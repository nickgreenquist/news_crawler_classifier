Roy Moore sexual assault allegations condemned by growing number of Republican lawmakers:::::National Republican leaders have pulled their support for Roy Moore, the Alabama GOP Senate candidate, in the wake of allegations claiming he had inappropriate sexual contact with teenage girls.The Washington Post reported last week that four women accused Moore of initiating sexual contact with them in the late 1970s and early 1980s, when he was an assistant district attorney in his early 30s.One of the women, Leigh Corfman, told the newspaper that Moore had sexual contact with her when she was just 14.The age of consent in Alabama is 16.On Monday, a fifth woman stepped forward: Beverly Young Nelson said Moore assaulted her in the late 1970s when she was a 16-year-old waitress.Moore has denied the allegations, saying in a statement obtained by Fox News on Friday that the article was "based on a lie supported by innuendo.""It seems that in the political arena, to say that something is not true is simply not good enough.So let me be clear.I have never provided alcohol to minors, and I have never engaged in sexual misconduct," he said.Still, multiple Republicans have called on Moore to step aside from the special election in December.And the National Republican Senatorial Committee reportedly severed its fundraising ties with Moore.The White House Speaking to reporters on Thursday, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said if the allegations are true, President Trump believes that "Moore will do the right thing and step aside."Like most Americans, the president believes we cannot allow a mere allegation, in this case one from many years ago, to destroy a persons life," Sanders said."However, the president also believes that if these allegations are true, Judge Moore will do the right thing and step aside."Trump deflected questions about the allegations when asked by reporters during his trip to Asia.Vice President Mike Pence found the allegations in the story disturbing and believes, if true, this would disqualify anyone from serving in office, his press secretary, Alyssa Farah, told reporters.Here's how other lawmakers have responded to the allegations.Sen. Mitch McConnell While speaking to reporters on Monday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said he believes the women quoted in the Washington Post's story.He urged Moore to step aside in light of the allegations.Previously, McConnell said Moore should step aside if "these allegations are true."Sen. Cory Gardner Cory Gardner, the National Republican Senatorial Committee chairman, said Monday that he believes the women who have alleged Moore's misconduct.In a statement, he encouraged the Senate to "vote to expel" Moore should he win the election next month."He does not meet the ethical and moral requirements of the United States Senate," Gardner, R-Colo., said.Sen. Mike Lee A former backer of Moore, Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, pulled his endorsement from Moore after the allegations came to light."Having read the detailed description of the incidents, as well as the response from Judge Moore and his campaign, I can no longer endorse his candidacy for the US Senate," Lee said in a tweet.He had also requested that Moore's campaign no longer use his image.Sen. Lisa Murkowski Im horrified and if its true, he should step down immediately, Murkowski told reporters.She reportedly also urged Sen. Luther Strange, who was appointed to fill Jeff Sessions seat when he was tapped to become attorney general, to launch a write-in campaign.The deadline to take Moore off the ballot has passed.Sen. Mike Rounds If they are true, then he should seriously think about stepping aside," Sen. Mike Rounds, R-S.D., said.Sen. John Cornyn I find it deeply distrusting and troubling.Its up to the governor and the folks of Alabama to make that decision as far as what the next steps are," Majority Whip John Cornyn, R-Texas, said.He later withdrew his endorsement of Moore.Sen. Tim Scott If theyre accurate, he absolutely should [step aside]," Tim Scott, of South Carolina, said.Sen. Susan Collins In a tweet on Monday, Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, called for Moore to "withdraw from the Senate race in Alabama."Collins wrote that she listened to Moore deny the allegations in a recent radio interview, but "did not find his denials to be convincing."Collins' most recent statement comes after she previously tweeted: "If there is any truth at all to these horrific allegations, Roy Moore should immediately step aside as Senate candidate."Sen. Steve Daines "These are very serious allegations and if true he should step down," said Sen. Steve Daines, R-Mont.Sen. John McCain "The allegations against Roy Moore are deeply disturbing and disqualifying.He should immediately step aside and allow the people of Alabama to elect a candidate they can be proud of," Arizona Sen. John McCain said.Sen. Richard Shelby Its a devastating nasty story, Alabama Sen. Richard Shelby told reporters.If its true, I dont believe thered be a place for him in the U.S. Senate.Sen. Jeff Flake Like other Republicans, Flake called on Moore to step aside from the election if the allegations are true.He has also tweeted his call for Moore to step aside immediately and lambasted local Alabama GOP officials who defended Moore.Sen. Luther Strange Alabama Sen. Luther Strange, who lost the special election primary to Roy Moore, called the allegations disturbing.He has not yet said if hell reenter the race, but told the Associated Press that he is doing research.It is too late to take Moore off the ballot, but Strange has been encouraged to launch a write-in campaign.Sen.Rob Portman I think if what we read is true, and people are on the record so I assume it is, then he should step aside, Ohio Sen.Rob Portman said.Sen. Ben Sasse Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., called the Washington Posts story "heartbreaking."The senator also agreed on Twitter with National Review editor Jonah Goldberg who said, As the father of a 14 year old girl, this Whats the big deal?crap enrages me.Sen. Ted Cruz "These are serious and troubling allegations," Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, who previously endorsed Moore, said in a statement."If they are true, Judge Moore should immediately withdraw.However, we need to know the truth, and Judge Moore has the right to respond to these accusations."Sen. Bill Cassidy Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., officially withdrew his support from the candidate on Saturday."Based on the allegations against Roy Moore, his reponse and what is known, I withdraw support," he said.Sen. Orrin Hatch "I stand with the Majority Leader on this.These are serious and disturbing accusations, and while the decision is now in the hands of the people of Alabama, I believe Luther Strange is an excellent alternative," Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, tweeted Monday.Sen. Pat Toomey We'll probably never know for sure exactly what happened," Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., said on NBC's "Meet the Press" Sunday."But I think the accusations have more credibility than the denial.I think it would be best if Roy would just step aside.Rep. Paul Ryan House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., said in a statement that if the allegations are true, they would disqualify Moore from the special election in December.These allegations are disqualifying if true.Anyone who would do this to a child has no place in public office, let alone the United States Senate, Ryan said in a statement.Rep. Peter King "I would say unless he can prove his innocence, the burden is now on him within the next day or so, I believe he has to step down.He owes it to himself, he owes it to the state and and he owes it to the U.S. Senate," New York Rep. Peter King said on MSNBC.Gov.John Kasich Ohio Gov.John Kasich said on Twitter that hes long opposed Moore and called on him to step aside from the race as well.Ive long opposed Roy Moore [and] his divisive viewpoints.The actions described make him unfit for office.The GOP must not support him.He should step aside, Kasich said.Former Gov.Mitt Romney Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee, slammed Moore on Twitter.Innocent until proven guilty is for criminal convictions, not elections.I believe Leigh Corfman, the former governor said.Her account is too serous to ignore.Moore is unfit for office and should step aside.Former Gov.Jeb Bush On Monday, former Republican presidential candidate and Florida Gov.Jeb Bush said Moore should step down in light of the allegations."This is not a question of innocence or guilt like in a criminal proceeding; this is a question of whats right and whats wrong.Acknowledging that youre dating teenagers when youre 32 years old as assistant state attorney is wrong.Its just plain wrong," he told CNBC, adding that he agreed with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who said earlier Monday that Moore should "step aside.""We need to stand for basic principles, and decency has to be one of those," Bush added."In the really poisonous political environment we have right now, one of the rules I think has to apply is that when you attack somebody on the other party, and the other team for doing something wrong, when it happens on your team, you have an obligation I think to speak out as well."Sen. Lindsey Graham The South Carolina senator took to Twitter Tuesday to say Moore should step aside in the Alabama Senate race."In light of the most recent allegations and the cumulative effect of others, I believe #RoyMoore would be doing himself, the state, the GOP, and the country a service by stepping aside," Graham tweeted."If he continues this will not end well for Mr.Moore."The Associated Press contributed to this report.
Roy Moore fights new sexual assault accusations as woman claims abuse at 16:::::Another woman in Alabama stepped forward Monday claiming that U.S. Senate candidate Roy Moore groped her and attempted to push her head toward his crotch when she was 16, delivering a statement to the media moments after the Republican called the accusations against him a witch hunt.Beverly Young Nelson spoke out Monday alongside attorney Gloria Allred, alleging that when she was working as a waitress in Alabama, Moore then the district attorney for Etowah County touched her in his car behind the restaurant where she worked.ROY MOORE BLASTS MCCONNELL, WAPO, AS CALLS TO LEAVE SENATE RACE GROW In a statement sent out ahead of Mondays news conference, Moores campaign stated that the allegations were part of a witch hunt against a man who has had an impeccable career for over 30 years and has always been known as a man of high character.The statement continued, Let it be understood: the truth will come forward, we will pursue all legal options against these false claims and Judge Moore will be vindicated.Less than an hour after Nelson spoke, the chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, Sen. Cory Gardner, said he believed those who have spoken out against Moore, proving he is unfit to serve in the United States Senate and he should not run for office.Gardner added that if Moore wins the election, the Senate should vote to expel him, because he does not meet the ethical and moral requirements of the United States Senate.ROY MOORE SEXUAL ASSAULT ALLEGATIONS CONDEMNED BY GROWING NUMBER OF REPUBLICAN LAWMAKERS Nelson alleged that Moore, under the premise of giving her a ride home from her shift at the Old Hickory House in Gadsden, parked his car behind the restaurant, and allegedly started to put his hands on my breasts when she was a teenager.Nelson said she tried to escape from Moores car, but he locked the doors and allegedly put his hands on her neck and tried to force her head on his crotch.Nelson said she tried to fight Moore off as he tried to remove her shirt.Becoming visibly emotional, Nelson said: I thought he was going to rape me.Nelson added that before she got out of the car, Moore gave up his sexual advances, and told her, Youre just a child.I am the district attorney of Etowah County, and if you tell anyone about this no one will ever believe you.She also said that Moore would frequent the restaurant and would twirl her waist-length hair when she walked past.Nelson is the fifth woman to accuse Moore of sexual misconduct.The Washington Post reported Thursday that he initiated sexual contact with a 14-year-old girl in 1979, which Moore said was completely false.Nelson told reporters both she and her husband are strong supporters of President Donald Trump, and that this has nothing to do with Democrats or Republicans, but rather her experiences with Moore from her teenage years.ALABAMA PASTOR DEFENDS EMBATTLED US SENATE CANDIDATE ROY MOORE To further prove her connection with Moore, Nelson displayed her high school yearbook signed by Moore: To a sweeter more beautiful girl I could not say Merry Christmas Christmas 1977 Love, Roy Moore D.A.12-22-77.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell earlier in the day called for Moore to step aside in the Senate race against Democrat Doug Jones, and acknowledged the possibility of a write-in candidate.Meanwhile, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who had previously tweeted that the candidate should immediately step aside, said that Moore shouldnt be allowed to sit in the Senate and that he should be expelled or not seated by any means possible.Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, rescinded his endorsement, and Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said that if you win, you lose, and tweeted that he also thinks Moore should step aside.He added: If he continues this will not end well for Mr. Moore.Republican Alabama Senator, Richard Shelby, said Monday that Moore should seriously consider removing himself from the race, and Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, withdrew his support of Moore, saying: "I can't urge the people of Alabama to support a campaign in the face of these charges" and called the allegations against Moore "criminal conduct."
Sessions directs prosecutors to 'evaluate certain issues' involving Uranium One and Clinton, leaves door open on special counsel:::::Attorney General Jeff Sessions directed senior federal prosecutors to evaluate certain issues requested by congressional Republicans, involving the sale of Uranium One and alleged unlawful dealings related to the Clinton Foundation, leaving the door open for an appointment of another special counsel.In a letter first obtained by Fox News, the Justice Department responded to July 27 and September 26 requests from House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., and other committee members, who called for the appointment of a special counsel to investigate the matters in question.The letter comes on the eve of Sessions testimony before the same committee, scheduled for Tuesday.The Attorney General has directed senior federal prosecutors to evaluate certain issues raised in your letters, Assistant Attorney General Stephen Boyd wrote.These senior prosecutors will report directly to the Attorney General and the Deputy Attorney General [Rod Rosenstein], as appropriate, and will make recommendations as to whether any matters not currently under investigation should be opened, whether any matters currently under investigation require further resources, or whether any matters merit the appointment of a Special Counsel, Boyd wrote.The Justice Department does not ordinarily confirm or deny investigations, and Boyd wrote that this letter should not be construed to do so.The Justice Departments letter specifically said that some of the topics requested by Goodlatte and other committee members were already being investigated by the departments Inspector Generals office.The letter specifically mentioned allegations related to the FBIs handling of the Clinton email probe, including allegations that DOJ and FBI policies or procedures were not followed in connection with, or in actions leading up to or related to then-FBI Director James Comeys public announcement to close the Clinton email matter on July 5, 2016, or the letter he sent lawmakers on October 28, 2016, about newly discovered Clinton emails, and that those investigative decisions were based on improper considerations.The Department has forwarded a copy of your letters to the IG so he can determine whether he should expand the scope of his investigation based on the information contained in those letters, Boyd wrote.Once the IGs review is complete, the Department will assess what, if any, additional steps are necessary to address any issues identified by that review.While the Justice Department did not confirm or deny an ongoing investigation into Clinton matters, administration officials pointed Fox News to the attorney generals testimony at his confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee in January, raising questions over whether he would recuse himself from this investigation.With regard to Secretary Clinton and some of the comments I made, I do believe that that could place my objectivity in question, Sessions said in response to committee Chairman Chuck Grassleys, R-Iowa, asking whether he could approach a Clinton investigation impartially.Sessions added at the time, I believe the proper thing for me to do would be to recuse myself from any questions involving those kind of investigations that involve Secretary Clinton and that were raised during the campaign or to be otherwise connected to it.Former FBI Director Robert Mueller was appointed in May as a special counsel to investigate accusations of collusion between Russia and officials close to President Trump.Fox News' Jake Gibson contributed to this report.
Donald Trump Jr. releases email communications with WikiLeaks from before election:::::President Trumps eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., corresponded with WikiLeaks before the 2016 presidential election, a dialogue of which the president's son confirmed Monday night on Twitter.In a series of tweets, Trump Jr. produced "the entire chain of messages with @wikileaks (with my whopping 3 responses) which one of the congressional committees has chosen to selectively leak.How ironic!"The Atlantic first reported on Monday that Trump Jr. received a private message from the WikiLeaks Twitter account on September 20, 2016 - a message shown in the tweets produced by the president's son."A PAC run anti-Trump site putintrump.org is about to launch," WikiLeaks wrote."The PAC is a recycled pro-Iraq war PAC.We have guessed the password.It is 'putintrump.'See 'About' for who is behind it.Any comments?"Trump Jr. replied, "Off the record I dont know who that is, but Ill ask around.Thanks."In a seperate October 2016 exchange, WikiLeaks urged Trump Jr. to "comment on/push this story" about then-Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton wanting to "just drone" Julian Assange, the Wikileaks founder."Already did that earlier today," Trump Jr. later replied."Its amazing what she can get away with."The messages obtained by The Atlantic were turned over to investigators by Trump Jr.s attorneys.The House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence had access to the documents, a source told Fox News."Over the last several months, we have worked cooperatively with each of the committees and have voluntarily turned over thousands of documents in response to their requests," Alan Futerfas, an attorney for Trump Jr., said in a statement."Putting aside the question as to why or by whom such documents, provided to Congress under promises of confidentiality, have been selectively leaked, we can say with confidence that we have no concerns about these documents and any questions raised about them have been easily answered in the appropriate forum."According to the report, the messages are part of a long correspondence between WikiLeaks and Trump Jr., though Trump Jr. seemed to ignore many of the messages, including some which urged him to release "one or more of your father's tax returns."President Trumps attorney Ty Cobb told Fox News on Monday that he was not aware that Donald Trump Jr.s attorneys provided these documents to congressional investigators, but said there is likely no legal issue, from what he knows of the documents.Wikileaks publisher Julian Assange tweeted about the report on Monday, saying that the organization couldn't "confirm" the messages with Trump Jr. Wikileaks "does not keep such records and the Atlantic's presentation is edited and clearly does not have the full context," Assange wrote."WikiLeaks loves its pending publications and ignores those who ask for details," Assange continued."Trump Jr. was rebuffed just like Cambridge Analytica.In both cases WikiLeaks had publicly teased the publications.Thousands of people asked about them.WikiLeaks can be very effective at convincing even high profile people that it is their interest to promote links to its publications."WikiLeaks has such chutzpah that it allegedly tried to convince Trump Jr to leak his father's tax returns & his own "Russian lawyer meeting" emails (he did)," Assange wrote."WikiLeaks appears to beguile some people into transparency by convincing them that it is in their interest."Assange also claimed that the "full text of alleged DMs with context provides a different reading, unsurprisingly."This is not the first time that Trump Jr. has been in the spotlight, and has had his actions brought into question amid the larger probe into Russian meddling and potential collusion with Trump campaign associates in the 2016 presidential election.In June 2016, Trump Jr. accepted a now-highly scrutinized meeting with Russian attorney Natalia Veselnitskaya, after he allegedly was promised dirt on Hillary Clinton.The meeting was brokered by music publicist Rob Goldstone who promised the campaign information.Jared Kushner and Paul Manafort, who was charged last month in Special Counsel Robert Muellers probe into Russian collusion, also attended the meeting.Fox News Matt Richardson and John Roberts contributed to this report.
Sen. Rand Paul returns to Capitol Hill after brutal attack:::::Sen. Rand Paul returned to Capitol Hill Monday for the first time after he was brutally attacked at his Kentucky home less than two weeks ago.Paul entered the Senate chamber to cast a vote.He spoke with other senators, including Democratic Sen. Brian Schatz of Hawaii.Paul was attacked while mowing his lawn on Nov. 3, according to authorities.The neighbor -- Rene Boucher -- attacked Paul from behind after he had gotten off of his lawn mower.Paul's friend, Robert Porter, said that Paul was wearing protection over his ears and didn't hear Boucher coming.An X-ray exam showed the Kentucky senator suffered six broken ribs and a build up of excess fluid in his lungs.Boucher's attorney insisted the attack had "nothing to do" with politics, but rather was due to a "landscaping dispute."A senior adviser to Paul disputed that claim.Boucher, 59, was charged with misdemeanor assault for the attack.He pleaded not guilty last week in Bowling Green.The Associated Press contributed to this report.
The Moore things change...:::::**Want FOX News Halftime Report in your inbox every day?Sign up here.** On the roster: The Moore things change - House, Senate get to nitty gritty on taxes - Menendez jury approaches deadlock on all counts - Trump Jr. tried to coordinate with WikiLeaks - That fine line between value hunting and vagrancy THE MOORE THINGS CHANGE Who knew that it would be more difficult to get elected to the United States Senate facing allegations of sexual misconduct with teenage girls?Try as we might to convince ourselves that all of the old rules of politics were voided by the outcome of the 2016 election, the world is not as much changed as we are tempted to believe.One of the laziest tropes in political journalism these days one to which this note has sometimes succumbed is that in 2017 were operating in a Beyond Thunderdome environment.#nothingmatters #yolo #dumpsterfire But what we have seen in the past week are some very normal manifestations of the political cycle.On Tuesday, the party that lost the White House had a jim-dandy Election Day, with surging voter intensity carrying its nominees to victory in Virginia, New Jersey and beyond.Thats pretty much what one would expect, especially considering that almost exactly the same thing happened eight years ago for the other side.Republicans want to believe that there is some sort of a new political coalition that will insulate them from the normal depredations of the political cycle.They have not.And they wont in 2018 either.It will be challenging for the GOP to keep the House and to take advantage of a favorable Senate map.Thats the way it always is, especially when a president of your own party is broadly unpopular.Conversely, Democrats want to believe that victories in Virginia and elsewhere are harbingers of a massive political backlash against Republicans that will cure what ails the Blue Team with key voter blocs with which its members have struggled.Thats just exactly what Republicans thought in 2009 and 2010 when it seemed like they couldnt lose.Imagine their surprise when Barack Obama waltzed into a second term.But if you really want to see a disconnection from political reality, look no farther than the discussion about the Senate candidacy of Roy Moore.It has been disheartening to hear the way commentators and analysts on both sides of Moores Senate bid have responded to the growing, worsening allegations against him for misconduct toward teenage girls, some as young as 14, when he was a prosecuting attorney in his 30s.Some of Moores supporters have argued somehow that it shouldnt matter to voters that Moore, an officer of the court who carried a badge, would be trolling for teenagers, let alone allegations that now include something closer to attempted sexual assault.But maybe even more disheartening were those who seemed to think it wouldnt matter to voters in Alabama.Many billions of pixels have been slaughtered in service of explaining how coastal elites have a sneering attitude towards the residents of the interior of the nation.But what could be more sneering than assuming that voters wouldnt care if their senator had been a creep?The trap of the Trump era is the ready assumption that because someone who almost everyone thought couldnt win won, that no rules apply anymore.Anyone who, from the time of the first allegations on Thursday, assumed that Alabamians are of such meager character that they would still rather have Moore than a Democrat not only underestimates Alabamians, but also the power of political norms.This is not complicated, people.If your nominee is credibly accused of serious improprieties, especially with children, your candidate probably loses.Republicans have been scrambling to come up with some alternative scenario.Moore, whose solemn vow is to torch the Republican leadership, has steadfastly refused to step aside for the good of the party.There has been talk of a write-in campaign, suggestions that somehow Moore wouldnt be seated in the Senate and even calls to move the election date.But the most likely scenario is quite simple.The Republicans chose a bad nominee in a difficult political climate and, accordingly, lose the seat.Thats made even more likely by the fact that Democrats have chosen a nominee well suited in temperament and biography to his perspective constituents.Thats the reason the major parties always try to make sure that they have somebody running in every Senate race.You never know when an opportunity will arise.While the charges against Moore are themselves shocking, the political outcome of Republicans losing such a safe seat would be no more shocking than, say, a little-known Republican state senator winning the race to replace Ted Kennedy in Massachusetts eight years ago.W flatter ourselves to think that our moment of history is utterly different than everything that came before, but if were honest with ourselves, we realize change is always incremental and that the old verities die hardest.Fifth accuser steps forward, says Moore tried to force her into sexual act - Fox News: Another woman in Alabama stepped forward Monday claiming that U.S. Senate candidate Roy Moore groped her and attempted to push her head toward his crotch when she was 16 [Beverly Young Nelson] alleged that Moore, under the premise of giving her a ride home from her shift at the Old Hickory House in Gadsden, parked his car behind the restaurant, and allegedly started to put his hands on my breasts when she was a teenager.Nelson said she tried to escape from Moores car, but he locked the doors and allegedly put his hands on her neck and tried to force her head on his crotch.Nelson added that before she got out of the car, Moore gave up his sexual advances, and told her, Youre just a child.I am the district attorney of Etowah County, and if you tell anyone about this no one will ever believe you.McConnell, Gardner want to expel Moore if elected - Politico: Senate Republicans escalated their calls for embattled Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore to leave the race with Majority Leader Mitch McConnell saying he believes the women who have accused Moore of sexual misconduct and the chair of the GOPs campaign arm endorsing an effort to expel Moore should he be elected next month.I believe the individuals speaking out against Roy Moore spoke with courage and truth, proving he is unfit to serve in the United States Senate and he should not run for office, said Sen. Cory Gardner of Colorado, the chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee.THE RULEBOOK: TOUR OF DUTY The continual necessity for their services enhances the importance of the soldier, and proportionably degrades the condition of the citizen.Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No.8 TIME OUT: REALISM Paris Review: Sixteen years ago, Marina Picasso, one of Pablo Picassos granddaughters, became the first family member to go public about how much her family had suffered under the artists narcissism.No one in my family ever managed to escape from the stranglehold of this genius, she wrote in her memoir, Picasso: My Grandfather.He needed blood to sign each of his paintings: my fathers blood, my brothers, my mothers, my grandmothers, and mine.He needed the blood of those who loved him.AfterJacqueline Roque, Picassos second wife, barred much of the family from the artists funeral, the family fell fully to pieces: Pablito, Picassos grandson, drank a bottle of bleach and died; Paulo, Picassos son, died of deadly alcoholism born of depression.Marie-Thrse Walter, Picassos young lover between his first wife, Olga Khokhlova, and his next mistress, Dora Maar, later hanged herself; even Roque eventually fatally shot herself.Marina saw her grandfathers treatment of women as an even darker phenomenon, a vital part of his creative process Flag on the play?- Email us at HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM with your tips, comments or questions.SCOREBOARD Trump net job-approval rating: -19.2 points Change from one week ago: unchanged [President Trumps score is determined by subtracting his average job disapproval rating in the five most recent, methodologically sound public polls from his average approval rating, calculated in the same fashion.]HOUSE, SENATE GET TO NITTY GRITTY ON TAXES Fox News: [The] Senate on Monday begins a critical step in the effort to pass its tax bill, the so-called mark-up session in the chambers Finance Committee -- where members will dissect the bill line by line to get a version that can pass by a simple, 51-vote majority.However, a few major differences have emerged -- particularly whether the Senate version will delay a corporate tax cut for one year.Otherwise, the chambers version will likely increase the federal deficit beyond 10 years, which would force Senate Republicans to get 60 votes for passage with just 52 members.The other major issue: The Senate bill appears to eliminate all state and local tax deductions.The House version keeps some of the deductions, essentially for voters in high-tax states like California, New Jersey and New York.All of the Congress members in those states face re-election next year.GOP donors turning up the heat on tax hike holdouts - Bloomberg: A nonprofit group that spent more than $18 million to defeat Hillary Clinton in 2016 is turning its sights to Republican House members in high-tax states, including New York and New Jersey, saying it will be counting on them to support GOP tax legislation.House leaders plan to hold a vote on their bill -- which includes new limits on tax breaks for people in such states -- as early as Thursday.Some members from New York, New Jersey and California have expressed concerns.The 45Committee, which has links to big Republican donors, is spending $2 million on its advertising effort, which will be aimed at 30 House members, according to Brian Baker, the groups president.The spend includes television, radio and digital ads.Hatch amendments target investments - Fox News: FOX Business has learned Senator Orrin Hatch, Chairman of the Senate Finance committee, will introduce amendments during the mark up of the Senates TAX reform bill that will propose changing 401(k) contributions, IRA classifications and allow businesses to deduct a portion of their dividend payments to shareholders.The amendments to the chairmans mark of the Senates Tax Cuts and Jobs Act bill include a provision that will allow publicly traded companies to deduct from their income up to 12.5% of the dividends they pay shareholders, thus lowering the companys tax bill.Hatch Amendment #25, as it is called, would allow the dividend deduction for five years.McConnell misspoke on reality of tax increases - NYT: Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, acknowledged on Friday that the Republican tax plan might result in a tax hike for some working Americans, saying he misspoke days earlier when he said that nobody in the middle class is going to get a tax increase under the Senate bill.I misspoke on that, Mr. McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, said in an interview on Friday with The New York Times.You cant guarantee that absolutely no one sees a tax increase, but what we are doing is targeting levels of income and looking at the average in those levels and the average will be tax relief for the average taxpayer in each of those segments.MENENDEZ JURY APPROACHES DEADLOCK ON ALL COUNTS Fox News: Jurors in Sen. Bob Menendezs corruption and bribery case told the judge Monday that they cant reach a unanimous verdict on any of the charges.The judge sent the jury home for the day and told them to return on Tuesday to continue deliberations.The decision came after the judge had to speak with individual jurors about comments a dismissed juror made to the media over the weekend.The New Jersey Democrat is accused of accepting a plethora of donations and gifts from a wealthy friend in exchange for political influence.Both Menendez and the doctor, Salomon Melgen, have maintained their innocence.Its the first time in nine years that a sitting U.S. senator is facing a federal bribery charge.If Menendez is convicted and goes to prison, Gov.Chris Christie, R-N.J., would pick a replacement.That prospect is troublesome for Democrats who fear that Christie would pick a Republican to fill the Senate seat giving the GOP an additional edge for legislative fights.TRUMP JR.TRIED TO COORDINATE WITH WIKILEAKS Atlantic: On October 3, 2016, WikiLeaks wrote again.Hiya, itd be great if you guys could comment on/push this story, WikiLeaks suggested, attaching a quote from then-Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton about wanting to just drone WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange.Already did that earlier today, [Donald Trump Jr.] responded an hour-and-a-half later.Its amazing what she can get away with.Two minutes later, Trump Jr. wrote again, asking, Whats behind this Wednesday leak I keep reading about?The day before, Roger Stone, an informal advisor to Donald Trump, had tweeted, Wednesday @HillaryClinton is done.#WikiLeaks.Sen.

[Ed.note: Its an interesting thought, Mr. Gilbert, but not a practical one.While you rightly pointed in your note to the relevant passage of the Constitution, courts have consistently held that what the Senate and House can decide is whether a duly elected member meets the constitutional criteria for service, they cannot add new requirements.Whoever the secretary of state of Alabama declares the winner of the contest on December 12 only needs to be 30 years of age, a resident of Alabama and a U.S. citizen for at least nine years.And its probably a good thing that our legislative houses cant refuse to seat members other than those.Talk about the tyranny of the majority!If you can get 51 members of the Senate to agree to not seat members of a certain political party or certain political views, things could get crazy quickly.Now, the Constitution is equally clear that you can expel a member for basically any cause with 67 votes.But, as for keeping him out in the first place, that just wont fly.]Wow Chris.Wow.Way to join the Distrusted Media Club with a flair.Someone of your political acumen should have the ability to see and expose an obvious hit job.The Moore accusations come out 32 years later, a month before the election and too late to change the ballot and you suck in the lure like a true blue mainstream media marlin.Throw in a little Christian blackening and your Trump filleting is complete.Since you work for FOX maybe someone will pay somebody to make an unprovable charge of sexual impropriety against you.Maybe then your seat on the media bullying bandwagon wont be quite as comfortable.Expected better of you but I guess the siren call of the journalistic in-crowd is just too hard to resist.Fair and balanced?I think not.Bob Hoerr, East Peoria, Ill.

Sessions has 'no interest' in returning to Senate, source says:::::Not interested.Thats how U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions feels about talk of him heading back to the Senate to replace embattled Alabama GOP candidate Roy Moore, a source told Fox News.According to The New York Times, two White House officials floated the idea of replacing Moore with Sessions.Republican Alabama Gov.Kay Ivey would appoint Sessions to the vacant seat.Mr.Sessions remains highly popular among Alabama Republicans, but his relationship with President Trump has waned since he recused himself from the investigation of the role that Russia played in last years campaign, according to The Times.But a source close to Sessions told Fox News, The Attorney General has informed people in Alabama that he has no interest in returning to his old Senate seat.Senior Republicans on Capitol Hill have called on Moore to drop out of the race and have gone so far as to threaten to kick him out of the Senate if he wins.A fifth woman accused Moore, a former Alabama Supreme Court justice, on Monday of making unwanted sexual advances towards her when she was a teenager.Moore, who has maintained his innocence, says he isnt dropping out.Fox News' Jake Gibson contributed to this report.
Roy Moore's sexual assault allegations cloud Alabama special Senate election:::::Before Roy Moores sexual assault allegations came to light, the Republican senate candidate was already a polarizing figure.Hes argued that Muslims shouldnt be able to serve in Congress; he promoted the conspiracy theory that former President Barack Obama wasnt born in the U.S.; he said in a 2005 interview that homosexual conduct should be illegal.But even still, Steven Taylor, the political science chair at Alabamas Troy University, thought voters in the deep red state of Alabama could look the other way.In some ways, that Roy Moore has a very strong religious element to his politics is not substantially out of the mainstream for the state, Taylor told Fox News.Then, slightly a month before the special election, the Washington Post released a bombshell report of allegations that Moore had inappropriate sexual conduct with teenage girls while he was in his 30s.One woman alleged that Moore had her touch him in private areas when she was just 14.Moore has staunchly denied the accusations of sexual misconduct, but even still, many leading Republicans have called on him to step aside from the campaign.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Monday that he believed Moores accusers in asking him to step aside from the race.Whether Moore heeds the calls or faces further fallout from those in his party has yet to be seen.Read on for a look at the special Senate election to replace Jeff Sessions.Roy Moore, Republican Called the Ayatollah of Alabama by critics who believe he too closely marries his political and judicial responsibilities with religion, Judge Roy Moore emerged as the leader of the Republicans vying for the Senate seat.In a special primary election last month, Moore defeated incumbent Sen. Luther Strange who was tapped to fill the position when then-Sen. Jeff Sessions became the U.S. attorney general.In the primary, Moore, 70, garnered the support of conservative darlings, such as former Alaska Gov.Sarah Palin and Duck Dynasty star Phil Robertson.President Donald Trump backed Strange, but his former advisor, Steve Bannon, campaigned for Moore.Moores political past is mired in controversy, which he used to his advantage during the primary election.He was twice removed from Alabamas Supreme Court.The first time, he was removed when he refused to move a boulder-sized Ten Commandments monument from the statehouse; he was permanently suspended in 2016 after he instructed probate judges to deny marriage licenses to gay couples.The Supreme Court debacles worked in his favor given that Alabamians are generally very conservative and religious, Taylor said.And his refusal to bend to the federal government is in line with a tradition set in the state by the former longtime pro-segregationist Gov.George Wallace, he said.Hes very outspoken in a variety of ways, Taylor said of Moore.Hes a little more reflective of those more populistic candidates weve seen of late, including the president.After Moores primary victory, Trump tweeted that he spoke to Moore for the first time, calling him a really great guy who ran a fantastic race.Many Trump supporters turned out to campaign for Moore during the primary, despite the presidents backing of a different candidate.ALABAMA PASTOR DEFENDS EMBATTLED ROY MOORE Moores past took a backseat, however, when the Washington Post reported that four women accused Moore of engaging in inappropriate sexual behavior with them while they were teenagers and he was in his 30s.Leigh Corfman, now 58, alleged that Moore first approached her in a courtroom in 1979 when she was 14 years old.Eventually, Moore took her to his house, took off her shirt and pants, touched her private parts and guided her hand to his underwear, she said.The two did not have sexual intercourse, and he took her home when she asked, Corfman said.Moore has vehemently denied the accusations, calling them baseless and the very definition of fake news.It seems that in the political arena, to say that something is not true is simply not good enough.So let me be clear.I have never provided alcohol to minors, and I have never engaged in sexual misconduct, Moore said in a statement provided to Fox News.He also told Fox News Sean Hannity that he generally didnt date women who were teenagers when he was in his 30s and would not date someone without their mothers permission.And Moore admitted its possible that he did go on dates with one of the accusers in the Washington Post report who said she was 17 when Moore kissed her."He's very outspoken in a variety of ways."That line of defense is not as strident or strong as one might expect, Taylor said.The question becomes: Does Mr. Moore come up with a more effective defense?Does he come up with a more coherent message to explain this story other than fake news, although that does appeal to certain voters?Some polls immediately after the Washington Posts report show an uptake in support for Moores Democratic counterpart, Doug Jones.But with Thanksgiving and big Alabama football games coming up, that could distract voters from the fallout of the allegations, Taylor said.Doug Jones, Democrat A former U.S. attorney during the Clinton administration, Jones beat out seven other Democrats to secure the partys nomination.Jones, 63, is perhaps best known for successfully prosecuting two members of the Ku Klux Klan accused of bombing a Birmingham church in 1963 that killed four young girls.I may have the honor of serving Alabama as your senator, but the most important thing I have done is prosecuting those klansmen who killed 4 little girls at 16th St Baptist Church, Jones said in a tweet earlier this month.Because of his resume, Taylor said he is considered to be a quality candidate in the political science world.He is someone who is credible and therefore competitive, Taylor said.ROY MOORE SLAMS MCCONNELL, WASHINGTON POST AS CALLS TO LEAVE SENATE GROWS Weve not seen a lot of quality Democratic candidates for Senate because Sen. [Richard] Shelby and Sen.Sessions, they were so strongly ensconced in their positions that the Democratic nominee was most often a more fringe candidate and not taken very seriously, Taylor said.Jones doesnt fall in that category he has a background as a prosecutor, he has linkage to Civil Rights prosecution for the bombers in Birmingham.This makes him a more serious and significant candidate.Openly critical of Trump, Jones has promised to fight for pro-abortion policies, tackling student loan debt and raising the minimum wage.Even prior to the allegations of Moore groping a teenage girl, Democrats reportedly felt optimistic about Jones chances of winning in a historically red state.And after the allegations, some polls such as the one produced by JMC Analytics have Jones in the lead.Jones has been endorsed by prominent Democrats, including former Vice President Joe Biden and Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga. His Twitter feed is riddled with photos of his campaign from meeting with college students to discuss student loan debt to events with community leaders but it doesnt mention the allegations against Moore.Alabama House Minority Leader Anthony Daniels, D, encouraged Jones to stay the course and not get bogged down with the allegations against Moore.Getting involved in the allegations, that doesnt bring jobs to Alabama.That doesnt bring opportunity or economic prosperity to our state.That doesnt help education or health care.It doesnt help our infrastructure, Daniels told Fox News.Why would he focus on that?Daniels also praised Jones for being a fighter for his entire career.He said Jones would bring unity and civility to the Senate and would work with lawmakers across the aisle to better Alabama.The Associated Press contributed to this report.
Menendez corruption and bribery trial: What to know:::::Jurors in Sen. Bob Menendez's corruption and bribery case told the judge Monday that they "can't reach a unanimous verdict on any of the charges."The judge sent the jury home for the day and told them to return on Tuesday to continue deliberations.The decision came after the judge had to speak with individual jurors about comments a dismissed juror made to the media over the weekend.The New Jersey Democrat is accused of accepting a plethora of donations and gifts from a wealthy friend in exchange for political influence.Both Menendez and the doctor, Salomon Melgen, have maintained their innocence.Its the first time in nine years that a sitting U.S. senator is facing a federal bribery charge.What is Menendez accused of?Menendez, 63, accepted an abundance of campaign donations, gifts and vacations from Salomon Melgen, a Florida ophthalmologist.In return, Menendez used his position to lobby on behalf of Melgens business interests, according to prosecutors.Melgen allegedly directed more than $750,000 in campaign contributions to entities that supported Menendez, according to the indictment, which prosecutors said were inducements to get Menendez to use his influence on Melgen's behalf.Prosecutors have also accused Menendez of trying to hide the gifts.Melgen paid for Menendez and his girlfriend to stay for three nights at a Parisian hotel where rooms typically cost about $1,500 per night and allowed the senator the use of his private jet, according to prosecutors.NBC NEWS CALLS MENENDEZ A REPUBLICAN IN CORRUPTION CASE REPORT Federal prosecutors said that Menendez sold his office for a lifestyle that he couldnt afford.The indictment also alleged that Menendez pressured State Department officials to give visas to three young women described as Melgen's girlfriends.What is the senators defense?Both Menendez and Melgen have pleaded not guilty and Menendez has vehemently denied the accusations against him.Throughout the trial, defense attorneys sought to prove that Menendez and Melgen have been friends since before the former became a senator, and the trips were nothing more than friends traveling together.At times emotional, Menendez has maintained his innocence throughout the trial.What has happened in the trial so far?Defense attorney Raymond Brown got into a spat with U.S. District Court Judge William H. Walls at the start of the trial.Brown accused Walls of being extremely prejudicial to the defense.Walls had denied Menendezs request that the trial be recessed during critical Senate votes, stating that his job should not be treated differently from that of a construction worker or cab driver.MENENDEZ CASE MAY IMPACT VOTES The trial has also focused on a meeting former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., set up with Menendez and former Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius to discuss a nearly $9 million Medicaid billing dispute.Sebelius testified in court that the incident was the first time in her role in government that she was asked by a senator to take a meeting with another senator.She said that Melgen wasnt specifically mentioned in the meeting but that she assumed his case was the topic.Prosecutors didnt call Reid to testify before it rested its case on Oct. 11.Walls declined to throw the case out despite the defenses objections that the accusations against Menendez didnt fit the narrow definition of bribery that was a result of a 2016 Supreme Court decision.Menendez also had a little help from his friends.Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., arrived at the Newark courthouse to testify as a character witness for the Democratic senator, Grahams office confirmed.He testified about his experiences with Menendez in the Senate, unrelated to the underlying charges, his office said."In very difficult circumstances he always keeps his word," Graham, said during his testimony."A handshake is all you need from Bob.He's a very honest, hardworking senator."Sen. Corey Booker, D-N.J., has also appeared in support of Menendez.Menendez was also emotional when he was asked by reporters about his colleagues support.Is there anything else to know about Salomon Melgen?Melgen, 63, was convicted of 67 counts of health care fraud in April in what the Palm Beach Post called one of the biggest Medicare fraud cases in the U.S. During that case, prosecutors argued that Melgen, who was born in the Dominican Republic, robbed Medicare of as much as $105 million, according to the newspaper.His sentencing has been delayed until after this trial.WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT THE NEW JERSEY GUBERNATORIAL RACE Aside from Menendez, Melgen has given significant amounts of money to a variety of Democratic lawmakers, according to public records.What happens if Menendez is convicted?If Menendez is convicted and goes to prison, Gov.Chris Christie, R-N.J., would pick a replacement.That prospect is troublesome for Democrats who fear that Christie would pick a Republican to fill the Senate seat giving the GOP an additional edge for legislative fights.Vice President Mike Pence has said that it would be "altogether inappropriate and wrong" for a convicted felon to remain in the Senate.However, he said it would be a decision left up to the Senate if Menendez didn't resign.Menendez is up for reelection next year.He was selected to replace former Gov.Jon Corzine, D-N.J., in the Senate in 2005.The most serious charges against the two men carry a maximum 20-year prison sentence.Fox News Tara Prindiville and The Associated Press contributed to this report.
Menendez trial jurors say they're deadlocked; judge orders them to continue deliberations:::::Jurors in Sen. Bob Menendezs corruption case were ordered to continue deliberations despite telling the judge Monday they were deadlocked in the trial of the Democratic senator accused of taking bribes for political favors.In a note to U.S .District Judge William Walls, jurors wrote they cant reach a unanimous verdict.Walls sent the 12-person panel home for the day but instructed deliberations to continue on Tuesday.The case against Menendez has taken several frustrating turns.Jurors have been told repeatedly not to read reports about the case.Four jurors and three alternates told Walls they had heard or read something about the trial over the weekend.He questioned them individually in his chambers.Last week, Walls dismissed juror Evelyn Arroyo-Maultsby so she could go on vacation with her family.That prompted the judge to tell the new jury made up of seven women and five men to begin fresh deliberations.Panelists also asked Walls for the definition of a senator.The federal judge refused to answer.He also declined a jurors request last Monday for a transcript of the closing argument by Abbe Lowell, Menendezs attorney.Walls told jurors they would need to rely on their memories.The case marks the first time in almost a decade that a sitting U.S. senator faced a federal bribery charge.According to the criminal complaint, the New Jersey Democrat greased the wheels for Salomon Melgen, a Florida ophthalmologist.Among other things, Menendez was accused of helping obtain visas for several of Melgens girlfriends as well as lobby the State Department on his behalf regarding a $500 million port security contract in the Dominican Republic.Melgen, in turn, paid for private jets, hotel rooms and forked over nearly $75,000 in campaign contributions to Menendez.Even though a bribery conviction doesnt mean Menendez would be forced to resign, the 63-year-old lawmaker likely would face intense pressure to step down.A recent Fox News poll found that a majority of voters think Menendez should resign immediately if he is convicted.Vice President Mike Pence has said that it would be altogether inappropriate and wrong for a convicted felon to remain in the Senate.However, he said it would be a decision left up to the Senate if Menendez didnt resign.Menendez, who is up for reelection next year, was selected to replace former Democratic Gov.Jon Corzine in 2005.If Menendez steps down from the Senate before Jan. 16, outgoing and widely unpopular Republican Gov.Chris Christie would get to appoint a successor.If Menendez steps down or is forced out after that date, the decision would go to newly elected Democratic Gov.Phil Murphy.Carl Mayer, author of Shakedown: The Fleecing of the Garden State, has called for Menendez to resign.Menendez and Christie are opposite sides of the same coin: They both have excelled in the dark darts of New Jersey politics, but they are both, now, at the end of their political careers because voters are tired of the swamp, he said.Meanwhile Melgen, 63, was convicted of 67 counts of health care fraud in April, in what The Palm Beach Post called one of the biggest Medicare fraud cases in the U.S.The Associated Press contributed to this report.
Trump has shown some 'flexibility' on North Korea, says former UN secretary-general:::::During a speech delivered in South Korea last week, Trump called North Korean leader Kim Jong Un a "tyrant."Kim's government responded by calling Trump an "old lunatic."Ban believes the only way to deal with North Korea is through diplomatic means."There is no military solution," he said."Military means sometimes may be effective for a time being but it's not sustainable.You have seen such cases in Iraq and Afghanistan and in Syria."He is also optimistic that the sanctions against North Korea are working.Chinese President Xi Jinping "has made it clear that they will faithfully implement the Security Council resolution, and it seems that they are now doing it.That's why North Korea recently has been criticizing China by calling them names," he said."That means the sanctions seem to be working."The Associated Press contributed to this report.
GOP Senate campaign chair calls on senators to expel Moore if he wins special election:::::The chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, Sen. Cory Gardner, R-Colo., on Monday called on his fellow senators to expel Alabama Republican Roy Moore, if Moore wins a special election next month."I believe the individuals speaking out against Roy Moore spoke with courage and truth, proving he is unfit to serve in the United States Senate and he should not run for office," Gardner said in a statement."If he refuses to withdraw and wins, the Senate should vote to expel him, because he does not meet the ethical and moral requirements of the United States Senate."Gardner's statement was issued moments after a woman alleged Monday that Moore tried to rape her when she was 16 and he was in his 30s.Beverly Young Nelson said Moore groped her and tried to force her to perform oral sex on him, after offering her a ride home from the restaurant where she worked.Nelson's allegations followed accounts in The Washington Post last week by four other women who told the Post that Moore pursued sexual relationships with them when they were teenagers.The youngest of the four women, Leigh Corfman, said Moore molested her when she was only 14.Moore has denied all the allegations and accused the women of being part of a political smear campaign.Since the first allegations were published Thursday by the Post, a growing list of Republican senators have called on Moore to step aside, culminating Monday with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who said, "I think he should step aside," in response to a question about Moore's next steps.McConnell was also asked whether he believed the allegations against Moore."I believe the women, yes," he said.Alabama will hold a special election Dec. 12 to fill the Senate seat vacated by Attorney General Jeff Sessions.In September, Moore defeated Luther Strange, the Republican senator who had been appointed to fill Sessions' seat, in a Republican primary.Moore will face Democrat Doug Jones in the general election.The first wave of polls released Monday in the wake of the allegations showed Moore and Jones locked in a tight race.
Jeb Bush says passing temporary tax cuts would be 'stupid':::::Former Florida Gov.Jeb Bush on Monday said it would be "stupid" for Republicans to pass only temporary tax cuts.Lower tax rates, part of the GOP push to overhaul the American tax system this year, may have to last only for a few years to comply with Senate rules."That is really stupid because it creates uncertainty," Bush, a 2016 presidential candidate, told CNBC's "Power Lunch" in Florida."The Byrd Rule should be modified.If you want to create long-term economic growth, you've got to think beyond 10 years in my mind.So maybe I mean, the rule's not going to change.But it does create a real problem."Under Senate rules Republicans aim to use to approve a tax-reform plan, a bill cannot increase budget deficits after 10 years.The current congressional GOP proposals to chop corporate and household taxes are projected to significantly expand deficits.To stay within the rules, Republicans may have to consider changes, like adding more provisions to raise revenue or making tax cuts expire within the decade.Bush on Monday said a lack of consistent policy could discourage business actions that would boost job opportunities and wages."We're very short-term oriented in how we go about business these days and the net effect is we're not training people and we're not creating higher wage jobs.And income has really lagged behind," he added.House Republicans aim to pass their tax plan this week.The Senate starts marking up, or debating and amending, a slightly different tax proposal on Monday afternoon.If the chambers approve separate bills, they will have to reconcile the plans before passing unified legislation.The Congressional Budget Office projected that an earlier version of the House plan would add $1.7 trillion to budget deficits over 10 years.The plans would get rid of some deductions and other measures to offset the tax cuts.But the plans are not expected to fully cancel out the lost revenue with other money-raising measures.Many Republicans argue that economic growth sparked by the tax changes will either largely or fully make up for the cuts.
Senate tax tweak would curb pretax 401(k) catch-up contributions:::::Workers over age 50 would no longer be able to make catch-up contributions on a pretax basis to their retirement plans under a new amendment to the GOP's Senate version of the tax bill.Orrin G. Hatch, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, filed the amendment to the bill on Monday.The full text of the bill is here, and amendments are here.This amendment would permit workers over age 50 to contribute up to an additional $9,000 each year to their retirement plans, but it would require that these contributions be made to Roth accounts.Those are accounts where taxes are paid upfront.Currently, employees over age 50 can contribute up to $6,000 in additional savings each year to their 401(k) plan and do so on a pretax basis.That's on top of the current annual $18,000 limit.
College Republican group ACC aims to persuade GOP to embrace environment:::::To be sure, the group has its work cut out for it in trying to sway opinions in a major party that is often viewed as skeptical about if not outwardly hostile toward environmental issues.In June, a Gallup poll showed only 18 percent support among Republicans for addressing climate change."Compared to how the Republican Party has been diminishing the issue for the last few years, we are encouraging them to make it a priority," Benjamin Backer, the ACC's 19-year-old president, told CNBC in an interview."Clean energy is an issue that brings both sides together and creates a lot of jobs if it's done the right way," said Backer, who is a sophomore at the University of Washington."We need the national movement to make it a priority."The effort comes at an auspicious time, with the United States remaining the lone holdout among countries that have signed on to the Paris climate accord.Earlier this year, President Donald Trump announced the U.S. would cease participation in the agreement and has vowed to renegotiate its terms.According to the ACC's Backer, the Paris agreement has "a lot of flaws and America can meet pro-environmental goals without being a part of it.The problem, however, is that America should be involved in the discussions and decision-making" in order to improve on its goals, he told CNBC.The divergence of environmental views between millennial Republicans and their elders mirrors a dynamic reflected in a 2016 Pew Research opinion survey.The study bemoaned the "polarized views" that characterize the debate over the environment, noting that the climate skepticism demonstrated by Trump runs deep among the GOP rank and file.With the ACC's efforts, college Republicans intend to serve notice on the GOP's senior leadership, Backer insisted."The Republican Party really values their young activists and this will send a really strong message that things need to change," he told CNBC."We also want to send a really strong message to the RNC [Republican National Committee].We want to say, 'Hey, guys, we really need this to be a message for 2020," Backer said.As polls show that millennials are widely disillusioned with both Democrats and the GOP, "Republicans will continue to lose the youth vote if they don't embrace the environment in a massive way," he added.
Trump calls for major last-minute changes to GOP tax plans:::::Scrapping Obamacare's individual mandate would save the government $338 billion over 10 years, the Congressional Budget Office estimated this month, giving the GOP more room to chop rates.However, any proposal to do so will prove politically contentious, partly because the CBO projects 13 million more Americans would be uninsured by 2027.Average health insurance premiums are also expected to rise without the individual mandate.The House Ways and Means Committee already decided not to put the individual mandate repeal into its tax plan.The panel approved a tax bill last week, and House Republicans want the full chamber to pass it this week.House Republicans already face a challenge in holding on to blue-state GOP votes due to its proposed plan to end state and local tax deductions.The Senate has proposed its own bill that it will mark up, or debate and amend, starting Monday.Trump's proposed top rate of 35 percent is lower than those in the House and Senate plans.The House would keep the highest income-tax bracket at 39.6 percent.The Senate bill would cut it slightly to 38.5 percent.The president's call for an even lower rate on high-income Americans sparked more criticism from Democrats who say the GOP plan goes much further to help wealthy Americans than middle-income workers.In a statement, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Trump's proposal "would send premiums for millions of Americans skyrocketing, all so that the wealthy can get an even bigger tax giveaway than they'd get under the original Republican plan."Said Schumer: "The President's awful idea would take a plan that's already heavily tilted towards the wealthy and make it even worse."
Joe Biden: I 'honest to God' don't know if I'll run for president in 2020:::::Joe Biden will not tip his hand on 2020.On Monday, the former vice president told NBC's "Today" show that he is "not closing the door" on running for the Democratic nomination for president.Biden, who decided not to run in 2016 following the death of his son Beau, said he "honest to God" does not know if he will seek the White House.Biden, 74, cast some doubts on the prospect in a separate interview with Snapchat's "Good Luck America," which is not yet released but was seen by The Associated Press."I've done it a long time," the former senator from Delaware said, "and I'm just not sure it's the appropriate thing for me to do."Biden made the comments while promoting a new book, "Promise Me, Dad: A Year of Hope, Hardship and Purpose."It chronicles Biden's life around the time of his son's death.Biden has said he could have beaten President Donald Trump in last year's election.The former vice president is a popular Democratic politician who may appeal to the working class voters in traditionally blue states that helped to elect Trump.However, many in the party will likely seek a younger candidate who is not seen as a so-called establishment Democrat.Disclosure: NBC and CNBC are owned by NBCUniversal, a division of Comcast.
Moore threatens lawsuit over story that threatens campaign:::::Alabama Republican Roy Moore says a lawsuit will be filed over the newspaper report carrying allegations that he had sexual contact with a 14-year-old girl four decades ago and that neither Democrats nor Republicans want to see him win a special Senate election.While pressure to quit the race four weeks before Election Day intensified from within the Republican Party, Moore assured supporters Sunday night at a Huntsville, Alabama, gym that the Washington Post story was "fake news" and "a desperate attempt to stop my political campaign."Moore said allegations that he was "involved with a minor child are completely false and untrue and for which they will be sued," drawing a round of applause.The former judge also questioned why such allegations would be leveled for the first time so close to the special election in spite of his decades in public life."Why would they come now?Because there are groups that don't want me in the United States Senate," he said, naming the Democratic Party and the Republican establishment and accusing them of working together.He added, "We do not plan to let anybody deter us from this race."The Post story quoted four women by name, including the woman who alleged the sexual contact at 14 and had two dozen other sources.Moore also tried to raise money from the controversy, writing in a fundraising pitch sent about midafternoon that the "vicious and sleazy attacks against me are growing more vicious by the minute."He told supporters, "I'm counting on you to stand with me at this critical moment by chipping in a donation to help me bust through the vicious lies and attacks and get the truth out to as many voters as possible before December 12."Another fellow Republican, Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, urged Moore to drop out of the race.He said Moore's explanations had been inadequate and that Republicans should consider Sen. Luther Strange as a write-in candidate to run against Moore.Strange lost the Republican primary to Moore in September.Even if Moore were to step aside, his name would likely remain on the ballot.And any effort to add Strange as a write-in candidate would threaten to divide the GOP vote in a way that would give the Democratic candidate a greater chance of winning.Toomey did not rule out the possibility that Senate Republicans might work to unseat Moore if he wins the special election against Democrat Doug Jones."You know, this is a terrible situation, nearly 40-year-old allegation, we'll probably never know for sure exactly what happened," Toomey said on "Meet the Press" on NBC."But from my point of view, I think the accusations have more credibility than the denial.I think it would be best if Roy would just step aside."The White House, pointedly noting that President Donald Trump did not back Moore during the primary, said Trump will likely weigh in on the Senate race when he returns from Asia later this week.The White House has already made clear that Moore should step aside if the allegations are proven to be true."I think there's a special place in hell for those who actually perpetrate these crimes," White House legislative aide Marc Short said Sunday."But, having said that, he hasn't been proved guilty," Short added."We have to afford him the chance to defend himself."Moore is an outspoken Christian conservative and former state Supreme Court judge.The Post reported last Thursday that he had sexual contact with a 14-year-old girl and pursued three other teenagers decades earlier.While he called the allegations "completely false and misleading," in an interview with conservative radio host Sean Hannity he did not wholly rule out dating teenage girls when he was in his early 30s.Asked if that would have been usual for him, Moore said, "Not generally, no."The story stirred concern among anxious GOP officials in Washington in a key race to fill the Senate seat once held by Jeff Sessions, now the U.S. attorney general.Losing the special election to a Democrat would imperil Republicans' already slim 52-48 majority in the Senate, which is hoping to pass a tax overhaul later this year.But a Moore victory also would pose risks if he were to join the Senate GOP with a cloud of sexual misconduct allegations.In the immediate aftermath of the Post report, a wave of national Republican leaders called for Moore to drop out of the race if the allegations are true.They included the head of the House Freedom Caucus, Rep. Mark Meadows of North Carolina, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz.Over the weekend, more Republicans distanced themselves from Moore, including Sens.Bob Corker of Tennessee and Tim Scott of South Carolina.Toomey and Short appeared on NBC's "Meet the Press," Scott spoke on CBS' "Face the Nation."
US House will reject total elimination of state and local tax deductions: Brady:::::The head of the House of Representatives' tax-writing committee said on Sunday he would not accept elimination of a federal deduction for state and local taxes, opposing a proposal from Senate Republicans that would hike taxes for some middle-class Americans.House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady said he guaranteed the deduction would not be entirely scrapped in a final tax bill that emerges from dueling plans already unveiled by Republicans in the House and the Senate.Asked on "Fox News Sunday" if House Republicans would reject a bid by Senate Republicans to do away with the deduction entirely, Brady said: "That's what I'm saying."The deduction for state and local taxes, known as SALT, has been one of the most hotly contested issues as Republicans seek to achieve a significant overhaul of the U.S. tax code and hand President Donald Trump his first major legislative victory.It is a chief concern for a group of House Republicans who face re-election battles next year in high-tax, typically Democratic-leaning states such as California, New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, and Massachusetts.Other sticking points include a proposal by the Senate to delay implementation of a cut in the corporate tax rate and a House plan to eliminate the estate tax on inheritances.Republicans control both the House and the Senate.Lawmakers will debate their respective plans this week before heading home for the Thanksgiving Day holiday.Republicans hope to resolve their differences in time to reach their goal of enacting the legislation by the end of the year.The Senate tax blueprint introduced on Thursday would repeal the SALT deduction entirely.The House bill would repeal it only for state and local income and sales taxes, but preserve it for property tax up to $10,000 a year.Brady said there were many similarities in the rival tax proposals."I know that everyone's stressing the differences there are some but there's far more common ground," he said.Both the House and Senate plans would add $1.5 trillion over 10 years to the budget deficit and national debt, an increase that has worried some fiscally conservative Republicans.Both plans also call for deep tax cuts for high-earners and businesses and would reshape how the United States taxes multinational corporations.They are both widely seen as a boon for business.
Trump does not publicly rebuke Duterte for drug war killings:::::Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has sanctioned a bloody drug war that features extrajudicial killing.He called Barack Obama a "son of a whore."This week, he boasted that he murdered a man with his own hands.All that went unmentioned in public by President Donald Trump when the leaders held talks Monday in the Philippines.Reporters saw the beginning of the leaders' bilateral meeting in during which Trump praised Duterte's hospitality, the organization of the summit he was hosting and even Manila's weather.Trump said nothing about human rights and both leaders ignored shouted questions about the violent drug crackdown.The two men also shared a laugh in the meeting when Duterte called reporters "spies."Later, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said that the 40-minute meeting focused on ISIS, illegal drugs, and trade.Human rights, she added, briefly came up in the context of the Philippines' fight against illegal drugs.She did not say if Trump was critical of the violence.That appeared to conflict with the Philippines' version of the meeting.Harry Roque, a spokesman for Duterte, said "there was no mention of human rights.There was no mention of extralegal killings.There was only a rather lengthy discussion of the Philippine war on drugs with President Duterte doing most of the explaining."Breaking with his presidential predecessors, Trump has largely abandoned publicly pressing foreign leaders on human rights, instead showing a willingness to embrace international strongmen for strategic gain.He has cozied up to autocrats such as Saudi Arabia's King Salman, Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi and Russian President Vladimir Putin.And earlier in this trip to Asia he made no mention of human rights during multiple appearances in Beijing with Chinese President Xi Jinping."Trump seems very comfortable with strongmen.It's not just that he won't criticize Duterte.I wouldn't be surprised if he patted him on the back," said Mike Chinoy, senior fellow at U.S.-China Institute at the University of Southern California, before the meeting.Duterte's war on drugs has alarmed human rights advocates around the world who say it has allowed police officers and vigilantes to ignore due process and to take justice into their own hands.Government officials estimate that well over 3,000 people, mostly drug users and dealers, have died in the ongoing crackdown.Human rights groups believe the victim total is far higher, perhaps closer to 9,000."Human rights groups, I think, will be quite disappointed by the visit," said Amy Searight, director of the Southeast Asia Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies."It's unlikely that human rights or rule of law or due process are going to be topics that President Trump will raise."Duterte has strenuously defended the violence and boasted of participating himself.Late last year, he bragged that he personally pulled the trigger and killed three people years ago while serving as mayor of Davao City.And last week, while in Vietnam for an international summit, he said he took his first life years earlier."When I was a teenager, I had been in and out of jail, rumble here and there," Duterte said during a speech in Danang, where he briefly crossed paths with Trump on the sidelines of an international summit."At the age of 16, I already killed someone."He claimed he fatally stabbed the person "just over a look."His spokesman later tried to downplay the comment, saying, "I think it was in jest."Trump has shown little interest in pressuring Duterte to rein in the violence, instead saluting him during a May phone call."I just wanted to congratulate you because I am hearing of the unbelievable job on the drug problem," Trump told Duterte, according to a transcript of the conversation that later leaked."Many countries have the problem, we have a problem, but what a great job you are doing and I just wanted to call and tell you that."Trump also criticized Obama during the call, noting that his predecessor "did not understand" the drug problem the Philippines faces.Meanwhile, Duterte was openly critical of Obama in the final year of his presidency, including cursing his name.White House officials have suggested there is a strategy behind Trump's flattery of Duterte.Advisers have said that while Trump was always unlikely to publicly chastise the Philippine president, he may offer criticisms behind closed doors.Trump would plan to hold his tongue in public in order not to embarrass Duterte, whom he is urging to help pressure North Korea and fight terrorism, and to avoid pushing him into the arms of China."If the administration is not going to care about human rights in China, why would you care in the Philippines?"asked Gordon Chang, Asia expert and author of "Nuclear Showdown: North Korea Takes On the World."He said the "logical thing to do is keep them close and not let Duterte flirt with China.In our struggle with China, we need all the friends when we can get."Duterte has seemed less committed to the strategic partnership with the U.S. Searight said a good relationship is "vital to the United States given its location on the South China Sea and the enhanced access that the American military has gotten in recent years with the Philippines."White House aides have suggested that Trump's strategy has worked before, pointing to his interactions with el-Sissi.Trump refrained from chastising the Egyptian leader but quietly worked with him to help engineer the release of American prisoner Aya Hijazi in April.Trump dismissed the notion that he buddied up to dictators.He said Saturday he has great relationships with all sorts of leaders, "every person in that room today," after leaving a summit in Vietnam attended by Duterte and Putin, among others.Human rights groups have expressed dismay at Trump's public silence, believing that the spotlight an American president can shine on human rights abuses overseas can rally pressure on an authoritarian regime to change its ways."In the old days, we used to call on the U.S. government to raise human rights issues during these trips," said John Sifton, Asia advocacy director at Human Rights Watch.But given the administration's lack of credibility in raising human rights abuses, he said, they have pivoted to a different tack, focusing on international attention."We haven't given up," Sifton said.
Trump bailed on a trade deal, and now a bunch of US businesses may suffer:::::One of the defining actions of President Donald Trump's tenure in the White House so far is his decision to withdraw the U.S. from a 12-nation trade pact that would have had wide-ranging implications for the global economy.Now that deal the Trans-Pacific Partnership looks like it's going to be settled without the U.S.. That may mean American farmers and small business owners will soon regret Washington's exit."The U.S. business community that's going to get hit the hardest when TPP happens is going to be agriculture and small and medium-sized enterprises," said Steve Okun, senior advisor at international trade consultancy McLarty Associates and a former deputy general counsel at the U.S. transportation department.Progress on the agreement, now known as the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, hit a milestone over the weekend as the 11 remaining members agreed on core elements for a new framework without the U.S. Once the new deal is implemented, American farmers could be left at a disadvantage: The agreement seeks lower tariffs for goods traded among members, the bulk of which are Asia-Pacific nations.That means non-member countries, such as the U.S., will still face high rates when shipping to Asia-Pacific."It's going to really benefit farmers and agricultural producers here in Asia-Pacific and not the U.S.," Okun told CNBC.
Keurig, advertisers cut ties with Hannity after Moore coverage:::::At least five companies said over the weekend that they will no longer advertise their products during Fox News' "Hannity" television show, which sparked an outpouring on Sunday of counter-protests on social media.Keurig, Realtor.com, 23 and Me, Eloquii and Nature's Bounty all pulled their ads from the television show, in response to Fox host Sean Hannity's coverage of the sexual misconduct allegations against Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore.Last week, a Washington Post article published an article suggesting Moore had romantic or sexual relationships with four teenage girls when he was in his 30s, allegations which the candidate has vigorously denied.In the wake of the Post report, Hannity asked his viewers to give Moore the benefit of the doubt.On Twitter, the companies announced their decision to discontinue showing their ads during Hannity's show one of Fox News' most highly rated programs that is wildly popular with conservative audiences."We can confirm that we do not have advertisements running on this program," Nature's Bounty said on Twitter Friday.None of the companies cited Hannity's coverage of the allegations against Moore as the reason that they had pulled their ads.However, the companies took to social media to announce that they were not advertising with the show, after Twitter users called for them to distance themselves from the show."We've received inquiries RE: advertising on Hannity," 23 and Me said via Twitter on Friday."We are not running TV advertising on Hannity.We continue to closely evaluate where we advertise."
Trump straddles on issue of Russian election meddling:::::President Donald Trump tried to have it both ways Sunday on the issue of Russian interference in last year's presidential race, saying he believes the U.S. intelligence agencies when they say Russia meddled and Russian President Vladimir Putin's sincerity in claiming that his country did not."I believe that he feels that he and Russia did not meddle in the election," Trump said of Putin at a news conference in Hanoi with Vietnam's president."As to whether I believe it, I'm with our agencies," Trump said."As currently led by fine people, I believe very much in our intelligence agencies."The CIA and other U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that Russia meddled in the 2016 election to help Trump defeat Democrat Hillary Clinton.A special counsel's examination of potential collusion between Moscow and Trump campaign aides so far has led to indictments against Trump's former campaign chairman and another top aide for crimes unrelated to the campaign, and a guilty plea from a Trump foreign policy adviser.Multiple congressional committees are also investigating.Trump commented on the Russia election issue for the second straight day Sunday shortly before he arrived in the Philippines, the final stop on a five-country trip to Asia.In Manila, Trump is slated to meet with Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte and attend a pair of international summits.
'Dump Trump' protest erupts ahead of Philippines summit:::::Riot police used water canon to prevent hundreds of protesters reaching the U.S. embassy in Manila on Sunday, just a few hours before the arrival of President Donald Trump in the Philippines for a regional summit and the last leg of his Asia tour.Carrying placards declaring "Dump Trump" and "Down with U.S.Imperialism", the left-wing protesters were blocked by police in riot gear with shields and batons, and then showered with jets of water from a fire engine."Trump is the CEO of the imperialist government of the US, said 18-year-old student Alexis Danday after the protesters were scattered."We know he is here to push for unfair treaties between the Philippines and the U.S." Trump was expected to arrive in the Philippines at around 5 p.m. (0900 GMT) for meetings with leaders of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and other East Asian nations, fresh off an Asia-Pacific summit and bilateral visit in Vietnam.In Hanoi earlier on Sunday, Trump said he was prepared to mediate between claimants to the South China Sea, where four ASEAN countries and Taiwan contest China's sweeping claims to the busy waterway."If I can help mediate or arbitrate, please let me know," Trump said at a meeting with Vietnam's president, Tran Dai Quang."I'm a very good mediator and arbitrator."In August, foreign ministers of Southeast Asia and China adopted a negotiating framework for a code of conduct in the South China Sea, a move they hailed as progress but one seen by critics as a tactic to buy China time to consolidate its power.
Trump offers to mediate on South China Sea:::::U.S. President Donald Trump said on Sunday he was prepared to mediate between claimants to the South China Sea, where five countries contest China's sweeping claims to the busy waterway.Trump was speaking in Vietnam, which has become the most vocal opponent of China's claims and its construction and militarization of artificial islands in the sea.About $3-trillion in goods passes through the sea each year."If I can help mediate or arbitrate, please let me know," Trump said in comments at a meeting in Hanoi with Vietnam's president, Tran Dai Quang.Trump acknowledged that China's position on the South China Sea was a problem."I'm a very good mediator and arbitrator," he said.President Quang said Vietnam believed in handling disputes on the South China Sea through peaceful negotiations and on the basis of international laws - which Vietnam says nullify China's claims.Vietnam has reclaimed land around reefs and islets, but on nowhere near the same scale as China.Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines and Taiwan also have claims in the sea.Since Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has grown closer to China, Vietnam has emerged as China's main challenger in the region.In July, China pressured Vietnam to stop oil drilling in a disputed area, taking relations to a low.Relations have since improved and Chinese President Xi Jinping is visiting Hanoi later on Sunday.
Trump: Being friends with North Korea's Kim is possible:::::U.S. President Donald Trump said on Sunday that it was possible he could be friends with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un one day and that it would be "very, very nice" but he was not sure that it would happen.Asked at a news conference in Vietnam if he could see himself being friends with Kim, Trump said: "That might be a strange thing to happen but it's a possibility."If it did happen it could be a good thing I can tell you for North Korea, but it could also be good for a lot of other places and be good for the rest the world," Trump said."It could be something that could happen.I don't know if it will but it would be very, very nice."
Trump taunts Kim: I would NEVER call him short and fat':::::President Donald Trump is exchanging school yard taunts with North Korea's Kim Jong Un.In a response to North Korea calling Trump's speech in South Korea "reckless remarks by an old lunatic," Trump tweeted from Hanoi on Sunday morning: "Why would Kim Jong-un insult me by calling me 'old,' when I would NEVER call him 'short and fat?'"Trump goes on to say sarcastically, "Oh well, I try so hard to be his friend and maybe someday that will happen!"Trump has been working to rally global pressure against North Korea's nuclear weapons program on a trip to Asia.That includes a stern speech delivered in South Korea's National Assembly on Tuesday, in which he said: "Do not underestimate us.And do not try us....The weapons you're acquiring are not making you safer, they are putting your regime in grave danger.Every step you take down this dark path increases the peril you face."On Saturday, Kim's government responded by accusing Trump of trying to demonize North Korea, keep it apart from the international community and undermine its government."Reckless remarks by an old lunatic like Trump will never scare us or stop our advance," the North's Foreign Ministry said in a statement."On the contrary, all this makes us more sure that our choice to promote economic construction at the same time as building up our nuclear force is all the more righteous, and it pushes us to speed up the effort to complete our nuclear force."North Korea is not known to have tested any of its missiles or nuclear devices since Sept. 15, a relative lull after a brisk series of tests earlier this year.Asked at news conference with Vietnam's president later Sunday if he could become friends with the North Korean leader, Trump replied it "might be a strange thing to happen but it's certainly a possibility."He said he doesn't know if that friendship will develop, but added it would be "very, very nice if it did."
President Donald Trump: Russian President Vladimir Putin denies Russia meddled in 2016 election:::::President Donald Trump said Saturday that Russia's Vladimir Putin again denied interfering in the 2016 U.S. elections.But Trump declined to say whether he believed the Russian leader."He says he didn't meddle.I asked him again.You can only ask so many times," Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One on the trip to Hanoi, Vietnam."Every time he sees me, he said: 'I didn't do that.'And I believe, I really believe that when he tells me that he means it."Trump and Putin did not have a formal meeting while they were in Vietnam for an economic summit, but the two spoke informally several times and reached agreement on a number of principles for the future of war-torn Syria.But Trump made clear that the issue of Russian meddling in the election hovers over the leaders' relationship Putin is "insulted" by the accusation, Trump said.In a blistering partisan attack, Trump accused Democrats of using the election issue to create a barrier between the U.S. and Russia as the nations work on crises in Syria and Ukraine."Having a good relationship with Russia's a great, great thing.And this artificial Democratic hit job gets in the way," Trump told reporters, once again casting doubt on the U.S. intelligence community's conclusion that Russia did try to interfere in the election."People will die because of it."Trump's suggestion that he may believe Putin over his own nation's intelligence community is certain to re-ignite the firestorm over the election meddling.Meanwhile, a special counsel investigation of potential collusion between Moscow and Trump campaign aides so far has resulted in two indictments for financial and other crimes unrelated to the campaign, as well as a guilty plea.Trump said the probe into the election hacking was a "fake barrier" placed by Democrats that was hurting the United States' ability to have a relationship with Russia, a distraction that was putting lives at stake.The Kremlin issued a statement Saturday saying that the leaders met during the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation conference in Denang and reached agreement on a number of principles for the future of the civil war-torn country now that the Islamic State group has largely been pushed out.Among the agreements' key points, according to the Russians, were an affirmation of de-escalation zones, a system to prevent dangerous incidents between American and Russian forces, and a commitment to a peaceful solution governed by a Geneva peace process.The Kremlin quickly promoted the agreement as the White House stayed silent.Trump told reporters that the deal was reached "very quickly" and that it would save a number of lives.And he praised his relationship with Putin, saying "We seem to have a very good feeling for each other and a good relationship, considering we don't know each other well."Snippets of video of conference events have shown Trump and Putin shaking hands and chatting, including during the world leaders' traditional group photo.The two walked together down a path to the photo site, conversing amiably, with Trump punctuating his thoughts with hand gestures and Putin smiling.Journalists traveling with Trump were not granted access to any of the APEC events he participated in in the picturesque tropical seaside city.White House officials worked quietly behind the scenes negotiating with the Kremlin over a formal meeting.The Russians raised expectations for such a session and Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One en route to Asia that it was "expected we'll meet with Putin" to discuss issues including ramping up pressure on North Korea to halt its nuclear and ballistic weapons program.As speculation built, the two sides tried to craft the framework of a deal on the future of Syria that Trump and Putin could announce in a formal bilateral meeting, according to two administration officials not authorized to speak publicly about private discussions.Though North Korea and the Ukraine had been discussed, the two sides focused on trying to strike an agreement about a path to resolve Syria's civil war once the Islamic State group is defeated, according to officials.But the talks stalled and, minutes before Air Force One touched down in Vietnam, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters the meeting was off.Putin and Trump crossed paths several times during the conference.The two men, each wearing traditional blue Vietnamese shifts, shook hands and greeted one another as they stood side-by-side for the group photo of world leaders.On Saturday, they were also seen shaking hands and speaking briefly during one meeting, according to a Fox News videographer who was the only American journalist allowed into the room.Trump and Putin were also seen chatting, with plenty of hand gestures from Trump, as they walked side by side to a dramatic vista overlooking the South China Sea for another group picture.Trump who is on a lengthy Asia trip, attended meetings and a lunch Saturday before heading to the capital city of Hanoi for a state visit.
North Korea says Trump begged for a war during his Asia trip:::::North Korea said on Saturday that U.S. President Donald Trump's first trip to Asia showed he was a "destroyer" and said he had begged for war on the Korean peninsula."Trump, during his visit, laid bare his true nature as destroyer of world peace and stability and begged for a nuclear war on the Korean peninsula," the foreign ministry spokesman said in a statement carried by the state news agency.Trump had warned North Korea on Wednesday not to underestimate the United States as he wrapped up his visit to South Korea.The North Korean spokesman said nothing would deter Pyongyang from pursuing its nuclear weapons program.
Republicans pull endorsements of Roy Moore after he acknowledges relationships with teens:::::Two Republican senators, Mike Lee of Utah and Steve Daines of Montana, rescinded their recent endorsements on Friday of Alabama Republican Senate nominee Roy Moore, who is embroiled in a controversy over his alleged past relationships with teenage girls."Having read the detailed description of the incidents, as well as the response from Judge Moore and his campaign, I can no longer endorse his candidacy for the US Senate," Lee tweeted late Friday.Daines tweeted a similar message soon after: "I am pulling my endorsement and support for Roy Moore for U.S.Senate."The senators' tweets followed a stunning report Thursday by The Washington Post, which documented the accounts of four women who said Moore had pursued sexual relationships with them when they were in their teens, and Moore was in his early 30s.The youngest of the four women, Leigh Corfman, said Moore initiated multiple sexual encounters with her when she was 14 years old.In an interview Friday afternoon with Sean Hannity, Moore denied ever having met Corfman, but said he may have dated at least two of the women who spoke to the Post.Overall, Moore said, dating teenage girls in his 30s "would be out of my customary behavior."But when Hannity pressed him on whether he actually had, Moore claimed he couldn't recall.This was only moments after Moore had insisted to Hannity that one of the women in the Post's story, Gloria Thacker Deason, had been 19, and not 18, when Moore dated her.At another point in the interview, Moore appeared to defend pursuing "young ladies" as long as their parents approved."I don't remember ever dating any girl without the permission of her mother.And [one woman] said her mother actually encouraged her to go out with me," he said.
McConnell says he 'misspoke' about middle-class tax hikes:::::Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Friday acknowledged he "misspoke" when he said no middle-class Americans would see a tax hike under the Senate tax plan.He told The New York Times that "you can't guarantee that no one sees a tax increase."He added that the Senate aims to reduce the burden on the average taxpayer in each income bracket.Senate Republicans on Thursday unveiled a tax plan, seeking a broad reduction in the business and individual tax burden.While most taxpayers are expected to see cuts under the proposal, some Americans, depending on their specific circumstances, could pay more due to the elimination of certain deductions.A Times analysis estimated that about a quarter of middle-class families would see taxes rise in 2018.Other independent analyses have projected tax hikes for a pocket of the population under the Senate plan and a similar proposal working its way through the House.Read the full Times story here.
Mark Cuban denies discussing with Steve Bannon a possible presidential run:::::Mark Cuban says he would run as an independent for president if he chooses to challenge Trump 12:41 PM ET Thu, 9 Nov 2017 | 06:00 Mark Cuban on Friday denied that he talked to Steve Bannon about his possible run for president in 2020.Earlier in the day, the Daily Beast cited four sources and reported that the billionaire entrepreneur has been in touch with Bannon, President Donald Trump's former chief strategist, "for months" about a potential campaign.Bannon urged Cuban to run as a Democrat, the report said, which would pit him against Trump in 2020 if both men won the major parties' nominations.Cuban told the news site that he texted Bannon "a few" times and believes that none of those were "more than one full sentence."Cuban told CNBC that running for president did not come up in his exchanges with Bannon."Nope.Not even remotely close," the Dallas Mavericks owner said.On Thursday, Cuban publicly said he is considering running for president as an independent, depending on whether his wife and family would endorse it.The "Shark Tank" panelist added that he would prefer to run as a Republican rather than mounting a bid as a Democrat.Cuban would "absolutely not" run as a Democrat, he said.The billionaire's wealth could help him avoid the need for party infrastructure, should he decide to run.It is unclear why Bannon, a staunch Trump ally, would want Cuban to run against the president.CNBC could not immediately reach Bannon for comment.Disclosure: CNBC owns the exclusive off-network cable rights to "Shark Tank," which features Mark Cuban as a panelist.
Roy Moore: Sexual contact with 14-year-old 'never happened':::::Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore said Friday that allegations by four women that he pursued relationships with them when they were teenagers are "completely false and misleading."Moore appeared on "The Sean Hannity Show," where he claimed never to have met a woman named Leigh Corfman, who alleges that Moore pursued a sexual relationship with her when she was 14 years old."I don't know Ms. Corfman from anybody," Moore told Hannity."I've never talked to her, never had any contact with her."Over the course of the interview, however, Moore did acknowledge having known at least two of the other women who spoke to The Washington Post."With regards to the other girls, understand that this was 40 years ago," he sad, "and after my return from the military.I dated a lot of young ladies."Moore stressed that his behavior was never inappropriate, and the three women he acknowledged knowing had all reached the legal age of consent.One of the women, Debbie Wesson Gibson, said Moore asked her out after they met at her high school, where Moore was speaking to her civics class.Moore said he did not specifically remember speaking to Gibson's class, or exactly when, or even if, they dated."I knew her as a friend.If we did go out on dates, then we did, but I do not remember that," Moore said.He did, however, remember that Gibson was "a good girl," and he recalled knowing her parents."They were friends," he said.Another woman, Gloria Thacker Deason, recalled that Moore took her on dates when she was 18, where he bought her drinks before she'd reached the legal drinking age of 19.Moore denied that he'd ever bought her drinks when she was 18."As I recall, she was 19 or older," he said."I seem to remember her as a good girl, and I had some sort of knowledge of her parents, or her mother," he said of Deason.Overall, Moore said, dating teenagers when he was in his 30s "would be out of my customary behavior," but claimed he couldn't recall if he ever actually had.This was only moments after Moore insisted that Deason had been 19, not 18, when they dated.At another point in the interview, Moore appeared to defend pursuing "young ladies" as long as their parents approved."I don't remember ever dating any girl without the permission of her mother.And [one woman] said her mother actually encouraged her to go out with me," he told Hannity.Moore portrayed The Washington Post's report as a hit job, cooked up by his political enemies, and tried to cast doubt as to why the women did not come forward with their allegations earlier."Obviously, you don't wait 40 years to break out something like this," he said of Corfman's account."There will be facts that come out ... to show in this situation that this was a Democrat and maybe even an established Republican effort to undermine this campaign because they don't want to hear the truth in Washington.They don't want to hear the truth.About God.And about the Constitution," Moore said.In Washington, Republican senators responded to the report Thursday with shock and dismay.More than a dozen lawmakers said that if the claims are true, Moore should exit the race immediately.According to new paperwork filed with the Federal Election Commission Friday, the National Republican Senatorial Committee is no longer a part of a joint fundraising committee that includes Moore's campaign, the Alabama GOP and the Republican National Committee.
GOP Senate campaign arm abandons Roy Moore following sexual allegations:::::The chief fundraising vehicle for Republican Senate campaigns on Friday severed its ties to Roy Moore, the party's nominee in Alabama's special election next month.The break with Moore came a day after The Washington Post reported allegations by four women who said Moore had pursued sexual relationships with them when they were teenagers.At the time, Moore was in his early 30s.According to new paperwork filed with the Federal Election Commission on Friday, the National Republican Senatorial Committee is no longer a part of a joint fundraising committee that includes Moore's campaign, the Alabama GOP and the Republican National Committee.Moore has denied the allegations against him, and his campaign on Thursday said the Post's report, which cited 30 sources, was "garbage," and "the very definition of fake news and intentional defamation."In Washington, Republican senators responded to the report with shock and dismay, telling reporters that if the claims were true, Moore should exit the race immediately.Moore's campaign did not immediately respond Friday to a request for comment about the NRSC's decision to abandon the race.As of 2 p.m.ET Friday afternoon, the RNC and the Alabama Republican Party both remained in the joint committee.
Here are the hurdles the GOP tax plans face:::::After the Senate plan's release Thursday, Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., voiced fears about the effect of broad cuts on the national debt.The budget resolution approved by Congress allows it to pass a plan that adds as much as $1.5 trillion to federal budget deficits over a decade.While the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has not scored the Senate plan, it estimated that an earlier version of the House bill would increase federal budget deficits by $1.7 trillion over 10 years.The current plans appear to come nowhere close to canceling out tax cuts with new revenue."I remain concerned over how the current tax reform proposals will grow the already staggering national debt by opting for short-term fixes while ignoring long-term problems for taxpayers and the economy," Flake, who will not run for re-election next year, said in a statement."We must achieve real tax reform crafted in a fiscally responsible manner."Along with Flake, Sens.Bob Corker, R-Tenn., and John McCain, R-Ariz., have expressed concerns about ballooning the national debt.Corker, who will also leave the Senate, has previously said he would not vote for a tax plan that adds "one penny" to the deficit.The CBO also projected that debt would rise to 97.1 percent of gross domestic product in 2027, up from 91.2 percent under current CBO projections.The forecast did not include the estimated effects of economic growth.Republicans argue that growth sparked by the bill will help to offset, or cancel out entirely, the budget shortfall caused by broad tax cuts.However, it is not clear if the tax cuts can spark the growth necessary to do so.Meanwhile, two other GOP senators called for more changes to the child tax credit to further reduce the burden on middle-class taxpayers.The Senate plan would increase the credit from $1,000 to $1,650.Sens.Marco Rubio, F-Fla., and Mike Lee, R-Utah, on Thursday called for a $2,000 credit."We continue to believe that the best way to provide real relief to working families is through a straightforward, significant, and permanent expansion of the child tax credit preferably doubling the credit to $2,000 per child and expanding its applicability to payroll taxes," they said in a statement."The Senate is not going to pass a bill that isn't clearly pro-family, so we look forward to working with our colleagues to get there."Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., has previously called for even deeper tax cuts.The GOP, which holds 52 seats in the Senate, is working on a tight margin to pass a bill.Republicans can only lose two votes.Meanwhile, in the House, Republicans can lose just 22 votes to still pass a plan.The proposal's fate in that chamber may hinge largely on how a bill treats state and local tax deductions.Many Republicans enough to sink legislation on their own represent districts in high-tax blue states, which benefit from the provision.They have expressed concerns about eliminating those deductions.The House bill changes the provisions to allow taxpayers in those states to deduct up to $10,000 of property taxes.The Senate bill scraps all state and local deductions.No GOP senators represent the states that benefit most from the deductions, like New York, California and New Jersey.If the House and Senate pass separate bills, they will have to reconcile them before approving a final bill.Agreeing on the state and local measures could prove contentious at that time in the negotiations.Republicans, who have long sought to trim corporate and individual taxes to spark economic growth, see passing a tax plan as critical to their electoral chances in the 2018 midterms.
De Blasio: Ending state and local tax deductions will be permanent:::::If Republican lawmakers are able to end state and local tax deductions in their tax-reform bill, Americans will "never see it again," New York Mayor Bill de Blasio told CNBC on Friday.The Senate GOP's tax plan, unveiled on Thursday, would eliminate federal deductions for state and local taxes.The House plan also calls for eliminating the deduction but allows a property tax deduction of up to $10,000.Tax analysts say the move could harm high-tax blue states, such as New York and California, where the state and local tax deduction is a major item."State and local deductibility has been in place since 1913.It has been something agreed upon by Democrats and Republicans throughout.Once it is gone, you'll never see it again," de Blasio told "Squawk Box."He added that if the provision is removed, at least 100 million Americans would be subject to double taxation."So, that puts downward pressure on state and local revenue," he said."The second problem is, the federal government then at any point can start raising the federal tax rate again.There's no prohibition," he said."So, you lose the protection for homeowners, for everyday people, for middle-class people."The Democratic mayor also says the U.S. needs higher growth rates, but the Republicans' tax bill is unlikely to facilitate that.Instead, growth comes from fixing our infrastructure, he said."Our infrastructure is falling apart," de Blasio said, and "we need a strong federal government."De Blasio was elected to a second term earlier this week, beating GOP state Assemblywoman Nicole Malliotakis and several third-party candidates.He is the first Democrat to win re-election as New York mayor since Ed Koch 32 years ago.When asked whether he would seek a third term like Mike Bloomberg, de Blasio said "oh, no.""I have differences with Michael Bloomberg and things I also really appreciate," he said."I think it was a mistake to go for a third.Two-term limit.The people chose it.The people were right."
Trump's CNN attacks may hobble legal case to block AT&T-Time Warner deal:::::President Donald Trump's broadsides against cable network CNN may complicate the U.S. government's legal case if it decides to block AT&T's deal to buy media company Time Warner, according to legal experts.Trump's repeated claims that CNN produces "fake news" and other criticisms of the network could hurt legitimate legal arguments the Department of Justice may use to show the deal gives the company too much power over media rivals and is bad for consumers."His comments have soiled the process," said John Kwoka, an economics professor at Northeastern University."If I were AT&T's lawyers I would certainly introduce them into the evidentiary record as meddling with what is really a law enforcement process."The fate of AT&T's $85.4 billion deal to buy Time Warner, hatched in October 2016, looks set to end up in court as the two sides have so far failed to agree on what conditions AT&T needs to meet in order to gain antitrust approval.Justice Department staff have recommended that AT&T sell either its DirecTV unit or Time Warner's Turner Broadcasting unit, which includes news company CNN, a government official told Reuters on Thursday, on the grounds that a combined company would raise costs for rival entertainment distributors and stifle innovation.AT&T chief executive Randall Stephenson said on Thursday he would not sell CNN to win antitrust approval and would fight the government in court if the two sides could not reach an agreement."If we feel like litigation is a better outcome then we will litigate," Stephenson told the New York Times DealBook conference on Thursday.He said the company had been ready to go to court the day the deal was announced in October 2016.
A Middle-Class Tax Cut? It Depends Who and Where You Are:::::Republicans promised a middle-class tax cut.So far, they have created mostly middle-class confusion.Both the evolving House bill and the emerging Senate plan would slash taxes for businesses and many wealthy individuals.What they would mean for the middle class, however, is less clear.The plans feature a spider web of intersecting and offsetting changes to the tax code that many taxpayers and even many tax accountants are struggling to untangle.This much is clear: Either version of the bill would be bad news for residents of high-tax, high-cost states, most of which tend to elect Democrats.Both bills would eliminate the deduction for state and local income and sales taxes not a big deal in low-tax states such as Florida and Texas, but a potentially huge difference for many taxpayers in high-tax California and New York.More from The New York Times: Cars Lose the Spare Tire for a Leaner Ride, but It Could Cost You Legislator Targets Tech Perks in Baltimore County District Uber Must Treat Drivers as Employees, U.K. Tribunal Rules The Senate bill would go further by also eliminating the deduction for state and local property taxes.That would be especially hard on states such as New Jersey that have high housing costs and that rely heavily on property taxes to fund their governments.(States won by Hillary Clinton in 2016 accounted for two-thirds of state and local tax deductions in 2015.They accounted for half of total income.)Michael Gottlieb, a 32-year-old health care lawyer who lives with his wife and two children in Fair Lawn, N.J., said he believed that his family would pay more in taxes based on the proposals being floated."You add all of this up and I am taking a hit," he said."I don't know if it is a drastic hit, but I am coming out behind, not ahead."His property tax and mortgage interest combined total $24,000 a year, while he estimates his state income tax would total another $10,000, for a total of $34,000 in itemized deductions.But under the new tax system, he would probably take only the standard deduction, which is $24,000 for a married couple filing jointly.Taxpayers across the country were making similar calculations this week.Most analysts agreed that the tax bill would cut taxes for the middle class on average, but would raise them on millions of families.A New York Times analysis this week found that the original version of the House plan would raise taxes on nearly half of middle-class families by 2026.Other independent estimates likewise showed that a significant minority of middle-income taxpayers would pay more under the House plan than they would under current law.That conclusion posed a political problem for Republicans, who have repeatedly promised a middle-class tax cut.Some Republicans, including Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, criticized the House bill for doing too little to benefit families.The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, promised over the weekend that "nobody in the middle class is going to pay more" under the Senate plan.The Senate bill the full text of which was released Thursday probably falls short of that promise.But some economists said the bill would most likely be better for the middle class on average than the House bill.The Senate version keeps most of the provisions of the House bill that would have helped middle-class families, such as the doubling of the standard deduction, and would make others, such as the child tax credit, more generous.It would also preserve some tax breaks that the House bill initially would have eliminated, including a deduction for medical expenses and a tax credit for families who adopt children.Some of those provisions, including the adoption credit, had been restored by the House Ways and Means Committee, which approved a revised version of the bill on Thursday.Still, the tax cuts in the Senate bill would probably be modest for most middle-class families, especially compared with the far larger tax breaks for businesses and some high-income individuals."The tax cut will still be a large windfall for very high-income people and a very small tax cut for low- and middle-income families," said Elaine Maag, who studies tax and spending policy for the Urban Institute.Tax preparers across the country said they were fielding nervous calls from clients wondering how the changes would affect them.Caitlin Campbell, president of Tower Financial Partners in Colorado Springs, said many of her clients had been excited about the prospect of tax cuts until they began to hear details.The House bill would increase the tax credits given to families with children, but also eliminate the personal exemption given to every taxpayer.Those offsetting provisions would leave some larger families worse off."They are surprised," Ms. Campbell said."They thought it was going to be a good deal.They thought it was going to reduce their taxes, and they are surprised that they might not do as well."That kind of uncertainty could pose political challenges for Republicans as they try to round up the 50 votes needed to pass the bill in the Senate.Vanessa Williamson, a political scientist at the Brookings Institution who has studied public opinion on taxation, said the recent Republican approach to tax overhaul differed sharply from the tax cuts passed under President George W. Bush.The Bush tax cuts were simple to explain, easy to quantify and lowered taxes for just about everybody, she noted.This time, the Republican approach is much less simple."People are relatively risk-averse," Ms. Williamson said."So if there's uncertainty about the benefits that you would receive, that's problematic."Deana L. Parsick, who runs a tax preparation company in Springfield, Mo., said clients had been calling her, too, but less out of anxiety than anticipation.Most of her clients have incomes of $25,000 to $35,000 a year, she said.They would benefit from the higher standard deduction and increased child tax credits."So for my clientele, I haven't seen anything that would affect them negatively," Ms. Parsick said."They're excited about the possibility, very excited."For many, the offsetting provisions in the bill are difficult to figure out.Amy and Ben Powell, who live in Louisville, Ky., with their toddler son, collectively earn roughly $80,000.Mr. Powell is a choir teacher at a local middle school, while Ms. Powell works part time at a local coffee shop.They both work on the weekend, in their church, for extra cash: He is the music director and she leads the choir's altos to make sure they are on key.The couple generally prepare their tax return together through TurboTax, which she said makes it pretty clear which tax breaks help them the most: the child tax credit, their mortgage deduction, student loan interest, the credit for teachers who buy supplies for their classroom, and charitable giving."Last year was our first year of claiming a dependent, which gave us a nice chunk back on our return," Ms. Powell said.Most of those deductions would stay in place or grow under the Republican plan.But the Powells would lose the personal exemption more than $12,000 this year and they would no longer be able to deduct their student loan interest or Mr. Powell's classroom expenses.That made them nervous, they said.Ms. Powell said friends also had concerns about prospective changes, including the dependent care tax credit, which was eliminated in the first iteration of the House tax proposal."We are both fortunate that we don't pay for child care," said Ms. Powell, who said her parents help watch their son."But I have heard from friends who are worried that what you pay into child care is being tampered with in some way."
China's Xi preaches 'openness' and 'cooperation' after Trump comes out swinging:::::Seeing profound change in economic globalization, Chinese president says 3:28 AM ET Fri, 10 Nov 2017 | 02:29 Chinese President Xi Jinping on Friday talked up the value of international "cooperation" and economic "openness."Xi's speech at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Da Nang, Vietnam, followed an address from President Donald Trump.Trump similarly called for economic openness, but struck a harsh tone against countries he deemed guilty of "chronic trade abuses."Xi praised many of the results of an increasingly connected world."Over the last few decades, economic globalization has contributed significantly to global growth.Indeed, it has become an irreversible historical trend," Xi said, according to a provided translation."In pursuing economic globalization, we should make it more open, more inclusive, more balanced, more equitable and more beneficial to all," the Chinese leader told the gathering of political and business leaders.Xi is attending the APEC meeting fresh out of last month's 19th Chinese Communist Party Congress during which he consolidated power at the top of the political totem pole.In the last year, he has also sought to market the world's second-largest economy as the flag bearer of free trade despite the fact that many elements of China's economy are not open.
'We can no longer tolerate these chronic trade abuses': Trump lashes out at China and others:::::President Donald Trump on Friday pushed for freedom and economic openness in a forceful speech that portrayed Washington as a more respectful trade partner to Asian nations than China has been.Speaking at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Vietnam, the president also warned against mistreating his country, accusing some countries in the region of "product dumping, subsidized goods, currency manipulation and predatory industrial policies.""We can no longer tolerate these chronic trade abuses, and we will not tolerate them," Trump said."From this day forward, we will compete on a fair and equal basis," he added."We are not going to let the United States be taken advantage of anymore.I am always going to put America first the same way that I expect all of you in this room to put your countries first."Additionally, Washington will "no longer tolerate the audacious theft of intellectual property, we will confront the destructive practices of forcing businesses to surrender their technologies to the state and forcing them into joint ventures in exchange for market access," he said.Many U.S. firms operating in China have complained of such policies.Trump said he did not blame China, the world's second-largest economy, or other countries for "taking advantage of the U.S. on trade," repeating a message he delivered in Beijing the previous day.
A Fifth Woman Accuses Senate Candidate Roy Moore of Sexual Misconduct:::::Mr. Moore, a judge who was twice removed from the states high court, first for refusing to remove the Ten Commandments from the Supreme Court grounds, then for refusing to accept gay marriage, responded defiantly.He showed no sign of leaving the race ahead of Alabamas Dec. 12 special election date.In an afternoon statement, Mr. Moores campaign described Ms. Allred as a sensationalist leading a witch hunt, and she is only around to create a spectacle.The statement, issued before Ms. Allreds news conference in New York, denied again any sexual misconduct with anyone by Mr. Moore.Republicans here and in Alabama have been up in arms over the accusations, published last week in The Washington Post, that Mr. Moore pursued sexual or romantic relationships with teenagers when he was in his 30s.The reports have upended a race in a state that has not elected a Democratic senator in 25 years.Photo In a fund-raising appeal, Mr. Moore reached out to his supporters with the subject line: Mitch McConnells plot to destroy me.Apparently Mitch McConnell and the establishment G.O.P.would rather elect a radical pro-abortion Democrat than a conservative Christian, he wrote.And Mr. Moores wife, Kayla Moore, lashed out in a Facebook post on Monday, complaining about a witch hunt in Alabama and claiming that we are gathering evidence of money being paid to people who would come forward.Washington establishment and Democrat Party will stop at nothing to stop our campaign, she wrote.Prayers appreciated..... Advertisement Continue reading the main story But with Mr. McConnell now firmly against his election, Mr. Moore and his candidacy promise to deepen the divide between Republican leaders in Congress and the populist wing of the party that is standing by the Alabamian.Another Republican senator, Susan Collins of Maine, also called for Mr. Moore to drop out of the race on Monday.Anxious Republican officials spent much of the weekend trying to determine what, if anything, they could do to halt Mr. Moore without simply turning over the seat.If Doug Jones, the Democratic nominee, wins, it would narrow the Republican advantage in the Senate to a single seat.Photo But if Mr. Moore stays in and goes on to win, it could leave Senate Republicans with the difficult question of whether to stop him from being seated or seating him and immediately moving to expel him from the chamber.One idea now being discussed under this scenario, brought up by two different White House officials who spoke on condition of anonymity, would be for Gov.Kay Ivey of Alabama to immediately appoint Attorney General Jeff Sessions to what had been his seat when it becomes vacant again.Mr.Sessions remains highly popular among Alabama Republicans, but his relationship with President Trump has waned since he recused himself from the investigation of the role that Russia played in last years campaign.Republicans in Washington, though, have not ruled out fielding a write-in candidate and some of the partys outside groups were expected to conduct surveys this week of who would be most formidable prospect, according to officials familiar with the plans.Democrats, who have been restrained about their prospects in such a conservative state, said that if additional women like the one joining Ms. Allred tell their stories, it would undermine Mr. Moores case that he is being smeared in a single newspaper article.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Breaking News Emails Sign up to receive an email from The New York Times as soon as important news breaks around the world.The more people that come out of the woodwork, the more women with similar stories, the more credible it becomes, said Zac McCrary, an Alabama-based Democratic pollster.Its going to become easier to see through Roy Moores non-denial denials.Democrats have begun raising money in earnest for Mr. Jones, a former prosecutor who sent Ku Klux Klansmen to jail for the infamous Birmingham church bombing of 1963 that killed four young girls.Advertisement Continue reading the main story At the news conference in New York, Ms. Nelson grew emotional as she described the assault, which she said happened one night after her shift ended at a local restaurant, where she was a waitress.Her boyfriend was late that night to pick her up after work, she said, and Mr. Moore offered her a ride home.Ms. Nelson said that instead of driving her home, Mr. Moore drove to the back of the restaurant, parked his vehicle and forced himself on her.Ms. Allred displayed a yearbook she and Ms. Nelson said is signed by Mr. Moore.The attorney said that Ms. Nelson contacted her to enlist my help and support in coming forward publicly following the allegations by other accusers.Ms. Allred said that her law firm spoke to Ms. Nelsons mother and sister, who verified the story.Photo The New York Times has not independently spoken to the family.Ms. Allred said that Ms. Nelson is willing to testify under oath.Ms. Nelson said that she and her husband supported President Trump during the 2016 election, an attempt to neutralize arguments that she is making the claims for political reasons.Ms. Allred also pre-empted attacks that she is acting with partisan interests.

Grassley of Iowa gave a somewhat more muted response, telling KCCI-TV on Friday that Mr. Moore should step aside but adding: The trouble is, if he agreed to step aside, his name is still on the ballot.People can still vote for him, and he could get elected.On Monday, those senators were joined by Mr. McConnell, Jeff Flake of Arizona, Todd Young of Indiana, Susan Collins of Maine and Thom Tillis of North Carolina, all of whom had previously made more qualified statements, saying that Mr. Moore should step aside before the Dec. 12 special election if the allegations were true.Mr. McConnell toughened his stance at a news conference about the Republican tax plan and said that party leaders were considering a write-in option.Watch the video here.Ms. Collins, Mr. Flake, Mr. Young and Mr. Tillis also dropped their if true caveats in tweets on Monday.Mr. Young said in a statement that if Mr. Moore did not step aside, Republicans should act to protect the integrity of the Senate.Mr. Flake went so far as to declare that, if he lived in Alabama, he would vote for a Democrat over Mr. Moore.If true Photo By far the most common reaction has been a call for Mr. Moore to step aside if the allegations are true.That was the first response of more than 30 senators, though none explained what criteria they would use to judge the truth of the accusations.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.Advertisement Continue reading the main story If the allegations are true, I dont think this candidacy is sustainable, John Cornyn of Texas said, but we believe in a presumption of innocence until proven guilty, and so I think its important for the facts to come out.Lamar Alexander, John Barrasso, Shelley Moore Capito, Michael B.

In Watershed Moment, YouTube Blocks Extremist Clerics Message:::::Its a watershed moment on the question of whether were going to allow the unchecked proliferation of cyberjihad, said Mark D. Wallace, the chief executive of the Counter Extremism Project, a research organization that has long called for Mr. Awlakis recordings to be removed from the web.You just dont want to make it easy for people to listen to a guy who wants to harm us, said Mr. Wallace, a former diplomat.He said the fact that much of Mr. Awlakis presence was lectures on Islamic history did not justify keeping it on YouTube.Its an insult to Islam to say the teaching of the religion cant stand the loss of a preacher who was also the leading propagandist of jihad in English, he said.The policy shift at YouTube comes in the face of a growing chorus of criticism for internet companies, including Facebook, Twitter and Google, which owns YouTube.They had long argued that they were merely neutral platforms with no responsibility for what users posted.Video But they were quick to remove copyrighted material, child pornography and beheading videos, for example, which posed an obvious threat to their business.They have slowly stepped up the removal of extremist content, spurred on after 2014 by the Islamic States use of Twitter to recruit fighters.Most recently, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube all admitted that the Russian government had used their platforms last year to pose as American voters and spread divisive propaganda.Under fire from Congress, all the companies pledged to police their sites more carefully in the future.The prolific presence on YouTube of Mr. Awlaki, who in his later years called for attacks on America and Americans, has been a subject of complaints since November 2009, when he wrote on his website that Army Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan was a hero for fatally shooting 13 people at Fort Hood, Tex.Born in New Mexico to Yemeni parents, Mr. Awlaki spent half his life in the United States and spoke excellent English.As a popular young imam in Denver, San Diego and a Washington, D.C., suburb, he recorded lecture series that were eventually best sellers among Western Muslims notably his 53-CD boxed set on the life of the Prophet Muhammad.Advertisement Continue reading the main story After leaving for London in 2002, however, he gradually embraced the view that the United States was at war with Muslims, who had a religious duty to fight back.After evidence emerged that he had recruited and coached the young Nigerian who tried to blow up an airliner over Detroit on Christmas Day in 2009, President Barack Obama ordered a legal review and then placed him on the terrorist kill list.Mr. Awlaki and three other members of Al Qaeda were killed in a drone strike in Yemen in September 2011.But his death on Mr. Obamas orders made him a martyr in the eyes of many admirers, who posted more and more of his work on YouTube.Much of it was the early, mainstream material, which clearly did not violate YouTubes community guidelines.But especially after Mr. Awlakis death, fans often labeled even his early material as the work of the martyr killed by America.The number of videos on YouTube presenting or celebrating his work more than doubled from 2014 to 2017, even as investigators found his decisive influence in most of the major terrorist attacks in the United States and some in Europe.The Counter Extremism Project, in a series of reports, documented his posthumous power and complained about YouTubes recommendation tools, which often suggested Mr. Awlakis more sinister recordings to people who watched material on Islam or sampled his history talks.YouTube was slow to remove even his most explicit calls for violence.Though the company first promised publicly to take such material down in 2010, Mr. Awlakis Call to Jihad, a 12-minute talk calling on Western Muslims to join the jihad in the Middle East or carry out attacks at home, remained easily available on YouTube until last year.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.As pressure mounted, however, the company recently decided to treat Mr. Awlaki the way it treats terrorist organizations, with a near-total ban, according to company officials.The officials agreed to discuss the policy change but declined to be named, citing security concerns.YouTube said the initial decision to purge any particular video was made by human reviewers.But once the decision has been made, a hash function, a kind of digital fingerprint, is created to automatically rid the site of additional copies of the same video.The officials noted that YouTube, according to its published rules, strictly prohibits content intended to recruit for terrorist organizations, incite violence, celebrate terrorist attacks or otherwise promote acts of terrorism.But they decided that in the special case of Mr. Awlaki, all of his recordings should be removed.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Ive seen a major drop-off of his work on YouTube, said Alexander Meleagrou-Hitchens, the research director at George Washington Universitys Program on Extremism and author of a forthcoming book on Mr. Awlaki.They deserve credit for that.Some civil libertarians cautioned about the dangers of censorship, even by a company rather than a government.The motivations that lead any individual to commit an act of violence are very complex, said Faiza Patel of the Brennan Center for Justice at New York Universitys law school.To pin it on one guys videos seems very simplistic.Mr. Meleagrou-Hitchens noted that Mr. Awlakis work remains easy to find elsewhere on the web for those seeking it.A weekend search for Mr. Awlakis Call to Jihad, for instance, instantly brought up the video on a French site, Dailymotion; on the Internet Archive; and on a Pakistanis Facebook page.Nonetheless, Mr. Meleagrou-Hitchens said, the popularity of YouTube and its automated recommendations have made it an especially pernicious platform for the cleric.The fact is that if you really want Awlaki videos, youll find them, he said.But if hes less available on YouTube, fewer people are coming across him who arent actually seeking him out.
Congress Struggles to Confront Sexual Harassment as Stories Pile Up:::::Under federal law, complainants must undergo a confidential process, where co-workers who might be able to provide corroborating evidence are excluded.They often must wait about three months before submitting an official complaint, yet must file one no later than 180 days after the episode.Once filed, victims then must submit to up to 30 days of mandatory counseling and complete another 30 days of mediation.If mediation fails, the person then must wait 30 more days before seeking an administrative hearing or filing a lawsuit in Federal District Court.Photo The system is so stacked, said Debra Katz, a Washington lawyer who often works on sexual harassment cases.They dont want people to come forward.With such rigid policies, even the most dogged complainants may find no avenue for resolution.In one case, a fellow at the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation, M. Reese Everson, brought a complaint against a House member to the Office of Compliance.But she said the office told her it could not handle her case because, as a fellow and not a full-time employee, she did not fall under its jurisdiction.She ended up filing her complaints with the District of Columbia government, where they have languished for more than two years.Few deny the growing sense that Congress is, for many women, a hostile workplace.Last Thursday, the Senate approved a resolution that would create mandatory anti-harassment training for all Senate employees and interns, and would require training every two years.At least two other pieces of legislation that would make the changes even broader are in progress.Kristin Nicholson, a former chief of staff to Representative Jim Langevin, Democrat of Rhode Island, said Congress has not gone far enough.Advertisement Continue reading the main story We think training needs to be in-person to be more effective, said Ms. Nicholson, who now directs the Government Affairs Institute at Georgetown University, and were asking for reforms to the opaque process for reporting and resolving harassment claims.In interviews, few who were harassed said they were never even informed of the Office of Compliances existence.Got a confidential news tip?The New York Times would like to hear from readers who want to share messages and materials with our journalists.Rebecca Weir, a 39-year-old lawyer in Washington, had never heard of the office in 2001 when she said former Representative Gary Miller, Republican of California, asked her to twirl for him in his Diamond Bar, Calif., office.He said, My God, you look amazing today.Just stunning.And he was kind of leering at me, and then he asked me to twirl, Ms. Weir recalled.I was stunned, but I was young and dumb and heres a member of Congress that Im working for asking me to twirl in his office.So I did.Ms. Weir said Mr. Millers chief of staff called from Washington soon after with some news.Well Rebecca, I dont know what you did, but Gary just called me and said you can have a $1,250 bonus, effective immediately, Ms. Weir recalled.On Monday morning, a woman who identified herself as Mr. Millers wife, Cathy Miller, denied the allegations.I know my husband, she said before adding that the claim was yellow journalism.There also was no mandatory training in place on Katherine Cichys 27th birthday in 2013.Ms. Cichy, then an aide for now-retired Senator Tim Johnson, Democrat of South Dakota, was walking through Union Station with colleagues when Ms. Cichys direct supervisor repeatedly called her hot.Ms. Cichy reported the episode to her then-chief of staff, who she said made light of the incident, saying it is what it is.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Months later, Ms. Cichy took a job in another office.The man who harassed her stayed in Mr. Johnsons office, as did his former chief of staff, Drey Samuelson, who said on Friday that hed warned the offending employee, I would fire him, and it never happened again.He said that he did not make light of the episode.Photo Bottom line, Ms. Cichy said, my boss told me I was hot, and I had to sit in a room every day and work with him.And they didnt do anything about it.Nothing.For women lobbyists, sexual suggestions appear to be part of the price of access.In her 40 years on the Hill, Laura W. Murphy, the former head of the American Civil Liberties Unions Washington legislative office, said she endured a number of sexually suggestive incidents as generations of lawmakers cycled in and out of Congress.In the 1980s, a House member, whose name she would not share, tried to kiss her in the produce aisle at a Capitol Hill grocery store.In the early 2000s, she said a lawmaker asked her for a working dinner, then propositioned her for sex.At first it was about work, Ms. Murphy, 62, said.But then it devolved into a very blatant overture to have sex.Like many women, Ms. Murphy did not report the incidents in part because she believed her career could be negatively impacted and because she wasnt sure where she could turn.All of the women now coming forward are putting pressure on the Office of Compliance, whose processes date back to the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995.Between 1997 and 2014, the United States Treasury paid $15.2 million in 235 awards and settlements for Capitol Hill workplace violations under the offices byzantine procedures, according to a recent Washington Post analysis of the Office of Compliance.Susan Tsui Grundmann, the offices executive director, said that the office has received an increase in requests for harassment training in the past two weeks, and that the five-member board has repeatedly recommended since 2010 that Congress implement regular mandatory harassment training.Bradford Fitch, president and chief executive of the Congressional Management Foundation, a group that helps lawmakers and staff run their offices, said sexual harassment is vastly underreported in congressional offices.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.This has been the case for decades: In 1989, Alice Cain was 22 and three months into a job as a chief of staffs assistant for Paul Simon, the late Democratic congressman from Illinois, when one of his top donors groped her and kissed her at a fund-raiser held at a Washington hotel.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Ms. Cain, who is now 50 and works for a nonprofit organization, said that several other women in her office had similar experiences with that donor, whom she declined to name out of respect for his family.But she said it was years before the women spoke to each other about the episodes.If I go into my bosss office and say, Oh, this guy did this to me I dont want to lose my job, Ms. Cain said.I think all of us made that calculation.She said she decided to share her story belatedly for the 22-year-olds now.Others are now reconsidering past experiences, episodes previously brushed off as playful or not a big deal, that register now as assault.Hannah Hudson was in her early 20s and working for a Democratic congressman from Oklahoma in 2009 when she was joined on a work trip by staff members from a Republican senators office.At a work outing, she said a senior aide for that senator attempted to tug open her wrap dress, which shed pinned closed, asking, Why are you holding out on us?Ms. Hudson, who is now 32 and works as a photographer, didnt think to report the incident.She said she tried to brush it off because she felt that what happened to her was not as bad as what had happened to other people.She does remember feeling grateful when a male colleague who silently witnessed the incident pulled her aside privately to ask if she was all right.How much of a patriarchal society do we live in that the person who came up to me in private and said, Oh, are you O.K.?is the hero?she asked.She paused.Thats the nice guy in the story.
Republican Class Warfare: The Next Generation:::::Tax breaks that phase in or out to make the 10-year budget impact look smaller?Check.Misleading examples and calculations to give the false impression of a tax cut for the middle class?Check.Pretending that tax cuts come free, that they wont eventually have to be offset by cuts to popular programs?Check, again.But there are also some new aspects to this latest money grab.This time around, much more clearly than before, the goal seems to be to favor wealth, especially inherited wealth, over work.And buried in the legislation are multiple measures that would make it much harder for the children of the middle and working classes to work their way up.So, about the wealthy: The prime example is the way G.O.P.plans would eliminate or sharply reduce taxes on inherited wealth, which currently apply only to a tiny number of huge estates.Yes, Republicans are still pretending that this is about helping small family businesses and family farms, but at this point thats a sick joke: The best estimates suggest that only around 80 eight-zero of such businesses and farms pay any estate tax each year.This is about making wealthy heirs even wealthier full stop.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.There are other big examples, like a new tax loophole that would benefit business owners but only as long as they dont actually run their businesses.And theres more.But let me shift focus instead to what Republicans are trying to do to ordinary families.Were still waiting for detailed analysis of the Senate bill, but the House bill doesnt just raise taxes on many middle-class families: It selectively raises taxes on families with children.In fact, half half!of families with children will see a tax hike once the bill is fully phased in.Suppose that a child from a working-class family decides, despite limited financial resources, to attend college, probably taking out a loan to help pay tuition.Well, guess what: Under the House bill, that interest would no longer be deductible, substantially raising the cost of college.What if youre working your way through school and your employer contributes toward your education expenses?The House bill would make that contribution taxable income.Advertisement Continue reading the main story What if your parent is a university employee, and you get reduced tuition as a result?That tuition break becomes taxable income.So would tuition breaks for graduate students who work as teaching or research assistants.So what were looking at here are a variety of measures that will close off opportunities for children who werent clever enough to choose wealthy parents.Meanwhile, funding for the Childrens Health Insurance Program, which covers more than eight million children, expired a month and a half ago and so far, Republicans have made no serious effort to restore it.This is surely the shape of things to come: If tax cuts pass, and the deficit explodes, the G.O.P.will suddenly decide that deficits matter again and will demand cuts in social programs, many of which benefit lower-income children.So this isnt just ordinary class warfare; its class warfare aimed at perpetuating inequality into the next generation.Taken together, the elements of both the House and the Senate bills amount to a more or less systematic attempt to lavish benefits on the children of the ultra-wealthy while making it harder for less fortunate young people to achieve upward social mobility.Or to put it differently, the tax legislation Republicans are trying to ram through Congress with indecent haste, without hearings or time for any kind of serious study, looks an awful lot like an attempt not simply to reinforce plutocracy, but to entrench a hereditary plutocracy.
Protesters Jeer as Trump Team Promotes Coal at U.N. Climate Talks:::::The American presentation came the same day that a new study showed that emissions were rising worldwide after three years on a plateau.Researchers said the emissions growth was driven largely by increased burning of coal in China and India.The question is not if we will continue to use coal, but how, said Holly Krutka, vice president of coal generation and emissions technologies at Peabody Energy.Michael R. Bloomberg, the former New York mayor who has spent tens of millions of dollars on a campaign to shut down coal plants, said, Promoting coal at a climate summit is like promoting tobacco at a cancer summit.Mr. Bloomberg, who is attending part of the Bonn conference, this week donated $50 million to environmental groups to help countries shift away from coal, starting in Europe.Photo While many energy experts agree that technologies like carbon capture for coal plants and nuclear power can play a critical role in reducing emissions, the fact that Trump administration officials have played down concern over global warming has triggered deep suspicion about American intentions.Nuclear and carbon capture are critical to reducing CO 2 emissions, but going to Bonn to promote the technologies without admitting climate change is a crisis is a logical absurdity, said Josh Freed, director of the clean energy program at the centrist think tank Third Way.He said that denying that climate change is a problem while pushing technology to solve it made no sense.Why would anyone trust or work with you?he said.Several American lawmakers who flew to Germany for the climate change talks denounced the coal discussion.Gov.Jay Inslee of Washington, a Democrat, pre-empted the White House event by striding into the packed conference room and calling it a sideshow that the rest of the world would ignore.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Its a total distraction, said Andrew Steer, president of the World Resources Institute, an environmental think tank based in Washington.Still, Mr.Steer acknowledged, countries throughout Asia and Africa are continuing to build coal plants in their quest to provide energy access for millions living without electricity.This is not wickedness on the part of these countries that want to get cheaper energy, he said.Trump administration officials made a similar point.We need to lift one billion plus people out of energy poverty, Mr. Banks said.He argued that while renewable energy has a bright future, only fossil fuels at the moment can deliver enough energy to allow people to rise out of poverty.Yet even as the Trump administration pushes for a revival of the coal industry, other countries say they are phasing it out.France has vowed to eliminate coal from its electricity mix by 2022, and Italy by 2025.The United Kingdom and Canada said this week that they, too, would take steps to phase out coal.Were passed the time that we want to be using coal, said Catherine McKenna, Canadas environment minister.People do not want polluting coal.They do not want it.Some developing countries described a more balanced view, however, conceding a need for fossil fuels in the short term while ultimately calling for stronger global action on climate change and a shift toward cleaner forms of energy, including renewables like wind and solar energy.Officials from Bangladesh, which still gets most of its electricity from natural gas and has plans to build 25 new coal-fired plants by 2022, said they would welcome the use of technology to improve the efficiency of their coal plants as a steppingstone toward renewable energy.Keep in mind that this is a developing country that has a huge need for electricity, said Muhammad Azizul Haque, a deputy secretary in Bangladeshs Environment Ministry.So there has to be balance, its not just saying, O.K., well go for renewables.Its very complicated, because people need energy.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Pakistan, for its part, has begun importing more liquefied natural gas in order to reduce its reliance on burning coal and oil for electricity, said Tariq Banuri, executive director of Pakistans Global Change Impact Study Center.Those imports have helped offset 1 percent of the countrys emissions.Mr. Banuri said that Pakistans emissions were likely to grow in the coming decades as it lifts itself out of poverty, though the country is also making a big push on renewable energy and could do more if wealthier nations provided more aid to help drive down the cost of wind and solar even further.But any nuanced discussions of energy policy were overshadowed by anger at the Trump administration for disengaging from the global community on climate change.During a question-and-answer session, audience members pressed American officials to clarify the White Houses stance on climate change.Climate mitigation is an important goal of the United States, Mr. Banks said, but I dont think its any surprise that economic security and energy security are higher priorities.
Text of Beverly Young Nelsons Accusation Against Roy Moore:::::Mr. Moore was an adult.He was much older than I was.I knew that he was the District attorney in Elowah County.I did not understand what that meant, but I knew that he was an important person and I always treated him with respect.When he was at the restaurant he would speak to me and would sometimes pull the ends of my long hair as I walked by him.I had red hair down to my waist.He would complement me on my looks.I did not think anything of it.I did nothing to encourage his flirtatious behavior.I was accustomed to men flirting with me because I was well developed and I competed in beauty pageants.I did not attach any significance to Mr. Moores behavior towards me and I did not respond to any of Mr. Moores flirtatious behavior for two reasons: First, I had a boyfriend.Second, even if I had not had a boyfriend I was not interested in having a dating or sexual relationship with a man twice my age.I turned 16 on November 14, 1977.About a month later I received my yearbook from Southside high school where I had spent my freshman and sophomore years.I happened to bring my yearbook to work with me to the restaurant on December 22, 1977.I put it down at the end of the counter.Mr. Moore happened to notice it and asked if he could write in your yearbook.I felt flattered and I said yes.He wrote in my yearbook as follows: Photo I took the yearbook home with me at the end of my shift that day.I felt honored that Mr. Moore, who was such an important person, would write in my yearbook.A week or two later I was working at the restaurant.My shift ended at 10pm when the restaurant closed.It was a cold night and I went outside to wait for my boyfriend to pick me up and drive me home.My boyfriend was late.Mr. Moore exited the restaurant at the same time as I did.He noticed that my boyfriend was not there and he offered me a ride home.I trusted Mr. Moore.He was the District attorney.I thought that he was simply doing something nice by offering to drive me home.I did not want to wait outside in the cold so I agreed.I wanted to call my boyfriend but this was before cell phones and I had no way to contact him.My home was only about two and a half miles away.I planned to call my boyfriend after I got home to let him know that I had gotten a ride home and that there was no need for him to pick me up.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Mr. Moore was wearing brown hush puppies on his feet.He drove a two door car.I believe that it was an old car, but I do not recall the model.I got into his car in the passenger seat.He began driving.I thought he would get on the highway, but instead he drove to the back of the restaurant.I was not immediately alarmed as there was an exit from the back of the restaurant to the street and he could drive from there to my house without getting on the highway.However, instead of driving to the street he stopped the car and parked his car in between the dumpster and the back of the restaurant where there were no lights.The area was dark and deserted.I was alarmed and I immediately asked him what he was doing.Instead of answering my question, Mr. Moore reached over and began groping me, putting his hands on my breasts.I tried to open my car door to leave, but he reached over and locked it so I could not get out.I tried fighting him off, while yelling at him to stop, but instead of stopping he began squeezing my neck attempting to force my head onto his crotch.I continued to struggle.I was determined that I was not allow him to force me to have sex with him.I was terrified.He was also trying to pull my shirt off.I thought that he was going to rape me.I was twisting and struggling and begging him to stop.I had tears running down my face.Advertisement Continue reading the main story At some point he gave up.He then looked at me and said, you are a child.I am the District attorney of Etiwah County.If you tell anyone about this, no one will believe you.He finally allowed me to open the car door and I either fell out or he pushed me out.I was on the ground as he pulled out of the parking area behind the restaurant.The passenger door was still open as he burned rubber pulling away leaving me lying there on the cold concrete in the dark.I got up and tried to pull myself together.I was making my way to the front of the restaurant when my boyfriend arrived.It was late and it was dark.I did not say anything to him as to what had occurred as he had a violent temper and I was afraid that he would do something that would get him into trouble.When I got home I went to my room.The following morning my neck was black and blue and purple.In the days following I covered the bruising on my neck with makeup.I did not tell anyone about what had happened.I was scared.I felt that if I told anyone Mr. Moore would do something to me or my family.I decided to keep what happened to myself.The day after Mr. Moore assaulted me I called the restaurant and quit my job.I never went there again.About two years later I told my younger sister what Mr. Moore did to me.About four years ago I told my mother what happened.Before I married my husband, John, I told him what Mr. Moore had done to me.My husband and I supported Donald Trump for President.This has nothing to do with Republicans or Democrats.It has everything to do with Mr. Moores sexual assault when I was a teenager.I thought that I was Mr. Moores only victim.I would probably have taken what Mr. Moore did to me to my grave, had it not been for the courage of four other women that were willing to speak out about their experiences with Mr. Moore.Their courage has inspired me to overcome my fear.Mr. Moore attacked me when I was a child.I did nothing to deserve his sexual attack.I was frightened by his position and his power.I am coming forward to let Mr. Moore know that he no longer has any power over me and I no longer live in fear of him.

Haste on Tax Measures May Leave a Trail of Loopholes:::::An incentive to invest in slipshod, money-losing ventures would be created by the combination of a new proposal to immediately expense investments with the Senates suggested delay in the corporate tax cut.Rules designed to prevent highly paid doctors, lawyers and other service providers from cashing in on new benefits aimed at small businesses can be easily circumvented.Even those who applaud the aim of reducing the corporate tax rate and transforming the way global profits are taxed worry that specific provisions will miss the mark.Republican leaders, responding to political pressure to move quickly, defend the process, saying Congress has held dozens of hearings on tax reform in recent years.Tax bills, by nature complex, are shaped by a galaxy of competing pressures.And withholding details until the final vote as a way of shielding the legislation from special interests is not a new strategy.Yet several veterans of previous tax battles argue what is different this time is the mix of breakneck speed and enormous scope.Consider the plans shift from a worldwide system, where profits are taxed no matter where they are earned, to a territorial system, which exempts profits earned outside the United States, bringing the American tax system in line with those in most other nations.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Because the switch could end up encouraging American companies to move even more profits offshore to avoid paying any domestic income tax, both the House and Senate versions of the bill impose rules to deter most multinationals with annual revenues of more than $100 million from exploiting such tactics.But the effort to catch the giants under the new territorial system sets a financial bar that small and medium-size businesses can limbo under.Mr. Shay said accounting firms were likely to start marketing off-the-shelf tax shelters allowing companies to set up foreign offices in low-tax countries like Bermuda or Luxembourg to shrink their tax bills.Theyre just opening us up to the next round of tax shelters on the international side, he said.And the I.R.S., underfunded as it is, isnt going to be able to check anything.At the same time, he said, some safeguards aimed at multinationals could still be bypassed.To reduce their home tax bill, companies like Google and Pfizer, for instance, often relocate patents and copyrights in tax havens and then sell use of that intellectual property back to their American subsidiaries at eye-popping prices.These are the higher-than-normal profits which Senate bill drafters have cunningly called Gilti (for global intangible low-tax income) that Republican bills are trying to stop from leaking out of the tax system.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Multinationals, though, could avoid some of the Gilti tax by shifting more tangible property like production and research facilities abroad.Other problems arise from the push to reduce the rate on pass-through businesses (sole proprietorships, partnerships and S corporations that currently pay taxes at the individual rate).Lawmakers have advertised the cut as relief for smaller businesses, but high-income investors in hedge and private-equity funds could use the provision to reduce the tax paid on rent and interest income by as much as a third.Hedge-fund investors have an additional opportunity for a windfall with a simple reporting technique, said Steven M. Rosenthal, a senior fellow at the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center and former legislation counsel with Congresss nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation.The funds decision to mark their trading positions at their market price (instead of their initial purchase price) would enable any gains to qualify for pass-through treatment at the newly reduced rate of 25 percent instead of being treated as short-term capital gains, at a top rate that nears 40 percent.The pass-through changes present other tax dodges.Benefits for pass-throughs that provide services like doctors, lawyers and accountants are supposed to be phased out for individuals with incomes above $75,000 and for married couples with income above $150,000.But a firm could skirt that limit by creating multiple partnerships with different functions, with one providing services, and the other handling, say, licensing or leasing, said Dan Shaviro, a professor of taxation at New York University Law School who helped write the 1986 tax overhaul.Photo There is not a single advantage this has, except for students of people like me, who will get paid more to figure out how to game the system, he said.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Individual proposals that might make sense on their own can also set off unintended consequences when paired together.Although the Senates plan to wait until 2019 to cut the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent has infuriated some shareholders, it saves money so that Congress can reach its budget goals.Some tax experts go further and argue that any cut should be phased in over a 10-year period to smooth out investment and reduce windfall gains.Yet enacting a 20 percent corporate tax rate to take effect one year in advance while allowing investors to immediately deduct their expenses at 35 percent operates like a subsidy, and could encourage investing in money-losing projects simply for a tax gain.That could lead to silly stuff where you have a loss before the tax, but a gain after the tax, Mr. Shaviro said.(He offered an example for the mathematically inclined.Normally no one would invest $100 to earn only $90 back.But under the Senate plan, where some business expenses could be immediately deducted at a 35 percent rate, you would get $35 back in 2018.So your actual cost is $65.By the time your $90 earnings are paid in 2019, though, the tax rate would be 20 percent.That would cost you $18 in taxes, and leave $72 in your wallet.So even though your investment lost $10, you are still coming out ahead: with $72 on a net investment of $65.)Other experts pointed to constantly shifting cost estimates of proposals that suddenly gained or lost tens of billions of dollars overnight.At the end of 10 years, the very safeguards that are supposed to prevent international tax avoidance actually lose money, according to the Joint Committees revenue estimates of the House bill, said Kimberly Clausing, an economist at Reed College.This is a big giveaway in future years, she said.On net, the whole system is ineffective.The shortcomings are fixable to some degree, critics say, but the Republican strategy of pushing through a bill without Democratic votes before the end of the year on tax rules that take effect a few weeks later will not leave sufficient time.To some supporters, though, thats the price of success.Will they find things that need to be fixed afterward because the process was moving so fast?Yes, said Rachelle Bernstein, vice president and tax counsel at the National Retail Federation, which represents big chains like Macys and Saks Fifth Avenue.But there are always technical corrections to tax bills after they pass, Ms. Bernstein said, and retailers have been waiting so long for a corporate rate cut that they dont mind if it finally happens with an imperfect bill.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Its part of how the sausage is made, but its better to make this sausage than cut it off, Ms. Bernstein said.
Navy SEALs Investigated in Green Berets Death Also Under Scrutiny in Theft:::::The Pentagon said last week that an inquiry into the four soldiers deaths would not be completed until January at the earliest.No one has been charged in Sergeant Melgars death, which a military medical examiner ruled a homicide by asphyxiation, or strangulation.The initial reports to Sergeant Melgars superiors in Germany said he had been injured while wrestling with the two Navy commandos, according to three officials who have been briefed on the investigation and who requested anonymity because of the ongoing investigation.The Naval Criminal Investigative Service took over the case in late September from Army criminal authorities after the status of the two Navy commandos was changed from witnesses to persons of interest, meaning officials were trying to determine what the commandos knew about the death and whether they were involved.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The Navy SEALs potential role threatens to tarnish SEAL Team 6, the famed counterterrorism unit that carried out the raid that killed Osama bin Laden in 2011.Until now, the biggest unanswered question in the case has been why Sergeant Melgar was killed.But new clues are emerging on that front.An American service member who knew Sergeant Melgar said he was under the impression that the sergeant had stumbled on some sort of money-skimming scheme involving the Navy commandos.A retired senior enlisted sailor who served in SEAL Team 6 said Sergeant Melgar discovered the scam and threatened to report the Navy commandos to the authorities.Sergeant Melgars suspicions were first reported in the Daily Beast.Both people spoke on condition of anonymity because the sergeants death remains under investigation.A spokesman for the Naval Criminal Investigative Service, Ed Buice, declined to comment on the homicide investigation.Special Operations troops from a range of units can earn qualifications that let them recruit sources for intelligence and pay them.These individuals may handle payments from small cash bags up to storage lockers filled with currency.Cash from funds to pay informants has a way of going missing, military officials said.Skimming money from funds, which in Mali could be as much as $20,000 at any given time, is relatively easy because the service members are often dealing with sources who are illiterate and cannot sign their names to a receipt.This allows an unscrupulous person to create a bogus receipt with the equivalent of an X for a signature, military officials said.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.One of the first missions to draw broad public attention to the secretive Navy SEAL Team 6 unit was its dramatic rescue in April 2009 of Capt.Richard Phillips after Somali pirates hijacked the Maersk Alabama cargo ship.Snipers from the units Red Squadron shot and killed three of the pirates in a small rescue boat.The criminal complaint against the surviving pirate, Abduwali Abdukhadir Muse, describes how Captain Phillips gave roughly $30,000 in cash from the safe aboard the Maersk to the pirates, money that soon disappeared.Captain Phillips later recalled leaning against a sack with the money inside on the lifeboat.When Navy personnel searched the lifeboat, all they found were guns, ammunition, cellphones and radios.The Naval Criminal Investigative Service gave the SEALs polygraph tests about the missing money but could never prove where the $30,000 had gone, and the case was closed.No SEAL from that mission is involved in the Mali case.Much is unknown about what happened around 5 a.m. June 4 in the house that Sergeant Melgar shared with another Army Green Beret and the two Navy commandos.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The SEALs were in the country on a clandestine mission to support French and Malian counterterrorism forces battling Al Qaedas branch in North and West Africa, known as Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, as well as smaller cells aligned with Al Qaeda or the Islamic State.The Americans helped provide intelligence for missions, and had participated in at least two such operations in Mali this year before Sergeant Melgars death.Over all, about two dozen American troops operate in Mali at any given time, mostly to help on training and counterterrorism missions.SEAL Team 6, formally known as the Naval Special Warfare Development Group, has over the past decade carried out kill-or-capture missions in Libya, Yemen, Afghanistan, Iraq and Somalia, as well as the one that killed bin Laden in Abbottabad, Pakistan, in 2011.According to one version of events surrounding the death in Mali, from a military official, one of the SEALs put Sergeant Melgar in a chokehold.When the sergeant passed out, the commandos frantically tried to revive him.Failing that, they rushed him to an emergency clinic, where he was pronounced dead.The service member who knew Sergeant Melgar said that the sergeants chain of command immediately grew suspicious when the initial incident reports said the death was the result of a drunken accident.His friends and superiors knew Sergeant Melgar did not drink.One of the SEAL commandos under investigation is Petty Officer Tony E. DeDolph, a former professional mixed martial arts fighter, according to two military officials who were not authorized to speak publicly about the matter.His identity was reported by The Intercept.Petty Officer DeDolph and the second Navy commando, Adam C. Matthews, were flown out of Mali shortly after Sergeant Melgars death and were placed on administrative leave at the units headquarters in Dam Neck, Va.Sergeant Melgar, a graduate of Texas Tech University who joined the Army in 2012, was assigned to the 3rd Special Forces Group, based at Fort Bragg, N.C., the same unit whose soldiers were attacked by a much larger and heavily armed group of Islamic State fighters near the border between Niger and Mali on Oct. 4.Sergeant Melgar, a native of Lubbock, Tex., was about four months into what military officials said was a six-month tour in Mali.He was part of a small crisis-response team in Bamako assigned to help provide intelligence about Islamic militants in Mali to the United States Embassy to help protect its personnel against attacks.The sergeant also helped assess which Malian Army troops might be trained and equipped to build a counterterrorism force.The distinguished accomplishments of Staff Sergeant Logan Melgars are in keeping with the highest honors and traditions of military service, read the citation with a Defense Meritorious Service Medal awarded to him posthumously.
Trump Again Wades Into Tax Debate, Suggesting Repeal of Obamacare Mandate:::::In recent weeks, Mr. Trump has called for including the repeal of the individual mandate in the tax bill.Doing so would save more than $300 billion over a decade and would allow Republicans to boast that they took a step forward in dismantling a law that continues to haunt them.Representative Kevin Brady, Republican of Texas and the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, said Mr. Trumps opinion remained a factor as the House tried to pass its own tax bill this week.The president has already indicated to me a number of times that hes really interested in including the individual mandate repeal, Mr. Brady said.It remains under consideration.Mr. Brady added that he was very confident that Republicans had the votes to pass the bill and that while he did not expect major changes to the legislation, there were important differences between the House and Senate bills that must eventually be bridged.Mr. Trumps Twitter messages about taxes have at times sowed confusion about the direction he wants to chart for the legislation.The president said previously that he wanted Republican negotiators to allow for a higher individual tax bracket to make sure that the bill was sufficiently progressive.The House plan would keep a top rate of 39.6 percent for millionaires and the Senate plan has a top rate of 38.5 percent for high earners.But Mr. Trump suggested on Monday that lawmakers lower the top rate to 35 percent while also giving deeper cuts to the middle class.Last month, lawmakers were considering making changes to 401(k) retirement accounts as a way to raise revenue before Mr. Trump quashed the idea on Twitter.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Although Mr. Trump must sign the eventual legislation, Republican lawmakers have shown a willingness to break with his wishes.Mr. Trump originally called for a 15 percent corporate tax rate, but Senate Republicans appear to have settled on a 20 percent rate that will be delayed by a year.Senate Republicans also have ignored Mr. Trumps desire to fully eliminate the estate tax and, for now, they have not addressed the special treatment of carried interest that gives hedge fund managers and private equity partners lower tax rates on their income.Advertisement Continue reading the main story At the beginning of the Finance Committees markup, which is expected to last several days, the panels chairman, Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, offered a pre-emptive defense of the bill, both in terms of substance and process.Mr. Hatch dismissed Democrats complaints, based on an analysis from the Joint Committee on Taxation, that the bill would raise taxes on millions of middle-class families, saying critics were missing the forest for the trees.The talking point is that 13 million families in the middle class will see their taxes go up next year if the bill becomes law, Mr. Hatch said.But, he said, critics should focus on the 90 percent of the middle class that would see a tax cut or no change under the bill.He also suggested that the Senate bill would keep the corporate rate cut permanent as Republicans amend the bill in the coming days to comply with special budget rules that will protect it from a Democratic filibuster.Theres no real cause for concern at this point, Mr. Hatch said.But I do want to make clear that were looking at a number of alternatives that will fill the necessary gaps and we have every intention of making the business reforms permanent.Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on the Finance Committee, warned that Republicans had drawn up legislation that would hurt millions of middle-class taxpayers.Because Republicans are planning to pass the bill under the rules that shield it from a filibuster, theyve got to squeeze several trillion dollars of tax handouts and corporate goodies into a $1.5 trillion box, Mr. Wyden said.That means telling the middle class in America to pay up.
Trump Judicial Pick Did Not Disclose He Is Married to a White House Lawyer:::::Democrats have strongly criticized the nomination of Mr. Talley, a 36-year-old who has never tried a case and who received a rare not qualified rating from the American Bar Association.His nomination advanced through the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday on a party-line vote.Photo Mr. Talley served as deputy solicitor general for the state of Alabama, currently serves in the Department of Justices Office of Legal Policy and was recommended by Alabamas U.S. senators, said Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary.He is more than qualified to serve in the federal judiciary.Mr. McGahn has played a key role in helping Mr. Trump transform the federal bench by filling vacancies with young, deeply conservative judges.But a White House official said Ms. Donaldson was not involved in that process.Ms. Donaldson has emerged in recent weeks as a witness in the special counsels investigation into whether Mr. Trump obstructed justice.She was interviewed by investigators recently about her detailed notes about conversations with Mr. McGahn on topics including the firing of the former F.B.I.director James B. Comey, according to two people briefed on the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the investigation with reporters.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.The special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, is investigating Russian interference in last years presidential election and whether Mr. Trump tried to obstruct the Justice Departments inquiry.He has denied any obstruction.Mr. Trump nominated Mr. Talley in September to the Federal District Court based in Montgomery, Ala.Weeks later, Mr. Muellers investigators notified the White House that they wanted to interview Ms. Donaldson, but there is no indication that anyone anticipated that at the time of her husbands nomination.Ms. Donaldson has not had much direct contact with Mr. Trump, but as Mr. McGahns top aide, she often spoke with him after he met with the president.Ms. Donaldson took notes, which the White House provided to the special counsels office.Mr. Talley, who graduated from Harvard Law School in 2007 and is a deputy assistant attorney general at the Justice Department, is the fourth judicial nominee under Mr. Trump to receive a not qualified rating from the American Bar Association and the second to receive the rating unanimously.Since 1989, the group has unanimously rated only two other judicial nominees not qualified.
Former Eli Lilly Executive Is Trumps Choice for Health Secretary:::::Critics mocked the selection by a president who promised to drain the Washington swamp of lobbyists and has complained about RIPOFF DRUG PRICES on Twitter.Representative Peter Welch, Democrat of Vermont, said that instead of draining the swamp, he has set the fox to guard the henhouse.Senate Democrats vowed to scrutinize Mr. Azars record in the Bush administration and as a drug company executive.I am also interested in how, given Mr. Azars professional background, he believes he can fairly execute any significant effort to lower drug prices for patients, said Senator Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington.Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee and the chairman of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, said Mr. Azar had the qualifications and experience to get results and promised to promptly schedule a hearing on his nomination.In addition to his experience as a pharmaceutical executive, Mr. Azar brings to the job impeccable credentials as a conservative lawyer.A graduate of Yale Law School, he was a clerk for Justice Antonin Scalia on the Supreme Court in the early 1990s and spent two years as a young lawyer working for Kenneth W. Starr, the independent counsel who investigated President Bill Clinton.If he is confirmed by the Senate, Mr. Azar would be returning to a sprawling agency where he served as general counsel and deputy secretary before spending a decade in the pharmaceutical industry.He resigned from Eli Lilly, which makes Cialis, Humulin and Trulicity among other popular and profitable drugs, in January.Mr. Leavitt dismissed concerns that Mr. Azars work at Eli Lilly would interfere with his ability to seek lower drug prices.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.To solve the problems within the pharmaceutical industry, you have to understand the way the distribution system works, Mr. Leavitt said.Alex understands that as well as any person in the country.If he were to be confirmed, Mr. Leavitt added, Alex doesnt work for the drug industry he works for the president of the United States.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Kathleen Sebelius, who succeeded Mr. Leavitt as health and human services secretary under Mr. Obama, said Mr. Azars knowledge of how the department worked would be a valuable asset if he was confirmed.But she said she had no doubt Mr. Azar would use that expertise to reverse the health care changes that she helped put in place.He may be the only secretary in modern history other than Tom Price to be given the job to take away peoples health care, Ms. Sebelius said.Alex is a smart guy.He clearly has watched the last year or so.I assume his agreement to come in means that hes O.K.with enforcing or trying to promote the presidents agenda.Mr. Trumps choice of Mr. Azar continues a pattern in which the president has put former industry officials in charge of regulating their former colleagues.At the Department of Health and Human Services, it would fall to Mr. Azar to follow through on the presidents threats to confront drug prices, many of which are manufactured by Mr. Azars former company.Eli Lilly, where Mr. Azar worked for almost a decade, is one of three manufacturers of insulin whose prices have skyrocketed in recent years.The price increases by the three drug makers Lilly, Novo Nordisk and Sanofi have happened in near lock step and prompted outcries from patient groups.This year, a lawsuit filed by patients accused the companies of fixing prices.Lilly again raised prices on two of its insulin products, Humalog and Humulin, by nearly 8 percent in May.The company has previously noted that many patients do not pay the list price for insulin because they benefit from rebates negotiated with insurers, and it offers discounts of about 45 percent off the list price for people without insurance.When Mr. Trump nominated Dr. Scott Gottlieb to be the commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration in March, Democrats sharply criticized the selection, saying he could not be objective because he had earned hundreds of thousands of dollars as an investor in and consultant to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies.But since taking office in May, Dr. Gottlieb has put pressure on drug companies to hold down prices and has taken steps to increase competition in the prescription drug market by speeding the approval of lower-cost generic products.No patient should be priced out of the medicines they need, Dr. Gottlieb said in June.And he followed up with several steps last month.If consumers are priced out of the drugs they need, he said, thats a public health concern that F.D.A.should address, within the scope of its mandate and authorities.John C. Rother, the executive director of the Campaign for Sustainable Rx Pricing, a coalition of consumer, labor and physician groups concerned about high drug prices, said Mr. Azar is competent and knows a lot about health policy and the operations of the Department of Health and Human Services.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Even with his drug background, its hard to say anything negative about him, Mr. Rother said, adding, We sincerely hope that he will follow through on the presidents commitment to achieve lower drug prices.

What Red States Are Passing Up as Blue States Get Billions:::::Some state governments and local think tanks have prepared estimates of the costs and benefits of Medicaid expansion in their region.But the Avalere analysis is the first to apply a consistent methodology across all of the states that have declined to expand.Some of the numbers are big.Florida would get an estimated $26 billion over the next decade, according to Avalere; North Carolina $13 billion.The Medicaid expansion has been the subject of substantial scholarly attention.Strong evidence suggests states expansion has helped improve the financial health of their low-income residents, as well as the financial performance of local hospitals.Studies also show that Medicaid coverage has helped low-income Americans get access to health care, though there is not yet strong evidence about whether it has improved their physical health.Research has found that the Medicaid expansion does not appear to discourage low-income people from working.More speculative articles have suggested that the influx of federal dollars may help strengthen state economies, though there is little hard evidence of such effects.Governors in expansion states have argued that the money has been particularly helpful in helping residents battle addictions to opioids.A recent study found that, in the early years of the expansion, there were no hidden costs to state budgets and that states spent no more on their programs than states that declined to expand.In some states, it appears that expansion has improved state finances, by reducing the need for programs that pay doctors and hospitals directly for uncompensated care, among other ancillary effects.There is evidence that Medicaid expansion has lowered insurance premiums for middle-class residents who buy their own insurance.Some states are likelier to come out ahead than others.Benjamin Sommers, an associate professor at the Harvard School of Public Health who studies Medicaid, said Wisconsin, for example, might actually save money over all if it accepted federal expansion dollars.But legislators and governors in the holdout states have consistently opposed the expansion, citing a range of political, ideological and fiscal concerns.One big issue, experts say, is the expansions link to Obamacare, a law that Republicans have vowed to repeal from the beginning.Its made it very hard for them to turn around and embrace one of the only optional parts of it, said Matt Salo, the executive director of the National Association of Medicaid Directors, who has closely watched the debate.There is ample evidence from the states that have done it that there is substantial benefit.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Some state officials also object to a program that provides benefits to poor residents who dont work.Studies have shown that the large majority of expansion beneficiaries are working, in school or caring for a sick family member.But the Trump administration has signaled that it will allow states to condition coverage on community engagement activities, a policy change that could interest some reluctant politicians.But States Would Have to Raise Money to Pay Their Share Projected state spending required to accept federal Medicaid money, as a percentage of each states 2016 general fund Tennessee Missouri Maine Utah South Dakota Florida Idaho Mississippi Kansas Nebraska Wyoming South Carolina Texas Virginia Oklahoma Alabama North Carolina Georgia Wisconsin 0.75% 0.61 0.54 0.54 0.53 0.53 0.53 0.47 0.47 0.44 0.44

0.40 0.38 0.37 0.30 0.27 For some states, finding 10 percent of the dollars may be a challenge.David Dzielak, the Medicaid director in Mississippi, a state that has not expanded, said raising even a small fraction of the funding would be hard, especially after recent corporate tax cuts.The Avalere numbers suggest that the 6 percent of Medicaid expansion costs that Mississippi would need to pay if it expanded next year would represent less than 1 percent of its 2016 general fund spending.Its all about the money, really, and our state is so poor that we cant even afford the 10 percent for the expansion, he said.Thats really the bottom line.But not every state that has expanded its program has been wealthy, and some of those have been red states.Louisiana, for example, expanded Medicaid last year, providing health coverage to around 430,000 people, despite limited fiscal capacity and state budget challenges.Some of the largest coverage gains have come in poorer states, including West Virginia, Arkansas and Kentucky.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Sara Rosenbaum, a professor of health policy at George Washington University, said states generally fight to maximize federal funding for their programs.She described Medicaid expansion as a striking counterexample, where political preferences have sometimes outweighed the desire for resources.Its so much revenue, she said.Thats when you know were not dealing with dollars and cents.Medicaid expansion states could keep growing.Voters in Maine last week approved a ballot measure to expand Medicaid.And recent legislative gains by Democrats in Virginia could change the politics of the issue there.Activists in other states, including Kansas, Utah and Idaho, are mobilizing for a renewed expansion push in the coming year.*** The Avalere estimates are rough, but they show what would happen if each states expansion resulted in a decrease in the uninsured rate among low-income residents that is similar to the average decrease in states that have already expanded their programs.The model then made adjustments for the size of the poor, uninsured population, and the different costs of providing Medicaid care in different states.In the states that have expanded already, there has been a wide range of effects.The uninsured rate among the eligible population declined by only half a percentage point in Massachusetts, which already had very broad insurance coverage.But it declined by more than six percentage points in Louisiana, where there were many more poor residents who lacked coverage.The average reduction was 2.5 percentage points.Most of the states that havent expanded are likely to reap more federal dollars than these estimates if they expand, said Mr. Sloan, but analysts felt the average number was a useful, conservative estimate.(That means that our figures may also understate the amount of money that states would need to spend, too.)Our budget numbers are for the fiscal year 2016, and come from a recent survey from the National Association of State Budget Officers.In evaluating the budget impact of the federal share of Medicaid expansion, we compared estimated federal spending with total state budgets, including current federal dollars.In evaluating the state share of the expansion funding, we compared the numbers to state general funds, to give a sense of how the program would compare with functions that the state raises its own funds to cover.State budgets typically grow by around 3 or 4 percent a year, said John Hicks, the associations executive director, so our percentages may slightly overstate Medicaid expansion funding as a share of state budgets.

half are undecided (presumably between voting and not voting at all).Based on my analysis of Voter Study Group data, these voters tend to be much more nonwhite, poorer and less educated than the overall electorate.Theyre the marginal voters Democrats need to mobilize to win.The next graphic measures voters attitudes toward economic and cultural issues.The Fault Line: Culture Wars The three groups of vote switchers are largely left-of-center on economic policy (Obama-Clinton voters are included for comparison).But the Obama-then-Trump segment is much more conservative on social issues suggesting they wont be easily won over to the Democratic side.Bars indicate the range of political views held by about 95 percent of the people in each voter group.Centrist How they voted in: Liberal Conservative 12 16 Economic issues Obama Clinton 3rd party/ didnt vote Obama Obama Trump Romney Clinton Cultural issues Obama Clinton 3rd party/ didnt vote Obama Obama Trump Romney Clinton Bars indicate the range of political views held by about 95 percent of the people in each voter group.Centrist More liberal More conservative How they voted in: 2012 2016 Economic issues Obama Clinton Third party or didnt vote Obama Obama Trump Romney Clinton Cultural issues Obama Clinton Third party or didnt vote Obama Obama Trump Romney Clinton The Obama-Trump voters who plan to stick with Republicans are more consistently conservative on both economic and cultural dimensions, but particularly on the latter (they are still broadly left of center on the economic dimension).The Republican-voting Romney-Clinton voters dont differ too much from Democrat-voting Romney-Clinton voters this group might include those who have always voted Republican; maybe some old liberal Nelson Rockefeller-style Republicans; or maybe some voters who dont follow politics very closely and dont realize that the Republican Party is more conservative than them.In the Obama-Other category, the undecideds look a lot like the Democratic voting decideds, squarely in the liberal camp.Since most of the voters are in all three subgroups (and the national electorate, too) lean left economically, a strong progressive economic message would almost certainly help Democrats.Moving right on economics, by contrast, will not help Democrats with any of these voters and could even risk losing some, demoralizing an energized base, especially younger voters.On culture, theres also not a whole lot to be gained by triangulating, particularly if Democrats want to mobilize the Obama-Other category of voters.Besides, if the racially tinged campaign of Mr. Northams opponent, Ed Gillespie, is indeed a preview of how Republicans plan to run in 2018, Democrats are going to have a hard time neutralizing cultural issues, and theyre going to struggle to win over rural voters who are motivated by these issues.Their best bet will be to offer a sharper economic message, which offers at least some possibility of gain among Obama-Trump voters and Obama-Other voters, with little risk of alienating Romney-Clinton voters.The Virginia results suggest Democrats still might also be able to expand their base without attempting to reach these voters with a new economic populism results that will certainly give comfort to the donor class of the party that gets nervous every time Bernie Sanders begins talking.The inevitable pendulum swing against the Republican Party, Mr. Trumps deep unpopularity, an energized electorate and the wave of Republican congressional retirements and the slow but steady demographic shift toward a younger, more diverse electorate will all give Democrats an advantage that they can ride mostly just by being Democrats and not doing stupid things.Project this trend forward, and perhaps a just-out-of-reach suburban Atlanta House district that a Democratic nominee, Jon Ossoff, narrowly lost this year becomes a narrow Democratic pickup in 2018.Still, the better bet for Democrats would be to present a sharper economic message, which offers at least some possibility of gain among Obama-Trump voters and Obama-Other voters, with little risk of alienating Romney-Clinton voters.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Its also better for our politics.The more Democrats rely simply on upscale voters cosmopolitan cultural values and corresponding revulsion to Mr. Trump, the more our political system becomes organized around zero-sum culture issues and locked in increasingly no-compromise polarization.Economics, after all, you can bargain over.Identity and culture, not so much.The good news for Democrats is that running on a stronger economic vision is not only good for the country, its also good for the Democrats long-term fortunes.
How the Resistance Helped Democrats Dominate Virginia:::::Sorenson, whose one-woman campaign the candidate had a demanding day job was limited by a cumbersome and unsightly cervical collar, had few illusions that all these new volunteer hearts had been set aflame by the local business owner and retired Navy Reserve commander David Reid, even if everybody who met him agreed right away that he seemed like a profoundly decent guy with the right priorities.She knew that their primary motivation was their hatred for the president, and that their secondary motivation was their hatred of their local Republican congresswoman, but she was optimistic that they might be taught to direct some of their umbrage toward Reids incumbent Republican opponent, Tag Sorry, shed say, with mock solemnity, Delegate Greason.What Sorenson needed from these inchoate volunteer armies, however, was not a collective expression of outrage; it was reliable support for campaign practicalities like door-knocking and phone-banking, tasks that lacked the glamour and solidarity of marches and protests.Even those who could readily speak about state and local issues how the Republicans in the House of Delegates had refused the Medicaid expansion and passed a sheaf of anti-abortion bills; how Loudoun County was the only district in Northern Virginia without full-day kindergarten; how somebody needed to put a stoplight at Waxpool and Demott, where Sorenson was almost killed were rarely acquainted with the proper channels for action.They would talk about calling their representative, and Sorenson would say, Thats not a congressional thing, thats a state thing!or Thats not a state thing, thats a supervisor thing!Call your supervisor!Sorenson showed them how to find out who their supervisors were.They wanted to write letters to Terry McAuliffe, the governor, about bathroom discrimination.She said: Dont write letters to Terry!The bathroom bill is dead, dont worry.It died in subcommittee, and even if it hadnt, Terry had already promised to veto it, so pick a better battle!If a more grizzled campaign manager might have thought only to harness this energy, Sorenson saw an opportunity to help organize it.When the volunteers made proposals that seemed impractical or irrelevant, she did not issue judgment.I didnt want to rain on their ideas, she said.Instead, she gently tried to usher them in productive directions.She told them about what a great guy David Reid was, how hed come from poverty and sent his two girls to local public schools and today stood for full-day kindergarten and gun control and Medicaid expansion and distance-based tolls on the Dulles Greenway.She also told them about Reids Republican opponent, Tag Sorry, Delegate Greason and all the party-line votes hed made down in Richmond.He votes 99 percent of the time with the Republican leadership.From assault rifles to bazookas to ninja stars, hes for it.To get Reid on the ballot, Sorenson explained, the campaign needed to collect 125 signatures by March.The pop-up groups were happy to help, especially because Sorenson had a pleasant, easygoing appeal, not to mention a broken neck.Within a few weeks, she was given almost 600 names.She couldnt quite account for how it was done; these groups didnt have leadership, exactly, or if they did, they had large steering committees and they could be touchy if you used the wrong word or gave one individual too much credit but they used Facebook and they contacted friends of friends and somehow they got the signatures they needed.And not only that.Representatives from some groups got the required signatures, and then representatives from some other groups materialized to vet those signatures and remove inadvertent out-of-district signatories, and then still other representatives from different or maybe the same groups suggested they might help Sorenson by formatting all of that petition data so they could merge the relevant information with their master voter file.As long as Sorenson was explicit about what she needed, it all seemed to just ... happen.In the months after Trumps inauguration, there was no shortage of expressive opportunities for the left protests, actions but few electoral conduits for its new resolve.Virginia provided one of them.In what Sorenson unsentimentally called 16, Hillary Clinton carried the state by more than five points, but the previous years election had preserved for the Republicans a considerable edge in the House of Delegates: 66 to 34.Not a single incumbent lost.Now, in advance of 2017, Democrats couldnt help thinking it auspicious that exactly 17 of those Republican delegates came from Clinton districts.If the party could flip only those seats this year, it would come away with a 51-49 majority.This seemed like a totally fanciful possibility to Sorenson herself, but she wasnt blind to its inspirational potency: Flip the Hillary districts, flip the house.A majority of the pop-up groups were experiments in decentralized organizing, so individual chapters were free to expend their energy where and how they pleased.Nevertheless, given the scarcity of actual elections this year, they flocked in disproportionate numbers to Virginia and in particular to its 32nd district.Reids district had no primary, for one thing, and seemed acutely winnable.It also had Sorenson.She was not only competent; she was, at least outwardly, calm.She also reached out to each group on its own terms, even if that effort alone absorbed three or four hours of each day.And she didnt want to seem exploitative, so she refused on principle to blast the groups lists with what she called hair-on-fire send-$5-now-or-the-world-will-end emails.Though in theory these groups had diverse goals, the impression they made on Sorenson was one of a great, reverberant longing.Theres just this huge energy, Sorenson told me, with people saying, We want to do something right now, we want to effect change in this election.They were hard to keep track of: who was with which group, what each one cared about, which groups were subgroups or affinity groups of other groups, which had national umbrella organizations and which didnt, which terms of art groups preferred to describe their particular variety of leaderlessness.There were chapters and huddles and pods, and they used Google Forms or Google Docs or Eventbrites or Meetups.She found herself scrolling through endless Facebook commentaries in search of group moderators or other sources of provisional authority.Advertisement Continue reading the main story She began to build her own Google Doc as a central storehouse for all the fugitive information.This color-coded document included but was not limited to, in no particular order, the following groups: 31st Street Swing Left; Code Blue; Indivisible Del Ray; Indivisible VA Assembly 42; Network NoVA; NOVANation Coalition; Sister District DC; Sister District Maryland; Swing Left; Together We Will NoVA; Vienna Neighbors United; VOTE MOB VA; WofA (We of Action); ACT Empowered; We ARE the People Who Stand Up; Loudoun 4 Womens March on Washington; Hunter Mill Huddle; Arlington Huddle Action Network; Neighbors for a Blue Virginia; Ward 3 Democrats; the Resurgent Left; Turn It Blue DC (formerly Swing Left NE DC); Dining for Democracy; #Citizen.Sorenson got a kick out of the names the groups had given themselves.She loved one called the Huddlery.Sorensons list included the names of the principals, to which she often felt obligated to append the qualification (co-leader?)or (steering committee member?).She documented their purpose, insofar as she could divine it; her perception of their viability (all talk no plans); and their willingness to help the Reid campaign to, as her own hashtag put it, #flip32blue.Each of the groups wanted Sorenson to make some kind of pitch for why they should direct their resources her way.Some, like Flippable, had former campaign people on staff; they just needed to hear the numbers and theyd mail a check.Others, like the West L.A. Democratic Club, asked her questions for an hour before saying no.Some had clear purity tests Will you take the no-PAC-money-ever pledge?Were you endorsed by Senator Sanders?and Sorensons campaign didnt always check all the boxes.Others were concerned that she didnt need the help badly enough.Sorenson did her best to put her candidate and their campaign up for adoption in a way that made their specific requirements clear.It was going to be expensive, for one thing.They had to raise at least $400,000, or $500,000 if she wanted her Cadillac plan.The map of Loudoun County is a Mandelbrot set of nested subdivisions, and three of her precincts the Villas, Lansdowne Woods and the Ashby Ponds retirement community are gated and thus unknockable, which meant the campaign would have to double down on phone banking.This would require a lot of coordination.Running against a seven-year incumbent, Reid also faced a huge deficit in name recognition, which meant that early preparatory canvassing was just as important as a late turnout effort.Money and time would always be the hardest asks, but while Sorenson was still neck-braced and understaffed, there were plenty of basic start-up tasks to complete.One outfit offered to make the campaign an easily updatable website.Another sent a member to take photographs, which saved the campaign $700.Sorenson offhandedly mentioned that it would be nice to have a spreadsheet itemizing all of Tag Greasons votes in his seven years in the House of Delegates bill number, how he voted, why it matters.She had it within hours.Yet another organization delivered print-at-home postcards that recalled classic Americana, marked with parks and schools and polling places; she wanted people to keep in mind that the 32nd district was an actual place.She loved the postcards, even if she had to send repeated reminders about which disclosures were necessary to make them compliant with campaign-finance law.It wasnt lost on her that some of the work being done was redundant, and that some of her interactions required more effort than they ultimately returned, but Sorenson understood that the new spirits were fragile.She tried to remind herself that each group brought its own perspective or talent, even as her attempt to outline their special characteristics revealed a litany of special needs.One group was part of a Jewish organization and thus couldnt canvass on Saturdays.Another one wanted to know how to get over to Loudoun without paying tolls, and many of its members were older and needed printed directions or car pools.But Sorensons willingness to keep track of and accommodate all these preferences gave her word-of-mouth fame.No research trial volunteer-coordination software, fund-raising by text message was too small or bug-ridden for her to disdain, and she joked that she was first in every line to serve as a guinea pig.In June, Shaun Daniels, then an executive director of an influential PAC called Win Virginia, told me, No one anywhere is working with more outside groups than Kathryn.Democratic politics had entered a new era of experimentation, he said, and this here is ground zero.By the middle of June, Sorenson had hired a field director and a field organizer, both from the Clinton campaign.They chose the weekend of June 24 for their earnest summer opener a Weekend of Action in part because it coincided with a Network NoVA event called the Womens Summit.This daylong happening brought together participants from across the pop-up group universe to hear speeches from 35 of the House of Delegate candidates left standing after the Democratic primaries the week before.These primaries had delivered a remarkable slate most of them first-time candidates, a majority of them women, including many from the working class and many of color.Sorenson did not feel competitive, and had great warmth for her colleagues in other races, but she knew that some of the pop-up groups would be tempted to exchange Reid for a candidate of greater charisma or a more diverse background, like the sheep farmer in a nearby district.She didnt want her outside collaborators to forget that they joined up with her (and Reids) effort early and for good reasons.The other salient election was the recent runoff between Jon Ossoff and Karen Handel in Georgias Sixth Congressional District.Sorenson herself was not disposed to draw any big lessons from Ossoffs defeat, which she was by nature unable to regard as a leading indicator on the president, or the Democratic Party, or the role of outside patrons.It seemed to her that the campaign was waged about as well as it could have been in a district that was close to impossible for a Democrat to win.For many of her volunteers, however, the loss felt like a dispiriting prelude to what was supposed to be a stirring campaign kickoff.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Early in the morning, a crowd of campaign staff members, longstanding volunteers and outside irregulars milled around Reids home in anticipation of their canvassing shifts.The familys two shiba inus were underfoot, the coffee table was decorated with back issues of astronomy and archaeology magazines and the whole place smelled faintly but persistently of maple syrup.There were cars from Massachusetts and Missouri, and Reid joked more than once about how he kept meaning to give out an award for the person who traveled the farthest to be there.The volunteers were mostly women, and mostly middle-aged, and had come outfitted for day hikes of moderate exertion.Whenever one of them was asked which group, if any, she had come with, there was a perceptible pause as she thought about the profusion of mailers in her inbox and posts in her Facebook feed.Those there for the first time were nervous about how they would be greeted.A woman from Vienna, Va., named Francesca, in capri-length cargo pants, sturdy boots and a beaded necklace, raised her hand.She had come on behalf of half a dozen groups.Am I going to look like a carpetbagger, or should I say that I care so much that I came here from elsewhere?Reid looked to Sorenson before responding.Nobody will ask you because you look like the district its pretty diverse here.We joke that we give an award for the person who came the furthest.All of this, here, its really starting to make a difference.The volunteers were shuffled through a brief orientation, which was longer on Reids biography a foster child who was the first in his family to go to college; a local businessman who sent his daughters to the public schools; a retired Navy Reserve intelligence officer who gave 23 years of service to his country than it was on his positions.But the point of the summer canvass was deliberately introductory.Photo Francesca, the woman from Vienna, cleared a space for me in her cluttered minivan.Shed worked on clean-energy policy, she told me en route, but her entire department was recently eliminated.We passed a new data center across from a data center under construction.She delivered an impassioned monologue as she tried to pay attention to the GPS; she had an air of spiky distraction, as if stopping to scowl at news alerts while watching a TV show.Now the Klan is out in Charlottesville when they take down the Confederate monuments.Just the other day I went to the website of the Southern Poverty Law Center for the first time in my life.Its intersectionality.If affluent people like me arent caring about Black Lives Matter, well it kind of opened my eyes.We cant ever not be engaged again.Its like the Founding Fathers idea of the yeoman government.My progressive friends, theyre on Facebook but theyre not out canvassing and phone-banking.Theres nothing else going on in 17, and theres all this pent-up energy.Francesca said she had gone to the Womens Summit the previous morning and left exhilarated, but what she took away from the conference wasnt wholly clear.Each delegate emphasized the importance of gerrymandering, and health care, and school funding, and rural broadband, and the state of the roads.If the national Democratic Party really was in crisis, torn between cultural politics and pocketbook issues, it certainly wasnt visible at the summit.The biggest applause line of the day came from Danica Roem, a transgendered former journalist and freshman member of the Democratic Party who won a surprise victory in a four-way primary in District 13, to the south.My opponent, she said with national-stage charisma, cares more about where I go to the bathroom than how you get to work!Francesca, however, seemed to have little interest in low-stakes issues like the office vacancies on Manassas Drive.Were literally fighting for our democracy, she said.Its Handmaids Tale.We got out to canvass in a subdivision of modest flagpoled homes on branching cul-de-sacs.Francesca traipsed over peoples lawns and rapped hard on doors.The hit rate with canvassing is always low, and over two hours on a hot and cloudless Sunday, we encountered only half a dozen families at home.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.In the few conversations Francesca did have, she was invariably friendly and polite, but her pitch about Reid was mostly that he was a great guy; every once in a while she remembered to say that he was in favor of full-day kindergarten districtwide or distance-based tolls on the Dulles Greenway.In her one extended interaction, a young mother began by saying that her family cared above all about full-day kindergarten.She had only ever voted in presidential elections, she admitted, but then managed, over the course of five minutes, to convince herself that she was wrong to do so.I dont vote in the local but I guess I really need to now, she said.Well, I was never out canvassing before, either!Francesca said.Some volunteers I accompanied were more careful to stay off lawns, or more fluent in the local issues, or had greater experience with the mechanics of political campaigns; some remembered that a 1 on the voter-information sheet meant most likely to vote for David Reid, while others were sure that great enthusiasm was recorded with a 5.On the record, they were always positive about their huddles and steering committees, even if off the record they wondered whether the welter of organizations meant duplicative or otherwise-inefficient resource allocation.No one, however, seemed frustrated by the fact that they reached only a handful of voters, or discouraged from making a return trip.Advertisement Continue reading the main story By the end of the weekend, more than 40 volunteers had knocked on more than 2,500 doors.Sorenson rarely allowed herself to be thrilled by anything, but she conceded some satisfaction that these were patently terrific results.This wasnt to say that everything had gone smoothly.When canvassing was over, Sorenson checked the campaigns email account to find a restrained but irate message from a community member, upset that his homes no soliciting sign was ignored.The volunteer stood and argued about the First Amendment.The voter leaned Republican, he continued, but had always voted on both sides of the aisle, and from what he knew about David Reid, he was interested.This encounter, however, had cost them his vote.This didnt sound to Sorenson like one of her own people.She looked up the planned itineraries of one of the outside groups an organization dedicated to voter-suppression issues and found that it must have been someone from its camp.Sorenson wasnt sure there was much she could do.They have a different list, and a different script, and different priorities.We tell our people in training not to get into constitutional battles, but each group does its own thing.The interaction was, Sorenson thought, a bummer, but she couldnt afford to dedicate any more time to it just then.She had email to answer, and as she took out her phone, I looked down at mine.There was a news alert that the Supreme Court had upheld part of Trumps travel ban, and I read it aloud.At first Sorenson didnt seem to know what I was talking about.Then she said: Oh, him.I cant even worry about him.I cant even think about him.She was late for another call, this one with the group that had the wrong compliance box on their folksy print-at-home postcards.It lasted an hour.It is never easy to assess a campaigns progress, particularly one that is likely to be won or lost by a few hundred votes, but over the summer the Reid campaign appeared to have cultivated a meaningfully committed base, among local voters and elsewhere.A San Francisco group called the Sister District Project, which pairs volunteers in deeply blue or red districts with campaigns in purple ones and had quickly become one of Sorensons most useful and beloved allies, had helped them set up an Amazon Wish List.Now far-flung supporters could buy them toner or printer paper.They handily outraised Delegate Greason for the month of June $53,000 to his $39,000 with five and a half times as many total contributions and 12 times as many grass-roots donors.Greason was still up $36,000 in cash on hand, but there was almost certainly enough time to close that gap, especially since the Reid campaign had raised enough money to hire a finance director, a young woman who had worked on the Ohio senatorial campaign; she would save Sorenson countless trips to the Post Office and the bank.On the third weekend in July, Sorenson was working from home when she checked the campaigns Facebook page and saw a photo of some 30-odd canvassers, 20 of them from the group that had done the campaigns website.I was like, Holy cow, you usually see those numbers later in the year.By the end of August theyd visited 32,556 doors.The House Democratic Caucus looked at their stats and decided to award them two additional paid positions.The major development was an unexpected shift in the dynamics at the top of the ticket.The governor and the states two senators were Democrats; the pipe dream for November 2017 was to bring the State Legislature into line.In August, however, the Republican gubernatorial candidate a former lobbyist, R.N.C.chairman and all-around establishment figure named Ed Gillespie hired an erstwhile Trump campaign operative and reinvented himself in the presidents image.He began to speak out against the removal of Confederate monuments and in favor of the travel ban.He spoke about the danger of sanctuary cities, even though Virginia has none, and ran campaign ads about Latino gang violence that prompted a rare public rebuke from Obama.It was hard to tell how this affected Sorensons race, though the summer poll wasnt good; Reid was down by seven.But the race, Sorenson knew, was always going to come down to turnout.The weekend after Labor Day would hopefully set the tone for the fall, when, with any luck, the name recognition theyd worked to foster might begin to translate into voter commitments.When returning summer volunteers arrived, they found a more mature operation: there was a sign-in table in the entryway, three times the turnout and a campaign staff large enough for one person to do check in, one person to divide the turf and a third to guide the orientations.Photo Reid as a candidate seemed looser and more confident.Hed received recent endorsements from the League of Conservation Voters and the Sierra Club, and was willing to talk about more difficult subjects.Theres some hesitation among people of color to put up yard signs for a Democrat, he told a group of volunteers, after what weve seen, down in Charlottesville and elsewhere, with the emboldening of white supremacists.He did not seem like the sort of person whod ever had reason to refer to white supremacy.He was, however, still making the same joke about giving an award to whoever had traveled the farthest to volunteer.For canvassers, the script was slightly different in this phase of the campaign.They were now instructed to ask directly if the campaign could count on the respondents vote.The field organizer explained that if volunteers found themselves in a position to discuss Delegate Greasons record in Richmond, they should mention that he missed more than 700 votes 713, to be precise.A volunteer raised his hand to ask how many pieces of legislation actually came before the delegates; he thought it would be more impressive to express Greasons absences as a percentage.Sorenson, at her computer, rolled her eyes.Once he left, she looked up.I know exactly how many pieces of legislation came before the chamber, and I picked that number for a reason!We do not want to express it as a percentage.Advertisement Continue reading the main story For every volunteer who saw fit to challenge the campaigns authority or its expertise, however, there were half a dozen there for a political education.If everybody hated the tolls, more than one canvasser asked, why were they so high?Well, the campaign answered, the Australian firm that owned the Dulles Greenway had donated $8,000 to Delegate Greason.There was something about the modesty of that figure that got even distant volunteers incensed on behalf of the local community.The conflicts surrounding Trumps D.C. hotel and the emoluments clause were exasperating but remote in their immensity, whereas a $6 toll for a $2.29 bottle of milk was an affront you could grasp.With 11 days to go before the election, their ground strategy shifted from the voter-commitment stage to the final get-out-the-vote effort; on the campaigns final Saturday, they enlisted 205 volunteers to go door to door helping voters articulate an explicit plan for when and how theyd go to the polls on Tuesday.The race, as Sorenson predicted, was going to come down to turnout on the margins: their tracking poll had them in a dead heat.Sorensons estimate was that Reid needed 13,150 votes to win, and it was easy for her to imagine that the final tallies would be within the 1 percent margin that would trigger an automatic recount.With the race tightening, Greason sent mailers that described Reid as a radical leftist who had taken tens of thousands of dollars from New York, Washington and California.Sorenson showed it to me and shrugged.Well, that last parts true.Sorenson was grateful for all the money and help from her outside volunteers, but what most moved her was when she felt someone had made the organizational leap from political fury to political identification.When one of her Sister District captains in Maryland asked for a yard sign, Sorenson furrowed her brow and asked her why she wanted one on the other side of the river.The volunteer simply said, We need to expand what we think of as our own backyard.Sorenson didnt have a lot of time for mawkishness, but that idea, she said, is just beautiful to me.And she could appreciate whatever it was that got people newly involved in politics and kept them there.If Indivisible wanted to call Virginia the first statewide referendum on Trump, that was fine with her, as long as they didnt set expectations so high that their support couldnt survive a disappointment.Election Day was a dark deluge of hard, driving rain.Sorenson put on high green galoshes and met Reid at his polling place at 7 a.m., then sent him on a tour of polling locations to shake hands and take selfies.She went back to their staging location in the rec room of some dedicated supporters.Everybody seemed to have a different idle conviction about which kind of voter was most susceptible to the weather, but Sorenson screened out the chatter, sitting on a high stool in front of her laptop, an overheated phone in her hand.She left only to vote herself, and to check up on an alarming but ultimately false story she heard about an older supporter whod had her ballot disqualified for no reason.The foot traffic not just the usual folks from D.C. or Maryland, but people who came from California, Florida and Iowa was so steady that the campaign began to run out of clipboards.Volunteers would arrive, muddy and soaked, peel off their clear ponchos and hand over their unreadably macerated voter rolls.By midafternoon, they were almost finished with the fifth complete pass theyd done, over their 11-day mobilization window, of all 10,000 doors in their universe.Most returnees declared that everyone on their lists had either voted already or was just waiting for a spouse to come watch the kids; some of them stopped Sorenson to tell her stories about how they took a moment at the end of their shifts to circle back around and check on these promissory replies, and more often than not they encountered I voted stickers.Then theyd be handed a new packet and sent back out into the rain.Someone in need of reprieve asked Sorenson when she planned to wrap things up for the day.When do you stop?If your nearest polling place closes at 7:00 and is two minutes away, you stop at 6:58.Sorenson didnt feel she could really trust the numbers that were coming in turnout, she thought, couldnt realistically be as high as it seemed to be but by 4 oclock she could no longer ignore the fact that most polling places had already far exceeded the totals they usually showed in off years.She dealt with her mounting anxiety by making new spreadsheets to compare precinct-level historical data and devoted her last hour of her campaigns last day to one final round of phone-banking to voters in what she worried was her one underperforming precinct.The campaign party was at a favorite strip-mall wine bar.Sorenson went home to change, thinking she might have a moment to herself before the results came in, but by the time she and the rest of her team arrived, 90 percent of Loudouns precincts were reporting.Reids race was one of the first calls.He won with more than 17,000 votes, by at least 17 points.Shoals of well-wishers formed around Sorenson, touching her arms and shoulders and yelling through their tears.You are so [expletive] awesome, one said.You brought happiness back into our lives, said another.Sorenson made her way through the crowd slowly and with only a small, hesitant, curious smile.Every few minutes the growing crowd reacted to new results.Wins at the top of the ticket brought sighs of relief, but the shouted announcement of each successive delegate victory triggered gasps and whoops of astonishment: the first Asian-American woman, the first two Latina women, the first out lesbian, the first trans woman, an African-American woman, even a woman in a Trump district; altogether at least 11 new Democratic women, seven from Northern Virginia alone, in a swell that seemed likely to result in 16 flipped districts for a tied House.Eventually Sorenson sat down with her finance and field directors the three young women, Reid later proclaimed, who organized a legion of volunteers and brought them to victory to eat some cheese;

Gun Carnage in the Nation, Groundhog Day in the Capitol:::::Photo Last year, Senator Christopher Murphy decided it was time to resort to a filibuster about the need to control the nations relentless gun violence.With the help of colleagues in the Senate chamber, he spoke for 15 hours.Nothing changed.This year, the Connecticut Democrat, sounding even more desperate, tried political candor: I wish it didnt feel like Groundhog Day but one day it wont, Mr. Murphy insisted after the Las Vegas gun rampage left 58 dead and many more wounded last month.Theres no great social change movement in this country that didnt have failures before it had success, he said of his perennial proposal, perennially rejected, for tighter background checks on gun buyers.In the Capitol, no one more clearly epitomizes the Groundhog Day image of dogged persistence in the face of repeated rejection than Senator Dianne Feinstein.The California Democrat responded to the Texas massacre last week (26 dead) by once more introducing her signature proposal to revive the federal ban on rapid-fire assault weapons adapted from the military battlefield.Resolute as Sisyphus, she had helped pioneer and steer to passage a 1994 ban with a 10-year life (the result of a compromise) that the equally dogged National Rifle Association successfully blocked when the time came for renewal.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.Had the earlier ban survived, and her fellow legislators showed the same gumption in the face of the gun lobbys threats, the sorts of military-style, semiautomatic weapons brandished to spray death in Las Vegas and Texas would have been banned.Now shes back again, ignoring Groundhog Day with a passion that was ignited in 1978 when, as president of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, she was the first on the scene when two colleagues Supervisor Harvey Milk and Mayor George Moscone were shot to death by an assassin.Advertisement Continue reading the main story She persists, she explains, so that after every mass shooting with a military-style assault weapon, the American people will know that a tool to reduce these massacres is sitting in the Senate, ready for debate and a vote.Meanwhile, to fool those same people, and dampen public outrage, President Trump and Republican legislators in political hock to the N.R.A.have trotted out familiar political bromides: Isnt this a complex mental health problem?And that awful bump stock gadget that sped up the Las Vegas shooters firing power shouldnt that be banned instead of the weapon itself?Ms. Feinstein, who knows this shell game, already has a bump stock ban in her latest proposal, along with more than 200 different assault weapons now flooding the gun industrys civilian market, plus ammunition magazines of more than 10 rounds.She points out that the rate of mass shootings has grown with the modern markets access to these rapid-fire weapons, more than doubling in the most recent decade to 50 mass shootings and 437 deaths.For lawmakers who would rather praise first responders than confront the real issue, the senator notes that one in five police officers who perished in the line of duty in 2014 was killed by an assault weapon.
The Right Way to Cut Corporate Taxes:::::Then theres Mr. Trumps warmed-over version of trickle-down economics.The White House asserts that businesses will take the money they save on taxes and use it to give workers raises and go on hiring binges.Sounds nice, but theres little empirical evidence for this fairy tale.In fact, there was no such surge in income after Congress slashed the corporate tax rate in the 1980s; nor was there in Britain as it cut its corporate tax rate in recent years.A Shrinking Burden In 50 years, corporate taxes have dropped as a share of gross domestic product.10 PERCENT OF G.D.P.8.4 Income taxes 8 7.3% 6 Payroll taxes 6.1 4.1 4 Corporate taxes 2 1.6 70s 80s 90s 00s 10s 10 PERCENT OF G.D.P.Income taxes 8.4 8 7.3% 6.1 6 Payroll taxes 4.1 4 3.9 Corporate taxes 2 1.6 1967 70s 80s 90s 00s 10s 16 So what would true reform look like?First, it would not blow a $1.7 trillion hole in the budget over the next decade, which is what the House plan would do, according to the Congressional Budget Office.Second, it would make the system fairer and more efficient.If Republicans worked with Democrats, they could reach a compromise to lower the top corporate tax rate to between 25 percent and 28 percent, eliminate loopholes and reduce the incentive businesses have to take on debt, rather than to use equity to expand.Under current law, interest is deductible for tax purposes while dividends are not.Real reform would also include a minimum tax on profits earned abroad by American corporations in the year those profits are earned, minus a credit for taxes paid to other countries.Businesses can now defer taxes on such profits indefinitely, as long as they do not bring the money back to the United States.Big companies like Apple, General Electric and Microsoft have kept an astonishing $2.6 trillion in profits offshore, hoping Congress will lower the tax rate or give them a tax holiday to repatriate the money at ultralow rates.The House bill would let companies bring those profits home at 7 percent (for money invested in hard-to-sell assets) or 14 percent (for cash).A plausible compromise would let businesses repatriate all past profits accumulated overseas at a somewhat discounted rate, say 15 percent to 16 percent.All of this money could be used to rebuild Americas dilapidated infrastructure.While the outlined changes would solve an immediate problem, Congress also needs to consider longer-term obstacles to tax avoidance by multinational companies.One smart idea that deserves more study is a proposal by economists like Kimberly Clausing, a professor at Reed College.She argues that the United States and other countries ought to tax profits that corporations earn from sales inside their borders, similar to the way American states now tax corporate profits.Each country would control its tax rates, deductions and credits.But companies would lose the ability to game the system by booking profits through subsidiaries registered in zero- or low-tax countries like Bermuda and Luxembourg, where they might be making few sales.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.Eventually, Congress will need to do more than just patch the tax system.Even without the Republican tax cut plans, the Congressional Budget Office expects the federal deficit to grow to 5.2 percent of gross domestic product in 2027, up from 3.2 percent in 2016, thanks in part to the Bush tax cuts and the Iraq war.Lawmakers will need to consider new sources of revenue, including a value-added tax, a carbon tax and a financial transactions tax.Each would broaden the tax base and achieve important policy goals, like encouraging savings, reducing greenhouse gas emissions and reducing risks in the financial system.The Republican proposals do none of these things.They do, however, reward the wealthy.Among the worst offenders is the proposed corporate tax cut, which is larger than needed and does nothing to make the system more efficient.The victims here are the economy as a whole and the workers and ordinary folk to whom Mr. Trump promised relief.
Democrats, Dont Be Fooled by Victory:::::Ralph Northam, the Democratic governor-elect, didnt only lose outside of the big metropolitan areas, and badly.He lost by more than the previous Democratic nominee, Gov.Terry McAuliffe, had in 2013.Of Virginias 133 counties and cities, Northam fared worse than McAuliffe in 89 of them.True, Northam did better than Clinton had, but only modestly so, as The Timess Nate Cohn noted.Thats another way of saying that Trumps success with the white working class now looks almost like the norm.Patrick Ruffini, a savvy conservative pollster, made a similar point when analyzing Virginias House of Delegates results.On first glance, those results look fantastic for Democrats.They flipped 15 of the 100 delegate districts, including a few inspiring long-shot wins.Yet only a single one of those 15 districts had voted for Trump.Republicans largely held the Trump districts, which let them keep control (pending recounts), 51 delegates to 49.I know that many progressives are tired of hearing about the white working class.They would rather stop obsessing over small-town America and instead pursue a coalition of minorities and highly educated whites, like the coalition that won Virginia last week.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.But giving up on the white working class would be a terrible mistake.Whites without four-year college degrees make up fully half of the adult population, and they tend to be dispersed, rather than packed in small geographic areas, which increases their political power.Accepting landslide defeats among the white working class effectively forfeits many state legislatures like those in Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Wisconsin, all of which are now Republican.State legislatures dont just make policy.They are also in charge of gerrymandering.Without the white working class, Democrats will need everything else to go spectacularly well to retake the House of Representatives next year.Virginia itself has four Republican-held seats that analysts think will be in play.Northam won only two of those four districts, according to the Virginia Public Access Project.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Or consider the Democrats four special-election House losses earlier this year, including the high-profile Georgia race.All were in Trump-won districts that Democrats couldnt quite flip.How can the party can do better?Its not an easy problem, and I wouldnt trust anyone who claims otherwise.But the crux of the matter is clear enough: Democrats have to get the white working class to focus on the working-class part of their identity rather than the white part.Most voters dont make decisions by doing a cost-benefit analysis of candidates proposals.They instead tend to vote for candidates who instinctively seem to get their lives.Voters are attracted to candidates with whom they can identify.Trumpism focuses people on the white part of identity.The Virginia campaign, for example, revolved around talk of immigrants and old Confederate heroes.When those are the topics, Democrats are going to struggle (however frustrating that may be).But race isnt the only part of peoples identities.When voters instead focus on class, Democrats thrive.Think back to Barack Obamas populist-tinged 2012 re-election campaign.Or look at the senators, like Sherrod Brown and Claire McCaskill, who hold their own outside of metropolitan areas.Or the landslide victories for ballot initiatives on Medicaid and the minimum wage.The best news for Democrats is that they dont turn off many suburban and urban voters by focusing on class.Most of them are struggling with slow-growing wages, too.Again, no one should pretend that finding the perfect message is easy.And no one should pretend that the Democrats have already found it.
Siding With the Enemy:::::It was gross and classic Trumpian deflection: Look everywhere but at the truth.That wont work this time.This kind of turn-the-other-cheek diplomacy depends on American submission and an eventual Russian awakening to the moral failing of their assault, neither of which is going to happen.It depends on Putin having a heart and a guiding sense of morality, both of which are in question.John McCain rightly issued a blistering rebuke of Trump, writing in a statement: Theres nothing America First about taking the word of a K.G.B.colonel over that of the American intelligence community.Theres no principled realism in cooperating with Russia to prop up the murderous Assad regime, which remains the greatest obstacle to a political solution that would bring an end to the bloodshed in Syria.Vladimir Putin does not have Americas interests at heart.To believe otherwise is not only nave but also places our national security at risk.The truth here is that we are seeing in real time how the presidents personal paranoia impedes our national policy and our national interests.The uncomfortable fact here is that Trump is pursuing his own interest, not American interests.And, on the question of Russia attacking our elections, Trump and Putins interest align against the facts and against America.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.That alone is beyond inexcusable.Trump is betraying this country by trying to curry favor with his new comrade.They both have an interest in casting doubt on whether Russia attacked our elections.Putin wants to be seen as innocent and Trump wants to be seen as legitimate, and neither is completely true.Lets say this again, as a clear declaration: Russia attacked our elections.They stole emails that were published and broadcast ad nauseam.They created and distributed propaganda on social media designed to exacerbate our divisions, content that was seen by nearly half the country.Advertisement Continue reading the main story We may never know precisely how all the Russian efforts influenced our elections which of these might have influenced the vote of individuals or conversely turned other voters off of the process altogether so that they just stayed home but saying that it had no effect defies logic and is indeed laughable.We dont know if the Russian election meddling was dispositive, but we know that it was disruptive.Clapper and Brennan shot back at Trump on CNN on Sunday morning, claiming that the president was being played.Clapper said: The threat posed by Russia, as John just said, is manifest and obvious.To try to paint it in any other way is, I think, astounding, and in fact, poses a peril to this country.On Sunday, Trump tried, pathetically, to take back the slap in the face he had delivered to this country and its intelligence agencies, saying of Putin: I believe that he feels that he and Russia did not meddle in the election.As to whether I believe it or not, I am with our agencies, especially as currently constituted with the leadership.Again, like Neo dodging bullets in The Matrix, Trump bends over backward to dodge making this simple, factual statement: Russia attacked our elections when he was elected, and they must pay for their crime so that this never happens again.Trump wont acknowledge the crime because Trump was the beneficiary of the crime.Trump wont insult Russia because it may well be that he was installed by Russia.Trump is as much a Russian project as an American president.This means that he is compromised, in capacity and function, and that means that Trumps fear of dishonor places the rest of us in danger of future attacks and exploitation.Trump is Putins dupe.
Paradise Papers Show How Misguided the G.O.P. Is on Taxes:::::We worry a lot about the cost of social programs in this country, saying we simply cant afford many things that we know could bring big rewards.But that missing $70 billion from corporate offshore tax avoidance would go a long way.A mere $140 million could replace the lead water pipes poisoning children in Flint, Mich.It would cost just an estimated $22.5 billion to end homelessness by providing all needy families with rental assistance.President Barack Obama asked Congress for $75 billion for his initial universal preschool plan; universal preschool for all 3- and 4-year-olds would cost $98.4 billion over 10 years.Senator Bernie Sanderss College for All Act doesnt even require the federal government to cover the entire $70 billion cost of public college tuition, but it could if this money were available to the government.Divvying up $70 billion a year to each parent in the country would be a huge step toward ending childhood poverty.And the available pot of money, were offshore tax avoidance not an option, would be even larger if rich individuals were taxed at the rates we all face here at home.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.Yet even in the face of the Paradise Papers revelations, Republicans want to lower taxes on big corporations and rich individuals even further.Businesses and the wealthy, the Republicans argument goes, will bring their money back to our shores and pay taxes on it if rates are lower.But there are few mechanisms included in their tax package that would actually push either group to do so, rather than keep it abroad and away from taxation.The House package included a new tax on intellectual property royalties multinational corporations pay to offshore affiliates in an effort, the writers say, to keep them from moving money to tax shelters.But, after an outcry from those multinationals, an amendment was added on Monday that weakens its impact such that its worth 95 percent less.Senate Republicans, meanwhile, havent included it in their version of the legislation.The House package also calls for a one-time tax of 7 percent and 14 percent on offshore earnings that have been stockpiled abroad, and an effective 10 percent rate on high returns to a parent company headquartered in this country from foreign subsidiaries, both efforts to supposedly keep multinationals from avoiding taxes.The Senate version proposes even lower rates on offshore earnings.Those rates are far lower than the 20 percent rate Republicans want to levy on corporate profits and a huge drop from the current rate of 35 percent leaving an incentive to keep money elsewhere.The House plan shifts the country to a territorial tax system, in which companies would owe taxes only on money they make here.Money generated abroad in foreign subsidiaries would be subject to the taxes of that country, so theyd have even more incentive to keep it in the low-tax places the Paradise Papers show theyve already been using.Advertisement Continue reading the main story None of these provisions go after wealthy individuals who keep their money in offshore accounts to avoid paying taxes.Instead, the House package hands these same people a variety of giveaways: an enormous loophole via a lower tax rate on pass-through businesses; the elimination of the alternative minimum tax that ensures they have to pay at least something; and the eradication of the tax on the wealthiest estates.The groups that are already dodging taxes through offshore accounting are the ones that make out with the biggest benefits.According to an analysis by the conservative Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, $1 trillion of the overall $1.5 trillion cost is from cuts for businesses.According to the Tax Policy Center, the highest-income families can expect the biggest reward.The richest 0.1 percent of Americans will get an average $278,370 reduction in their tax bill by 2027, while the poorest two-fifths of the country get around $25.The Republican tax plan would shift more of the tax burden onto those who can least afford to shoulder it and relieve those who are already starving the government of tax revenue.The Paradise Papers shine yet another spotlight on how the rich and powerful game the system to avoid paying what they would otherwise owe.The rest of us suffer for it.Why hand them even more favors?
Steve Jurvetson Quits Venture Capital Firm Amid Investigation:::::Steve Jurvetson, a founding partner of one of the best-known venture capital firms in Silicon Valley and a board member of Tesla and SpaceX, is leaving the firm after it began an investigation into his behavior with women, the firm told investors on Monday.As of today and by mutual agreement, Steve Jurvetson will be leaving DFJ, said a confidential letter sent to investors in the venture capital firm, Draper Fisher Jurvetson, and obtained by The New York Times.It continued, DFJs culture has been, and will continue to be, built on the values of respect and integrity in all of our interactions.The firms spokeswoman, Carol Wentworth, confirmed his departure, and a Tesla spokeswoman said he is taking a leave of absence from the Tesla and SpaceX boards pending resolution of these allegations.Last month, the firm said it became aware of indirect and secondhand allegations about Mr. Jurvetson and was looking into them.The acknowledgment came after Keri Kukral, a tech entrepreneur, wrote on Facebook: Women approached by a founding partner of Draper Fisher Jurvetson should be careful.Predatory behavior is rampant.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Heidi Roizen, an operating partner at DFJ, defended the firm last month.I dont need an investigation to state with certainty that this is patently wrong, she wrote in a Tumblr post.She added that the firm had never received an official allegation of misconduct.
What Red States Are Passing Up as Blue States Get Billions:::::Some state governments and local think tanks have prepared estimates of the costs and benefits of Medicaid expansion in their region.But the Avalere analysis is the first to apply a consistent methodology across all of the states that have declined to expand.Some of the numbers are big.Florida would get an estimated $26 billion over the next decade, according to Avalere; North Carolina $13 billion.The Medicaid expansion has been the subject of substantial scholarly attention.Strong evidence suggests states expansion has helped improve the financial health of their low-income residents, as well as the financial performance of local hospitals.Studies also show that Medicaid coverage has helped low-income Americans get access to health care, though there is not yet strong evidence about whether it has improved their physical health.Research has found that the Medicaid expansion does not appear to discourage low-income people from working.More speculative articles have suggested that the influx of federal dollars may help strengthen state economies, though there is little hard evidence of such effects.Governors in expansion states have argued that the money has been particularly helpful in helping residents battle addictions to opioids.A recent study found that, in the early years of the expansion, there were no hidden costs to state budgets and that states spent no more on their programs than states that declined to expand.In some states, it appears that expansion has improved state finances, by reducing the need for programs that pay doctors and hospitals directly for uncompensated care, among other ancillary effects.There is evidence that Medicaid expansion has lowered insurance premiums for middle-class residents who buy their own insurance.Some states are likelier to come out ahead than others.Benjamin Sommers, an associate professor at the Harvard School of Public Health who studies Medicaid, said Wisconsin, for example, might actually save money over all if it accepted federal expansion dollars.But legislators and governors in the holdout states have consistently opposed the expansion, citing a range of political, ideological and fiscal concerns.One big issue, experts say, is the expansions link to Obamacare, a law that Republicans have vowed to repeal from the beginning.Its made it very hard for them to turn around and embrace one of the only optional parts of it, said Matt Salo, the executive director of the National Association of Medicaid Directors, who has closely watched the debate.There is ample evidence from the states that have done it that there is substantial benefit.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Some state officials also object to a program that provides benefits to poor residents who dont work.Studies have shown that the large majority of expansion beneficiaries are working, in school or caring for a sick family member.But the Trump administration has signaled that it will allow states to condition coverage on community engagement activities, a policy change that could interest some reluctant politicians.But States Would Have to Raise Money to Pay Their Share Projected state spending required to accept federal Medicaid money, as a percentage of each states 2016 general fund Tennessee Missouri Maine Utah

0.40 0.38 0.37 0.30 0.27 For some states, finding 10 percent of the dollars may be a challenge.David Dzielak, the Medicaid director in Mississippi, a state that has not expanded, said raising even a small fraction of the funding would be hard, especially after recent corporate tax cuts.The Avalere numbers suggest that the 6 percent of Medicaid expansion costs that Mississippi would need to pay if it expanded next year would represent less than 1 percent of its 2016 general fund spending.Its all about the money, really, and our state is so poor that we cant even afford the 10 percent for the expansion, he said.Thats really the bottom line.But not every state that has expanded its program has been wealthy, and some of those have been red states.Louisiana, for example, expanded Medicaid last year, providing health coverage to around 430,000 people, despite limited fiscal capacity and state budget challenges.Some of the largest coverage gains have come in poorer states, including West Virginia, Arkansas and Kentucky.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Sara Rosenbaum, a professor of health policy at George Washington University, said states generally fight to maximize federal funding for their programs.She described Medicaid expansion as a striking counterexample, where political preferences have sometimes outweighed the desire for resources.Its so much revenue, she said.Thats when you know were not dealing with dollars and cents.Medicaid expansion states could keep growing.Voters in Maine last week approved a ballot measure to expand Medicaid.And recent legislative gains by Democrats in Virginia could change the politics of the issue there.Activists in other states, including Kansas, Utah and Idaho, are mobilizing for a renewed expansion push in the coming year.*** The Avalere estimates are rough, but they show what would happen if each states expansion resulted in a decrease in the uninsured rate among low-income residents that is similar to the average decrease in states that have already expanded their programs.The model then made adjustments for the size of the poor, uninsured population, and the different costs of providing Medicaid care in different states.In the states that have expanded already, there has been a wide range of effects.The uninsured rate among the eligible population declined by only half a percentage point in Massachusetts, which already had very broad insurance coverage.But it declined by more than six percentage points in Louisiana, where there were many more poor residents who lacked coverage.The average reduction was 2.5 percentage points.Most of the states that havent expanded are likely to reap more federal dollars than these estimates if they expand, said Mr. Sloan, but analysts felt the average number was a useful, conservative estimate.(That means that our figures may also understate the amount of money that states would need to spend, too.)Our budget numbers are for the fiscal year 2016, and come from a recent survey from the National Association of State Budget Officers.In evaluating the budget impact of the federal share of Medicaid expansion, we compared estimated federal spending with total state budgets, including current federal dollars.In evaluating the state share of the expansion funding, we compared the numbers to state general funds, to give a sense of how the program would compare with functions that the state raises its own funds to cover.State budgets typically grow by around 3 or 4 percent a year, said John Hicks, the associations executive director, so our percentages may slightly overstate Medicaid expansion funding as a share of state budgets.
Kept in the Dark About Doctors, but Having to Pick a Health Plan:::::Advertisement The New Health Care Kept in the Dark About Doctors, but Having to Pick a Health Plan Its open enrollment season for Affordable Care Act marketplace plans, Medicare Advantage plans and many employer-sponsored plans as well.Lots of evidence suggests you should shop around , and shop carefully , though this is harder than it sounds.When you select a health care plan, you probably consider premiums, and maybe you check deductibles and other cost sharing.But you cant easily scrutinize the plans networks and the quality of the doctors in them.Thats too bad, because you may be missing something important.Many health insurance options offered by employers or sold on the Obamacare marketplace come with narrower networks covering treatment from a limited slate of doctors and hospitals.(Though theres no official definition of a narrow network, many studies classify networks as narrow when they include less than about 30 percent of doctors or hospitals in the area.)Narrow network plans are cheaper , and insurers say they try to maintain quality as they narrow the choices they cover.Some appear to succeed, but some dont, and thats hard to fully assess before you sign up.Its virtually impossible to thoroughly check the quality of doctors in each insurance plan.A typical plan, even a narrow one, may have a network of hundreds or thousands of physicians.It is a potentially simpler task just to know if youre enrolling in a narrow or broad network plan.But in a study of Obamacare enrollees, for example, as many as 40 percent didnt know this information, either.That confusion is understandable.A study of 2016 marketplace offerings in 13 states found that only two provided indications of network size.Eight of them, as well as HealthCare.gov , provided a way to look up whether a doctor was in a plans network, but only two could filter plans to show only those with providers a consumer selects.To our surprise, we also found that few marketplaces could indicate which hospitals were in plans networks, said Charlene Wong, a pediatrician and researcher at the Margolis Center for Health Policy at Duke University and lead author of the study.In addition, none of these tools indicated network breadth by specialty.This means that a broad network plan might actually be quite narrow for some specialists, without consumers knowing.Image Pamphlets advertising the Affordable Care Act in the Mall of Americas in Miami.The open enrollment period runs until Dec. 15. Credit Joe Raedle/Getty Images A crop of new studies shows some of the specialties for which networks are likelier to be narrow, and suggests that what consumers dont know might hurt them.Researchers at the University of Pennsylvania found that plans with more narrow networks systematically excluded oncologists affiliated with higher-quality cancer centers.In part, this is how the plans offer lower premiums, because higher-quality cancer centers may demand higher payments.But its pretty likely consumers dont know that they may be trading quality for price.Unless you already have cancer, its pretty unlikely youll check the quality of oncologists covered by health plans when making an enrollment decision, said Daniel Polsky, a health economist with the University of Pennsylvania and a co-author of the study.Another study by Mr. Polsky and colleagues, published in Health Affairs, found that many marketplace plans offer relatively few choices of mental health care professionals.Even plans with wide primary care networks can have narrow mental health ones, the study found.Though only 39 percent of plans had very narrow networks of primary care physicians covering less than 10 percent of those in their markets 57 percent of plans had very narrow networks of psychiatrists.Marketplace plans also tend to be narrower for pediatric specialists than for adult specialists, according to other work by Dr. Wong and Mr. Polsky.And parents might have no idea until a child is ill. A beneficiary needing more specialized care may only then discover the less attractive features of their health plan, Mr. Polsky said.The priority should be improved provider network transparency at the time a plan is purchased.Scrutinizing the extent and quality of a plan is daunting.To find out which doctors are covered by a plan, you could consult its provider directory.But such directories are known to be error prone listing physicians not in networks or failing to list those who are.Ideally, marketplaces would provide a sense of the breadth of a plans network.The marketplaces could directly provide metrics for how many doctors are covered, by specialty and by reasonable distance from your house, for example.First steps toward doing so have been planned but have yet to be widely adopted.Assessing hospital quality with online tools is also something consumers can do, but it takes effort, particularly if comparing networks of hospitals across plans.There are fewer ways to assess physician quality, but some sites like Yelp and RateMDs.com may be worth a look.None of these tools are integrated into websites that consumers use to shop for marketplace or Medicare Advantage plans, however.And these resources cant overcome another challenge some people face a lack of access to broad network plans.Health insurance markets are local, and a recent Health Affairs study found that Hispanic Americans, for example, live in areas with plans less likely to have very broad networks.What can be done?Insurers that wish to offer narrow network plans could be required to also offer broad network ones.This would provide a fuller menu of options to more consumers.Additionally, online marketplaces could start to provide much clearer indications of the extent and quality of doctors included in plans networks, not just over all but by specialty.Consumers still may not avail themselves of the information, but at least it would be more readily accessible.Austin Frakt is director of the Partnered Evidence-Based Policy Resource Center at the V.A.Boston Healthcare System; associate professor with Boston Universitys School of Public Health; and adjunct associate professor with the Harvard T.H.Chan School of Public Health.He blogs at The Incidental Economist, and you can follow him on Twitter at @afrakt.The Upshot provides news, analysis and graphics about politics, policy and everyday life.Follow us on Facebook and Twitter.Sign up for our newsletter.Related Coverage Why Consumers Often Err in Choosing Health Plans Sign up for The Upshot Newsletter Get the best of The Upshots news, analysis and graphics about politics, policy and everyday life.SEE SAMPLE Please verify youre not a robot by clicking the box.* Required field You agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for The New York Times products and services.You are already subscribed to this email.Sign Up

Its Not Nearly as Scary as It Seems:::::Lets stipulate that there may be a correlation between light or moderate drinking and some cancers.We still dont know if the relationship is causal, but lets accept that theres at least an association.For breast cancer which is the cancer that seems to be garnering the most headlines light drinking was associated with a relative risk of 1.04 in the announcement.Relative risk refers to the percentage change in ones absolute (overall) risk as a result of some change in behavior.(And 1.04 is a 4 percent change from 1.0, which represents a baseline of no difference in risk between an experimental group and a control group.)A 40-year-old woman has an absolute risk of 1.45 percent of developing breast cancer in the next 10 years.This announcement would argue that if shes a light drinker, that risk would become 1.51 percent.This is an absolute risk increase of 0.06 percent.Using whats known as the Number Needed to Harm, this could be interpreted such that if 1,667 40-year-old women became light drinkers, one additional person might develop breast cancer.The other 1,666 would see no difference.Of course, moderate or heavy drinking might increase the risks further.The absolute risks for that 40-year-old would go to 1.78 percent from 1.45 percent for the moderate drinker, and to 2.33 percent for the heavy drinker.Those numbers are still not that scary.But maybe any increase in risk is too much for you.Thats fine.If youre one of those people, though, you have to acknowledge that you cant look at any one cancer in a vacuum.A person can get almost any cancer.The large meta-analysis upon which this announcement was based looked at 23 types of cancer with respect to alcohol consumption.It found a harmful relationship between three of them and light drinking.But it also found protective relationships meaning a decreased risk of cancer between six of them and light drinking.Im not arguing that you should engage in light drinking to avoid those six cancers.Im merely pointing out that cherry-picking allows you to come to different conclusions.With respect to moderate drinking, there were harmful relationships with seven cancers and protective relationships with three.The announcement focused on the former, not the latter.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.A 2013 meta-analysis in the Annals of Oncology that looked at all cancers found that, over all, light drinking was protective; moderate drinking had no effect; and heavy drinking was detrimental.Its even cherry-picking to focus only on cancer, though.A person can get any number of diseases, and this fact makes the dangers of light and moderate drinking even muddier.Advertisement Continue reading the main story If you accept the methodology of case-control and cohort studies, from which many of the links between alcohol and cancer arise, you have to accept the results of similar studies of other diseases.For instance, a cohort study of about 6,000 people found that those who drank at least once a week had better cognitive function in middle age than those who didnt.A 2004 systematic review found that moderate drinkers had lower rates of diabetes (up to 56 percent lower, although thats a relative risk reduction).Randomized controlled trials of alcohol (they do exist) show that light to moderate drinking can lead to a reduction in risk factors for heart disease, diabetes and stroke.These protective factors may be greater than all the other negative risk factors (even cancer) that might be associated with light or moderate drinking.More women die in the United States of heart disease than cancer.So do more men.Moreover, dire warnings have consequences.I know far too many people who now throw up their hands at every news story because it seems as if everything causes cancer.These stories rarely acknowledge an alternative point of view.The absolute risks of light and moderate drinking are small, while many people derive pleasure from the occasional cocktail or glass of wine.Its perfectly reasonable even if a risk exists and the overall risk is debatable to decide that the quality of life gained from that drink is greater than the potential harms it entails.This is true for many, many foods, not just alcohol.What can we do about this?We could make simple changes to have a better understanding of risk so that each new proclamation doesnt send us into a tizzy: 1) Consider the absolute risks.A 30 percent increase in risk sounds scary, but an increase from 1 percent to 1.3 percent absolute risk does not, though these are the same things.Likewise, we should be more concerned about a 5 percent risk increase to 21 percent from 20 percent than about a 30 percent increase to 1.3 percent from 1 percent.2) Dont give too much weight to observational data.This is especially true when causal data are available.3) Dont focus on any one disease while ignoring others.Something may be harmful regarding one disease while beneficial regarding another.4) Dont cherry-pick.That is, dont focus only on some studies, or only on some results.Review all the evidence for the most holistic picture possible.5) Acknowledge the harms, as well as the benefits, of recommendations.Consider both cost and joy.These rules may not make for exciting headlines.They may, however, lead to happier, and perhaps healthier, lives.
The Unsung Role That Ordinary Citizens Played in the Great Crime Decline:::::This long-term trend has fundamentally altered city life.It has transformed fear-inducing parks and subways into vibrant public spaces.It has lured wealthier whites back into cities.It has raised the life expectancies of black men.And even in an age of widening urban inequality, it has meant that the daily lives of the most disadvantaged are less dangerous now than they were a generation ago.These poor neighborhoods, Mr. Sharkey has found, have been the greatest beneficiaries of this tectonic change in safety.The same communities were participating in another big shift that started in the 1990s: The number of nonprofits began to rise sharply across the country, particularly those addressing neighborhood and youth development.Mr. Sharkey and the doctoral students Gerard Torrats-Espinosa and Delaram Takyar used data from the National Center for Charitable Statistics to track the rise of nonprofits in 264 cities across more than 20 years.Nonprofits were more likely to form in the communities with the gravest problems.But they also sprang up for reasons that had little to do with local crime trends, such as an expansion in philanthropic funding.A spike in nonprofits addressing subjects like the arts and medical research occurred in this same era.Comparing the growth of other kinds of nonprofits, the researchers believe they were able to identify the causal effect of these community groups: Every 10 additional organizations in a city with 100,000 residents, they estimate, led to a 9 percent drop in the murder rate and a 6 percent drop in violent crime.In a criminology field that has produced some eyebrow-raising ideas, this one is actually not so surprising.That national finding echoes local studies of some individual programs, like one run by the Pennsylvania Horticultural Society that converts abandoned lots into green spaces and that has been linked in Philadelphia to reduced gun violence.The research also affirms some of the tenets of community policing: that neighborhoods are vital to policing themselves, and that they can address the complex roots of violence in ways that fall beyond traditional police work.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Its absolutely consistent with what I would argue is probably the prevalent theory of policing among the major cities today, Richard Myers, the executive director of the Major Cities Chiefs Association, said of the new research.Local organizations also say Mr. Sharkeys results validate what they have already witnessed.Any time peoples basic needs are met, violence goes down thats not new, said Noreen McClendon, who directs the nonprofit Concerned Citizens of South Central Los Angeles.The group, led by Ms. McClendons mother for many years, was formed in the 1980s to fight a proposed waste incinerator in the neighborhood.It evolved in the 1990s to address many of the neighborhoods other challenges.The group created dozens of block clubs to care for individual streets.It cleaned alleys and repaired potholes, and hired local ex-offenders to do that work.It established a credit union, sponsored a jazz festival and developed hundreds of units of affordable housing.Photo During a time of major disinvestment in cities, and severe cuts in federal support for urban programs, residents of the neighborhood believed no one else was coming to help.Nobody, Ms. McClendon said.And if the group had not done this work itself?There would have been a lot more death, she said, between violence amongst people, violence from police brutality, just drugs.Many similar groups did not explicitly think of what they were doing as violence prevention.But in creating playgrounds, they enabled parents to better monitor their children.In connecting neighbors, they improved the capacity of residents to control their streets.In forming after-school programs, they offered alternatives to crime.In the East Lake neighborhood of Atlanta, the crime rate in the mid 1990s was 18 times the national average.The drug market in the neighborhood was estimated to be doing $35 million in business a year.There hadnt been a new building permit issued in the neighborhood in nearly three decades, a sign of how little anyone had invested in the community other than to buy drugs there.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Then the newly formed East Lake Foundation developed new mixed-income housing to replace a decaying public housing project.It started a golf program for neighborhood children on a nearby but long-deteriorating golf course.The foundation eventually opened a charter school, where the first class of seniors had a 100 percent graduation rate in May.We knew we wanted to see violence and crime go down in the community, said Carol Naughton, who led the foundation for years and today is the president of a national group, Purpose Built Communities, that is trying to teach East Lakes model in other cities.But weve never had a crime-prevention program.Today violent crime in East Lake is down 90 percent from 1995.But Ms. Naughton is momentarily perplexed by the question of whether she believes groups like hers have gotten enough credit for contributing to that outcome.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Were not part of the crime-reduction world, or the public safety world, in the same way that were part of the health and education and housing world, she said.It never occurred to us that were not getting the credit, because we dont even know that world is out there.The lesson in that response, and in Mr. Sharkeys work that effective crime prevention doesnt necessarily look like stop-and-frisk, or hot-spot policing, or mass incarceration is particularly relevant today as cities rethink policing.A lot of these communities were in despair because they needed resources, said Robert Sampson, a sociologist at Harvard who has studied Chicago neighborhoods damaged by violence.And what did they get?Well, they mainly got crime control.They got increases in incarceration.Those tactics may have contributed to the decline in crime as well.But theyve come with costs that have become clearer over time, in antagonizing communities and disrupting families.Mr. Sharkey is pointing to one possible solution with less evident downsides.And hes suggesting that communities can effectively take on the very roles that the police say have strained them as theyve increasingly been asked to perform jobs they werent trained for, as guidance counselors or marriage therapists or substance-abuse experts.They are taking that burden away from the police that probably never should have been there, but by default has kind of landed there, said Mr. Myers of the chiefs association, who is also a former longtime police chief himself, in Michigan, Virginia, Colorado and elsewhere.As Mr. Sharkey publishes his findings, crime rates are now diverging after a generation in which violence fell reliably year after year nearly everywhere.Its not clear yet whether the great crime decline he writes about will continue.But he argues that its time for a new model of violence prevention, one that relies more heavily on the kind of work that these community groups have been quietly doing than on the aggressive police tactics and tough sentencing that the Trump administration now advocates.The model that weve relied on to control violence for a long time has broken down, Mr. Sharkey said.If communities want police to step back, he is pointing to some of the people who can step in.This gives us a model.It gives us another set of actors who can play a larger role.
Democrats Cheer, but They May Have to Do Better in 18:::::All of the conditions for a 2018 wave are in place.The presidents approval rating is stuck in the mid-to-high 30s.The Democrats hold nearly a double-digit lead on the generic congressional ballot.The presidents party nearly always struggles in midterm elections.These conditions have been in place all year.They just havent yielded Democratic victories until now because the high-profile races have been fought in reliably Republican areas districts that voted for either Mr. Trump or Mitt Romney by at least 15 points.But Virginia voted for Hillary Clinton by five points in 2016, and it backed Barack Obama twice as well.New Jersey, Washington States 45th Senate district, New Yorks Westchester and Nassau Counties and Maine are generally even more Democratic-leaning.The big surprise of the night was the huge Democratic surge in Virginias House of Delegates, but that also came in Clinton Country.Of the 16 districts where Democrats currently lead in Virginia, Mrs. Clinton won 15 of them and received 49.7 percent of the vote in the other, according to data from the Virginia Public Access Project and Daily Kos Elections.Twelve of those 15 districts voted for Mrs. Clinton by at least five points.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Just because Tuesdays victories came in states or districts won by Mrs. Clinton doesnt mean they can be dismissed, however.College-educated white voters, paired with nonwhite voters, could profoundly endanger the G.O.P.in traditionally Republican, upscale districts.Up until the polls closed in Virginia, it was reasonable to suppose that Mrs. Clintons performance represented something of a ceiling for Democrats in well-educated areas.It would be easy, the theory went, for Republican voters to distinguish their longtime Republican representatives from Mr. Trump.Jon Ossoffs failure to outdo Mrs. Clinton in Georgias Sixth Congressional District seemed fully consistent with that possibility.But well-educated voters in Virginia didnt appear to make any distinction between Mr. Trump and their incumbent representatives.Ed Gillespie, who was thought to have run a pretty strong campaign for governor against Ralph S. Northam, wound up running well behind Mr. Trump in many well-educated suburbs, a possibility that few imagined heading into the contest.The catch, though, is that the overwhelming Democratic strength in well-educated areas did not cross the political divides of the 2016 election and reach into white working-class areas.In fact, Mr. Northam, a Virginia Military Institute graduate with a strong Southern pedigree, didnt even come close to matching Gov.Terry McAuliffe, Mr. Obama or Senator Tim Kaine in rural western Virginia.Democratic State Assembly candidates didnt run well ahead of Mrs. Clinton, either.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Yes, the political divisions of the 2016 presidential election wound up working pretty well for Democrats in Virginia, a highly educated state.But that might not be the case for Democrats in a lot of the rest of the country.There are only 11 Republican-held congressional districts in the United States where Mrs. Clinton won by five points or more.Even if Democrats swept those 11 districts, it wouldnt get them that far toward the 24 seats they need to flip the House.To my surprise, its not obvious that a rerun of the Virginia House of Delegates election on a national scale would yield Democratic control of the House.Without greater strength in areas that supported Mr. Trump, it would still be a tossup.The good news for Democrats is that they did run well ahead of Mrs. Clinton in white working-class areas during this springs special congressional elections.And on Tuesday, Mr. Northam ran ahead of her in some of those areas, too, even if he landed short of prior Democratic benchmarks.The big question in 2018 might prove to be whether Democrats can have it all: Will it be possible to combine a Virginia-like near sweep of Republicans in Clinton districts with a broad Democratic overperformance in white working-class districts?If they can do both, they will be favored to retake the House.One or the other would probably make the fight for House control a tossup.The fact that theyve done both at various points this year might be an early clue.
After a Tough 2016, Many Pollsters Havent Changed Anything:::::Nearly all of the private pollsters interviewed for this article have, at minimum, begun to do something about education.There is widespread agreement that the industry failed to properly represent less educated white voters, and that this was part of why last years polls were too favorable to Democrats.Its likely to remain a big issue, at least as long as white voters split so decisively on educational lines.The postelection report of the American Association for Public Opinion Research, the nations leading polling association, reached a similar conclusion.One possible fix is to weight by education, which would give more or less weight to certain respondents to ensure that less educated voters represent the appropriate share of the polls final estimate.For many public polls, weighting by education would make a big difference.It could move an otherwise lightly weighted poll by as much as four percentage points toward the Republicans in the Virginia governors race, for example, based on an analysis of the most recent Upshot/Siena College poll.With the Democrat, Ralph Northam, holding a modest lead in most polls, the difference could be enough to flip several surveys in the state.Education Can Make a Big Difference How the Upshot/Siena College poll of Virginia might have gone if it followed three common public polling methods and used weights for: The race, gender and age of registered voters, with a likely voter screen The race, gender, age, region and party primary history of the likely electorate, using only those who vote regularly The race, gender, age, region and party primary history of the likely electorate The Upshot/Siena College methodology without education with education +7 Dem.+2 without education with education +8 Dem.+5 without education with education +5 Dem.+4 with education +3 Dem.The race, gender and age of registered voters, with a likely voter screen The race, gender, age, region and party primary history of the likely electorate, using only those who vote regularly The race, gender, age, region and party primary history of the likely electorate The Upshot/Siena College methodology without education with education +7 Dem.+2 without education with education +8 Dem.+5 without education with education +5 Dem.+4 with education +3 Dem.There are a few pollsters in Virginia like The Washington Post and Quinnipiac that do weight by education, and did so before the 2016 presidential election.Most others werent weighting by education before 2016 and arent weighting by it today.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The disparity can be extreme.Sixty-six percent of likely voters were listed as college graduates in the latest Christopher Newport University survey of Virginia, well above the range of 49 percent to 52 percent in Upshot estimates.Mr. Northam led by six points in the Christopher Newport University poll.A Gravis poll, which showed Mr. Northam ahead by five points, had four-year college graduates at 60 percent of the electorate.A tied Roanoke poll had the college-educated share of the electorate at 57 percent.The relative lack of change among public pollsters doesnt mean that the pre-election polls in Virginia or elsewhere are doomed to miss by as much as they did in 2016.By most accounts, the 2016 polling error took a perfect storm: Just about everything that could break Mr. Trumps way appears to have done so.Next time, it could be the Democrats who beat turnout expectations and sway undecided voters.Theres also no guarantee that the stark educational divide of the 2016 presidential election will be as prominent without Mr. Trump on the ballot, or as important with midterm voters, who tend to be more educated.But the lack of change hints at a bleak possibility: a mismatch between the scale of the challenge facing the survey research industry and the capacity of many individual public pollsters to respond.Education Is a Mystery It might seem obvious that the 2016 election would drive public pollsters to adopt big changes.But many individual public pollsters were reasonably satisfied by their results, even though the industry as a whole seemed to get it wrong.Its not completely unreasonable.Last years polling error was an odd one.It was almost perfectly distributed across the battleground states to maximize the electoral consequences.There were large errors in a small number of states where Mrs. Clinton had a big lead, like Wisconsin and Michigan.But elsewhere the errors were more typical, or even nonexistent.Virginia is one such state: Mrs. Clinton led by five or six points in all the final polling averages; in the end, she won by 5.3 points.If pollsters didnt take any surveys in the Midwest, most or all of their results were probably in the margin of error.Their result might have leaned toward Mrs. Clinton, like everyone elses, but they could explain that away: There is a lot of evidence that undecided voters broke toward Mr. Trump.And most public pollsters didnt conduct enough polls, late enough in the race, to be sure of just how well or poorly they really did.Some pollsters did take enough surveys late enough in the race to merit a re-examination, but they didnt think education was decisive.Patrick Murphy of Monmouth University, for instance, found that weighting by education would have explained only one percentage point of bias in his surveys.But perhaps the bigger issue is that education is a mystery: Its hard for pollsters to even know if theyre getting it wrong, let alone to fix it.Advertisement Continue reading the main story I dont weight to education because its pretty hard to find accurate benchmarks for a likely-voter profile based on education, said Matthew Towery of Opinion Savvy, a firm that often conducts state polls using automated calls.Thats not something thats necessarily easily ascertained most of the time.Hes right.Its not easy to weight by education, and its especially tough for pollsters who rely on voter registration files the big data that powers most campaigning polling and analytics.Many pollsters use voter file data, rather than dialing telephone numbers at random (known as random digit dialing, or R.D.D.), to conduct their surveys and estimate the composition of the electorate.Voter files offer pollsters rich demographic and political data to help them weight their survey and estimate the likely electorate.R.D.D.surveys have their own advantages, but the loss of this data is a considerable disadvantage, especially in a low-turnout election.Unsurprisingly, the Virginia polls that at least partly use R.D.D.have occasionally produced somewhat outlying results.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.But the voter file has a weakness: Education is not reliably included on public voter files.To weight by education, pollsters using the voter file have to look elsewhere something pollsters who trust the voter file are generally reluctant to do.Not coincidentally, only two of the nonpartisan Virginia pollsters using a voter file appear to weight by education; all but one of the pollsters using random digit dialing in Virginia do, most likely using the census.Whats the alternative?A pollster could ask voters how much education they have in order to match estimates for the likely electorate from some other source, but there isnt a definitive benchmark for weighting.There still isnt universal agreement about how many voters in 2016 had a college degree: Theres a wide 10-point gap between the exit poll results and the census postelection survey.The combination of the uncertainty around the true educational composition of the electorate and the reluctance to weight voter-file surveys by self-reported measures has been enough to deter many public-voter-file-based surveys from weighting by education.These same factors pose a challenge to private partisan pollsters.But the pace of change among them has nonetheless been far greater.All but one of the 10 private partisan pollsters interviewed for this article have begun to do something about education, whether by weighting or by other means.This is the first time ever that Ive weighted education, getting ready for some elections in 2018, said Glen Bolger, a pollster for Public Opinion Strategies, a prominent Republican polling firm, because education is a pretty damn good predictor.Advertisement Continue reading the main story For private pollsters, there is a lot more acceptance of the problem and more acceptance that they just got it wrong, especially on the Democratic side.The big private polling firms conducted more than enough surveys, in enough states, late enough in the race, to have no illusions about whether their results were meaningfully biased.Some of them were already doing something about it before the election, but now theyre generally doing more.Theres still uncertainty about the exact way to do it, but most private pollsters are persuaded by the necessity of change uncertainty is no longer an excuse to do nothing.Its kind of a cop-out, said Anna Greenberg, a Democratic pollster at Greenberg Quinlan Rosner Research.You cant say I cant deal with education because I dont know the exact weight of it.You wouldnt not weight on race because you couldnt figure it out.Is It Enough?The debate among private pollsters, especially on the Democratic side, has instead advanced to a different stage: whether weighting by education is enough.The cause for debate is simple.Even weighting by education wouldnt have been enough to give Mr. Trump the polling edge.One possibility, often advanced by more traditional firms, is that the residual error could be explained by turnout or shifts among undecided voters.But theres a more ominous possibility.It wasnt just that polls didnt capture enough less educated white voters; it was also that they didnt get the right less educated white voters.Perhaps the polls missed less educated voters in the most rural areas.Maybe they missed those who dont work in office jobs, in old-economy sectors like manufacturing or agriculture.Or maybe they missed voters with low levels of social trust or a lower propensity to volunteer, who have long been less likely to respond to surveys and may have been more likely to support Mr. Trump in 2016.If true, the problem is a lot more difficult to solve.Weighting by education would not be an adequate remedy, since baristas arent exchangeable with factory workers, as David Shor of Civis Analytics puts it.Civis is the Democratic firm that has probably been the most vocal about the possibility that the polling industry suffers from bigger nonresponse challenges than can be fixed by weighting by education.The possibility of a deeper kind of nonresponse bias is now broadly held in the Democratic analytics world, but its nowhere near a consensus across the polling industry.Thats in part because theres limited public evidence to support it at this stage.Its also because many traditional pollsters are skeptical of analytics firms with an economic incentive to argue that traditional polling is broken or even impossible.But traditional pollsters mentioned some of these issues as well.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Research in this area seems poised to continue for the foreseeable future.But most of these efforts are occurring out of the view of public polling firms.If something is more profoundly wrong with public polling than weighting by education alone can address, its hard to see how many public polling firms will be able to do anything about it.
Upshot/Siena Poll Gives Democrat Narrow Lead in Virginia Governors Race:::::The poll asked respondents how they voted in last years presidential race, and there was a consistent pattern across demographic groups and geography.The governors race, although reminiscent of 2016, hasnt quite polarized voters to the same extent.White working-class voters said they backed Mr. Trump by a 48-point margin, 67 percent to 19 percent, somewhat wider than Mr. Gillespies 40-point edge.Mr. Northam holds a 26-point lead among voters from Northern Virginia; voters from that area said they backed Mrs. Clinton by 31 points.Its a pattern up and down the ballot.The pattern has also been fairly common beyond Virginia this year.In special congressional elections, Republicans have fallen far short of Mr. Trumps strong showing in white working-class areas, while Democrats have struggled to exceed Mrs. Clintons showing in the areas where she excelled, like Georgias Sixth Congressional District.But the Virginia contest seems to have a distinct dynamic.Mr. Gillespie, with establishment roots as a former chairman of the Republican National Committee, has run a campaign plainly intended to rally Mr. Trumps supporters, making the question of whether he can approach Mr. Trumps strong tallies somewhat more interesting.If Mr. Gillespie prevails or runs well ahead of Mr. Trump, it might be interpreted as a sign that establishment Republicans can excel by embracing Mr. Trumps message.According to this view, they could lure white working-class Trump supporters with his message on race and immigration, while maintaining greater support among well-educated voters with their establishment-friendly credentials and tone.Even if Mr. Gillespie loses by a small margin, his campaign could be judged a success, given national political conditions and Virginias Democratic lean.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Northam entered the race as a clear if modest favorite.Virginia, with a high percentage of college-educated voters, backed Mrs. Clinton by a five-point margin in November, and the national political environment would seem to be very favorable to a Democrat.The party out of power has generally won the Virginia governors race, and Republicans have underperformed in this years special elections.Mr. Trumps approval rating has consistently been in the 30s, and Democrats have a considerable lead on the generic congressional ballot.These conditions are consistent with a so-called wave election, like the ones that swept Democrats into power in the House in 2006 and back out in 2010.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.But Mr. Trumps approval rating was at 39 percent in the Upshot/Siena survey, with his disapproval at 51 percent.These figures are somewhat better for Mr. Trump than those of most other surveys perhaps in part because this poll tries to capture likely voters in an off-year election, and those voters are considerably older and whiter than the overall adult population.The poll was sampled from an L2 voter file, and its weighted to a likely electorate.It supposes a turnout of around 2.4 million votes, up somewhat from the 2.24 million cast in the 2013 governors race.But higher or lower turnout would not necessarily be a clear advantage for either side, according to our results.The Democratic strength among well-educated voters and the robust Democratic turnout in the primary for this race gives the party more strength among high-turnout voters than has been the case in recent elections.About 14 percent of respondents were undecided or refused to answer, while another 2 percent backed the Libertarian candidate Cliff Hyra.The relatively high proportion of undecided voters is partly because the sample includes a large number of less likely voters, who are vastly more likely to be undecided than the likeliest voters.Many public polls sample only frequent voters, or screen their sample down to the likeliest voters.Mr. Northam would have led by three points, 46 to 43, if the sample had counted only voters who were almost sure or very likely to vote.How the Poll Has Changed The poll is the first Upshot/Siena survey since the 2016 presidential election, when polls generally overstated Mrs. Clintons support in the decisive battleground states.Mr. Trump led by four points in our final Florida survey in 2016, and he was tied in our final North Carolina survey.But the Upshot/Siena survey also had Mrs. Clinton up by seven points in earlier polls of North Carolina and Pennsylvania, taken soon after the third debate, when she still had a wide lead in national and battleground state polls.The apparent shifts over the last few weeks of the race make it more difficult to assess the performance of these surveys.But a close analysis of last years surveys, combined with insights from across the survey industry, has helped inform two initial changes to the Upshot/Siena poll since last Novembers election.Advertisement Continue reading the main story First, the poll is weighted by self-reported education to match estimates based on the census Current Population Survey.Theres considerable evidence that the failure to weight by education was a major reason state pre-election polls were off the mark, especially in the Rust Belt states.Its not so clear that education weighting would have considerably improved the performance of Upshot/Siena surveys.Thats because the Upshot/Siena sample design and weighting scheme was already intended to properly represent low-turnout voters, who tend to be less educated.The education weight had no effect on the results of this Virginia survey.Second, we sampled and weighted to a likely electorate, rather than registered voters.Similarly, the modeled turnout score our estimate for the probability that a voter will turn out, based on past voting record and other measures now represents 60 percent of our estimate that a respondent will turn out, up from 50 percent in 2016.The remaining 40 percent of the estimate is based on respondents answers to several

Dont Nudge Me: The Limits of Behavioral Economics in Medicine:::::At first glance, behavioral economics the basis of Richard Thalers recent Nobel Prize in Economics seems like a rich field of potential solutions.People tend to do things, like donate organs, when its the default option as opposed to something they need to request.They tend to be less likely to miss appointments if you tell them how many other patients show up for theirs.They tend to be more likely to engage in preventive behaviors like using sunscreen if you focus on the benefits, not the harms.Many are turning to ideas like these to improve medication adherence.But those excited about the potential of behavioral economics should keep in mind the results of a recent study.It pulled out all the stops in trying to get patients who had a heart attack to be more compliant in taking their medication.(Patients adherence at such a time is surprisingly low, even though it makes a big difference in outcomes, so this is a major problem.)Photo Researchers randomly assigned more than 1,500 people to one of two groups.All had recently had heart attacks.One group received the usual care.The other received special electronic pill bottles that monitored patients use of medication.Those patients who took their drugs were entered into a lottery in which they had a 20 percent chance to receive $5 and a 1 percent chance to win $50 every day for a year.Thats not all.The lottery group members could also sign up to have a friend or family member automatically be notified if they didnt take their pills so that they could receive social support.They were given access to special social work resources.There was even a staff engagement adviser whose specific duty was providing close monitoring and feedback, and who would remind patients about the importance of adherence.This was a kitchen-sink approach.It involved direct financial incentives, social support nudges, health care system resources and significant clinical management.It failed.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.The time to first hospitalization for a cardiovascular problem or death was the same between the two groups.The time to any hospitalization and the total number of hospitalizations were the same.So were the medical costs.Even medication adherence the process measure that might influence these outcomes was no different between the two groups.The researchers in this trial deserve praise for their frank assessment of their results, as well as for trying to brainstorm ways in which they might achieve success in the future.Getting patients to change their behavior is very hard.In the past, weve tried making drugs free to patients to get them to adhere to their medications and improve outcomes.That failed.Weve tried lotteries (as in the study above) to nudge people to achieve better compliance.That failed.Maybe financial incentives, and behavioral economics in general, work better in public health than in more direct health care.There have been successes, after all, with respect to weight loss although these seemed to disappear over time.Weve also seen promise with respect to smoking cessation, although these come with caveats as well.Experts caution that the interventions that achieve success are often very intensive.They demand a great deal of attention, and can be quite expensive.Moreover, they are very focused, usually on a single issue or condition.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The problem is that health has so many moving parts.The health care system has even more.Trying to improve any one aspect can make others worse.Behavioral economics may offer us some fascinating theories to test in controlled trials, but we have a long way to go before we can assume its a cure for what ails Americans.
Your Race Against Time: How Climate Affects the Marathon:::::And while the biggest impacts show up in the performances of amateurs and weekend warriors, elite runners are not immune to these effects.When considering the top 20 finishing times at the largest marathons, the assessment found that temperatures in the 50s did not slow them, relative to days in the 40s.But temperatures in the 60s increased their times by three minutes, and those in the 70s increased their times by four minutes.Photo Since temperature has such a big effect on times, would it make sense to adjust marathon times for the weather?If this were done, five of the 25 fastest mens marathon times through March 1, 2017, would beat the current adjusted world record.Indeed, three of them would be more than two minutes faster.The current world-record holder is Dennis Kimetto from Kenya, but the temperature-adjusted record-holder would be Kenenisa Bekele from Ethiopia, who would move up from No.3 on the list.The second-fastest time would belong to the Ethiopian Tamirat Tola, who would move up from No.18.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Adjusting times for temperatures would lead to smaller changes among women.Paula Radcliffe of Britain (who has won the New York race three times) would remain the record-holder.The interactions between climate and a sport like long-distance running are only going to get more pronounced as the climate changes.Over the last 50 years, the temperature has exceeded 60 degrees on just 5 percent of the days during the first week of November, when the New York race is typically held.By 2050, this is projected to rise to 18 percent of days, and by 2090 it is expected to be 38 percent.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.How will runners and organizers react?National governments, city planners and large corporations are all realizing that a warmer world will force them to change the ways they do business.Marathons will be no exception.The organizers of the New York race will probably not want their event to be one where it is difficult, or perhaps even impossible, for people to set their personal best or to lower the world record.So they may want to adapt by moving the marathon to later in the year.At the same time, runners may switch from the New York City Marathon to others held in cooler climates to find the perfect temperature at just the right time of year.Could a Montreal Marathon be among the worlds most prestigious by 2050?Athletic equipment companies will surely develop new technologies to aid adaptation as well.For runners, the breathable mesh and cooling towels of today could easily be traded in for shirts with built-in air-conditioners.Seem far-fetched?They already exist.Indeed, I was one of the authors of a recent study of just how powerful a role technology can play in helping people adapt to warmer temperatures.For example, the rise of air-conditioning has reduced the mortality consequences of extremely hot days in the United States by more than 70 percent since 1960.Marathons and marathon runners appear likely to be able to adapt to climate change with relative ease through changes in when, where and how.But in many other areas of our lives, the costs of climate change are expected to be greater.More intense hurricanes, and the increased occurrence of extremely hot days, will elevate risks to life and property, which can only be offset through costly adaptation efforts.These include building more expensive housing, accelerating the deployment of air-conditioning and making painful decisions to move away from current homes as well as acceptance of increased risks.In this way, the climate choice in front of us is similar to the one faced by people training for a marathon.More time spent training makes for a faster marathon.Its not a great idea to show up on the day of the race without having invested much in your performance.The time for that is well in advance of the big day.In the case of climate change, we can devote resources now to reducing greenhouse gas emissions so that we face lower costs in the future.As with so many things in life, both marathons and the climate problem are subject to an old rule no pain, no gain.
What Did Bernie Sanders Learn in His Weekend in Canada?:::::Mr. Sanders, who drew huge crowds as a presidential candidate in the United States last year, learned firsthand that he is also a household name in Toronto.His policy vision, decidedly from the left in the United States, matches mainstream Canadian views.You received the welcome here that is normally reserved for celebrity rock stars, said Greg Marchildon, the director of the North American Observatory on Health Systems and Policies at the University of Toronto.Ed Broadbent, the chairman of the progressive Broadbent Institute, called Mr. Sanders the most important social democrat in North America even though Mr. Sanders is not a Canadian social democrat, and is not even a particularly powerful member of the Senate.Photo Lesson 2: Doctors like the system as much as patients do Many developed countries have achieved universal health coverage, but Canada is relatively distinct in its insistence that individuals should not have to pay any money at the point of care.When Canadians go to the doctor or hospital, they just show their Canadian Medicare card.At Womens College Hospital, executives showed Mr. Sanders an empty billing window.The hospital, they told him, has one employee who manages bills.For the entire hospital?Mr. Sanders said, in mock disbelief.Several patients told him about the comfort that comes from not having to pay for their care directly.And doctors, too, said they felt more comfortable recommending their patients get an operation or see a specialist than they might if those treatments werent free.I didnt have to fill out any forms; I didnt have to worry about how I was going to pay for the simple job of staying alive, said Lilac Chow, a kidney transplant patient at Toronto General Hospital, who had been brought in to share her experience with the senator.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Whenever Mr. Sanders was asked what he learned about the Canadian system, the value of free care came up.What I think stuck out to me was from both the patients and the physicians, the importance of not having to worry about money in terms of the doctor-patient relationship, he said in an interview after his trip on Tuesday.His Medicare-for-All bill includes free care as a central feature.If the legislation became law, no American would pay directly for a doctor, dentist or hospital visit, and co-payments for prescription drugs would be limited.(Taxpayers would, of course, finance the system.)Photo Lesson 3: Sometimes, you have to wait At a round-table discussion at Womens College Hospital, the chief of surgery noted that Canadian patients cant always get all the care they want right away.Wait times, you could argue are a problem for certain procedures, said Dr. David Urbach, before discussing the ways the province and hospital were working to shorten the lines.Mr. Sanders quickly turned to the glass-half-full interpretation.What you are arguing correct me if Im wrong is that waiting times are not a problem, and its an issue you are dealing with, he said.In Canada, where government finances health insurance and the private sector delivers a lot of the care, patients with life-threatening emergencies are treated right away.But patients with cataracts or arthritis often have to wait for operations the Canadian system considers elective.A governmental review of the Ontario system recently found that wait times were getting worse in some cases, like knee replacements.The Canadian system puts hospitals on a budget and limits the number of specialists it trains, both factors that can lead to lines for complex care thats not life-threatening.The system also limits access to services, like M.R.I.scans, that are much more abundant south of the border.On his weekend tour, Mr. Sanders didnt see the places where patients might wait.Hospital executives instead showed him a refugee primary care clinic, a neonatal intensive care unit and a cardiac surgery unit.But he points out that many Americans who are uninsured or who have limited savings and insurance with high deductibles may wait even longer than Canadians for elective, or even urgent, care.Advertisement Continue reading the main story If youre very, very rich, youll get the highest-quality care immediately in the United States, Mr. Sanders said, in the interview.If youre working class, if youre middle class, it is a very, very different story.The Commonwealth Fund, a health research group, ranked the United States health system at the bottom of its most recent 11-country rankings, published in July.But Canada did only a little better, at No.9.Of all the measures in the study, Canada ranked the worst on the timeliness of care.(A team of Upshot experts eliminated Canada in the first round in an eight-country virtual bracket tournament of international health system performance.)Any single-payer system will need to grapple with how much it should spend over all, and where it will save money.Mr. Sanderss Medicare-for-All bill currently includes few details about how the government would set budgets and allocate resources once all Americans were brought into the government system.Photo Lesson 4: Even Canadas system has holes Mr. Sanders wants to bring big, sweeping change to the American health care system.Unlike the Affordable Care Act, which filled in holes in an existing system, his Medicare-for-All plan would take away the health coverage that most Americans hold now, replacing it with a single, very generous government system.It would do away with the premiums, deductibles and co-payments that individuals and businesses pay for health care, and instead impose large tax increases.That is not the kind of change that would be politically trivial.In his speech, he noted that the creation of a single-payer system in Canada and Britain followed grass-roots movements, and political landslides by the parties that favored the change.Real change always happens from the bottom up, he said, to big applause.Youve got to struggle for it.Youve got to fight for it.Youve got to take it.And that is the history of all real change in this world.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Yet even in Canada, he learned, changes to the health care system have been difficult.The Canadian system, with insurance run at the province level, covers doctors and hospitals.But decades after the 1984 Canada Health Act, many Canadians pay for supplemental private insurance through their jobs for prescription drugs, dentistry and optometry despite a growing recognition that medications are essential to care.Any one of us around the table is just a job loss away from having access to prescription medications, and thats a problem, said Danielle Martin, a vice president at Womens College Hospital and policy researcher, who helped organize the trip, at a round-table discussion.Im on my own going to the dentist, said Naomi Duguid, a patient, sitting across the table.Its the only time I get to experience what it must be like to be an uninsured American.Ontario has recently started a program that will provide coverage for medications to residents under 25.And there is a patchwork of drug coverage programs for older people, the poor and those who get insurance from work.But even in Canada, its tough to find the resources to expand coverage.Advertisement Continue reading the main story We have to find the money to fund the program up front, said Kathleen Wynne, the premier of Ontario, who helped establish the youth drug coverage program.Photo Lesson 5: Canadians seem to value fairness more than Americans do Equity.Fairness.Throughout the weekend, Mr. Sanders kept asking Canadians what they thought about the higher taxes theyd paid to finance their system.Every one among the patients and doctors selected to meet him said the trade-off was worth it because it made the system fair.I think its a really fair way to do it, said Frederick Brownridge, 67, of Etobicoke, Ontario, as he sat by the window in his Toronto General Hospital room, with IV lines in his arms.Mr. Brownridge had had two heart valves repaired and a double bypass three days earlier.It also means if youre in a lower economic status or higher economic status, youll get the treatment you need.On Tuesday, Mr. Sanders said the uniformity of this message really stuck out to him: There really is, I think, a deep-seated belief in Canada that health care is a right, and whether youre rich or whether youre poor or whether youre middle class, you are entitled to health care.In the United States, though, Republicans control the presidency and the Congress, and many candidates last year ran on a promise to roll back government support for health care coverage.Several recent public opinion surveys show majority support for a government guarantee of health coverage, but support declines substantially when pollsters mention that government coverage would mean higher taxes.Mr. Sanders said he knows his bill isnt going to become law anytime soon, but he thinks discussing the idea will help make its underlying values more broadly acceptable.When you talk about health care, youre not just talking about health care, he said in his Toronto speech.Youre talking about values, because how a society deals with health care is more than medicine.Its more than technology.It is about the values that those societies hold dear.
Just Say No to Opioids? Ads Could Actually Make Things Worse:::::Photo In declaring the opioid epidemic a public health emergency last week, President Trump promised that the federal government would start a massive advertising campaign to get people, especially children, not to want to take drugs in the first place.But past efforts to prevent substance abuse through advertising have often been ineffective or even harmful.Perhaps the most famous American antidrug advertisement featured a sizzling egg in a frying pan to the sound of ominous music and a stern voice-over warning, This is your brain on drugs.A sequel to this ad featured Rachael Leigh Cook smashing an egg and the better part of a kitchen to dramatize the impact of heroin.Many other ads denouncing drugs and emphasizing their destructive effects as in the Just Say No campaign appeared regularly on television and in print beginning in the 1980s.Most of them were funded by the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy, which received hundreds of millions of dollars a year from Congress for such campaigns.Visually dramatic though the ads were, evaluations of them were deeply discouraging.The billions spent from the late 1980s through the mid-2000s at best had no effect on drug use, research shows.At worst, exposure to the campaign might have actually increased the likelihood of adolescent marijuana use.A study of over 20,000 youths 9 to 18 found that those who had been exposed to more antidrug ads expressed weaker intentions to avoid marijuana and more doubts that marijuana was harmful.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Why was the original campaign such a failure?In part it suffered from perverse incentives.Congress provided substantial money for the ads and was intensely interested in them at the height of the so-called war on drugs, creating internal pressure to make the ads appealing to members of Congress.But while ads that lectured or scared people about drugs might have seemed compelling to the modal member of Congress (a 60-year-old white male), they did not necessarily dissuade drug use by adolescents.In some cases, this kind of approach may make drugs more attractive as a sign of rebellion.
Revised Data Shows Community Colleges Have Been Underappreciated:::::The old graduation measures date to the late 1980s, when Senator Bill Bradley championed legislation requiring colleges to report graduation rates for their basketball and football players and, while they were at it, everyone else.The measures were limited to students who enroll in college for the first time and take a full course load.This is a perfectly reasonable way to measure graduation rates at Mr. Bradleys alma mater, Princeton, because nearly all undergraduates there start full-time, a few months after finishing high school.The federal graduation rates also calculated the percentage of students who graduated within six years of enrollment.This made sense for four-year universities, where the vast majority of bachelors degrees are earned within six years.The problem was that the graduation rate rules were then applied to the entire higher education system, including two-year community colleges, where nearly half of all undergraduates begin.The typical community college student isnt a fresh-faced 18-year-old taking a full slate of courses.Most community college students are nontraditional adults, parents, people with full-time jobs, people returning to school after years away.They often enroll part-time, taking longer to graduate than the three years the Education Department used to gauge the success of people pursuing two-year degrees.Many community college students also transfer to four-year colleges before finishing a degree a good result, but one that wasnt counted for graduation rates.So, following the committees lead, education officials made several changes.They included part-time and returning students in the calculation.They extended the time period to eight years.And they made separate calculations of how many students transferred before graduation, and how many were still in college.The results paint a very different picture of community college success.The old measures, for example, captured about 620,000 students who began as first-time, full-time freshmen in 2008.Only 20 percent graduated from the community college they started at within three years.North Shore Community College was typical its old graduation rate was 19 percent.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Such dire numbers became fodder for people defending for-profit colleges from heavy criticism of their high cost and poor outcomes.In 2014, Steve Gunderson, head of the main for-profit college trade association, wrote: Our institutions have a 63% graduation rate in our two-year programs, while our colleagues at comparable public institutions community colleges have a graduation rate of 20%.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.The new graduation rates, by contrast, captured more than 1.5 million community college students.Even though that group included more than 710,000 part-time students, who are often less likely to graduate, extending the time frame to eight years increased the average graduation rate to 27 percent.But transfers are where community colleges really shine.Some 510,000 students transferred before graduating, bringing the combined graduation and transfer rate up to 60 percent.Including all of the part-time and returning students and looking over eight years boosted North Shores graduation rate to 35 percent.Another 19 percent transferred before graduation.Others were still working toward a degree.All told, more than half of Mr. Burtons students had a successful outcome not, as the old rates suggested, fewer than one in five.The for-profit picture is not so rosy.The two-year programs Mr. Gunderson chose for comparison make up less than one-fifth of all for-profit enrollment.Four-year programs at for-profits have much lower graduation rates than those of comparable public institutions.Combined, they had a 34 percent graduation rate under the old measures.And in contrast with community colleges, the new measures make for-profits look worse, dropping their average graduation rate to 32 percent.For-profit students seldom bring their credits elsewhere.Including transfer students increases the average for-profit success rate to just 39 percent, compared with 60 percent at community colleges.In other words, Mr. Gunderson had it backward.The new measures suggest that community colleges are much more successful than for-profit colleges, not much less.They are also far cheaper and leave the average student with much less debt.Some for-profit results are catastrophic.Take South University, a Savannah, Ga.-based for-profit college.In 2008, it enrolled 12,233 new students in its online degree programs more than the University of Georgia and Georgia State University combined.The old measures show South University Online with a mind-boggling 2.4 percent graduation rate.But, as with community colleges, most South University Online students are nontraditional.What happens when all the students are counted over a full eight years?Answer: The graduation rate increases to just 7.8 percent.Add in transfers?8.1 percent.Include those still enrolled?8.5 percent.Three years after leaving college, only 23 percent of South University Online students have paid back even a dollar on the principal of their student loans, probably because nearly all of them failed to earn a degree.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Despite these results, South University Online remains accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools, the same body whose response to a multidecade academic cheating scandal at the University of North Carolina was to put the campus on probation for a single year.By comparison, the graduation rate of Georgia Northwestern Technical College, a public school, increases to 50 percent from 25 percent using the new measures.Preparing students to transfer falls to regional public universities in Georgia, instead of community colleges.Savannah State University has only a 33 percent eight-year graduation rate.But include transfer students, and its success rate rises to 81.2 percent.Not all community colleges look better.San Jose City College in California, which graduates 19 percent of traditional students within three years, sees its graduation rate drop to 18 percent when part-time and returning students are included, even when the time frame is extended to eight years.Transfers improve the success rate only to 21 percent.Most students at San Jose City College are falling short.Many community colleges have room to improve.But the big picture shows that community colleges were unfairly tarred by the old graduation rates.The results produced by including all students and by looking over the right time frame and accounting for transfers suggest that many prospective undergraduates may benefit from giving their local community college another look when searching for an affordable path to a degree.And lawmakers who have typically underfunded community colleges may want to direct more resources to institutions that are doing a difficult job better than we knew.
From Burma to the Philippines, Trump largely ignores human rights on Asia trip:::::Vietnam's Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc, left, President Trump, center, and Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte join hands for a photo during the Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit in Manila.(Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images) As his first official trip to Asia neared its end Monday, President Trump had yet to utter a word about the vicious military campaign against the Rohingya Muslim ethnic minority in Burma, which the United Nations top human rights official has called a textbook example of genocide.Earlier, in Vietnam, Trump embraced the communist nations leaders during a state visit to Hanoi without publicly raising the ongoing crackdown on political speech and independent journalists.In Beijing, he praised Chinese leader Xi Jinping, who oversees an authoritarian system that sharply limits press freedoms, as a very special man.And here in Manila, human rights issues were barely discussed if at all in Trumps first meeting with Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, who has garnered worldwide condemnation for waging a bloody, extrajudicial drug war that has killed thousands, shot either in police raids or targeted by hit men, often after being named by police.Some of the victims have been children.Throughout his 12-day, five-nation trip in Asia, Trump focused primarily on tough talk about trade, terrorism and North Koreas nuclear program, while saying little about chronic human rights abuses in a region that is home to some of worlds most brutal authoritarian regimes.The theme is a familiar one for Trump, who declared during a May speech in front of leaders in the Middle East, including many despots, that we are not here to lecture but to offer partnership.[Trumps incoherent message to U.S. allies in Asia] Russian President Vladimir Putin, left, and President Trump talk as they arrive for a photo session at the opening of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Summit in Danang, Vietnam, on Saturday.(Hau Dinh/AP) Unlike former president Barack Obama who canceled a bilateral meeting with Duterte last year Trump joined the Philippine strongman in raising glasses in a toast at the start of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit in Manila over the weekend.The two men appeared at ease as they posed for photographs with other leaders wearing traditional barong Tagalog shirts.Weve had a great relationship, Trump told reporters as he sat with Duterte at the start of the gathering.This has been very successful.As Trump pivoted to talking about the nice weather in Manila, Duterte cut off American reporters who tried to press Trump on human rights.Whoa, whoa, he protested.This is not a press statement.This is the bilateral meeting.Duterte at one point called reporters spies, prompting Trump to laugh.A spokesman for Duterte said after the meeting that human rights did not come up, although the Philippine leader did talk about his efforts against the drug menace.White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said human rights came up briefly in the context of the Philippines drug war; she did not elaborate.On two occasions, Trump declined to answer shouted questions from reporters about whether he had pressed Duterte on human rights.President Trump, left, shows the way to Chinese President Xi Jinping on stage during a business event at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing.(Andy Wong/AP) I have a sense that he is not going to address human rights, largely because he is trying to build a relationship with Duterte, said James Zarsadiaz, director of the Yuchengco Philippine Studies Program at the University of San Francisco.This 10-day trip is about building alliances in response to North Korea.[Dutertes assistant is a selfie king] White House aides said Trump routinely brings up human rights in his private conversations with world leaders, and in a couple of notable instances he has addressed the matter in public on his Asia trip.In a speech to the South Korean parliament, Trump called North Korea a hell no person deserves, and he laid out in sometimes gruesome detail the abuses Pyongyang has perpetrated including purportedly killing babies and carting the bodies away in buckets.In Tokyo, Trump met with the families of Japanese citizens who were abducted by North Korean agents four decades earlier.Other presidents, including Obama and George W. Bush, also have met with the families.Well work together and see if we can do something, now the spotlight is on, Trump said at a news conference with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.Trump called the abductions a very, very sad thing.In Beijing, Trump personally asked Xi to help resolve the case of three UCLA mens basketball players who were arrested for shoplifting while in Hangzhou for a tournament last week, according to people familiar with the situation.On Thursday, as Trump flew from China to Vietnam, a White House official told reporters aboard Air Force One that Trump has been quite concerned about Burma, where Muslims have been systematically slaughtered by the Buddhist majority.Its come up in a number of his conversations with Southeast Asian leaders, and certainly hell be discussing it, and publicly as well, said the official, who was not authorized to speak on the record.As of Monday, however, Trump had yet to do so.He has issued no public statement on the crisis since the Burmese military escalated its anti-Rohingya campaign two months ago.[As Trump arrives, a young victim of Dutertes drug war is mourned] Although the Obama administration promised a pivot to Asia, in part structured on human rights and U.S. values diplomacy, there has long been a sense that U.S. influence in the Asia-Pacific region is waning while Chinas is on the rise.Over the past decade, China has stepped up trade, investment and tourism in Southeast Asia, becoming a major economic player with close ties to political and military elites.All 10 ASEAN member states joined the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, a Chinese-led multilateral financial institution that is issuing billions in loans.China has not tied human rights reforms or worker protections to its economic largesse.The Obama administration sought to align ASEAN around common values that include human rights.But the 10 regional member countries have widely disparate political systems some democratic, some authoritarian and economic systems.Aides, including Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, said Trump believes it is more effective to discuss human rights issues in private; Trump has helped gain the release of a number of Americans who had been detained in Asia and the Middle East.The president railed about North Koreas mistreatment of American college student Otto Warmbier, who died shortly after being released from 17 months of captivity in Pyongyang.Across both East and Southeast Asia, U.S. allies are uncertain about what Trump stands for and nervous about what he will do, said Richard Heydarian, a security analyst and author of The Rise of Duterte.They see a total collapse of American soft power, largely because of Trump, and also American structural decline, especially relative to China, he said.But its a mistake to see this as a clear win for the Chinese, Heydarian added.Despite Chinas spending in Southeast Asia, countries are not ready to align with Beijing, which is seen as a bully because of its military-led maritime expansion in the South China Sea and its economic pressure.[When strongmen meet: Trump and Duterte in Manila] Absent a clear leader in the region, middle-power countries, including Japan, Australia and India, are stepping up their own diplomacy.Trump was scheduled to meet with the leaders from each of those countries Monday amid talk that they would form a quad of powers to help hedge against China in the Indo-Pacific.During the Obama administration, Duterte made his frustration with the United States clear, lashing out at Obama for criticizing the anti-drug campaign and threatening to curtail U.S.-Philippine military ties.Duterte announced that he wanted a divorce from the United States and planned to align himself with Chinas ideological flow.China, in turn, promised money for major infrastructure projects and military upgrades.Trump has taken a markedly warmer approach than Obama did.In a private phone call in April that focused mostly on North Korea, Trump praised Duterte for doing an unbelievable job in combating the illicit drug trade and invited Duterte to visit the White House, according to details of the conversation first revealed in detail in May by The Washington Post.And despite protests against Trump here in Manila during his visit, a majority of Filipinos are more comfortable with the United States than with China and are certainly not prepared to cast their lot with Beijing alone.Dutertes administration has continued to work with the United States on a range of issues and still takes money for counternarcotics work, police training and other items.In the run-up to Trumps visit, Duterte struck an almost conciliatory tone.The upshot is that U.S. influence in the Philippines remains strong and Trump probably has the political capital to nudge Duterte on the drug war if he chose to do so, experts said.The credibility of the U.S. is at stake because of Trumps unsophisticated ways in diplomacy, said Zarsadiaz, the Philippine studies director.In the grand scheme of things, in Asia, there is still this sense that the U.S. is an arbiter of justice....Time will tell whether Trump will follow the lead of congressional leaders, of the U.N., of Amnesty International, and stand behind what are seen as American principles.
Senate Republicans repudiate Roy Moores candidacy and urge him to leave the race:::::On Nov. 13, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) definitively called on Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore to "step aside" after women accused him of sexual misconduct when they were teenagers."I believe the women," McConnell said.Moore denied the allegations.(The Washington Post) On Nov. 13, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) definitively called on Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore to "step aside" after women accused him of sexual misconduct when they were teenagers."I believe the women," McConnell said.Moore denied the allegations.(The Washington Post) Senate Republican leaders on Monday waged an urgent campaign to pressure GOP nominee Roy Moore to withdraw from the Alabama Senate race amid allegations of sexual misconduct, declaring him unfit to serve and threatening to expel him from Congress if elected.But Moore showed no signs he was preparing to step aside, even as another woman came forward to accuse him of sexually assaulting her in the late 1970s when she was 16 years old.The fusillade from Senate Republicans started Monday morning in Louisville, where Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) called on Moore to step aside.I believe the women, yes, he said of the allegations leveled against Moore.Later, National Republican Senatorial Committee Chairman Cory Gardner (R-Colo.) issued a written statement going even further.If he refuses to withdraw and wins, the Senate should vote to expel him, Gardner said.He later told reporters Moore doesnt belong in the United States Senate.Roy Moore, the Republican nominee in a special election in Alabama for a Senate seat, said on Nov. 11 that he has not been guilty of sexual misconduct with anyone.The Washington Post reported on Nov. 9 that a woman said Moore initiated a sexual encounter in 1979 when she was 14 and he was 32.(WBRC) The public comments from top Republican senators marked a dramatic escalation from their initial reactions to Thursdays Washington Post report detailing allegations that Moore initiated a sexual encounter with a 14-year-old girl when he was 32.The intensifying move against Moore reflected a growing sense that his candidacy is becoming a national emergency for the Republican Party, which is already deeply concerned about its standing with voters ahead of the 2018 midterm elections.In campaigns far from Alabama, Democrats on Monday sought to tie GOP candidates to Moore to take advantage of the controversy surrounding the former judge.Still, national Republican leaders and their allies were left without a clear path forward, with no way to remove Moores name from the ballot for the Dec. 12 election.One possibility that some GOP officials were pushing as a last-ditch effort was a write-in campaign by Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who vacated the seat to join the Trump administration.But there was considerable skepticism in Sessionss orbit that he would agree to that idea.Others floated the prospect of a write-in effort for Sen. Luther Strange (R-Ala.), whom Moore defeated in the primary.Sen. Richard C. Shelby (R-Ala.) was among the Republicans voicing confidence that Sessions would be the partys best hope as write-in candidate.He told reporters the attorney general would be a strong one.President Trump has been relatively quiet on the controversy in recent days while traveling in Asia, adding a degree of uncertainty to how the party should proceed with Moore.Last week, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Trump believed that if the allegations against Moore are true, he will do the right thing and step aside.In recent days, senior Trump administration officials have been in touch with Alabama Gov.Kay Ivey (R) and her inner circle, according to several people briefed on the talks.One person described those conversations as information gathering so the White House would know where Ivey stands and to keep the channels of communication open as the political drama continues.Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.)withdrew on Nov. 13 his endorsement of Roy Moore in the race for the Alabama Senate.(Jordan Frasier/The Washington Post) But since Trump wont return from Asia until late Tuesday and is still considering his own options regarding how to further address Moores candidacy, White House officials have been reluctant to lean on Ivey in any way, the people said.Its tough having him out of town because no one wants to get too far ahead of him, said one Republican involved in the talks, requesting anonymity to describe private deliberations.McConnell has spoken to Trump about Moore since the allegations were first reported last week, a Republican familiar with their conversations said.Senate Republican leaders and their allies believe that Trumps positioning wherever he decides to come down will be crucial to the attempt to force Moore out.Gardners call to expel Moore if elected was Senate Republican leaders most aggressive effort yet to get the former judge to drop out of the race.But an effort to expel a senator is extremely rare and would require the approval of two-thirds of the chamber to be successful.An actual vote hasnt happened since 1862.Moore was defiant amid the increasing pressure from party leaders.He wrote on social media that McConnell is the one who should step aside and that he has failed conservatives.The war of words unfolded on the same day that Beverly Young Nelson, now 55 , accused Moore, now 70, of sexually assaulting her and bruising her neck in the late 1970s when she was 16 years old.Nelson said at a news conference at a New York hotel that Moore, then the district attorney of Etowah County, was a regular at a restaurant, the Old Hickory House restaurant in the northeastern Alabama town of Gadsden, where she was a waitress and would sometimes compliment her looks or touch her long red hair.She showed a copy of her high school yearbook that she said Moore signed on Dec. 22, 1977, with the inscription: To a sweeter more beautiful girl I could not say Merry Christmas.On a cold night about a week or two after that, Nelson alleges that Moore offered to give her a ride home from work after her shift ended at 10 p.m.Instead of taking her home, Nelson said that Moore pulled the two-door car into a dark and deserted area between a dumpster and the back of the restaurant.When she asked what he was doing, Nelson alleges that Moore put his hands on her breasts and began groping her.When she tried to open the car door and leave, Nelson said he reached over and locked the door.When she yelled at him to stop and tried to fight him off, she alleges that he tightly squeezed the back of her neck and tried to force her head toward his lap.He also tried to pull her shirt off, she said.Moore denied this latest accusations during a brief campaign appearance Monday evening in Etowah County, where he still lives.I can tell you without hesitation this is absolutely false, Moore said, according to the Anniston Star newspaper.I never did what she said I did.I dont even know the woman.I dont know anything about her.I dont even know where the restaurant is or was.The new allegation followed an extensive report published Thursday by The Washington Post in which Leigh Corfman alleged that Moore initiated a sexual encounter with her when she was 14 and Moore was a 32-year-old assistant district attorney.Moore has denied the accusation.In addition to Corfman, three other women interviewed by The Post in recent weeks said Moore pursued them when they were between the ages of 16 and 18 and he was in his early 30s, episodes they said they found flattering at the time, but troubling as they got older.None of the three women said that Moore forced them into any sort of relationship or sexual contact.Neither Corfman nor any of the other women sought out The Post.While reporting a story in Alabama about supporters of Moores Senate campaign, a Post reporter heard that Moore allegedly had sought relationships with teenage girls.Over the following three weeks, two Post reporters contacted and interviewed the four women.Moore has declined to rule out that he may have dated girls in their late teens when he was in his 30s, but he has said he did not remember any encounters.Last week, McConnell and many other senators said that if those allegations were true, Moore and would need to step aside, stopping short of the position he took Monday.Scott Jennings, a former McConnell aide, wrote a column published Monday endorsing a highly unusual proposal that has also generated chatter among Republicans: Sessions should step down as attorney general and run for the seat.President Trump should intervene, Jennings wrote in the Louisville Courier-Journal, by demanding the Alabama Republican Party withdraw Moores name as a candidate, which it almost certainly would do if ordered by the White House; dispatch a still-popular Sessions to run a write-in candidacy; and campaign for and hope Sessions wins.A Sessions spokeswoman at the Justice Department did not immediately comment on the proposal.A Republican close to Sessions granted anonymity to speak candidly said Sessions has told folks in Alabama that he is not considering it.Sessions is scheduled to be on Capitol Hill Tuesday to testify before the House Judiciary Committee.Inside the White House, Sessions has been floated as a potential replacement, according to two White House officials and several Senate Republican aides.Sessions whose once close relationship with Trump has frayed over the past year following Sessions recusal from the federal probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election has dismissed the notion in private but would of course listen to the president, should he reach out, according to one White House official.Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah), who expressed solidarity with McConnells rejection of Moore, wrote on Twitter that Strange would be an excellent alternative.Strange repeatedly declined to comment when asked if he would mount a write-in campaign or if he had spoken to Moore.A spokeswoman for the Alabama Republican Party did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the prospect of a write-in campaign.In an interview Sunday with the website Alabama Political Reporter, state Republican Party Chairman Terry Lathan said it would be a serious error for party officials to publicly endorse a write-in candidate.While Moores name must remain on the ballot, the state Republican Party has the power to disqualify him meaning votes cast for him would not count.Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) criticized Moore Monday.He also distanced himself from the campaign of Democratic nominee Doug Jones, who is trying to demonstrate independence from national party figures in hopes of winning some crossover votes in Alabama, which leans heavily conservative.I thought Moore never belonged in the Senate even before these allegations, said Schumer.As for the Jones effort, Schumer said, when they ask us for help, well do it.But its been an Alabama race.As Republican senators returned to Washington on Monday, several of them made clear to the leadership in phone calls and through colleagues that they would support a tougher line on Moore in the coming days and would encourage Trump to join them once he returns from Asia, according to two people familiar with the discussions.Asked if there was any easy solution to the Moore situation, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) replied: No.Then he reconsidered.Theres one solution, McCain said.He should never be a United States senator.Paul Kane, Ed OKeefe and Elise Viebeck contributed to this report.
New woman accuses Moore of sexual misconduct when she was a minor:::::During a press conference Nov. 13, Beverly Young Nelson accused Senate candidate Roy Moore of sexually assaulting her in the 1970s when she was a teenager.(Reuters) During a press conference Nov. 13, Beverly Young Nelson accused Senate candidate Roy Moore of sexually assaulting her in the 1970s when she was a teenager.(Reuters) An Alabama woman on Monday accused Roy Moore, the Republican nominee for Alabamas open U.S. Senate seat, of sexually assaulting her and bruising her neck in the late 1970s when she was 16 years old.This new allegation follows an extensive report published Thursday by The Washington Post that detailed allegations that Moore initiated a sexual encounter with a 14-year-old girl when he was 32.The story also described his relationship with three other girls who were between the ages of 16 and 18 at the time.Moore has denied the allegations.Beverly Young Nelson, now 55, said Monday that she got to know Moore, now 70, in the late 1970s when she was a waitress at the Old Hickory House restaurant in the northeastern Alabama town of Gadsden, where Moore lived for much of his life.Nelson said at a news conference at a New York hotel that Moore, then the district attorney of Etowah County, was a regular at the restaurant and would sometimes compliment her looks or touch her long red hair.She showed a copy of her high school yearbook that she said Moore signed on Dec. 22, 1977, with the inscription, To a sweeter more beautiful girl I could not say Merry Christmas.On a cold night about a week or two after that, Nelson alleges, Moore offered to give her a ride home from work after her shift ended at 10 p.m.Instead of taking her home, Nelson said, Moore pulled the two-door car into a dark and deserted area between a dumpster and the back of the restaurant.When she asked what he was doing, Nelson alleges, Moore put his hands on her breasts and began groping her.When she tried to open the car door and leave, Nelson said, he reached over and locked the door.When she yelled at him to stop and tried to fight him off, she alleges, he tightly squeezed the back of her neck and tried to force her head toward his lap.He also tried to pull her shirt off, she said.I was determined that I was not going to allow him to force me to have sex with him.I was terrified, Nelson said during the news conference, often becoming emotional as she described the attack that she alleges occurred about 40 years ago.I thought that he was going to rape me.Moore denied the latest accusations during a brief campaign appearance Monday evening in Etowah County, where he still lives.I can tell you without hesitation this is absolutely false, Moore said, according to the Anniston Star newspaper.I never did what she said I did.I dont even know the woman.I dont know anything about her.I dont even know where the restaurant is or was.Earlier in the day, Bill Armistead, the chairman of Moores Senate campaign, accused Nelsons attorney, Gloria Allred, of being a sensationalist leading a witch hunt.Nelson is the fifth woman to publicly accuse Moore of pursuing her when she was a teenager.Judge Moore is an innocent man and has never had any sexual misconduct with anyone, Armistead said in a statement....Let it be understood: The truth will come forward, we will pursue all legal options against these false claims and Judge Moore will be vindicated.[Woman says Moore initiated sexual encounter when she was 14, he was 32] At the news conference in New York, Nelson said that during the incident, she kept fighting Moore, with tears rolling down her face, and he eventually stopped.She said he then told her: Youre just a child and Im the district attorney of Etowah County, and if you tell anyone about this, no one will believe you.Nelson said she then fell or was pushed out of the car.The passenger door was still open as he burned rubber pulling away, leaving me laying there on the cold concrete in the dark, Nelson said.She said that her neck was black and blue and purple the next day.She said she quit her job at the restaurant so that she would not have to see Moore again.About two years after the alleged incident, Nelson said, she told her sister what had happened.She also said she told her husband of 13 years, John Nelson, before they got married and also told her mother about four years ago.Allred, a womens rights attorney who has represented victims of sexual assault or abuse in high-profile cases, said that Nelson reached out to her and that her law firm has interviewed Nelsons relatives.Allred said Nelson wants the Senate Judiciary Committee to call a hearing within the next two weeks and petition Moore to testify about the incident under oath.She added that Nelson is not considering any civil or criminal options at this time.Nelson said she always assumed she was the only woman who had this sort of experience with Moore.The Post report published last week featured four women who said Moore pursued a relationship with them when they were teenagers.Leigh Corfman told The Post that in early 1979 Moore took her to his home, where he kissed her, touched her and took her clothes off; she was 14 at the time, and he was a 32-year-old assistant district attorney.None of the four women sought out The Post.While reporting a story in Alabama about supporters of Moores Senate campaign, a Post reporter heard that Moore allegedly had sought relationships with teenage girls.Over the ensuing three weeks, two Post reporters contacted and interviewed the four women.All were initially reluctant to speak publicly but chose to do so after multiple interviews, saying they thought it was important for people to know about their interactions with Moore.The women say they do not know one another.Nelson said that the courage of these women prompted her to speak out.My husband and I supported Donald Trump for president.This has nothing whatsoever to do with the Republicans or the Democrats.It has everything to do with Mr. Moores sexual assault when I was a teenager, Nelson said.Mr. Moore attacked me when I was a child, and I did nothing to deserve his sexual attack.[McConnell, Senate GOP campaign chief repudiate Roy Moores candidacy ] Earlier in the day, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said he believes the

From Burma to the Philippines, Trump largely ignores human rights on Asia trip:::::Vietnam's Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc, left, President Trump, center, and Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte join hands for a photo during the Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit in Manila.(Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images) As his first official trip to Asia neared its end Monday, President Trump had yet to utter a word about the vicious military campaign against the Rohingya Muslim ethnic minority in Burma, which the United Nations top human rights official has called a textbook example of genocide.Earlier, in Vietnam, Trump embraced the communist nations leaders during a state visit to Hanoi without publicly raising the ongoing crackdown on political speech and independent journalists.In Beijing, he praised Chinese leader Xi Jinping, who oversees an authoritarian system that sharply limits press freedoms, as a very special man.And here in Manila, human rights issues were barely discussed if at all in Trumps first meeting with Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, who has garnered worldwide condemnation for waging a bloody, extrajudicial drug war that has killed thousands, shot either in police raids or targeted by hit men, often after being named by police.Some of the victims have been children.Throughout his 12-day, five-nation trip in Asia, Trump focused primarily on tough talk about trade, terrorism and North Koreas nuclear program, while saying little about chronic human rights abuses in a region that is home to some of worlds most brutal authoritarian regimes.The theme is a familiar one for Trump, who declared during a May speech in front of leaders in the Middle East, including many despots, that we are not here to lecture but to offer partnership.[Trumps incoherent message to U.S. allies in Asia] Russian President Vladimir Putin, left, and President Trump talk as they arrive for a photo session at the opening of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Summit in Danang, Vietnam, on Saturday.(Hau Dinh/AP) Unlike former president Barack Obama who canceled a bilateral meeting with Duterte last year Trump joined the Philippine strongman in raising glasses in a toast at the start of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit in Manila over the weekend.The two men appeared at ease as they posed for photographs with other leaders wearing traditional barong Tagalog shirts.Weve had a great relationship, Trump told reporters as he sat with Duterte at the start of the gathering.This has been very successful.As Trump pivoted to talking about the nice weather in Manila, Duterte cut off American reporters who tried to press Trump on human rights.Whoa, whoa, he protested.This is not a press statement.This is the bilateral meeting.Duterte at one point called reporters spies, prompting Trump to laugh.A spokesman for Duterte said after the meeting that human rights did not come up, although the Philippine leader did talk about his efforts against the drug menace.White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said human rights came up briefly in the context of the Philippines drug war; she did not elaborate.On two occasions, Trump declined to answer shouted questions from reporters about whether he had pressed Duterte on human rights.President Trump, left, shows the way to Chinese President Xi Jinping on stage during a business event at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing.(Andy Wong/AP) I have a sense that he is not going to address human rights, largely because he is trying to build a relationship with Duterte, said James Zarsadiaz, director of the Yuchengco Philippine Studies Program at the University of San Francisco.This 10-day trip is about building alliances in response to North Korea.[Dutertes assistant is a selfie king] White House aides said Trump routinely brings up human rights in his private conversations with world leaders, and in a couple of notable instances he has addressed the matter in public on his Asia trip.In a speech to the South Korean parliament, Trump called North Korea a hell no person deserves, and he laid out in sometimes gruesome detail the abuses Pyongyang has perpetrated including purportedly killing babies and carting the bodies away in buckets.In Tokyo, Trump met with the families of Japanese citizens who were abducted by North Korean agents four decades earlier.Other presidents, including Obama and George W. Bush, also have met with the families.Well work together and see if we can do something, now the spotlight is on, Trump said at a news conference with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.Trump called the abductions a very, very sad thing.In Beijing, Trump personally asked Xi to help resolve the case of three UCLA mens basketball players who were arrested for shoplifting while in Hangzhou for a tournament last week, according to people familiar with the situation.On Thursday, as Trump flew from China to Vietnam, a White House official told reporters aboard Air Force One that Trump has been quite concerned about Burma, where Muslims have been systematically slaughtered by the Buddhist majority.Its come up in a number of his conversations with Southeast Asian leaders, and certainly hell be discussing it, and publicly as well, said the official, who was not authorized to speak on the record.As of Monday, however, Trump had yet to do so.He has issued no public statement on the crisis since the Burmese military escalated its anti-Rohingya campaign two months ago.[As Trump arrives, a young victim of Dutertes drug war is mourned] Although the Obama administration promised a pivot to Asia, in part structured on human rights and U.S. values diplomacy, there has long been a sense that U.S. influence in the Asia-Pacific region is waning while Chinas is on the rise.Over the past decade, China has stepped up trade, investment and tourism in Southeast Asia, becoming a major economic player with close ties to political and military elites.All 10 ASEAN member states joined the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, a Chinese-led multilateral financial institution that is issuing billions in loans.China has not tied human rights reforms or worker protections to its economic largesse.The Obama administration sought to align ASEAN around common values that include human rights.But the 10 regional member countries have widely disparate political systems some democratic, some authoritarian and economic systems.Aides, including Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, said Trump believes it is more effective to discuss human rights issues in private; Trump has helped gain the release of a number of Americans who had been detained in Asia and the Middle East.The president railed about North Koreas mistreatment of American college student Otto Warmbier, who died shortly after being released from 17 months of captivity in Pyongyang.Across both East and Southeast Asia, U.S. allies are uncertain about what Trump stands for and nervous about what he will do, said Richard Heydarian, a security analyst and author of The Rise of Duterte.They see a total collapse of American soft power, largely because of Trump, and also American structural decline, especially relative to China, he said.But its a mistake to see this as a clear win for the Chinese, Heydarian added.Despite Chinas spending in Southeast Asia, countries are not ready to align with Beijing, which is seen as a bully because of its military-led maritime expansion in the South China Sea and its economic pressure.[When strongmen meet: Trump and Duterte in Manila] Absent a clear leader in the region, middle-power countries, including Japan, Australia and India, are stepping up their own diplomacy.Trump was scheduled to meet with the leaders from each of those countries Monday amid talk that they would form a quad of powers to help hedge against China in the Indo-Pacific.During the Obama administration, Duterte made his frustration with the United States clear, lashing out at Obama for criticizing the anti-drug campaign and threatening to curtail U.S.-Philippine military ties.Duterte announced that he wanted a divorce from the United States and planned to align himself with Chinas ideological flow.China, in turn, promised money for major infrastructure projects and military upgrades.Trump has taken a markedly warmer approach than Obama did.In a private phone call in April that focused mostly on North Korea, Trump praised Duterte for doing an unbelievable job in combating the illicit drug trade and invited Duterte to visit the White House, according to details of the conversation first revealed in detail in May by The Washington Post.And despite protests against Trump here in Manila during his visit, a majority of Filipinos are more comfortable with the United States than with China and are certainly not prepared to cast their lot with Beijing alone.Dutertes administration has continued to work with the United States on a range of issues and still takes money for counternarcotics work, police training and other items.In the run-up to Trumps visit, Duterte struck an almost conciliatory tone.The upshot is that U.S. influence in the Philippines remains strong and Trump probably has the political capital to nudge Duterte on the drug war if he chose to do so, experts said.The credibility of the U.S. is at stake because of Trumps unsophisticated ways in diplomacy, said Zarsadiaz, the Philippine studies director.In the grand scheme of things, in Asia, there is still this sense that the U.S. is an arbiter of justice....Time will tell whether Trump will follow the lead of congressional leaders, of the U.N., of Amnesty International, and stand behind what are seen as American principles.
Candidate Donald Trump asked black voters: What the hell do you have to lose? Well, apparently, judgeships.:::::President Trump with Judge Neil M. Gorsuch and Supreme Court Justice Anthony M. Kennedy at the White House on April 10.(Carolyn Kaster/AP) During the 2016 presidential election season, Donald Trump repeatedly asked black Americans what they had to lose by sending him to the White House to succeed the country's first black president.Well apparently, the courts.According to an analysis by the Associated Press, 91 percent of Trumps nominees to U.S. federal courts are white, and 81 percent are male.Three out of every four of the nominees are white men.The last president to nominate a similarly homogeneous group was George H.W.Bush.Also, according to the analysis, more than a quarter of Trump's nominees are white males who will replace women or people of color: The shift could prove to be one of Trumps most enduring legacies.These are lifetime appointments, and Trump has inherited both an unusually high number of vacancies and an aging population of judges.That puts him in position to significantly reshape the courts that decide thousands of civil rights, environmental, criminal justice and other disputes across the country.The White House has been upfront about its plans to quickly fill the seats with conservatives and has made clear that judicial philosophy tops any concerns about shrinking racial or gender diversity.Courts were a large issue during the 2016 election.Former president Barack Obama considers diversifying the courts to be among his greatest legacies.His nomination of Sonia Sotomayor to the Supreme Court made her the first Hispanic justice on the country's highest bench.And in terms of federal benches as a whole, the Obama administration nominated a higher percentage of people of color to federal judgeships than any other president.Just months before the 2016 election, Obama spoke to University of Chicago law students about his commitment to diversity on the bench I am not to brag but I have transformed the federal courts from a diversity standpoint with a record that's been unmatched.We've got more African Americans on the circuit courts than we ever [had] before.We've got I've appointed more African American women to the federal courts than any other president before.I've appointed more Latinos than any president before.I've appointed more Native Americans, more Asian Americans, more LGBT judges than ever before.But at no point did I say, oh, you know what, I need a black lesbian from Skokie in that slot.Can you find me one?I mean, that's just not how I've approached it.It turns out that if the process is fair and you are saying that it's important that our courts are reflective of a changing society, youll end up with a really good cross-section of people who are excellent.And that's who we've been able to appoint.Those in the Obama administration have said that the president wanted the benches to look like America.But Trump and other conservatives have regularly criticized Obama for nominating activist judges more concerned with political ideology than reflecting the ethnic and gender diversity of the country.Activism isn't exclusive to liberalism.But Trump critics say that the president isn't interested in keeping political activism out of the courts.He simply wants judges who reflect the politics of some of his most loyal supporters.During the campaign, Trump was praised by conservatives for taking the unusual step of releasing a list of judges he would consider nominating to the Supreme Court if he was elected president.Most of the names were suggested by the Heritage Foundation, a conservative public policy think tank.And the move was viewed as an effort to reassure conservatives that the former Hillary Clinton donor would carry out their judicial agenda in office.Trump went on to win 80 percent of white evangelical voters, with one of the main reasons being his promise to nominate judges that support the politics of one of his most loyal demographic groups, according to the New York Times.He wooed them and convinced them that he would appoint Supreme Court justices in the mold of Antonin Scalia, the conservative who died in February.To these pragmatic players, the election boiled down to only two issues, both that could be solved with Supreme Court appointments: stopping abortion and ensuring legal protections for religious conservatives who object to same-sex marriage.Despite low approval ratings only 37 percent of adults approve of Trump's job performance, the overwhelming majority of white evangelical voters 73 percent view his job performance favorably, according to the latest Washington Post/ABC News poll.And appreciating his judicial appointments is one of those reasons.But Americans looking for more ethnic and gender diversity in Trump's nominees might want to focus on the group the president has tasked with choosing the nominees.Were going to have great judges, conservative, all picked by the Federalist Society, Trump told former White House chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon while on the campaign trail.The group will gather in Washington this week for the 2017 National Lawyers Convention.Here's a list of the people chosen to speak at the event.
Steve Bannon is twisting Chuck Todds words to claim an orchestrated smear of Roy Moore:::::Breitbart News chairman Stephen K. Bannon appears at a rally Sept. 25 for U.S. Senate candidate Roy Moore in Fairhope, Ala. (Photo by Brynn Anderson/AP) Stephen K. Bannon has identified the perfect person to convince Alabama voters who might be wavering on Roy Moore that the GOP Senate candidate's alleged pursuit of teenage girls is nothing more than a smear campaign by Democrats, establishment Republicans and the media, all working in cahoots: NBC's Chuck Todd.Even Chuck Todd, the swampiest creature of swamp creatures, he walked through it yesterday on 'Meet the Press,'" Bannon said Monday on the Breitbart News Daily SiriusXM radio show.He said it felt completely orchestrated.One problem: That's not really what Todd said.Todd's orchestrated assessment referred to the way Capitol Hill Republicans responded, almost in unison, to The Washington Post's report that four women claim Moore inappropriately touched, kissed or tried to date them when they were teens and he was in his 30s.Mitch McConnell, the way he's been this clearly felt almost orchestrated, Todd said.The minute, within an hour, this came out, many of the McConnell allies came out and said, 'He's got to go.'Sounds like Mitch McConnell has decided it's worse if Roy Moore wins.It did indeed appear that McConnell and fellow Republicans had agreed their position would be that Moore should drop out if the allegations against him were true.On Monday, hours before a fifth woman came forward and claimed that Moore groped her when she was 16, McConnell said he believes the first four women are telling the truth.Republicans orchestrating their response to the allegations is not improper and certainly not the same thing as colluding with Democrats and the media to publish a false report.But Bannon is trying to muddy the waters and dupe voters into believing that even Chuck Todd suspects Moore is the victim of a conspiracy.Why?Because Bannon thinks the perception that Todd is on his side will make his argument stronger.You ought to play that clip 20 times between now and the end of the show, Bannon told Breitbart News Daily host Alex Marlow, who is editor in chief of the Breitbart website.
Roy Moores problems just got much, much more serious:::::During a press conference Nov. 13, Beverly Young Nelson accused Senate candidate Roy Moore of sexually assaulting her in the 1970s when she was a teenager.(Reuters) Shortly before Roy Moore's latest accuser came forward Monday afternoon, an Alabama political reporter appeared on CNN to defend him.What Moore is accused of doing was only a misdemeanor in 1979, emphasized Brandon Moseley of ALReporter.com: If [Moore] had stolen a lawn mower at age 21, would that be a reason not to elect him 50 years later?The comments made Moseley only the latest Moore defender to downplay the severity of alleged sexual touching initiated by a 32-year-old man on a 14-year-old girl.In case there was any doubt, we are now way, way beyond stolen lawn mower comparison.Beverly Young Nelson on Monday accused Moore of what basically amounts to sexual assault even attempted rape.Seated next to attorney Gloria Allred, Nelson said Moore offered her a ride and then parked in a dimly lit area behind a diner she worked at before groping her, locking the doors and trying to force her head into his lap.I thought he was going to rape me, she said, constantly choking back tears.She was 16 at the time.One reason for the lack of a united outcry against Moore in the GOP has been the questioning about how much wrong he's accused of doing.However crass the lawn mower comparison is, the then-14-year-old, Leigh Corfman, described a scene in which Moore initiated touching she wasn't comfortable with, but she didn't accuse him of attempted rape or even sexual assault, in so many words.Even if she didn't, Alabama state law both today and back then labels this kind of behavior sexual abuse in the second degree.It is indeed a misdemeanor punishable by up to one year in jail.And the other three women who told The Post that Moore dated them when they were between 16 and 18 were technically of consenting age (16) at the time.This new allegation is by far the most serious and moves this well beyond legal and moral gray areas into an alleged felony and one about which Nelson says she is willing to testify in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee.She also has a high school yearbook she says Moore signed for her.Moore's signature and the one in the yearbook appear to match.It shouldn't be terribly surprising that another woman has come forward with such an allegation that tends to be the case but Nelson's allegation takes this in a wholly different direction.If Moore was capable of this kind of alleged forcible assault, it stands to reason that there will be more stories to come.Not that Moore's supporters will find it difficult to shift tactics.They'll simply move away from the lawn mower analogies and biblical comparisons to casting doubt on the accusations themselves.But this certainly makes it no longer tenable to claim that this is a misunderstanding from a bygone era in the United States or a very specific region of the country.And these Moore defenders have to wonder how much more they'll be asked to defend or dispute in the days and weeks to come.National Republicans are now quickly trying to rid themselves of Moore's mess.After the news conference Monday, National Republican Senatorial Committee Chairman Cory Gardner (R-Colo.) said the Senate should expel Moore even if he's elected Dec. 12 an outcome that can hardly be ruled out at this point because he does not meet the ethical and moral requirements of the United States Senate.But while the national establishment has clearly decided that the situation needs to be dispatched with and fast the ones that really need convincing are Moore and Alabama Republicans.Either Moore drops out or the state party withdraws his nomination.Beyond that, this drama could last another month and possibly longer, or it could conclude with Democrats winning the seat and the GOP's majority being cut in half.

Rand Paul (R-Ky.) returned to Washington, still in pain from an attack that left him with six broken ribs, but doing little to quell speculation about what caused his neighbor to lash out.Paul, the second-term senator and former presidential candidate, arrived at the U.S. Capitol on Monday evening in time for two scheduled votes.Accompanied by two aides, the senator had no obvious scars or bruises but was clenched in pain as he walked.An aide attempted to deflect reporters as Paul quietly explained that hes still struggling to breathe as his ribs heal.He even waved off and politely declined a friendly handshake from Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) one of his 2016 presidential campaign opponents not out of spite, but because he said it might be too painful.The senator and his wife flew from Kentucky on Monday in part, aides said, so he could vote against a procedural motion to begin debate on the nomination of Steven G. Bradbury, President Trumps pick to serve as the top lawyer at the Transportation Department.During George W. Bushs administration, Bradbury was among the lawyers who helped write the torture memos, as they are known, that endorsed brutal interrogation techniques.Paul is a longtime critic of Bush-era interrogation practices and other aspects of the years-long war on terror.He is planning to be in Washington all week for Senate business, an aide said.Paul declined to answer questions from reporters at the Capitol, but told the Washington Examiner in his first interview since the Nov. 3 attack that there was no justification for what happened.There is no motive that would justify hitting somebody from behind and breaking their ribs and damaging their lungs, so no, there is no justification for something like that, Paul told the paper.[Pauls injuries remain shrouded in mystery as alleged attacker pleads not guilty] But the senator, citing the pending case against his attacker, declined to engage on what might have prompted the assault still leaving unanswered many questions about what transpired at his Bowling Green, Ky., home.The senators neighbor, Rene Boucher, 59, pleaded not guilty last Thursday as Kentucky state police and FBI investigations continue into the matter.For now, Boucher, a retired anesthesiologist, faces a possible 12-month sentence and a $500 fine if he is convicted of fourth-degree assault, according to a county prosecutor.More serious state charges would come from Commonwealths Attorney Christopher T. Cohron.Federal charges, in turn, would fall to the U.S. attorneys office in Louisville.Police, and Paul himself, were unaware initially just how serious his injuries were and Paul did not immediately seek medical attention, police said.His office initially described Pauls injuries as minor, but later announced he had broken five ribs.A day later, they said he had six broken ribs.[A disturbed person: The mystery behind the attack on Rand Paul grows, as Pauls side weighs in] No new evidence has emerged to help explain a motive for the altercation but Bouchers attorney has insisted that the incident was unequivocally not about politics.A senior adviser to Paul strongly disputed Bakers characterization of the incident last week, saying that the senator was vigorously assaulted by someone in his neighborhood.He called it a serious criminal matter after a long-standing dispute with Boucher.The motion to proceed to final debate on Bradburys nomination cleared the Senate but Paul wasnt the only Republican to vote no.Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), another torture critic who is walking with a cane after a minor tear in his right Achilles' tendon a side effect of his ongoing cancer treatment also voted against the motion on Bradburys nomination.Another nominee, Derek Kan, was confirmed 90 to 7 to serve as a Transportation Department undersecretary for policy.Read more at PowerPost
The judicial nominee whos never tried a case is also married to a Trump administration lawyer:::::Brett J. Talley in 2014.(Matt McClain/The Washington Post) Brett J. Talley, the young lawyer nominated by President Trump for a lifetime federal judgeship in Alabama, was asked by a Senate committee to disclose family members who are likely to present potential conflicts of interest if he is confirmed.In response, Talley said he would evaluate real or potential conflict, or relationships that could give rise to appearance of conflict and recuse himself from cases if necessary, according to a Senate Judiciary Committee questionnaire.He did not, however, identify any family members including his wife, who is one of President Trumps attorneys.Annie Donaldson is White House Counsel Donald McGahns chief of staff.Talleys failure to mention his wife in the 30-page written questionnaire was first reported Monday by the New York Times.Talley could not be immediately reached for comment.The White House did not respond to questions about whether the administration sees a potential conflict of interest and whether Talley should have disclosed that he is married to a White House attorney.Taylor Foy, spokesman for the Senate Judiciary Committee and its chair, Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), said nominees are not required to list their spouses occupation.Its no secret that Mr. Talleys wife, Ann Donaldson, is the chief of staff to the White House counsel, Foy said.She was sitting behind Mr. Talley at his nomination hearing.Anyone who had any concerns about his wifes occupation could have raised them at the hearing.As a district judge, Talley could end up presiding over cases in which the federal government or the White House is one of the parties.For example, district judges in Hawaii and Maryland had previously heard cases challenging the Trump administrations travel ban.Charles Geyh, an Indiana University law professor, said Talleys marriage to a White House attorney is not bothersome and should not disqualify him from his nomination.Federal judges are required by law to recuse themselves in cases that present conflicts of interest.But, Geyh said, the 800-pound gorilla was that it was not disclosed.It makes it, at the very least, incredibly poor form ...Its something that the Senate has every right to be in front of it to decide whether its a problem, said Geyh, who teaches and writes about judicial ethics and conduct.[He has never tried a case, but Trump wants to make him judge for life] Talley attracted controversy for what some say is his limited experience in practicing law and the level of partisanship he had shown in the past.The Judiciary Committee, on which Republicans outnumber Democrats, approved Talleys nomination last week on a party-line vote.His nomination is now headed to the Senate for a full confirmation vote.Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), the ranking Democrat on the committee, said the Senate should not confirm Talley.By failing to disclose that his wife is one of President Trumps lawyers, Talley has betrayed his obligation to be open and transparent with the Senate and American people, Feinstein said in a statement, adding later: Talleys nomination shouldnt be considered by the Senate unless he answers questions about this glaring omission that [clarify] matters concerning when he would recuse himself.Feinstein said reports that Donaldson has been interviewed by special counsel Robert S. Mueller IIIs team as it investigates Russian meddling in the U.S. presidential election show a clear conflict of interest that should have been disclosed.The Times reported that Muellers team recently talked to Donaldson about her notes on conversations with McGahn regarding the firing of FBI Director James B. Comey.Feinstein and other Democrats on the committee have opposed Talleys nomination, citing his lack of trial experience, and political comments he previously made on social media, on his political blog and in several opinion pieces he has written for CNN.The American Bar Association, which vets federal judicial nominees, has rated Talley as not qualified.Talley, a 36-year-old lawyer from Alabama who writes horror stories on the side, has practiced law for only three years and has yet to try a case.Before his nomination in September, he had been unequivocal about his political views.For example, one tweet from his account, which has since been made private, says, Hillary Rotten Clinton might be the best Trumpism yet.On his political blog called Government in Exile, he wrote a post with the title, A Call to Arms: Its Time to Join the National Rifle Association, in January 2013, a month after a gunman in Newtown, Conn., killed 27 people before taking his own life.He criticized gun-control advocates, who, he said, have exploited the Newtown mass shooting to advance an agenda to strip people of their Second Amendment rights.Answering written questions from Democrats on the Judiciary Committee about his previous political statements, Talley said he would recuse himself in cases in which his impartiality is questioned, as required by federal statute, and that his personal views on the Second Amendment and other issues will have no bearing on how I would rule in a case.He also said the blog post calling on people to join the NRA was meant to attract opposing views and encourage constructive discussion.[Trump judicial nominee draws more scrutiny over anti-LGBT comments: We discriminate] Challenged about his lack of trial experience, Talley said he had previously argued motions in federal district court on behalf of the state of Alabama, often through written briefs rather than in person.He also said he had argued cases before the 11th Circuit Appeals Court and the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals.He said it would be inappropriate for him to comment on his recommendation for the federal bench a decision made by two U.S. senators from Alabama, Richard C. Shelby and Luther Strange.Geyh, the law professor, said revelations of Talleys failure to disclose also could raise questions about whether his proximity to political power played a role in his nomination.We do have a cronyism concern; that because of his association with members of the Senate and members of the White House that hes being considered for a position that the ABA says hes unqualified [for], Geyh said.To what extent is the president doing this as a favor for someone he knows?To what extent is this an arrangement in favor of home state senators who are indifferent to [Talleys] qualifications?Talley graduated from Harvard Law School in 2007.Shortly after, he became a law clerk in Alabama, spending two years in a federal-district court and another two at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit.He worked as a political speechwriter for three years, first for Mitt Romneys presidential campaign in 2012 and then for Sen.Rob Portman (R-Ohio) from 2013 to 2015.In April 2015, Talley became an Alabama deputy solicitor general, a position he held for nearly two years until he became deputy assistant attorney general for the Justice Department in January.In a statement defending Talleys nomination, Grassley said he does not believe extensive trial experience is the only factor in deciding on a nominees qualifications.Mr. Talley has a wide breadth of various legal experience that has helped to expose him to different aspects of federal law and the issues that would come before him, Grassley said.Talleys nomination comes as Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) continue to intensify efforts to place conservative jurists on the federal bench.Talley and Donaldson were married in August 2015.Donaldson was an associate for the Washington law firm Jones Day before she was appointed to the White House post.She is one of several lawyers from the firm who were tapped to join the Trump administration, some as attorneys for the White House, including McGahn.Among the others: Greg Katsas, James Burnham and David Morrell, who now work in the Office of the White House Counsel.Katsas, Trumps deputy counsel, is also a judicial nominee.The Senate last week approved Katsass nomination to an appellate court in Washington.Read more: Meet the ghost hunter and horror novelist who writes Sen.Rob Portmans speeches Senate Republicans look for political victory in D.C. judicial appointment How unusual are Trumps not qualified judicial nominations?
White House not holding event for U.S. Nobel Prize recipients, a break with usual practice:::::A national library employee shows the gold Nobel Prize medal awarded to the late novelist Gabriel Garcia Marquez, in Bogota, Colombia, in 2015 (Fernando Vergara/AP) U.S. recipients of Nobel Prizes for science and economics will not meet with President Trump or be feted at the White House when they visit Washington this week, a break with past administrations.Eight American scientists and academics were announced as winners of the prestigious prizes last month.Six of them are expected to attend a Nobel symposium at the Swedish Embassy on Tuesday.The annual event is typically timed to coordinate with a White House invitation for American winners.Its just a scheduling issue, White House spokesman Raj Shah said Monday.The president congratulates this years Nobel laureates.The White House is unable to make an event work given the demands on the presidents schedule, including a 12-day trip to Asia.Trump concludes the nearly two-week trip to Asia on Tuesday, returning to Washington that evening.He originally planned to return to Washington on Tuesday morning, but extended his stay in Manila, the last Asia stop, to attend the East Asia summit Monday.Although the White House event has not been held every year, it has been customary at least since the Clinton administration.Trumps decision for this first year in office has been a topic of interest among scientists especially, because of administration policies and decisions seen as hostile to research into climate change, pollution, pesticides and more.[EPA is taking more advice from industry, ignoring its own scientists] The Nobel event typically takes place in mid- to late November, a tight window after the winners are announced in early October and before the Nobel Prize ceremony in Stockholm in early December.The decision not to invite laureates to the White House was first reported by the science and medical news website Stat News.We went through the regular channels, as we always do, and this year because of the travel it just wasnt possible, Swedish Embassy spokeswoman Kate Reuterswrd said.Scheduling the event is often tricky because of the busy fall legislative calendar, the Thanksgiving holiday and other complications, she said.Reuterswrd said Nov. 14 was chosen because it was the date when most of the laureates could attend.The White House told the embassy that neither Trump nor Pence could see the laureates that day, she said.Both the White House and the embassy expressed hope that the event could be held next year, assuming there are American winners, she added.[American among three winners of 2017 Nobel Prize for chemistry] Chemistry laureate Joachim Frank of Columbia University is among the American laureates expected to attend Tuesdays discussion and news conference at the embassy.Frank said he was not contacted by the Trump administration either when he won or in connection with a White House invitation.In an email exchange, Frank said he would not have accepted the invitation if offered.I was very relieved that there would be no chance of him being present, Frank said.The other American winners are physicists Kip S. Thorne, Barry C. Barish and Rainer Weiss; geneticists Jeffrey C. Hall, Michael Rosbash and Michael W. Young; and economist Richard H. Thaler.[Watch: Three Americans win Nobel Prize for physics] Last year, the White House events for laureates was held Nov. 30, after Thanksgiving.The event, President Barack Obamas final such meeting, was also notable for the absence of laureate Bob Dylan.The musician won the 2016 Nobel Prize in literature.Obama did not hold the event in 2009, his first year in office, when he won the Nobel Peace Prize.He met with U.S. laureates each subsequent year of his presidency.
Roy Moore might become one of the few non-Confederates booted from the Senate:::::U.S. Senate candidate and former Alabama chief justice Roy Moore packs a handgun while speaking at a rally Sept. 25 in Fairhope, Ala. (Brynn Anderson/AP) Republicans frustrated by Roy Moores insistence on staying in the race for the U.S. Senate in Alabama despite allegations of sexual misconduct seem to have settled on a strategy.As articulated by Sen. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.), chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, the idea would be to allow Moore to take his seat in the Senate, should he win next months general election, and then quickly begin the process to expel him from the body.(The Senate probably wouldnt have any choice but to seat Moore, thanks to a 1969 Supreme Court decision.)That process, in short, goes like this.(In long: Read this.)The Senate Ethics Committee conducts an investigation.If it finds grounds to expel him, the Senate can hold a vote to do so.If two-thirds choose to expel him, hes out.Republicans control the Senate, but others already seem amenable to Gardners plan.Nothing about their doing so would be normal.The Senates historian indicates that only about 30 senators have faced expulsion proceedings, most of which followed extensive tenures in the body.Only 15 were expelled, and 14 of those expulsions were of senators found to be sympathetic to the Confederacy during the Civil War.(One, John Breckinridge, was a general in the Confederate Army.Another, Jesse Bright, was expelled after a friend was found to be carrying a letter from him to Jefferson Davis, president of the Confederacy.He visits your capital mainly to dispose of what he regards a great improvement in fire-arms, the letter read in part.)More details on the expulsion investigations are below.Such an effort would not be a sure thing, even setting aside the two-thirds vote count.Because these proceedings are rare, most seem to get mired in questions about the boundaries of the Senates authority.That, and several particular examples that mirror Moores situation, might suggest that Gardners plan would be more difficult than it seems.Consider William Roach, about whom questions were raised in 1893.The allegation against Roach was that he had embezzled money when serving as a bank teller before being elected to the Senate.The Senate declined to investigate.After extensive deliberation, the Senate historian wrote, the Senate took no action, assuring that it lacked jurisdiction over members behavior before their election to the Senate.The alleged embezzlement had occurred 13 years earlier.(The historian had no dates for Roachs or Burton Wheelers allegations.)Consider, too, William Langer.Langer was accused of corruption in 1941, with residents of his state seeking to block him from taking office.The Senate historian describes the fierce debate over the charges.[Senators] were particularly concerned about the danger of establishing the precedent that the Senate could be used by a members political opponents to overturn the will of a states citizens as expressed at the polls.Referring to the majority report, the authors of the minority report, Ellison D. Smith (D-SC) and Abe Murdock (D-UT), warned the Senate, We cannot think of a better illustration of the danger of being swept away by a barrage of slander.Tom Connally (D-TX) concurred in the conclusion that there was insufficient evidence to warrant expelling or excluding Langer.A majority of the Senate voted to allow Langer to hold his seat.(Hed already been sworn in as the debate raged.)Both of those precedents might be heartening to Moore, who is accused of actions that occurred more than 30 years ago.Should he win office, an effort to expel him is not a sure thing.More-recent senators have resigned rather than face the judgment of their peers.Moore so far seems disinclined to take that step, and his history in elected office twice being censured while serving as chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court similarly suggests a willingness to see fights through to the end.Of course, there are also politics at play.Republicans worried about 2018 may be more willing to oust Moore than senators were in 1893 or 1941.The concern that arose during the Langer debate if accusations of improper action before election should be grounds for ouster will still loom.But 2018 may be looming larger.Past efforts to expel senators William Blount (R-Tenn.), 1797.Tried to incite a rebellion to return Florida and Louisiana to Britain to make money.Result: Expelled.John Smith (R-Ohio), 1807.Allegedly aiding Aaron Burr in a revolt.Result: Not expelled.James Mason (D-Va.), 1861.Support for the Confederacy.Result: Expelled.Robert Hunter (D-Va.), 1861.Support for the Confederacy.Result: Expelled.Thomas Clingman (D-N.C.), 1861.Support for the Confederacy.Result: Expelled.Thomas Bragg (D-N.C.), 1861.Support for the Confederacy.Result: Expelled.James Chesnut (D-S.C.), 1861.Support for the Confederacy.Result: Expelled.Alfred Nicholson (D-Tenn.), 1861.Support for the Confederacy.Result: Expelled.William Sebastian (D-Ark.), 1861.Support for the Confederacy.Result: Expelled.Charles Mitchel (D-Ark.), 1861.Support for the Confederacy.Result: Expelled.John Hemphill (D-Tex.), 1861.Support for the Confederacy.Result: Expelled.Louis Wigfall (D-Tex.), 1861.Support for the Confederacy.Result: Expelled.John Breckinridge (D-Ky.), 1861.Serving as a Confederate general.Result: Expelled.Lazarus Powell (D-Ky.), 1862.Support for the Confederacy.Result: Not expelled.Waldo Johnson (D-Mo.), 1862.Support for the Confederacy.Result: Expelled.Trusten Polk (D-Mo.), 1862.Support for the Confederacy.Result: Expelled.Jesse Bright (D-Ind.), 1862.Support for the Confederacy.Result: Expelled.James Simmons (R-R.I.), 1862.Corruption.Result: Resigned.James Patterson (R-N.H.), 1873.Fraud related to the transcontinental railroad.Result: Not expelled.William Roach (D-N.D.), 1893.Embezzlement.Result: Not expelled.Joseph Burton (R-Kan.), 1906.Corruption.Result: Resigned.Reed Smoot (R-Utah), 1907.Being a Mormon.Seriously.You can read more about this at the Senates site.Result: Not expelled.Robert LaFollette (R-Wis.), 1919.Sedition.Result: Not expelled.Truman Newberry (R-Mich.), 1922.Campaign finance violations.Result: Not expelled.Burton Wheeler (D-Mont.), 1924.Conflict of interest.Result: Not expelled.John Overton (D-La.), 1934.Election fraud.Result: Not expelled.Huey Long (D-La.), 1934.Election fraud.Result: Not expelled.William Langer (R-N.D.), 1942.Corruption.Result: Not expelled.Harrison Williams Jr. (D-N.J.), 1982.Corruption.Result: Resigned.Robert Packwood (R-Ore.), 1995.Abuse of power.Result: Resigned.John Ensign (R-Nev.), 2011.Corruption.Result: Resigned.
Trump personally asked Xi Jinping to help resolve case of UCLA basketball players arrested in China:::::Three UCLA basketball players were arrested Nov. 7 in Hangzhou, China, on suspicion of shoplifting.LiAngelo Ball, Cody Riley, and Jalen Hill were accused of stealing sunglasses from a Louis Vuitton store.(Victoria Walker/The Washington Post) MANILA President Trump personally asked his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, to help resolve the case of three UCLA men's basketball players who were arrested for shoplifting while in Hangzhou for a tournament last week, people familiar with the situation said Monday.Trump raised the arrests during a two-day state visit to Beijing, arriving a day after the three freshman players were accused of stealing sunglasses from a Louis Vuitton store next to the team's hotel.Guard LiAngelo Ball, brother of Los Angeles Lakers rookie guard Lonzo Ball, and forwards Cody Riley and Jalen Hill did not play in the team's victory over Georgia Tech on Saturday in Shanghai.They did not fly home with the team, and ESPN has reported that authorities have surveillance footage and that the players could be required to remain in Hangzhou for a week or two.After Trump raised the matter, Xi promised to look into the case and ensure that the players are treated fairly and expeditiously, said a U.S. official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the situation.Chief of Staff John F. Kelly has been in touch with the families of the players and has spoken with UCLA Coach Steve Alford, and Kelly remains in contact with Chinese authorities, the official added.This official indicated that charges against the players have been reduced and that the case is proceeding toward a resolution.White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders confirmed in an email that Trump raised the matter with Xi.[In Beijing, Trump declines to hit President Xi Jinping on trade: I dont blame China] The fact the charges have been reduced, and that the case appears headed toward some kind of resolution in the near future, indicates the three players have cooperated with authorities.According to the China Law Translate, the penalties for shoplifting can vary greatly.While stealing goods worth more than 2,500 yuan ($380) is supposed to merit jail time and someone stealing goods worth between 7,000 and 10,000 yuan ($1,050 and $1,510) could bring between two and three years in jail the site says the fact the players are teenagers could reduce the severity of the punishment, as could their cooperation to try to make the situation right.Doing so could include admitting wrongdoing, as well as providing compensation for the stolen goods.The State Department typically takes the lead on cases involving U.S. citizens who are arrested abroad, and the U.S. Embassy in Beijing is aware of the case, officials said.UCLA is one of the top basketball programs in the country, and the Ball family including LiAngelo's outspoken father, LaVar Ball has become well-known in the sports world.Monday afternoon, UCLA officials declined to comment on the latest developments, referring back to the schools original statement on the matter last week.After Saturdays win in Shanghai over Georgia Tech, Coach Steve Alford also elected not to elaborate beyond what he originally said in the wake of the initial reports.News of the arrests was widespread, not only in the United States but also in China, breaking just a day before Trump arrived in the country.The president spent most of two days with Xi, a stay that included a tour of the Forbidden City, a state dinner and meetings.The two leaders discussed North Korea's nuclear threat, bilateral trade relations and a host of other issues.They made no public mention of the UCLA case.Trump learned about the details of the case from aides, including Kelly, said the official familiar with the internal discussions.Secretary of State Rex Tillerson also might have spoken about the case with Trump, the official said.The arrest of the three college players overshadowed the trip UCLA and Georgia Tech took to China last week, which included a tour of the Chinese mega-corporation Alibaba.While touring the company, they met with its executive vice president, Joe Tsai, who recently came to an agreement to purchase 49 percent of the Brooklyn Nets from Russian billionaire Mikhail Prokhorov, with the option to purchase another chunk of the team believed to be 80 percent that would make him the controlling owner in four years.[Five ripples of the Nets eye-popping sale price, around the NBA and beyond] The story also eclipsed the Ball familys entry into the Chinese market.In concert with the middle sons expected participation in the game, the familys shoe and apparel business, Big Baller Brand, opened the first of two pop-up stores in Shanghai Friday.At the event, LaVar Ball declined to answer questions about the incident, which came after he had canceled a news conference to promote the opening.The father appeared to get himself in hot water last week after telling ESPN he didnt think the incident was a big deal."I'm going to wait until I get more intel on what's going on, LaVar Ball said at the time.He'll be fine.Everyone's making it a big deal.It ain't that big a deal.It is notable that LaVar Ball has gone quiet on the subject, given he has refused to be quiet about virtually anything for the past several months.As his son prepared for the NBA draft eventually becoming the No.2 overall pick by his hometown Lakers -- the Ball father became a household name across the country by virtue of his willingness to speak his mind.Most recently, he criticized Lakers Coach Luke Walton for his rotations, saying that was partly to blame for Lonzo's shooting struggles so far this season.While LiAngelo Ball remains in custody in Hangzhou, his older brother continues to suit up for his NBA team.Speaking to reporters in Phoenix Monday morning ahead of a game against the Suns, Lonzo Ball said in speaking to both his youngest brother, LaMelo, and father over the past few days, that it seems like the situation is moving closer to a resolution.Hopefully [Trump] helps him, and everything works out, he said.When I talked to my dad and my little brother, it seemed like everything was going fine, so I assume everything is going cool out there.When asked when he thinks the situation could be resolved, and when his brother and teammates could return to the United States, Lonzo Ball said, Hopefully within the next week or two."Meanwhile, the rest of the family LaVar Ball, his wife and youngest son have traveled to Hong Kong, where its second pop-up store is set to open Tuesday.UCLAs next game is at home Wednesday against the University of Central Arkansas.
Could a surge of support from women flip the House to the Democrats in 2018?:::::Thousands of people participated on Jan. 21, 2016, in the Womens March on Washington.(Sarah L. Voisin/The Washington Post) There was a theory before the 2016 presidential election that Donald Trumps political rhetoric and personal history might turn the election into a rout.Women, it was theorized, might balk at voting for the Republican at unprecedented levels, making it all-but-impossible for Trump to win the White House.Obviously, that didnt happen.While Trump did receive fewer votes, he won the electoral college and the presidency.Women backed Hillary Clinton, according to exit polling, but by a margin generally in line with how theyd voted for Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012.Men backed Trump by about the same margin as they had George W. Bush in 2000 and 2004.Despite Clintons loss, 2017 has been a year in which theres been a noticeable shift in the demonstrated power political and otherwise of women: more women running for office.A massive protest/rally in Washington in January.Uncovering decades of sexual harassment and abuse at the hands of powerful men.Clinton once said that the future is female; the present seems to be, too.At Axios, Mike Allen speculates that this might have an effect on the 2018 elections.Trump won narrowly, and his unprecedented coalition included many suburban and exurban women who couldnt stomach Hillary Clinton, Allen wrote.If those voters were to tip dramatically to Democrats in 2020, Republicans would suddenly have a massive math problem.Unless men tipped the other way.Consider what happened in 2016.Last November, women preferred Clinton by about 12 percentage points and men preferred Trump by about the same margin, according to exit polling.For women, that was a 1-point shift to the Democrats relative to 2012.For men, it was a 5-point shift to the Republicans.At the same time, the percentage of the electorate that was female declined and the percent that was male increased.That combination meant victory for Trump, however narrowly.There are margins of error here that add gray area around all of the calculations, but the pattern in recent presidential elections is fairly consistent.The chart below shows exit poll results since 1976 (as compiled by Cornells Roper Center).Since 1992, women have consistently backed the Democrats and consistently made up more than half of the electorate.The vote among men has varied more often during that period.The more immediate question for 2018 is how women and men have voted in House elections.Last year, the margin between men and women in the presidential election was the widest it has been in any presidential election since 1976.Interestingly, the margin of support for Democratic House candidates by women matched the highest since 1994.As with the presidential results, theres been a consistent pattern in House voting since 1992.More women voting, and they are more likely to vote for Democratic candidates.Since 1992, though, there have only been three elections in which the Democrats won a majority of the House: 1992, 2006 and 2008.(Democrats won more votes in 2012 but not control of the chamber.)Those are also the only three races since then in which men have backed Democrats more heavily in House races.The one election where women backed Republicans more heavily than Democrats was in the Republicans 2010 rout.On the column chart above, youll notice that the three elections with the smallest difference between how men and women voted were also 1992, 2006 and 2008, when women were more likely to support Democratic candidates by 6, 8 and 8 points respectively.This is largely because men moved to the left.In no election since 1992 have men backed Republicans more heavily in exit polling and Democrats won more House seats.Thats the question raised by 2017.Will there be a rejection of Republican candidates by women and, if there is, to what extent would it offset the vote of men?The most recent Post-ABC poll asked Americans how they plan to vote in the 2018 House races.The Democrats hold an 11-point advantage on that question.Among women, Democrats are preferred by 20 points.Among men, its tied.
Joe Biden squashes idea that he might have taken over Hillary Clintons presidential run:::::Former vice president Joe Biden is getting winks and nudges to declare his political ambitions for 2020.(Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post) In television appearances Monday, former vice president Joe Biden said he would not have taken Hillary Clintons place as the Democratic Partys 2016 presidential nominee even if he had been given the chance.Donna Brazile, the former chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, claimed in a new memoir that she considered initiating a process to swap Clinton out for Biden last year after Clinton fainted at a Sept. 11 memorial event.On NBCs Today show Monday, Biden told host Matt Lauer that Braziles book was the first time he or any of his staff heard of such a possibility.I give you my word, Biden said.I would never have taken it.I was for Hillary.I did 83 campaign events for Hillary.I think I can say I did more events and worked harder for Hillary, as hard for Hillary, as anyone else.She would have been a first-rate president.[Donna Brazile: I considered replacing Clinton with Biden as 2016 Democratic nominee] Biden noted he had already decided, long before last fall, that he was not prepared to run for president.His oldest son, Beau Biden, died of brain cancer in May 2015, and the former vice president repeatedly said last year that he knew he wouldnt be able to withstand the pressures of a campaign while grieving.I was not ready in terms of my family, Biden told Lauer.So, no, I would never have done that.Biden certainly sounded like a would-be candidate on Today as he discussed the changes he felt the Democratic Party needed to make to be successful and refused to rule out the possibility of running in 2020.He fielded questions from audience members about gun violence, President Trumps performance and whether voters would be put off by Bidens age in a presidential race.Biden, 74, would be 77 if he decided to run for president in 2020.Look, I think people have a right to ask your age, your health.I think if anyone were to run for president, you should fully disclose your medical records, he said.Right now as my mother would say, knock on wood Im healthy.Im in pretty good shape.But, you know, thats a way off.If we run, I think its a legitimate issue for people to raise..@JoeBiden's response to @MLauer asking crowd if it sounds like he's running in 2020 pic.twitter.com/NEEuIwrZM1 TODAY (@TODAYshow) November 13, 2017 In an interview on NBCs Megyn Kelly Today, host Kelly laid out the challenges Biden would face if he did enter the 2020 race.The critics will say you are too old you are going to be 77 in 2020 you wouldnt have any new ideas, you have already run twice and lost, she said.You would have to promise it would be one term only and the blue-collar Rust Belters you would need to get elected already love Donald Trump.[Joe Biden on politics of fear: The American people will not sustain this attitude for long] Biden didnt miss a beat.They love me more, he told Kelly to audience laughter.But they are right about all the first parts, correct.I am not sure I can overcome the front end, but I understand the Rust Belt.Donald Trump has no notion of what those people are going through.When Kelly asked him whether he was getting any closer to deciding, however, Biden said no.If the Lord came down and sat here and said, Look, the nomination is yours if you accept it now, I would say, No, not now, he told Kelly.Because Im not ready.Theres so much more to do in terms of finishing this book, finishing the ability to try to win back the House of Representatives.And then well see.He added: Ive become a great respecter of fate.Its not being blunt I think Im qualified to be president, but theres a lot of really talented people out there in the Democratic Party.As The Washington Posts Philip Rucker reported, Brazile would not have had the power to unilaterally replace Clinton with Biden.Nevertheless, the claims Brazile made in her new book, Hacks: The Inside Story of the Break-ins and Breakdowns that Put Donald Trump in the White House, prompted a wave of outraged responses from former Clinton campaign officials who said they do not recognize the campaign she portrays in the book.We were shocked to learn the news that Donna Brazile actively considered overturning the will of the Democratic voters by attempting to replace Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine as the Democratic Presidential and Vice Presidential nominees, read an open letter signed by more than 100 former campaign aides.It is particularly troubling and puzzling that she would seemingly buy into false Russian-fueled propaganda, spread by both the Russians and our opponent, about our candidates health.Braziles book caught the attention of Trump, who used it to launch a string of tweets accusing Crooked Hillary & the Dems of stealing the primary election.New Donna B book says she paid for and stole the Dem Primary.What about the deleted E-mails, Uranium, Podesta, the Server, plus, plus Donald J.

Is Biden considering a presidential run in 2020?:::::Biden: 'We cannot wait for others to write the future'
Rep. Andy Harris of Md. and Corey Stewart of Va. endorsed Roy Moore. Now what?:::::Update: Late Friday evening, Rep. Andy Harris (R-Md.)and Republican Corey Stewart, chairman of the Prince William board of supervisors, both of whom endorsed Roy Moore, made their first public comments on the allegations against the Alabama GOP Senate candidate.Harris said Moore should withdraw from the race if the accusations are true.Stewart, who is seeking the GOP nomination to challenge Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) next November, defended Moore, saying he didnt believe the accusers.More details here.Original story below: Maryland and Virginia Republicans who endorsed Roy Moores candidacy for U.S. Senate were silent Friday morning after accusations that Moore initiated sexual contact with minors while he was in his 30s.The Washington Post reported allegations that Moore initiated contact with a 14-year-old girl when he was a 32-year-old assistant district attorney in Alabama and pursued three other females between the ages of 16 and 18.Republican Senate candidate Corey Stewart, chairman of the Prince William Board of County Supervisors, also endorsed Moore.(Jahi Chikwendiu/The Washington Post) Moore denies any wrongdoing.In September, Rep. Andy Harris, the only Republican representing Maryland in Congress, endorsed Moore in a bitter GOP runoff election in Alabama that gripped national politics.Washington needs to be shaken up, and I cant think of a better man to do that than Judge Roy Moore, Harris said in a statement at the time.He will bring not only principle to the Senate, but also a backbone of steel.I am proud to endorse him.Harriss congressional office referred questions to his political staff.His reelection campaign did not return a call or two emails seeking comment Friday.Congressman Andy Harris owes it to his constituents and all decent Marylanders to withdraw his endorsement of Roy Moore, Fabion Seaton, a spokesman for the Maryland Democratic Party, said in a statement.Moore faces the Democratic nominee, Doug Jones, in a Dec. 12 special election.President Trump, Vice President Pence, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and others, most of whom opposed Moore in the GOP runoff election, have said he should withdraw from the Senate race if the allegations are true.Republicans in Alabama, meanwhile, have mostly rallied around him.Virginians who endorsed Moore include Prince William Board of County Supervisors Chairman Corey A. Stewart, who is running for the Republican nomination to challenge Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) and has declared himself leader of the anti-establishment wing of the state GOP.In a fundraising email in September, Stewart called Moore exactly the kind of leader we need in Washington, D.C., to advance President Trumps agenda and reverse the disastrous policies of the Obama-Clinton Democrats.Stewart did not respond to calls seeking comment Friday morning.Kaines campaign spokesman, Ian Sams, said, any person of conscience should be willing to condemn child sex abuse, and the fact Corey hasnt speaks volumes about him.Former Virginia attorney general and 2013 gubernatorial nominee Ken Cuccinelli also endorsed Moore, according to a list of endorsements listed on Moores website.Alie Hassan, a spokeswoman for Cuccinelli, said he was unavailable for comment Friday morning.She said the endorsement was from the Senate Conservatives Fund, of which Cuccinelli is president, and not a personal endorsement from Cuccinelli himself.

How polarization and splintered media are fostering a world of doubt:::::Stephen K. Bannon.(Bill OLeary/The Washington Post) One would have thought that Fox News would be the big winner from a presidential cycle that began with 17 Republican candidates.Fox is now and was over the course of the election the most prominent cable news station among Republicans, with 44 percent of Republicans identifying it as their most trusted source of news or commentary in an October Suffolk University poll.Fox News was a go-to for Republican legislators and candidates well before the election campaign began.That, as it turns out, may have been a problem.A study conducted by Harvards Berkman Klein Center released in August showed that the most effective media outlet at driving attention on social media wasnt Fox it was Breitbart.Most popular media on the right from May 2015 to Election Day (Berkman Klein Center) There have been two overlapping trends that define the political moment and which, together, put Fox at a disadvantage.The first is greater polarization.While Congress has been growing more polarized for several decades (driven largely by Republicans becoming more conservative), its only within the past decade or so that Americans have joined them.Pew Research has surveyed Americans on a range of policy issues since 1994; its only in the past decade or so that Democrats and Republicans significantly pulled apart.As it stands, 95 percent of Republicans are more conservative than the median Democrat.Ninety-seven percent of Democrats are more liberal than the median Republican.The other trend, which overlaps with the timeline of polarization, is the splintering of media sources, thanks to the Internet and social media.While television news had already fragmented during the growth of cable, there was still a substantial barrier to entry for starting a new cable station that produced news content.The Web, Twitter and Facebook obliterated the barrier to entry while simultaneously making it trivial to share information widely.Theres another aspect to the issue of polarization worth highlighting.Not only do Democrats and Republicans more broadly disagree with one another on policy, but they are also much more likely than in years past to view each other negatively.Last year, more than half of Democrats and Republicans viewed members of the other party very unfavorably with more than 40 percent saying that the other political party is a threat to the nations well-being.Its easy to see a marketplace that might emerge.We have a lot of chicken-egg issues here Did polarization follow a splintered media environment?Does polarized news foster or follow dislike of the other party?but theres at least a symbiosis that allows for politically polarized media outlets.Lets layer on another common characteristic of the political moment: cherry-picking.I keep returning to an essay Lawrence Lessig wrote in 2009 for the New Republic.In it, he argued that there was a downside to making government documents public: People could use a surfeit of data points to cobble together speculative arguments.The best analogy for this is the strung-together conspiracy theories from the film A Beautiful Mind.If youre looking for something, the more you have to work with, the easier it is to find the pattern youre looking for.Once upon a time, Fox News had someone who did exactly that.Glenn Beck would create webs of largely unfounded allegations that impugned his political opponents and then rail against them for an hour a day.In 2011, Beck left Fox News, starting his own network.In an interview that year, former Fox News head Roger Ailes explained the thinking to Fox host Howard Kurtz.[As] President Obamas popularity has plummeted and the country has grown increasingly sick of partisan sniping, something unexpected happened.Roger Ailes pulled back a bit on the throttle.He calls it a course correction, quietly adopted at Fox over the last year.Glenn Becks inflammatory rhetoric his ranting about Obama being a racist became a bit of a branding issue for us before the hot-button host left in July, Ailes says.The extent to which Fox actually let up on the throttle is debatable, but its certainly the case that Fox News ceded space to its right.During the 2016 election, Breitbart (and many others) happily nested there.That Fox was also the favored network of the Republican establishment itself a remarkable victory for the network worked against it in an election when the partys base was clamoring for someone to challenge the establishment from both parties.Fox News still owned the airwaves, but Breitbart largely owned everywhere else.There was still space further to its right in the hazy, conspiracy theory land of Gateway Pundit and Infowars, but Breitbart became a mainstream force by being harder right and less establishment than Fox.[McConnell calls on Roy Moore to end Senate campaign following accusations of sexual misconduct] When he left the White House as a presidential adviser, Stephen K. Bannon returned to run the site, as he had before joining Donald Trumps campaign in the summer of 2016.Bannon pledged to use the site to bolster Trumps politics.Now Im free.Ive got my hands back on my weapons, he told the Weekly Standard after he left, adding: I am definitely going to crush the opposition.Theres no doubt.Over the weekend, Bannon demonstrated what deploying those weapons entails, sending two Breitbart employees to Alabama to, in the words of Axioss Jonathan Swan, discredit The Washington Posts reporting on Roy Moores alleged sexual misconduct with teenagers.Consider whats being described: an effort to cherry-pick information that can be used to bolster a largely partisan view that the allegations against Moore involving attempted sexual contact with a young teenager are invalid.Breitbart did indeed weaponize the overlap of online media and partisanship, and this is how that weapon is deployed.(One of the first stories to result from this effort was headlined Mother of Roy Moore Accuser: Washington Post Reporters Convinced My Daughter to Go Public.This was an exclusive the site claimed ...despite the point being mentioned in The Posts original story.)One of the things about the Internet is that there are large audiences for things that one might not expect.The example I like to use here is furries: Before the rise of the Internet, few people realized that there were large populations of adult Americans who enjoyed dressing up as animals.Now, there are furry conventions.The Internet proved the audience.So, too, theres an audience for news reinforcing partisan positions and negative partisan allegations.The universe is infinite; theres always an audience closer to the poles than you realize.There was an audience last year for a theory that Hillary Clintons presidential campaign chairman was involved in a secret child-sex-slavery ring operated out of a D.C. pizza shop.It was a large enough audience that a guy drove across multiple state lines armed with a rifle to investigate.When he got there, he learned that there was no such ring.The intel on this wasnt 100 percent, the man, Edgar Welch, told the New York Times.Which, as Ive noted before, is wrong.The intelligence was 100 percent accurate: It just showed that there wasnt any such conspiracy taking place.Welch wasnt interested in that accurate intel, though.Theres a market for political intel that isnt 100 percent accurate in an America where nearly half of one party thinks the other is a threat to the nation which means that someone in this splintered media environment will work to meet that demand.It also means that there can be a temptation to drift further to the edges.Fox News ratings have recently rebounded from trailing MSNBC earlier this year, the Times reports, largely thanks to its reembrace of partisan politics.
Supreme Court takes case on free speech rights of antiabortion counseling centers:::::The Supreme Court said Monday that it would decide whether it violates free speech guarantees for California to require crisis pregnancy centers, which counsel against abortion, to tell patients that the state offers contraception services and abortion assistance.The case is one of three raising First Amendment concerns that the court announced it will hear early next year.Another involves a Minnesota law that bans wearing political messages at polling places.The third stems from the arrest of a man who spoke out against corruption at a Florida city council meeting.The California case promises to be a high-profile conflict that raises important free speech issues about when a states intent to regulate the medical profession violates constitutional protections.Crisis pregnancy centers provide services for pregnant women and try to persuade them not to end their pregnancies.But some state legislatures, including Californias, have charged that they use deceptive advertising and confuse and even intimidate women who think they are going to receive more neutral abortion counseling.Californias Reproductive FACT Act requires the centers to disclose whether they have medical personnel on staff and to inform women that the state offers subsidized contraceptives and abortion.A panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit upheld the law, saying the state could regulate professional speech and had a valid interest in safeguarding public health.The required sign did not encourage abortion, the judges said, but merely informed patients of available state services.But the centers said they are targeted because their message is unpopular with the states leaders.The state, rather than using countless alternative ways to communicate its message, including its own powerful voice, instead compels only licensed facilities that help women consider alternatives to abortion to express the governments message regarding how to obtain abortions paid for by the state, says the petition filed by the National Institute of Family and Life Advocates.The case is NIFLA v. Becerra.With the acceptance of the cases, the term will be heavy with First Amendment challenges.The court next month hears what could be the marquee case of the term, when it examines whether a Colorado law that says a baker must make a wedding cake for a same-sex couple violates constitutional protections against compelled speech.The baker says creating such a cake would be an endorsement of the marriage his religious beliefs do not allow.The polling-place case the court accepted Monday challenges a Minnesota law prohibiting voters from wearing T-shirts or political badges, buttons or other insignia with overtly political messages.Violators are asked to cover up or remove the items, but elections officials are told not to bar them from voting.Andrew Cilek, executive director of the Minnesota Voters Alliance, was delayed from voting in 2010 because he wore to the polls a T-shirt with a tea party logo and a button that said Please I.D.Me.The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit upheld the law, saying it was intended to maintain peace, order and decorum at polling precincts.At least 10 other states have similar laws.This is an encouraging day for the cause of free speech and freedom of expression, said Wen Fa, an attorney for the Pacific Legal Foundation, which is representing the voters group.With this case, the Supreme Court has an opportunity to strike a blow for core constitutional freedoms, by declaring that Minnesota cant turn polling places into First Amendment-free zones.The case is Minnesota Voters Alliance v. Mansky.The Florida case means a return to the Supreme Court for Fane Lozman, who previously won a landmark ruling from the court that said his floating home was a house, not a vessel subject to maritime seizure laws.This time, Lozman is suing because of his arrest at a 2006 Riviera Beach City Council meeting.He was never prosecuted on charges of disrupting the meeting, and he then sued the city, charging that the arrest was retaliation and violated his free speech rights.A jury and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit ruled against him.They said because there was probable cause for the arrest, he could not bring his suit.Represented by lawyers at the Stanford Supreme Court Litigation Center, Lozman says lower courts are divided on the issue of whether a finding of probable cause is enough to defeat a claim of retaliatory arrest.Recent years have seen a fresh surge of civic engagement, much of it involving criticism of the government, Lozman said in his petition to the court.Thus, the risks of retaliatory arrests remains a pressing concern.The city council says the decision to arrest Lozman was made by the police officer, even though a council member had warned Lozman not to continue his tirade against government corruption during the public comments portion of the meeting.The case is Lozman v. City of Riviera Beach.

Befuddled by group handshake, Trump strains, grimaces and finally succeeds:::::U.S. President Donald Trump gathered with world leaders on Nov. 13 at the ASEAN Summit in Manila.(US Department of State) U.S. President Donald Trump gathered with world leaders on Nov. 13 at the ASEAN Summit in Manila.(US Department of State) Nevertheless, he persisted.President Trump, after some brief confusion, managed to successfully execute a traditional handshake for a group photo at a summit in the Philippines.But first, the presidents unintentionally comedic struggles went viral.Appearing at the Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit here, Trump was momentarily befuddled by the traditional group handshake, in which the leaders cross their right arms over their left and grasp the hands of the fellow participants on both sides.Give us your brightest smile, an emcee intoned as the leaders lined up onstage for their star turn.President Trump crosses his arms for the traditional ASEAN handshake with other leaders, including, from left, Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc, Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte and Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, during the opening ceremony of the ASEAN Summit in Manila, on Monday.(Jonathan Ernst/Reuters) But Trump could not quite do that, nor could he muster the ritual greeting.The president first crossed his hands in front of him, and then, after glancing at the leaders on either side, made a second attempt, this time lifting his arms outward, according to an Associated Press report.Finally, Trump alighted on the correct pose: He strained to reach the hand of the far shorter Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte on his left and completed the maneuver with a wincing grimace.Handshakes have long held outsize significance for Trump, who uses them to size up potential rivals, assert his dominance or convey warm sentiments.In Brussels in May, Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron engaged in a jaw-clenching, face-tightening, knuckle-whitening handshake for six full seconds, with each man trying to claim the alpha status.In February, Trump greeted Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, with whom he has a friendlier relationship, with a handshake that lasted 19 seconds, included two firm pats from Trump on the back of Abes hand.It ended with the president declaring, approvingly, Strong hands.This week, on Trumps first stop in Japan on his five-country, 12-day Asia trip, a fist bump between the president and Abe while golfing was viewed as a sign of the good relations between the two leaders.Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc , President Trump, Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte and Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull cross their arms to shake hands.(Jonathan Ernst/Reuters) And a March photo opportunity, in which Trump failed to shake hands with German Chancellor Angela Merkel in front of cameras, was viewed as a snub of the German leader.But speaking to reporters Saturday as he flew from Danang, Vietnam, to Hanoi, Trump brought up the missed greeting unprompted, saying he simply hadnt heard the calls for him to shake hands with Merkel.I get along very well with Angela, he said.You people dont write that.I actually get along really well with Angela.With one day left on Trumps Asia trip before he returns to the United States, White House photographers are no doubt adjusting their apertures, eagerly awaiting the next greeting be it fraught, symbolic or, as in this case, just downright and delightfully bungled.
Trump boasts of great relationship with Philippines Duterte at first formal meeting:::::While attending the Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit in the Philippines, President Trump met with the country's controversial leader, Rodrigo Duterte, on Nov. 13.(Reuters) While attending the Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit in the Philippines, President Trump met with the country's controversial leader, Rodrigo Duterte, on Nov. 13.(Reuters) President Trump met here Monday with Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte amid questions from human rights advocates about whether Trump would confront his counterpart over a bloody drug war that has resulted in thousands of extrajudicial killings.Trump praised Duterte for doing an unbelievable job in combating the illicit drug trade during a private phone call in April that focused mostly on North Korea.In that call, the contents of which were first revealed in detail in May by The Washington Post, Trump also invited Duterte to visit the White House.The two leaders met for the first time briefly on Friday at an economic summit in Danang, Vietnam, and were photographed raising wine glasses together in a toast at the opening dinner of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations forum on Sunday.Images of them appearing at ease with one another and, like other leaders at the summit, wearing traditional barong Tagalog shirts, were published in Philippine newspapers.On two occasions, however, Trump declined to answer shouted questions from reporters about whether he had pressed Duterte on human rights.[Trumps incoherent message to U.S. allies in Asia] President Trump toasts with Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte at an ASEAN Summit dinner in Manila on Nov. 12, 2017.(Andrew Harnik/AP) Weve had a great relationship, Trump told reporters, sitting with Duterte at the start of the bilateral meeting.This has been very successful.He praised Dutertes handling of the summit and said, Ive really enjoyed being here.As Trump pivoted to talking about the nice weather in Manila, Duterte cut off the American reporters who tried to press Trump on human rights.Whoa, whoa, he protested.This is not a press statement.This is the bilateral meeting.Duterte at one point called reporters spies, prompting Trump to chuckle.You are, Duterte repeated.A spokesman for Duterte said after the meeting that human rights did not come up, although the Philippine leader did raise his efforts in the drug menace.White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told American reporters that the two leaders spoke about combating terrorism and illegal drugs, as well as bilateral trade.Human rights, she said, came up briefly in the context of the Philippines drug war.She did not elaborate.Ahead of his visit here, Trump boasted that he expected things to go a lot better than during the last trip to the Philippines by President Barack Obama.However, Trump appeared to mix up his references.Obama canceled a bilateral meeting with Duterte in September 2016 after the Philippine leader made derogatory comments about him and the United States, a longtime treaty ally.Obamas 2015 visit to Manila went smoothly before Duterte was elected.Protesters burn an effigy of President Trump during the ASEAN Summit in Manila, on Nov. 13, 2017.(Bullit Marquez/AP) I have a sense that he is not going to address human rights, largely because he is trying to build a relationship with Duterte.This 10-day trip is about building alliances in response to North Korea, said James Zarsadiaz, director of the Yuchengco Philippine Studies program at the University of San Francisco.[Dutertes assistant is a selfie king] White House aides said Trump routinely brings up human rights in his private conversations with world leaders, and in a couple of notable instances he has addressed the matter in public on his five-nation Asia trip.In a speech to the South Korean parliament, Trump called North Korea a hell no person deserves, and he laid out in sometimes gruesome detail the abuses Pyongyang has perpetrated including purportedly killing babies and carting the bodies away in buckets.In Tokyo, Trump met with the families of Japanese citizens who were abducted by North Korean agents four decades earlier.Other presidents, including Obama and George W. Bush, also met with the families.Well work together and see if we can do something, now the spotlight is on, Trump said at a news conference with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, calling the abductions a very, very sad thing.Yet Trump has not talked about human rights more broadly outside the context of North Korea.He has yet to make any public statement in the two months since the Burmese military escalated a brutally violent campaign against the Rohingya ethnic minority, Muslims who have been systematically slaughtered by the Buddhist majority in a campaign the United Nations top human rights official called a textbook example of genocide.In Vietnam, Trump embraced the communist nations leaders, paying a state visit to Hanoi, without publicly raising the ongoing crackdown on political speech and independent journalists.Obama also embraced Hanoi, but his administration insisted on the release of hundreds of prisoners and had sought to use a 12-nation trade deal, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, to enact new protections for workers in Vietnam and elsewhere.Trump, on his third day in office, removed the United States from that deal.On Thursday, as Trump flew from China to Vietnam, a White House official told reporters aboard Air Force One that Trump has been quite concerned about Burma.Its come up in a number of his conversations with Southeast Asian leaders, and certainly hell be discussing it, and publicly as well, said the official, who was not authorized to speak on the record.As of Monday afternoon, Trump had yet so do so.The question of whether Trump will press Duterte on human rights is often talked about as a test of U.S. power, both in the Philippines and in the region as a whole.[As Trump arrives, a young victim of Dutertes drug war is mourned] Though the Obama administration promised a pivot to Asia, in part structured on human rights and U.S. values diplomacy, there has long been a sense that U.S. influence in the Asia-Pacific region is waning while Chinas is on the rise.Over the last decade, China has stepped up trade, investment and tourism in Southeast Asia, becoming a major economic player with close ties to the political and military elite.All 10 ASEAN member states joined the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, a Chinese-led multilateral financial institution that is issuing billions in loans.An authoritarian state that sharply curtails free speech and political dissent, China has not tied human rights reforms or worker protections to its economic largesse.The Obama administration sought to align ASEAN around common values that include human rights.But the 10 regional member countries have widely disparate political systems some democratic, some authoritarian and economic systems.Aides, including Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, said Trump believes it is more effective to discuss such human rights issues in private; Trump has helped gain the release of a number of Americans who had been detained in Asia and the Middle East.The president railed about North Koreas mistreatment of American college student Otto Warmbier, who died shortly after being released from 17 months of captivity in Pyongyang.Across both East and Southeast Asia, U.S. allies are uncertain about what Trump stands for and nervous about what he does next, said Richard Heydarian, a security analyst and author of The Rise of Duterte.They see a total collapse of American soft power, largely because of Trump, and also American structural decline, especially relative to China, he said.But its a mistake to see this as a clear win for the Chinese, he added.Despite Chinas spending in Southeast Asia, countries are not ready to align with Beijing, which is seen as a bully over its military-led maritime expansion in the South China Sea and its economic pressure.[When strongmen meet: Trump and Duterte in Manila] Absent a clear leader in the region, middle-power countries, including Japan, Australia and India, are stepping up their own diplomacy.Trump was scheduled to meet with the leaders from each of those countries on Monday amid talk that they would form a quad of powers to help hedge against China in the Indo-Pacific.Duterte made his frustration with the United States clear, lashing out at Obama for criticizing the anti-drug campaign and threatening to curtail U.S.-Philippine military ties.He announced that he wanted a divorce from the United States and planned to align himself with Chinas ideological flow.China, in turn, promised money for major infrastructure projects and military upgrades.But despite protests against Trump in Manila during his visit, a majority of Filipinos are more comfortable with the United States than with China and are certainly not prepared to cast their lot with Beijing alone.Dutertes administration has continued to work with the United States on a range of issues and still takes money for counternarcotics work, police training and other things.In the run-up to Trumps visit, Duterte struck an almost conciliatory tone.The upshot is that U.S. influence in the Philippines is not over, and Trump probably has the political capital to nudge Duterte on the drug war, should he choose to do so, experts said.The credibility of the U.S. is at stake because of Trumps unsophisticated ways in diplomacy, said Zarsadiaz, the Philippine studies director.In the grand scheme of things, in Asia, there is still this sense that the U.S. is an arbiter of justice....Time will tell whether Trump will follow the lead of congressional leaders, of the U.N., of Amnesty International, and stand behind what are seen as American principles.
Trump picks Alex Azar to lead Health and Human Services Department:::::What to do with Roy Moore?The White House and leading Republicans split, again
For Roy Moores insistent defenders: Heres why now.:::::Alabama GOP Senate nominee Roy Moore delivers remarks to the Mid-Alabama Republican Club.This is the first time Moore has spoken publicly since allegations of sexual misconduct with an underage girl.(Cameron Carnes/The Washington Post) Theres been a consistent refrain from those seeking to discredit The Washington Posts reporting that uncovered a 1979 incident in which Alabama Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore allegedly fondled a 14-year-old girl: Why now?Why is it only a month before the election that this story came to light, after being unmentioned for the past 40 years?Here, for example, is Moore himself making the argument: To think grown women would wait 40 years before a general election to bring charges is unbelievable, he said at an event in Alabama over the weekend.He later added, Isnt it strange after 40 years of constant investigation, that people have waited four weeks before a general election to bring their complaint?Thats not a coincidence.Of course its not a coincidence that the women came forward just as Moore is seeking election to the Senate but not in the way Moore means.Moore has been a controversial figure in American politics for some time but mostly at the edges.His fight to preserve a monument to the Ten Commandments in a state building 15 years ago gained him national attention but not necessarily national importance.Now, hes seeking election to the Senate, one of 100 people who make up one half of the legislative branch of government.Its a much more important fight nationally, and, as a result, has attracted much more attention.Theres a reason that people with skeletons in their closets are loath to seek elected office: Once they do, the scrutiny that is a natural part of the campaign process threatens to expose those skeletons.This is less true for lower-level elected positions, where there is less media attention and fewer resources.For something like the Senate or the presidency, though, that scrutiny is both intense and should be expected.In this case, reporter Stephanie McCrummen was in Alabama as part of The Posts coverage of the race.She explained the genesis of the story to NPR last week.I was in Alabama actually reporting another story on Roy Moore supporters, a story aiming to understand, you know, the basis of his support in the state.And it was at the end of a long conversation with someone there that these allegations surfaced.So none of these women none of the women in this story sought out The Washington Post.No one promoted this story to The Washington Post.And all of the women went through quite a long process deciding whether to come forward.Weve seen a similar difficult deliberative process in other recent allegations that have made headlines.Moores claim that its unbelievable that it could take 40 years for these stories to come to light ignores dozens of recent examples of allegations against men in positions of power that took decades to surface.Its important to note that McCrummen wasnt the only Post reporter covering the race.In late September, shortly before the primary, our Michael Scherer profiled Moore, including a two-hour interview conducted as the pair drove to visit Moores mother.When Moore came to Washington, our Sean Sullivan covered his visit.Had either Scherer or Sullivan heard the same rumors as McCrummen rumors, weve learned over the past few days, that have been around for years its safe to say that they, too, would have investigated further.That, of course, is what reporting is about: telling important stories.Sometimes that means convincing people who know the stories to come forward, as The Posts team did with the four women sharing stories about Moores alleged interest in teenage girls, including Leigh Corfman, the girl who was 14.The original story noted that [n]either Corfman nor any of the other women sought out The Post.After learning about them, two Post reporters contacted and interviewed the four women.All were initially reluctant to speak publicly but chose to do so after multiple interviews, saying they thought it was important for people to know about their interactions with Moore.Why was it important?Presumably because of the timing.Because now.For 40 years, as Moore and his defenders point out, the women kept their stories close, telling some friends and family (and, in Corfmans case, one former boyfriend) but not the public at large.Its important for Alabamians at large to know about those interactions now presumably because Moore is running for the Senate.The same reason its important for The Post and other outlets to cover who he is and what he believes, as Scherer, Sullivan and McCrummen all have.The point of asking why now is not usually a good-faith effort to understand why the interactions only just came to light.It is usually simply meant to raise uncertainty about the womens stories and, therefore, about the allegations against Moore.It is up to the voters of Alabama to decide if the allegations against Moore are a reason to oppose his candidacy; they may decide that they are not.The Posts role is simply to bring the stories to light.Theres a more subtle aspect to why now thats worth pointing out.Why did the story drop last week?Because that was when the story was ready, after dozens of interviews and a great deal of verification, down to the date of court appearances 38 years ago.Why now?Because thats when an important story about a man who is right now seeking election to the Senate was unearthed, researched and vetted.Its no more complicated than that.
Theresa May vows to tackle 'inhuman destruction of Rohingya people':::::Theresa May has said the Rohingya crisis "looks like ethnic cleansing", during a speech in which she praised Sky News' "heartbreaking" reports on Myanmar's brutal crackdown.In a major foreign policy address, at the Lord Mayor's Banquet in the City of London, the Prime Minister pledged to deepen partnerships with countries in Asia to combat major issues."This includes tackling the problems in the region today - such as North Korea, where we have played a leading role in securing sanctions in response to the regime's outrageous proliferation of nuclear weapons," she said.:: Explained: The Rohingya refugee crisis Video: Starvation and death on the beaches And paying tribute to Sky's coverage, Mrs May said: "And it includes continuing to step up our efforts to respond to the desperate plight of Rohingyas - brought home to us again on our TV screens so graphically today, with heartbreaking images of young children emaciated and pleading for help."This is a major humanitarian crisis which looks like ethnic cleansing."And it is something for which the Burmese authorities - and especially the military - must take full responsibility."The Prime Minister added: "The UK is already the largest donor in response to this crisis."And we will continue to play a leading role in bringing the international community together - working through the UN and with regional partners to do everything possible to stop this appalling and inhuman destruction of the Rohingya people.":: Exclusive: The depth of Rohingya crisis revealed Video: Rohingya children beaten in refugee camps Mrs May also used her speech to launch a powerful attack on President Vladimir Putin's foreign policies and pledge the UK will continue to play a leading diplomatic role after Brexit.The Prime Minister suggested a post-Brexit trade deal would support Europe's commitment to open economies and free societies in the face of Russian threats to the international order."As I said in my speech in Florence, the UK will remain unconditionally committed to maintaining Europe's security," she said."And the comprehensive new economic partnership we seek will underpin our shared commitment to open economies and free societies in the face of those who seek to undermine them."Chief among those today, of course, is Russia.Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea was the first time since the Second World War that one sovereign nation has forcibly taken territory from another in Europe."Since then, Russia has fomented conflict in the Donbass, repeatedly violated the national airspace of several European countries, and mounted a sustained campaign of cyber-espionage and disruption.:: Analysis: UK 'shirking responsibility' on Rohingya crisis Video: Rohingya sex trafficker: 'Five pounds for each girl' Mrs May accused Russia of "seeking to weaponise information" as she criticised Moscow's meddling in elections and hacking of Denmark's defence ministry and the German parliament."Deploying its state-run media organisations to plant fake stories and photo-shopped images in an attempt to sow discord in the West and undermine our institutions," she said."So I have a very simple message for Russia.We know what you are doing.And you will not succeed."Because you underestimate the resilience of our democracies, the enduring attraction of free and open societies, and the commitment of Western nations to the alliances that bind us."The UK will do what is necessary to protect ourselves, and work with our allies to do likewise."The Prime Minister announced that Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson will visit Moscow in the coming months for talks, as she promised Britain will "take the necessary actions to counter Russian activity".But she added current tensions are "not the relationship with Russia we want".:: Why is Rohingya crisis not classed as genocide?Image: More than 600,000 Rohingya

the United Kingdom, Europe and the world."As a permanent member of the UN Security Council, Russia has the reach and the responsibility to play a vital role in promoting international

would visit Jordan later this month to discuss its moves to deal with the challenge of refugees from Syria.And claiming that Britain is at forefront of international efforts in the fight against Islamic State and Islamist terrorism, Mrs May warned the Government would order military intervention where necessary."Of course we must never be paralysed by the myth that armed intervention is doomed to fail," she said."And the UK is not and will not be afraid to deploy its hard power where necessary."And on Africa, the Prime Minister revealed she has asked the new International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt, who succeeded Priti Patel last week, to link aid and trade."It is our partnership with the countries of Asia and Africa in particular that will define the course the world takes," Mrs May said.
Westminster harassment: TV producer Daisy Goodwin says she was 'groped' at Number 10:::::Westminster's sexual harassment scandal has threatened to enter Downing Street after a top TV producer claimed she was once groped in Number 10.Daisy Goodwin, the creator of ITV series Victoria, claims that a male Government official "put his hand on my breast" during a meeting.The alleged incident took place during David Cameron's time as prime minister between 2010 and 2016.Number 10 promised a Cabinet Office investigation should a formal complaint be made, with a spokesperson saying such allegations are treated "very seriously".It is the latest in a series of claims to hit officials and politicians across the UK's parties.Image: The incident is alleged to have occurred at Number 10 between 2010 and 2016 Ms Goodwin, who is also a poetry anthologist and novelist, said the ongoing scandal of harassment claims at Westminster, as well as in Hollywood, encouraged her to speak out.She told the Radio Times how she had discussed a proposed TV programme with the official during a meeting at Number 10."At the end of the meeting we both stood up and the official, to my astonishment, put his hand on my breast," Ms Goodwin said."I looked at the hand and then in my best Lady Bracknell voice said: 'Are you actually touching my breast?'"He dropped his hand and laughed nervously."Ms Goodwin said she had left Downing Street in anger but had not thought to report the official.Video: PM on 'deeply troubling' harassment culture Outlining why she was now speaking publicly about the incident, Ms Goodwin added: "Now, in the light of all the really shocking stories that have come out about abusive behaviour by men in power from Hollywood to Westminster, I wonder if my 'Keep Calm and Carry On' philosophy, inherited from my parents, was correct?"The answer is, I am not sure."I think humiliating the official was probably the appropriate punishment, but suppose he tried it on with someone less able to defend themselves?"The Cabinet Office is currently conducting investigations into allegations of impropriety against Theresa May's deputy Damian Green and international trade minister Mark Garnier.Last week, the Prime Minister announced cross-party proposals to bolster safeguarding measures for staff in Westminster.
Boris Johnson apologises to Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe over 'anguish':::::Boris Johnson has apologised to Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe for the "further anguish" caused by his error over her detention in Iran.The Foreign Secretary admitted his remarks "could and should have been clearer" when he previously stated the British-Iranian national was training journalists in Iran prior to her arrest.During a House of Commons grilling, Mr Johnson told MPs: "The British Government has no doubt Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was in Iran on holiday and that was the sole purpose of her visit."My remarks on the subject before the Foreign Affairs Committee could and should have been clearer and I acknowledge that the words I used were open to being misinterpreted, and I apologise."I apologise to Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe and her family if I have inadvertently caused them any further anguish."Mr Johnson's comments about Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe have sparked fears the 38-year-old could face a longer jail sentence.Both the Iranian judiciary and media have used the Foreign Secretary's words as justification for her imprisonment, leading to calls for Mr Johnson to resign.Image: Boris Johnson faced another grilling by MPs over Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe's case Labour's shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry, who forced Mr Johnson to face MPs on Monday with her urgent question, took issue with the Foreign Secretary's suggestion his comments were "misinterpreted" as she demanded he "unequivocally" state he "simply got it wrong".She told the Foreign Secretary his "pride matters not one ounce compared to Nazanin's freedom".Responding, Mr Johnson said: "Of course I apologise for the distress and suffering that has been caused by the impression that I gave that the Government believe, and I believe, that she was there in a professional capacity."She was there on holiday.I do apologise, and of course I retract any suggestion that she was there in a professional capacity."Video: Boris 'absolutely' the man to bring Nazanin home Under further pressure from Labour MPs to confess to an error, Mr Johnson acknowledged his "mistake" and admitted: "It was wrong of me to say she was there in a professional capacity."Following Mr Johnson's appearance in the House of Commons, Mrs Zagahri-Ratcliffe's husband, Richard Ratcliffe, told Sky News he would not be joining demands for the Foreign Secretary to resign."It's important that the Foreign Secretary stays to see it through and brings Nazanin home," he said.Mr Ratcliffe stressed he did not want to be seen as "some sort of political agitator" in Iran, which could allow the regime to "build a conspiracy".But Mr Ratcliffe did reveal his anger with the Government's handling of his wife's case, adding: "Don't get me wrong, I've not always been happy with the Government, the Government knows that behind closed doors, the Government knows that on the media and so on."I'm pretty transparent about that.But at the same time I'm not trying to push for anyone to lose their job, I'm just trying to bring Nazanin home."Monique Villa, the chief executive of Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's employers, the Thomson Reuters Foundation, also backed away from calling for Mr Johnson to go.Ahead of Mr Johnson's planned visit to Tehran in the next few weeks, she told Sky News: "Boris Johnson now has a mission and I want him to execute on his mission.Image: Richard Ratcliffe revealed his anger at the Government's response to his wife's detention "He's certainly the right person now to go and compensate for the enormous harm he has done."Ms Villa revealed Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who works as a project manager for the charitable arm of the Thomson Reuters news agency, is "now very seriously worried" about lumps she has found on her breasts.Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe has been detained in Iran's capital since April last year, when she was arrested at Tehran airport as she attempted to return home together with her young daughter, Gabriella.She is accused of plotting to overthrow the country's regime.Downing Street has said offering Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe diplomatic protection is "one of the options" being considered.The Government's response to her plight came in for renewed scrutiny on Sunday after Environment Secretary Michael Gove said he did not know why Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was in Iran when she was arrested.
David Davis under fire over pledge for MPs' vote on Brexit deal:::::The Government has bolstered its commitment for Parliament to have the final say on a Brexit deal - but immediately faced a backlash for not guarding against the UK leaving the EU without an agreement.Brexit Secretary David Davis unveiled plans for the UK's divorce deal to be written into law, meaning both MPs and peers will be afforded a vote on the agreement between London and Brussels.The proposed Withdrawal Agreement and Implementation Bill will cover issues such as an agreement on citizens' rights, the UK's financial settlement and the details of a transitional period.Mr Davis told MPs: "I can now confirm that once we have reached an agreement we will bring forward a specific piece of primary legislation to implement the agreement."This confirms that the major policy set out in the withdrawal agreement will be directly implemented into UK law by primary legislation, not by secondary legislation with the Withdrawal Bill."This also means that Parliament will be given time to debate, scrutinise and vote on the final agreement we strike with the EU."This agreement will only hold if Parliament approves it."But pointless if we have enshrined a drop dead date in the Bill, & get a deal at 11th hour!Thered be no time!Heidi Allen (@heidiallen75) November 13, 2017 The move comes ahead of a pivotal week for the Government's other key Brexit legislation, with more than 400 amendments tabled to the EU Withdrawal Bill - planned to convert EU law into UK law before March 2019 - ahead of its return to the House of Commons on Tuesday.Mr Davis's announcement appears to be a concession to pro-Remain Tories amid the threat of a rebellion causing a Government defeat.Conservative backbenchers previously warned they were ready to support an amendment demanding the UK's divorce deal is approved by an Act of Parliament.Former attorney-general Dominic Grieve, who brought the amendment, has revealed he and other Conservative MPs have recently been in talks with Downing Street over the legislation.But the Government's beefed-up promise for a parliamentary vote did not dispel concerns surrounding the EU Withdrawal Bill.Mr Davis confirmed MPs and peers will be given a take-it-or-leave-it choice on the Brexit deal, as he explained if Parliament rejects a withdrawal agreement, Britain will still leave the EU.Video: David Davis on the future of Brexit - full interview Tory backbencher Heidi Allen branded Mr Davis's plan "pointless" as she also highlighted the Government's intention to alter legislation to state Britain's membership of the EU will formally end at 11pm on 29 March, 2019.She posted on Twitter: "Pointless if we have enshrined a drop dead date in the Bill, & get a deal at 11th hour!There'd be no time!"And also offers no safeguard if no deal is reached.Unacceptable."Fellow Conservative MP Antoinette Sandbach similarly labelled the Government's promise "meaningless" should Brexit talks slip beyond March 2019.Meanwhile, former Tory constitution minister John Penrose welcomed the Government's stronger pledge on a parliamentary vote, but expressed continuing concerns over the use of so-called "Henry VIII powers" as provided by the EU Withdrawal Bill.Labour's shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer branded Mr Davis's actions "a significant climbdown from a weak Government on the verge of defeat"."With less than 24 hours before they had to defend their flawed bill to Parliament they have finally backed down," he said."However, like everything with this Government the devil will be in the detail."Liberal Democrat Brexit spokesperson Tom Brake said a parliamentary vote "simply isn't good enough" as he repeated his party's call for a second EU referendum on the terms of a Brexit deal.
Firms deliver Brexit warning to May at Downing Street talks:::::Business groups from across the EU have warned Theresa May on the threat to investment and jobs without "urgent progress" in Brexit talks within the next two weeks.The delegation visited Downing Street to voice fears that current uncertainty over the UK's future trading relationship with the EU was damaging to firms across the continent.Business groups from countries including Germany, France and Ireland joined UK counterparts in urging both sides in the break-up to heed their united stance on the need for trade talks to be given the green light by EU leaders at their December summit in two weeks' time.As we leave the EU, we must do all we can to ensure that UK and EU businesses continue to thrive side-by-side.Thats why it was so important to speak to European business leaders in Downing Street this morning: pic.twitter.com/TtQTPgFLc0 Theresa May (@theresa_may) November 13, 2017 They said a failure to agree a transition period by Christmas would risk more of their members triggering contingency plans for a cliff-edge Brexit in March 2019. :: Pound slips as May faces leadership pressure The EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, declared on Friday that only "real and sincere progress" on the sticking points of citizens' rights, the Irish border and exit bill would be enough to recommend the start of the next phase of negotiations.Video: EU gives UK a deadline on Brexit bill Emma Marcegaglia, president of the lobbying group BusinessEurope, said after meeting the PM: "We don't want uncertainty, we are very concerned.:: Set your watches: official Brexit time revealed "We know that if companies don't see certainty probably they will have a contingency plan and probably they will leave the UK, or they will invest less."So, these two weeks are extremely important."Video: EU 'not slowing down' Brexit trade talks The CBI's director-general, Carolyn Fairbairn, called or "urgent progress" saying the current lack of clarity meant that some firms were already acting on their contingency plans.:: JPMorgan chiefs warn May of French Brexit raid She said: "With UK-EU trade worth more than 600bn (534bn) each year, business groups from across Europe used today's meeting with the Prime Minister as a welcome opportunity to highlight the mutual importance of seeing real progress before Christmas."All business organisations present reiterated the damage a 'no-deal' scenario would do to trade.Video: Davis does not 'recognise' Brexit deadline "A transition period reflecting the current arrangements remains the priority on both sides of the Channel."While businesses welcomed the Prime Minister's Florence speech, we now need to move beyond warm words if jobs, investment and living standards are to be protected."A Downing St spokesperson said of the discussions: "The Prime Minister reassured the group that Brexit meant the UK was leaving the EU, not Europe and reiterated her ambition for free and frictionless trade with the EU27 once the UK departs."She also expressed her commitment to giving businesses the certainty they need by agreeing a time-limited implementation period as soon as possible."
PM slaps down Boris Johnson and Michael Gove over jailed Briton Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe:::::Boris Johnson and Michael Gove have received a slapdown from No 10, as it clarified that a British woman detained in Iran was on holiday.The Prime Minister's official spokesman said: "The Government's position on this is clear - she was there on holiday and for no other purpose."Mr Gove is the latest Cabinet minister to be criticised for his handling of the case after he said on Sunday he did not know why Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe was in Iran - more than a week after Foreign Secretary Mr Johnson was forced to correct his claim that she was "training journalists".Mrs May's spokesman said the Prime Minister had personally spoken to Iranian president Hassan Rouhani on two occasions about the case, most recently at the UN General Assembly in September.Video: Keir Starmer: 'A stronger Prime Minister would have got rid of Boris' Labour's shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry will ask a minister to explain the Government's handling of the case in the commons later.Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's husband, Richard Ratciffe, has asked for Mr Johnson to go to Iran with him and to grant his wife diplomatic protection.No 10 confirmed it was "an option being considered" - but Sky News understands it is unlikely due to the implications for other cases.The Foreign Office would need to take legal advice on how it would work in her case.Mr Johnson has been under sustained pressure after making comments that could prolong Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe's sentence.Video: Johnson on Briton's detainment in Iran He told MPs the 38-year-old was in Iran to train journalists despite her family's claim she was in the country to visit relatives with her daughter.Jeremy Corbyn attacked Mr Johnson for his comments, calling for him to be sacked for "putting our citizens at risk".But Mr Ratcliffe, who spoke to his wife over the weekend, said it would not be in her interests for Mr Johnson to go, as he is now fully aware of the need to work to win her freedom.Video: Johnson 'put jailed Briton's life in danger' Mr Johnson, arriving for a meeting of foreign ministers in Brussels, said all consular cases are "very sensitive" but the "key thing to understand" was the Foreign Office was "working very hard intensively and impartially on all those cases".Labour's shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer told Sky News there was a "strong case" for Mr Johnson to be sacked and any strong PM would have done so before now, but he acknowledged Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's family's "acutely difficult position".Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was arrested in April 2016, and jailed for five years amid claims she was working against the Iranian regime - which she denies.Mr Johnson's comments have been widely reported by state media in Iran and held up as justification for her incarceration.Video: Jailed Briton 'inconsolable' over Johnson remark The Labour MP who represents the family's constituency, Tulip Siddiq, told Sky News that Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was "inconsolable", "sobbing down the phone" to her husband and "couldn't believe (Mr Johnson) could make comments that would endanger her life".Mr Ratcliffe said his wife was taken to hospital for tests after complaining of "stabbing pains" in her breasts.Lumps were discovered which a specialist said may be benign but she has been put under close surveillance as she has a family history of breast cancer, and because the stress she is under could make her more at risk of developing the disease.
Labour urges PM to back its Brexit transition plan:::::Labour's shadow Brexit secretary has written to the Prime Minister urging her to back his party's amendment to the EU (Withdrawal) bill.Sir Keir Starmer says unless the Government backs the Labour amendment to allow the single market to continue operating for another two years after Brexit, Theresa May's pledge to implement a transitional arrangement will be impossible.Sir Keir told Sky News "everybody" agrees a transitional deal will be necessary because a trade deal with the EU will not be in place by Brexit in 2019.But he said Mrs May's offer to the EU of a two-year transitional period, made during her speech in Florence in September, would not be possible because it "extinguishes" Britain's subjection to the European Court of Justice - the court that underpins the framework of the single market.Video: David Davis on the future of Brexit - full interview It comes after repeated calls from senior hardline Brexiteer Conservatives for the Government to walk away from an EU deal, or at least prepare for no deal.It was revealed on Sunday that Boris Johnson and Michael Gove became the latest to do so, joining forces to write to Mrs May, calling on her to ensure all members of her senior team were behind Brexit and warning of the consequences of failing to plan.Sir Keir called on Mrs May to act in the "national interest", by supporting Labour's proposals for transitional arrangements, or at least to table an amendment that proposes the same arrangements.He said: "Step back, think about this amendment, table the self-same amendment if you want, for heaven's sake, act now in the national interest, not in party interest."It comes as Mrs May met European business leaders to discuss the future of UK-EU trade after Brexit.The Prime Minister will attempt to win support from European firms for her goal of moving the negotiations on to trade talks.Video: PM pushed to clarify Brexit transition A former Conservative Government member, pro-remain Dominic Grieve, criticised the Government's own Brexit bill amendment, tabled last week, which would set the date for leaving the EU as 29 March 2019.The amendments will be debated as the landmark EU (Withdrawal) Bill goes into its committee stage this week."The amendment that has been tabled by the Government, there is a day on which we have got to go... seems to reduce the Government's flexibility in its negotiations - it's an incoherent and thoroughly stupid amendment.It won't have my support," he said.He added: "I'm not in the business of trying to obstruct Brexit taking place, even though I think it's a disaster, because in the light of the referendum result I don't think it would be right for me to do so.Video: UK MEPs to get a 6m 'golden goodbye' "(But) If the public in this country, come to the conclusion that they want something different, then I think Parliament ought to be in a position to respond."Speaking ahead of the Prime Minister's business meeting, Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable said most businesses were nervous about the Government's pursuit of a hard Brexit and needed certainty."Any transitional deal needs to maintain the status quo so as to provide the certainty that business needs.The Prime Minister must push for a deal that keeps us within the customs union and single market," he said.But Tory former leader and cabinet secretary Iain Duncan Smith said Labour was shifting its position on Brexit.He told the BBC: "Staying inside the Court of Justice would actually be tantamount to staying within the European Union."Mrs May wants to agree the broad outline of a transition deal with the European Union for after Brexit in the next few months, her spokesman said on Monday."We would hope we could reach an agreement on the broad outline of what an implementation period looks like within the next few months," the spokesman told reporters.
Sacked Labour Welsh minister Carl Sargeant hanged himself, says post-mortem:::::Former Welsh minister Carl Sargeant, who was found dead just days after finding out he was facing allegations of sexual harassment, hanged himself at his family home, a post-mortem has found.John Gittins, senior coroner for North Wales (East and Central), said Mr Sargeant had left a note for his wife Bernadette on the utility room door, telling her not to enter.But she did and found her husband on the floor.He is believed to have taken his own life on 7 November at his home in Connah's Quay, Deeside, in North Wales.Along with family members, the emergency services tried to resuscitate Mr Sargeant for about 20 to 30 minutes, before pronouncing him dead.The former minister for children and communities was found dead after being sacked from his role and suspended by the Labour party.There has been mounting pressure on Wales' first minister, Carwyn Jones, to resign over his handling of the situation.Mr Sargeant's family claim he was unaware of the detail of the allegations he faced and was therefore unable to defend himself.Video: Jones: Sargeant's death brings 'darkest days' They also insist the Welsh Labour Party was made aware of the impact the situation was having on his mental and physical health the day before he died.Mr Gittins said his job was not to apportion blame, but instead to establish the cause of Mr Sargeant's death.He said: "Let me make it absolutely clear that my inquest will not consider the veracity of the allegations made against Mr Sargeant, nor will I be looking to Cardiff and the Welsh Assembly or the Welsh Labour Party and making adjudication as to who is right and who is wrong and who can be trusted."But, as part of my investigation, I must gather evidence to assist me in reaching a conclusion, as when the final inquest hearing takes place I will be required to give consideration to reaching a conclusion of suicide, which would require me to be certain that it was Mr Sargeant's intention to end his life."The full inquest has been adjourned to a later date, which will be confirmed in due course.:: Anyone feeling emotionally distressed or suicidal can call Samaritans for help on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org in the UK.
Zaghari-Ratcliffe case: Boris Johnson given lifeline from unlikely ally:::::News that Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe has found new lumps in both her breasts and is on the verge of a nervous breakdown underlines the horror of the predicament this mother-of-one has found herself in since she was arrested on holiday in Tehran in April 2016.That the Foreign Secretary added to her despair by mistakenly telling MPs she was training journalists in Iran is - in the eyes of many - a sackable offence.But Mr Johnson was offered a lifeline on Sunday from an unlikely ally - her husband.Richard Ratcliffe heard his wife sob down the phone over Mr Johnson's remarks.Video: Boris Johnson 'put jailed Briton's life in danger' He wrote of his wife's "anger" toward the Foreign Secretary in a statement released on Sunday.But he also wrote that it is not in his wife's interest for Mr Johnson to go.That's because after 19 months of campaigning for his wife's release, Mr Johnson is finally having to take notice.The Foreign Secretary's mistake when giving evidence to MPs on the Foreign Affairs Select Committee has catapulted Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's plight from a diplomatic incident into a national story, and a full-blown political crisis for him.So Mr Ratcliffe is right when he says Mr Johnson will have a "crucial role in the weeks ahead to stand up for Nazanin and finally bring her home".That's because his political future is now entwined with her fate.
British MEPs in line for 6m 'golden goodbye' when UK leaves EU:::::British Members of the European Parliament (MEPs), including leading Brexit campaigner Nigel Farage, will be in line for a "golden goodbye" pay out of over 6m (5.3m) when the UK leaves the EU, Sky News has learnt.A senior European Union source has confirmed that these so-called "transition payments", in effect redundancy money for MEPs when they stand down or lose their seats, will be paid to Britain's 73 MEPs.However the same source has said that Brussels will not pay for it and that it will in effect be added to the so-called "Brexit bill" which Britain must pay.The scheme awards one month's salary for each year served as an MEP, up to a maximum of 24 months.Senior figures who campaigned for the Leave campaign will be in line to receive substantial sums.Video: Farage: I'd 'probably' take money Nigel Farage, the former UKIP leader who remains a group leader in the European Parliament, is set to receive around 169,000 (150,000).Daniel Hannan, the Conservative MEP, will receive the same sum.Other figures, including prominent Remain supporters who have served even longer, will be in line to receive the maximum amount of over 200,000 (176,000).This excludes other benefits, including free private healthcare for themselves and family members in perpetuity and generous pension allowances.There is no question of any impropriety - all members are legally entitled to the money - but some will doubtless find the prospect of MEPs who voted to leave financially benefiting from Brexit a rum one - especially given that their compensation will have to be paid directly by the British taxpayer, not by the EU.And indeed being paid out of a sum of money - the Brexit bill - which many of them say should not even exist.Image: Seventy-three British MEPs sit in the European Parliament MEPs have already experienced a substantial increase in their salary as it is paid in euros.With sterling's depreciation since the referendum, MEPs' purchasing power has increased by over 10% since 2016.Mr Farage is unrepentant about accepting the money.When asked by Sky News if it was his intention to accept it, he replied: "After 18 years hard service I'd probably take it," but added: "But they won't give it to me."Mr Farage said that he thought it highly likely that the EU would try to deny the payments and pensions owed to him and other prominent Ukippers on account of their euroscepticism: "Given the nasty vindictive nature of these institutions I'd be very surprised if I get what's due."Richard Corbett, a long-standing Labour MEP who will also receive the money, says that is nonsense: "He's entitled to it.There's no question of the EU saying some can have it and some can't.It's a typical Farage invention, if I might say so."The case of MEPs' redundancy payments and pension rights is in some ways a microcosm of the arguments around whether or not Britain does indeed sport liabilities to the EU.Image: Daniel Hannan is set to receive the same sum as Mr Farage Mr Farage says that the pensions of the 22,000 British people who have at some point worked for the EU are the one area he sees there being a case for the UK paying some contribution.If no deal is reached between the UK and the EU it is possible that MEPs might still be able to get the money, but they might have to appeal to the European Court of Justice (ECJ) to get it.The irony of Mr Farage applying to that body isn't lost on the man himself: "I don't think I'd do very well there," he jokes.But some in Brussels are wondering whether or not the money will ever need to be paid at all.As Mr Farage told me: "The argument some people are making around here lately is that if there is a transition period then there needs to be a British MEP voice during that period, that they could be non-voting honourary members of the EU Parliament with salaries but without voting rights and I've heard that from someone very close to Juncker himself."There is a precedent for that: before the new countries of eastern Europe joined in 2004 they had observer MEPs to look after their interests on the way in.The argument goes you could have the same for Britain on its way out.Video: April: Nigel Farage compares the EU to the Mafia This isn't a view confined to the Brexiteers, alive to conspiracies and concerns about Brexit backsliding.The arch-remainer Richard Corbett agreed with the idea and goes further, by pointing out that it will be the agreement reached between the EU and UK which sets the date of departure and that during the transition it would make more sense for Britain to remain a full member of the EU, perhaps two or three years after the official 2019 Article 50 countdown runs out.That way the UK would retain its ability to shape the regulations and laws to which it would remain subject during any transition.If that happened then Britain would take part in the next round of European elections scheduled for May 2019.And if we did Mr Farage is certain about where he'll be: "I cannot think of anything I'd less like to do after 2019 for a couple of years."But if they really do fudge this and the British parliament betrays the will of the people and if effectively we don't Brexit before the next set of European elections and we have to contest those elections I will be there in the front line contesting those elections and I will give them, the establishment a result which they can't even bear to look at."

Moore expulsion idea splits Senate Republicans:::::Moore expulsion idea splits Senate Republicans Some lawmakers say talk about booting the Alabama candidate from office if he wins could just propel his campaign.Senate Republicans are escalating their demands for embattled Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore to leave the race, including a growing faction calling for him to be expelled if he wins next month.But some senior Republicans are wary that the chorus of anti-Moore sentiment from Washington will only embolden Moore and his supporters.The former Alabama Supreme Court justice won the Republican primary battering Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and the GOP establishment.Story Continued Below Sen. Cory Gardner of Colorado, chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, raised the specter of expulsion in a Monday statement.Later, retiring Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona told reporters he would support Democrat Doug Jones over Moore and that expelling Moore should remain on the table.But other top party leaders werent as quick to embrace the idea of expelling Moore from the chamber, which has been attempted but not completed in well more than a century and could raise serious questions about the Senate defying the will of voters.Other Republicans fear the precedent of booting a senator who hasnt violated any Senate rules or is not facing criminal charges.When asked about a potential expulsion vote, Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn of Texas, who earlier said Alabama voters would have the final judgment on Moore, declined to weigh in and merely noted: There hadnt been an election yet.Alabama Sen. Richard Shelby said that if Moore is elected, we will seat him.Sign up here for POLITICO Huddle A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.You can unsubscribe at any time.What will happen then, none of us know, Shelby said.He cautioned that before expelling a member, there are a lot of steps that have to happen.You would look at all the evidence.Still, Shelby, who backed Sen. Luther Strange in Alabama's Republican primary, said Mondays news conference with yet another woman accusing the candidate of sexual assault was very disturbing, adding she looked believable.The Senate Ethics Committee would take the lead in any expulsion proceedings if Senate Republicans were to decide to pursue that option.A senator can technically be expelled for any reason, according to former Senate historian Don Ritchie.Two-thirds, or 67 senators, would be needed to vote in favor for it to succeed.The last expulsion from the Senate happened in 1862.The floodgates against Moore opened Monday morning, when Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told reporters in Louisville that he believes the women who have accused Moore of sexual misconduct and went further than he did last week in calling Moore to get out of the race.I think he should step aside, McConnell said Monday, adding: I believe the women, yes."Republicans are exploring their options, although they are extremely limited.GOP senators are increasingly talking up the possibility of a write-in campaign by Strange, though the appointed senator doesnt appear to be interested and comes with his own baggage that led to his primary loss against Moore.McConnell confirmed that party officials are also exploring whether to pursue a write-in bid to try to retain the Senate seat in the deeply conservative state.We'll see if its Strange, he said.Strange said Monday night that right now, he was highly unlikely to pursue a write-in bid.I made my case during the election, now its really going to be up to people in our state to sort this out, Strange said.A lot of these allegations are new, its an unfolding story.Another name that has surfaced is Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who held the Senate seat for two decades before his elevation to the Cabinet, though there is no indication he is interested in returning to the chamber.The idea of removing Moore from office if he wins drew a range of responses from Republican senators.Sen. Todd Young (R-Ind.)tweeted that if Moore doesnt withdraw immediately from the race, we need to act to protect the integrity of the Senate.A spokeswoman declined to elaborate whether the freshman senator meant expulsion.But others were more explicit.I believe the individuals speaking out against Roy Moore spoke with courage and truth, proving he is unfit to serve in the United States Senate and he should not run for office, Gardner said.If he refuses to withdraw and wins, the Senate should vote to expel him, because he does not meet the ethical and moral requirements of the United States Senate."Several Senate Republicans have called on Moore to get out of the race since late last week, including Sens.Steve Daines of Montana, Mike Lee of Utah and Bill Cassidy of Louisiana.On Monday, Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) said he agrees with McConnell and that Strange would be "an excellent alternative."Cornyn also announced Monday he was withdrawing his endorsement of Moore, adding that the best course of action is "to leave the final judgment in the hands of Alabama voters.""I have now read Mr. Moores statement and listened to his radio interview in which he denies the charges," Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) tweeted Monday."I did not find his denials to be convincing and believe that he should withdraw from the Senate race in Alabama."Collins later told reporters that talk about expelling Moore was premature.But there are no signs the pressure from Washington will sway Moore, the defiant former judge who was twice removed from the state's highest court.Shortly after McConnell's remarks on Monday, Moore's campaign account tweeted: "The person who should step aside is @SenateMajLdr Mitch McConnell.He has failed conservatives and must be replaced.#DrainTheSwamp."Polls had already shown a surprisingly close race between Moore and Jones even before the allegations broke.The most recently released survey, conducted by the Republican-leaning firm JMC Analytics and Polling, shows Jones leading Moore by 4 percentage points.Democrats, who had already been closely watching the campaign and quietly deploying resources down south, are still concerned about any perception that the race will become nationalized and further galvanize Moore supporters."It's an Alabama race that they're running, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said Monday.They're involved.If they ask us for things, we're going to try to help them, but it's an Alabama race that the Jones campaign is running on its own."Meanwhile, a fifth Alabama woman publicly accused Moore of misconduct on Monday afternoon.Appearing with attorney Gloria Allred at a press conference in New York, Beverly Young Nelson recounted how Moore, now 70, assaulted her when she was a waitress at a restaurant that the then-district attorney of Etowah County frequented.Fighting through tears, Nelson recounted how one night, Moore forced himself on her in his car behind the restaurant in Gadsden.After she screamed at him to stop, she said, Instead of stopping, he began squeezing my neck, attempting to force my head onto his crotch.I continued to struggle.I thought he was going to rape me, Nelson said.At some point he gave up, she continued.And he then looked at me and he told me, he said, Youre just a child, and I am the district attorney of Etowah County, and if you tell anyone about this, no one will ever believe you.After Nelson gave her statement, Allred presented Nelsons high school yearbook from 1977, carrying a note from Moore, which is signed, Roy Moore, D.A.She was 15 years old at the time.Allred said she had spoken with Nelsons sister, mother and husband, who all said they knew about the alleged assault.Ahead of the news conference, Moores campaign chairman Bill Armistead released a statement aimed at trying to rebut the coming accusations.Gloria Allred is a sensationalist leading a witch hunt, and she is only around to create a spectacle, Armistead said.Weve said this before and well say it again: Judge Moore is an innocent man and has never had any sexual misconduct with anyone.Gabriel Debenedetti contributed from New York, and Elana Schor from Washington.

GOP leaders bullish tax bill will pass the House this week:::::Speaker Paul Ryan, House Majority Whip Steve Scalise and House Republican Conference Chair Cathy McMorris Rodgers hold a news conference at the Capitol on Nov. 7.Congress GOP leaders bullish tax bill will pass the House this week A vote is expected Thursday, though members are being asked to keep Friday open in case.Republican leaders are confident they have the votes to pass their once-in-a-generation tax reform bill in the House this week.There was little arm-twisting over the weekend, multiple sources close to leadership told POLITICO.And unlike with the Obamacare repeal effort earlier this year, when leaders made final-hour tweaks to win over resistant members, Speaker Paul Ryans team doesnt intend to make significant changes to the legislation before the vote this time.Story Continued Below I think theyve made the calculation that they have 218, Rep. Peter King said in a Saturday phone interview.The New York Republican, currently a no on the bill, said he hasnt heard from leadership in more than two weeks.Fellow New York Rep. Dan Donovan, another GOP opponent of the legislation, said the same.The lack of outreach to GOP holdouts suggests leadership feels good about the level of support in the conference though the Republican whip team won't officially count votes until Monday night.Passage in the House this week would be a big boon to the tax reform effort after widespread skepticism that Republicans could shepherd legislation through the chamber by Thanksgiving, as they had promised.The Senate where the GOP has a slim margin and the tax bill is markedly different from the House's remains a bigger obstacle.In the end, I think what you're going to see is the House pass a bill, House Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.)said Sunday on Fox & Friends.He added that GOP leaders hope to "pass the bill hopefully by the end of the week and then let the Senate go do their job.The most reliable politics newsletter.Sign up for POLITICO Playbook and get the latest news, every morning in your inbox.Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.You can unsubscribe at any time.The bill is expected to go to the House Rules Committee on Wednesday, where no amendments will be made except for perhaps a few technical corrections, GOP sources said.Republicans intend to hold a floor vote Thursday but are keeping Friday open in case any problems crop up this week.Leaderships confidence could be misplaced.Some Republicans worry that Rep. Darrell Issas (R-Calif.) defection on the bill last week could trigger an exodus of other California Republicans.Rep. Tom McClintock (R-Calif.), for one, has been emphasizing to leadership since January that the bill must preserve the state and local tax deduction, which relieves a financial burden for people from high-tax states.Its possible that with Issa going over, that could make a few of the California people nervous, said one Republican lawmaker.GOP leaders will also have to grapple this week with concerns about the Senate bill.Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) immediately went on record against the Senates plan to phase in the corporate tax cut until 2019.Thats a problem, said Meadows.I dont know why you would phase in [a corporate tax cut].If youre looking for economic growth, why do you phase it in?The Senate bill also does not include a $10,000 property tax deduction included in the House bill.That was a delicately crafted olive branch to members from high-tax districts that was critical to securing their support for the overall bill.Without the provision, GOP leaders dont think the tax bill can clear the House.On Fox News Sunday, House Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady (R-Texas) sent a warning to the Senate that any tax bill must include the property tax deduction."I'm convinced that this is where we're going to end up because it's important ... to make sure people keep more of what they earn, even in these high-tax states," Brady said.Ryan has also tried to head off internal concerns about the Senate bill by promising to go to conference committee and negotiate a compromise, instead of simply swallowing the other chambers version.Ryan made a similar promise on the budget earlier this year, but the House ended up having to accept a Senate blueprint that many Republican members despised.The House will pass its bill, the Senate will pass its bill, and then we will get together and reconcile the differences, which is the legislative process, Ryan said last week.There's concern that Ryan and Brady will get squeezed by an impatient President Donald Trump to accept the Senate bill if the process drags out until the end of the year.We must have a Conference Committee to resolve differences between the House & Senate #taxreform bills, Republican Study Committee executive director Scott Parkinson tweeted last week.The House will not just eat the Senate bill as ... the lowest common denominator.For now, though, House leaders are focused on the task at hand: getting a bill through the House.Their challenge has shifted dramatically from past controversial votes: Typically, they're most worried about Freedom Caucus members banding together and sinking legislation.This time, they're watching Republicans from swing districts in New York, New Jersey and California members who are typically in leadership's corner.Freedom Caucus members have given leaders room to maneuver on tax reform, largely praising the bill or at least refusing to draw red lines on provisions they dislike."We've been working really well with them, and I talk to Mark Meadows on a regular basis, and most of the members of the Freedom Caucus that we talk to, they are really supportive of this bill, as are most members of our conference, Scalise said Sunday in his Fox interview.In addition to King and Donovan, sources say New Yorkers Elise Stefanik, John Faso, Lee Zeldin and Claudia Tenney are leaning no on the legislation.Most Republicans in the New Jersey delegation are also unlikely to back the bill.For New Yorkers and some people in New Jersey, this is going to result in a tax increase, Donovan said in a Saturday interview.My teachers, my firefighters, my construction workers, my bus drivers these are the people that are not going to see tax relief.The tax cuts that other parts of the nation will enjoy [are] going to be paid for by these people.Rep. Tom MacArthur of New Jersey has given leaders hope that they can win over some of those GOP holdouts, however.After initially opposing the bill, the Republican advocate of the state and local tax deduction suddenly changed his mind and decided to support the bill.He's already being rewarded for that change of heart: On Monday morning, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and the presidents daughter, Ivanka Trump, will visit MacArthur's district to tout the legislation by his side.Colin Wilhelm contributed to this report.
Senate passes measure requiring sexual harassment training for senators, aides:::::"Everyone deserves to feel safe and comfortable at work, and the passage of this official Senate policy is an important measure to ensure thats the case in these halls," Sen. Amy Klobuchar, a lead sponsor of the legislation, said in a statement.| Andrew Harnik/AP Photo Senate passes measure requiring sexual harassment training for senators, aides The Senate unanimously approved legislation late Thursday that institutes mandatory sexual harassment training for senators and aides a potentially meaningful shift amid calls for overhauling Capitol Hill's system for handling harassment complaints.Bipartisan talks on a plan to require sexual harassment training, as first reported by POLITICO, began as current and former female lawmakers and aides publicly shared their stories of sexual harassment on the job in Congress.Awareness of workplace harassment on the Hill is spiking as sexual assault allegations shake the Hollywood establishment and Republicans grappled Thursday with a report that Alabama Senate nominee Roy Moore initiated a sexual encounter with a minor while in his 30s.Story Continued Below The legislation approved Thursday, co-sponsored by both Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), would require harassment training that also covers discrimination based on race, religion, disability and other criteria.Sexual and workplace harassment is a widespread problem that affects too many women and men in too many places, professions, and industries," Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), a lead sponsor of the legislation, said in a statement."Everyone deserves to feel safe and comfortable at work, and the passage of this official Senate policy is an important measure to ensure thats the case in these halls.One of the measure's co-sponsors, Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), said Wednesday that senators also discussed changing the current guidelines for handling Hill harassment complaints, but the version that ultimately passed did not go beyond requiring training that is now voluntary.Sign up here for POLITICO Huddle A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.You can unsubscribe at any time.More than 1,000 former congressional aides from the two parties have lent their voices to call for a bigger shakeup of the current protocol for handling congressional harassment cases, which requires victims to undergo mandatory counseling and mediation before filing a complaint.
Bradbury wins Collins vote amid debate over torture memos:::::Liberal groups have fought fiercely to derail Stephen Bradbury's nomination, citing his authorship of memos providing legal authorization for harsh treatment of prisoners suspected of terrorism.| Cliff Owen/AP Photo Bradbury wins Collins vote amid debate over torture memos Stephen Bradbury, who helped write the so-called torture memos endorsing brutal interrogation tactics under the George W. Bush administration, has locked up a key swing vote on his nomination to join the Trump administration.Human rights and other liberal groups have fought fiercely to derail Bradbury's nomination as general counsel of the Department of Transportation, citing his authorship of memos providing legal authorization for harsh treatment of prisoners suspected of terrorism.Story Continued Below But although Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) sent a strong signal this week that he would oppose Bradbury, another swing vote Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) said Thursday that she would back him in the Senate's vote next week."His role was not developing the policy," Collins told POLITICO, noting that she has "taken a close look at" Bradbury's background."His role was as an attorney within the Justice Department, and he's obviously not going to have anything to do with this issue at DOT."Bradbury, who wrote several legal memos approving the use of harsh interrogation tactics after joining the Bush administration's Department of Justice in 2005, saw his bid to become Bush's assistant attorney general in 2008 run aground amid opposition from Senate Democrats.Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.) has already placed a hold on his nomination to join the Trump administration.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) filed a procedural motion on Thursday that sets up a final confirmation vote on Bradbury next week.Sign up here for POLITICO Huddle A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.You can unsubscribe at any time.Activists working to derail the Bradbury nomination had viewed Collins as a potential "no" vote, given her support in 2014 for the public release of the Senate Intelligence Committee's report on brutal treatment, seen as tantamount to torture, that certain prisoners received while detained by the CIA.With Collins in the "yes" camp, however, human rights groups would have to peel off two more Republican opponents by next week in order to defeat the nomination.A spokesman for Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), a former Judge Advocate General in the Air Force, said Thursday he is leaning toward voting for Bradbury.The office of Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), seen as another potential swing vote, did not return a request for comment.Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), an Intelligence Committee member seen as a potential Bradbury supporter, remains undecided on the nomination, according to a spokesman.McCain appears solidly opposed, telling POLITICO on Wednesday that he would oppose "any nominee who in any way has supported the use of enhanced interrogation."The Arizona Republican this week opposed the nomination of Steven Engel, who reviewed a draft 2007 memo on enhanced interrogation, to the senior Department of Justice position for which Bradbury previously served in an acting capacity.McCain's comments gave some hope to human rights groups, who escalated their campaign to defeat Bradbury.Approving the DOT nominee "would send a terribly cruel message to the million-plus refugee torture survivors living in the United States, and the millions more across the globe," the leaders of the nonprofit Center for the Victims of Torture wrote in a Wednesday letter to senators."There must be accountability for those who champion repugnant and immoral misuses of government authority."
Republicans might be stuck with Roy Moore:::::GOP leaders desperately want Roy Moore off the ballot.But they have neither the legal nor the political leverage to force the defiant ex-judge out of the race.The White House, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and a host of other Republican senators called on Moore to drop out of the race Thursday if there were truth to the accounts of four women who told The Washington Post that Moore pursued relationships with them while they were teens and he was in his 30s.The news sent Republican operatives scrambling to parse the dusty sections of Alabama state law that deal with replacing candidates on the ballot.Story Continued Below But some absentee ballots have already been sent to voters, which appears to make it impossible to install someone in place of Moore on the Republican Party line.The election is on Dec. 12.Apart from the legal considerations, Moore owes no loyalty to Republican leaders in Washington, who backed another candidate in the primary and spent millions of super PAC dollars to defeat him while Moore won the nomination on an anti-McConnell platform.Moores campaign lashed out as condemnation rained upon him Thursday, calling the story a baseless political attack.Judge Roy Moore has endured the most outlandish attacks on any candidate in the modern political arena, but this story in todays Washington Post alleging sexual impropriety takes the cake, Moore campaign chairman Bill Armistead said in a statement.National liberal organizations know their chosen candidate Doug Jones is in a death spiral, and this is their last ditch Hail Mary.Sebastian Kitchen, a spokesman for Doug Jones, the Democratic candidate, said simply: "Roy Moore needs to answer these serious charges."Though Republicans have begun looking into options to replace Moore, Alabama law requires the candidate roster on the ballot to be set 74 days before an election.If Moore does withdraw, however, any votes cast for him would not count.Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) and other Republicans have suggested that GOP Sen. Luther Strange, the appointed senator who lost to Moore in the special primary, could put himself forward as a write-in candidate.State law bars a candidate who lost in a primary from appearing on the general election ballot as an independent, but it does not appear to forbid a write-in campaign.Of course its possible!said Murkowski, who lost her Republican primary in 2010 but won reelection as a write-in candidate, when asked about the feasibility of such a plan.White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, in a gaggle aboard Air Force One, said President Donald Trump believes that "if these allegations are true, Judge Moore will do the right thing and step aside."Through his press secretary, Vice President Pence echoed those remarks."The Vice President found the allegations in the story disturbing and believes, if true, this would disqualify anyone from serving in office," Alyssa Farah said.Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas) said senior Republicans are still examining what, if any, options they have ahead of the special election.Cornyn and a host of other congressional Republicans had recently endorsed Moore after his primary win, when Moore defeated Strange and a field of other Republicans in the race to complete Attorney General Jeff Sessions term in the Senate."This troubling news is so recent that people are trying to understand what hit us," Cornyn told reporters."I think people are trying to sort it out and figure out what the appropriate response is, including Sen.Strange."The Washington Post reported that Moore, then age 32, initiated a sexual encounter with a 14-year-old girl in 1979.The Post quoted the woman, Leigh Corfman, as well as three other women who said in multiple interviews that Moore pursued relationships with them while they were teenagers.Cornyn said Corfman's willingness to go on the record about the sexual contact does not yet prove Moore's guilt."If it is true, I don't think his candidacy is sustainable," Cornyn said."But we believe in a presumption of innocence until proven guilty.And so I think it's important for the facts to come out."Pressed by reporters on the further proof he would want to view the allegations against Moore as true, Cornyn added: "I'm interested in seeing what substantiation there is for the story."Morning Score newsletter Your guide to the permanent campaign weekday mornings, in your inbox.Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.You can unsubscribe at any time.Earlier in the day, White House legislative affairs director Marc Short said on CNN that "there's no path forward" for Moore if the allegations were true."But lets be cautious here of allegations that arise 38 years later and actually arise a month before Election Day," Short said."So I think we need to let the facts come out and find out what the truth is and go from there before we jump to conclusions."Short raised the possibility of legal action to get a new candidate in the race if Moore drops out."Remember that the president supported Luther Strange in that primary," Short said."I think whatll happen is that theres options for write-in candidates and theres also options for lawsuits I think will arise about [the] path forward.But I dont think we should begin going down that pathway until we give Roy Moore the chance to defend himself and defend his character.Other Senate Republicans had the same reaction as McConnell and Cornyn, with denunciations flying in swiftly but often with an if true caveat.If thats true, he doesnt belong in the Senate," said Sen. Richard Shelby, Alabamas senior senator."The allegations against Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore are deeply troubling," Sen. Cory Gardner, chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, said in a statement."If these allegations are found to be true, Roy Moore must drop out of the Alabama special Senate election."As Senate Republicans grappled with a politically challenging tax bill rollout, several sidestepped questions about Moore by noting that they have not yet delved into the details of the allegations against him.I have seen the headlines, but I have not had the opportunity to review the specifics, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), who endorsed Moore, told POLITICO.Sen. John Hoeven (R-N.D.) told reporters that obviously this is a real concern, but before I would comment further I have to see what the facts are.But Murkowski was unequivocal.Im horrified, and if this is true he needs to step down immediately, she told reporters.Alabama Gov.Kay Ivey, a Republican, called the story "deeply disturbing.""These allegations are deeply disturbing.I will hold judgment until we know the facts," Ivey said in a statement."The people of Alabama deserve to know the truth and will make their own decisions."Both Republicans and Democrats stepped around the one other scenario that would end the GOPs Moore problem: the chance that he could now lose the Senate race in deep-red Alabama.Moore faces a well-funded Democratic opponent, former U.S. attorney Doug Jones, but the Republican has led in most polling, and Alabama has not elected a Democratic senator in decades."I don't think it has anything to do with Doug Jones or the Doug Jones campaign," said Alabama-based Democratic pollster Zac McCrary."I don't think Doug Jones or the Doug Jones campaign has any relevance to this piece of this [race] for the next month.It's all about Roy Moore."
Senate GOPs tax bill points to nasty fight ahead:::::From left, Sen. Mitch McConnell, Sen. Orrin Hatch, Steven Mnuchin and Gary Cohn speak with reporters Thursday as work gets underway on the Senate's version of the GOP tax reform bill.| J. Scott Applewhite/AP Photo Senate GOPs tax bill points to nasty fight ahead There are dramatic differences between the House and Senate versions of the tax overhaul, imperiling Trump's desire to sign legislation by year end.Yawning divisions have emerged between the House, Senate and White House over tax reform, raising doubts about whether Republicans will be able to achieve their most important political and policy priority before the end of the year.The Senate and House are split on some key issues, including the top tax rate and the timing of the corporate tax cut, and also at odds with President Donald Trump in many areas.Hard bargaining, battles between GOP factions and an onslaught of lobbying are the gauntlets Republicans will have to run to get legislation to Trump's desk by the end of the year and into their mailers and ads for the 2018 elections.Story Continued Below If one thing unifies Republicans and makes the job easier than it might appear, it's the fear that they will have nothing to take into those contests after the failure of another marquee effort, repealing and replacing Obamacare.House Speaker Paul Ryan and other GOP leaders used the drubbing the party took in Tuesday's election in Virginia as a warning to the rank and file: Pass tax reform or face the wrath of Republican voters."We are going to conference," Ryan told reporters Thursday, after the Senate unveiled its long-awaited plan and House tax writers advanced theirs to the House floor."Yes, the Senate bill is going to be different than the House bill because that's the legislative process."The House Ways and Means Committee approved its bill on a party-line 24-16 vote, and House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy said the full House would vote on it next week.The Senate Finance Committee will start working on its bill next week, maybe as early as Monday.The most reliable politics newsletter.Sign up for POLITICO Playbook and get the latest news, every morning in your inbox.Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.You can unsubscribe at any time.One of the first differences to emerge was the Senate's plan to delay slashing the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent until 2019.The House wants to cut the tax immediately, and has the White House on its side.Cutting the corporate rate is the centerpiece of the GOP plan to lower tax rates and spur faster economic growth.But the Senate is trying to limit the revenue impact to allow a bill to pass with just 51 votes and avoid a possible Democratic filibuster.In another break with Trump, neither the Senate bill or the House bill includes a repeal of the Obamacare individual mandate requiring Americans to have health insurance.But Senate Republicans are still considering a repeal to help cover the cost of making some tax cuts permanent.GOP leaders are talking with rank-and-file members to assess whether they have the necessary 50 votes to scrap the least popular part of Obamacare."I'd sure like to do that," said Sen. Roger Wicker (R-Miss.)"I think we're counting votes.It sure gives us a lot more flexibility."Trump has pushed for repealing the mandate, along with conservative senators and House members.But many lawmakers said reopening the health care debate would just make passing the tax bill harder.The Senate plan would set a top individual tax rate of 38.5 percent, compared to the House's 39.6 percent for annual income above $1 million, and keep deductions for people with high medical bills and for student loan interest that the House wants to discard.It would completely eliminate a federal deduction for state and local taxes, while the House had to mollify a group of GOP lawmakers from high-tax blue states by keeping the deduction for property taxes, up to $10,000.The Senate kept the maximum mortgage deduction at the interest on loans up to $1 million.The House would cut it to $500,000.The House targeted the estate tax a favorite foil of conservative Republicans for elimination in 2025, after doubling the current exemptions to about $11 million for individuals and $22 million for married couples.The Senate is proposing only to double the exemptions.The House proposed expanding the child tax credit to $1,600 per child from $1,000.The Senate set the increase at $1,650.But that is still too low for some senators who want a $2,000-per-child credit because they worry some middle-income people could otherwise see their taxes go up under the plan and they have an ally in Ivanka Trump."While we are glad to see an increase to the child tax credit, like the House bill, it is simply not enough for working families," Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and Mike Lee (R-Utah), the main champions of the issue in the Senate, said in a joint statement.On another hot-button issue, the treatment of "pass-through" businesses that pay individual tax rates, the Senate would set a top rate of 30 percent, while owners of those businesses have been clamoring for parity with corporations.The House is offering a super-low 9 percent rate on the first $75,000 those businesses earn, which attracted praise from the powerful National Federation of Independent Business, which had panned the House bill last week.Both bills would shift the U.S. to a "territorial" tax system that would largely shield offshore corporate income from U.S. taxation.But they parted ways on a mechanism to discourage more companies from moving abroad to take advantage of the change.As the first details were trickling out about the Senate plan, Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady (R-Texas) unveiled a new round of changes to the House GOP's plan.Their tax plan had ballooned beyond their budget, allowing them to cut taxes by no more than $1.5 trillion, after Republicans earlier this week gutted a plan to crack down on international tax avoidance hated by the Koch brothers and a number of multinational corporations.The revisions include hundreds of billions of dollars in new revenue aimed at filling that budget hole.Republicans did it in part by taking back much of the money $87 billion they had lost when they watered down those overseas tax avoidance provisions.Another $70 billion would come from charging companies more in a one-time tax on their overseas earnings.Under the new plan, they'd pay 14 percent on their liquid assets and 7 percent on illiquid ones like factories overseas.That's up from 12 percent and 5 percent, respectively, under the previous proposal.House lawmakers want to raise another $20 billion by requiring people claiming the popular child tax credit to provide a Social Security number for their child, a provision long sought by Republicans aimed at preventing undocumented immigrants from taking the break.Delaying their plans to repeal the estate tax by another year saved them $21.5 billion.They'd raise another $109 billion from companies tapping a long-standing break for research and development expenses.Other House provisions would expand a tax on private university endowments and impose a surtax on life insurance companies.The plan also would allow organizations such as charities and churches to engage in political speech without risking their tax-exempt status, and it restored a tax break for adopting children that had been on the chopping block.Senate Finance Committee aides said the panel was still working to make its bill compliant with the chamber's budget rules, which don't allow the tax bill to add to deficits outside the 10-year budget window.Given the GOP's slim majority in the Senate and the danger of a repeat of their Obamacare fiasco, some House Republicans were resigned to more or less having to defer to the Senate."I look at it more as a priority of process and procedure over substance," said Rep. Dennis Ross (R-Fla.)."While there are some very good things, don't get me wrong, substantively in our bill, I think the canvas will probably be painted in its final stage in the Senate once we give them the vehicle."Ben White, Josh Dawsey, Colin Wilhelm, Seung Min Kim, Elana Schor and Jennifer Haberkorn contributed to this report.
Goodlatte to retire after 2018:::::Rep. Bob Goodlatte's district has long been a safe seat for Republicans.| Drew Angerer/Getty Images Goodlatte to retire after 2018 Rep. Bob Goodlatte, the term-limited chairman of the powerful House Judiciary Committee, said on Thursday that he will not seek reelection in 2018.With my time as Chairman of the Judiciary Committee ending in December 2018, this is a natural stepping-off point and an opportunity to begin a new chapter of my career and spend more time with my family, particularly my granddaughters, the Virginia Republican said in a statement.Story Continued Below Goodlatte, a 13-term incumbent, is the latest in a string of Republicans opting against running for reelection.In the last week, three Texas congressman Jeb Hensarling, Ted Poe and Lamar Smith also left safely conservative seats behind.Hensarling and Smith were also term-limited as committee chairmen.As recently as July, Goodlattes staff sought to squash rumors that the 65-year-old congressman planned to retire.Goodlattes decision opens a Republican-leaning seat, nestled in the Shenandoah Valley, which backed President Donald Trump by a 24-point margin.
Ex-ethics chief Shaub asks Congress to strengthen oversight office:::::Walter Shaub announced his resignation as head of OGE in July, telling The New York Times that there wasnt much he could do at OGE anymore.| J. Scott Applewhite/AP Ex-ethics chief Shaub asks Congress to strengthen oversight office Walter Shaub said he felt almost powerless as head of the Office of Government Ethics to serve as a check on President Donald Trumps administration, but he's pushing Congress to empower his successors.Shaub, now the senior director for ethics at the nonpartisan Campaign Legal Center, sent a letter to House Oversight Committee Chairman Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) and ranking member Elijah Cummings (D-Md.)and met with them Thursday morning to recommend more than a dozen legislative proposals to strengthen OGE.Story Continued Below My goal was specifically, and I emphasized this to the congressmen, was to find some reasonable, noncontroversial middle-of-the-road proposals that would definitely have some discernible impact, Shaub told POLITICO in an interview Thursday.Nothing in here is designed to focus on the current president or embarrass him.Instead, it focuses on logical things that would be good regardless of whos president next.Shaub said that before he voluntarily left office in July, he felt vulnerable raising questions about Trump's appointees' financial arrangements and pushing back on what he viewed as conflicts of interest for an administration full of wealthy business executives.He reported to the president and was required to go through White House budget director Mick Mulvaneys office to communicate with Congress.The most reliable politics newsletter.Sign up for POLITICO Playbook and get the latest news, every morning in your inbox.Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.You can unsubscribe at any time.Shaub joined the Campaign Legal Center this summer to pursue reforms to strengthen OGE.The White House has dismissed many of his criticisms and said he politicized the agency as its leader.Shaub's recommendations on Thursday include insulating the OGE director from retaliation by establishing new procedural or substantive requirements for removal and authorizing OGE to communicate with Congress on issues ranging from its budget and legislative proposals to its oversight of the executive branch ethics program.He includes 30 pages of proposals.To improve oversight, Shaub suggests allowing the OGE director to stay in office for up to a year beyond the terms expiration or until replaced.He said the post has been vacant for more than five years over the last 14, but carryover authority would enhance the continuity of OGEs operations following the end of a directors term.He also proposes amending the Ethics in Government Act to clarify that OGE oversees the entire executive branch ethics program, a change he said would only require replacing references to executive agency with executive branch in sections 402 and 403.Shaub also recommends strengthening OGEs ability to collect ethics information and records and establishing an inspector general with regular jurisdiction over small agencies and limited special jurisdiction to conduct ethics investigations throughout the executive branch.For the sake of transparency, Shaub proposes requiring OGE and agency ethics officials to post public records online, including unclassified reports of senior official travel on government aircraft and requiring the agency to collect and post written plans for how candidates would prepare for a Presidential transition and resolve their conflicts of interest.Shaubs recommendations for substantive ethics requirements include ending the use of special government employees for more than 130 days by automatically designating such a person as a regular employee on the 131st day of work and barring political appointees from working on particular matters affecting employers who make discretionary payments to them.His letter notably makes no mention of Trump.He told POLITICO hes focused on improving the process going forward, not relitigating the past, though he still believes Trump should address his conflicts of interest.Asked whether the lawmakers expressed any concern that a more powerful OGE could clash with the House Oversight Committee, Shaub said: It does the opposite.It harmonizes it.As to whether a Republican-controlled Congress would consider his proposals, Shaub wouldnt speculate.The legislative process is long and messy, he said.I dont think I can make any predictions.
Advertisers distance themselves from Hannity after Moore coverage:::::Two companies have said they will no longer advertise during Fox Newss Hannity after critics called for the companies to pull their ads over Sean Hannitys coverage of the sexual misconduct allegations against Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore (R).Realtor.com and Keurig both said they are stopping their ads from airing during the show after being questioned about the advertisements on Twitter.Neither company specifically said their decision was over Moore coverage, but only made the announcement in response to critics.ADVERTISEMENT Thanks for bringing this to our attention.We are adjusting our media buy to no longer include this show placement.MS, Realtor.com wrote to a Twitter user on Friday who tweeted a clip of Hannitys Fox News show at the company.Keurig said in a tweet to the president of liberal group Media Matters for America that the company is stopping its ad during Hannitys show.Angelo, thank you for your concern and for bringing this to our attention, the Keurig account wrote to Angelo Carusone.We worked with our media partner and FOX news to stop our ad from airing during the Sean Hannity Show.Another company, Eloquii, said Hannity is blocked from its advertising list, but did not specify on what medium.Angelo, thank you for your concern and for bringing this to our attention.We worked with our media partner and FOX news to stop our ad from airing during the Sean Hannity Show.Keurig (@Keurig) November 11, 2017 While we continually strategize on where we advertise on and offline, we are not currently, and will not be running TV ads on Hannity.@mmfa realtor.com (@realtordotcom) November 11, 2017 Hi there!Hannity is blocked from our advertising list.If we can help with anything else, please don't hesitate to reach out to us at social@eloquii.com.ELOQUII (@ELOQUII) November 10, 2017 Media Matters has for months tried to put pressure on Hannitys advertisers.In May the group published a list of the Fox News host's advertisers on its website.The latest push comes after Hannity during his Thursday night show urged viewers not to rush to judgment regarding the allegations against Moore.Every single person in this country deserves the presumption of innocence, Hannity said.With the allegations against Judge Moore, none of us know the truth of what happened 38 years ago.The only people that would know are the people involved in this incident.Hannity also said Moore should drop out of the race if the allegations against him are true.If its true he should step aside and leave the Senate race, Hannity said.Hannity then interviewed Moore on Friday during his radio show, which is nationally syndicated.Moore in the interview denied accusations leveled against him by a woman who said he initiated sexual contact with her when she was 14 and he was 32.The Washington Post reported the allegation and also included accounts from three other women who said Moore attempted to court them around the same time period, when they were between 16 and 18 years old.In the same interview, Moore admitted he may have dated teenaged women at that point in his life, but said he did not remember anything like that."-This post was updated on Nov. 12 at 4 p.m.
Former Moore colleague: 'Common knowledge' that he dated high school girls:::::A former colleague of GOP Senate candidate Roy Moore said Saturday that it was "common knowledge" that the Alabama Republican dated high school girls when he worked in the Etowah County District Attorney's Office in the 1980s.In a statement to CNN, Teresa Jones, who served as deputy district attorney for Etowah County, Ala., from 1982 until 1985, said that multiple people thought it was unusual that Moore dated high school girls, but that no one ever raised the matter with him."It was common knowledge that Roy Moore dated high school girls, everyone we knew thought it was weird," Jones told CNN."We wondered why someone his age would hang out at high school football games and the mall ... but you really wouldn't say anything to someone like that."ADVERTISEMENT Moore, now 70, served as the assistant district attorney for Etowah County from 1977 until 1982.Jones's comments come two days after an explosive Washington Post report detailed allegations that Moore pursued sexual and romantic relationships with teenage girls when he was in his early 30s.One of Moore's accusers, Leigh Corfman, told the Post that the former Alabama Supreme Court justice initiated a sexual encounter with her in 1979, when she was just 14 and he was 32.Moore has vehemently denied Corfman's allegation.But in an interview on Sean Hannity's radio program on Friday, he did not rule out that he dated girls in their late teens when he was in his 30s, saying that he did not remember doing so.On Saturday, in his first public appearance since The Washington Post report was published, Moore said that the allegations were politically motivated, and that he had never engaged in any sort of sexual misconduct.Still, the allegations have prompted condemnation from many Republican lawmakers and officials, who have called on Moore to step aside in Alabama's special Senate election if the accounts are true.
Poll: 37 percent of Alabama evangelicals more likely to vote for Moore after allegations:::::Nearly 40 percent of Alabama evangelicals said in a new poll that they are more likely to vote for GOP Senate candidate Roy Moore following allegations of sexual misconduct against him.A JMC analytics poll found that 37 percent of evangelicals surveyed said the allegations make them more likely to vote for the GOP Senate candidate in the upcoming election.Just 28 percent said the allegations made them less likely to vote for Moore and 34 percent said the allegations made no difference in their decision.In all, 29 percent of respondents in the poll said the allegations against Moore would make them more likely to vote for him, compared to 38 percent overall who said the allegations would make them less likely to vote for the candidate.ADVERTISEMENT The poll was conducted on Nov. 9 and Nov. 11 and was based on 575 responses.It has a margin of error of 4.1 percent.The Washington Post reported last week that a 53-year-old woman accused Moore of initiating sexual contact with her in 1979, when she was 14 and he was 32.Three other women also said Moore approached them around the same time, when they were between the ages of 16 and 18.Moore has denied the allegations, saying they are "completely false" and suggesting they are part of a smear campaign.Several lawmakers have called for Moore to step aside if the allegations are true.
GOP nears initial victory on tax reform:::::House Republicans are on the precipice of a big victory on tax reform, but the legislation still faces enormous hurdles before it can reach President Trumps desk and be signed into law.Legislation is expected to receive a vote on the House floor this week after clearing the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee in a party-line vote with no GOP defections.At this point it would be a surprise if Republicans werent able to pass the bill through the House.ADVERTISEMENT The number of Republicans publicly opposed or leaning against the bill is in the single digits, and Speaker(R-Wis.) appears poised to meet his ambitious timeline of having the tax bill introduced in early November and passed by Thanksgiving.I do believe that the momentum continues to move us forward, Rep. Mark Walker (R-N.C.), chairman of the conservative Republican Study Committee, told The Hill.He said Republicans cant afford to hold off the bill after the failure to approve ObamaCare repeal.Last weeks losses in off-year elections across the country just added urgency for Republicans.It will be difficult for members who voted against ObamaCare repeal to go 0-for-2 on their campaign promises, Walker said.Id look for a huge vote.An amendment Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady Kevin Patrick BradyOvernight Health Care: Initial Senate tax bill doesn't repeal ObamaCare mandate | 600K sign up for ObamaCare in first four days | Feds crack down on opioid trafficking Overnight Finance: Senate GOP unveils different approach on tax reform | House tax bill heads to floor | House leaders eye vote next week | AT&T denies pressure for CNN sale GOP tax bill clears hurdle, heads to House floor MORE (R-Texas) added to the bill on Thursday bolsters the odds of a successful House vote.The amendment created a new 9 percent tax rate for some small-business income earning the support of the National Federation of Independent Business, which panned the initial House bill.It also restored the adoption tax credit, a top priority for conservatives.It definitely made the bill stronger, said Rep.

Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.), a member of the hard-line House Freedom Caucus, told The Hill on Friday that he was still undecided.He said there are "a lot of really good things in the bill" and was happy to see the adoption tax credit restored.But he also wished the bill's tax cuts were retroactive and thinks that Congress should ensure that every taxpayer sees a rate reduction."I'm a little bit disappointed that we're not eliminating the clawback provision," he said.Biggs added that he's "hopeful that the process continues to be open to changes."Rep. Warren Davidson Warren Earl DavidsonDeVos to re-evaluate funding applications rejected for formatting errors MORE (R-Ohio), another Freedom Caucus member, said on Twitter Friday that hes still looking at taxpayer scenarios under the bill.#TaxReform that raises your taxes is the wrong direction, he tweeted.While things look positive for the House vote, Republicans have missed past deadlines they have set for themselves.At the joint House and Senate GOP retreat in January, Ryan mapped out a timeline for rank-and-file Republicans showing theyd get a tax bill to Trumps desk by August.They also failed to repeal ObamaCare, despite campaigning on doing so for years.But Republicans are highly motivated to accomplish one of the top items on their legislative agenda, especially after last weeks election losses in Virginia.I think a lot of people in Washington are taking a message from the Virginia elections that voters are discontent with the lack of policy progress in Washington, said Scott Hodge, president of the Tax Foundation.And I think thats provided some urgency to both the House and the Senate to get this tax-reform plan to the presidents desk before Christmas.Further challenges lie ahead.Senate Republicans released their own tax bill Thursday that has many differences from the Houses measure.The Senate bill fully repeals the state and local tax deduction.That would be unacceptable to many House Republicans from blue states, including some who appear likely to vote for the House bill.And some aspects of the Senate bill may not be well received from conservatives in the House.The Senate measure does not repeal the estate tax and delays until 2019 cutting the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 20 percent.The House bill slashes the corporate rate more immediately.To me, that is the biggest conflict between the House version and the Senate version, Walker said in the interview.He and other GOP sources said there could be some minor, last-minute changes to the House bill before it gets a final vote, especially as House leaders pore over the details of the Senate proposal.I still think there are a few tweaks and adjustments to be made Walker said.Ryan made it clear that if both chambers pass tax bills, they would go to a conference committee rather than the House simply voting on the Senates measure.But its not clear yet if the Senate bill even has the votes yet to clear its own chamber, where Republicans can only afford two defections.Some GOP senators, such as Jeff Flake Jeffrey (Jeff) Lane FlakeGOP rushes to cut ties to Moore Flake on Moore defenders: 'This cannot be who we are' GOP senators raise concerns over tax plan MORE of Arizona and James Lankford James Paul LankfordGOP senators raise concerns over tax plan Cornyn: Senate tax vote likely after Thanksgiving Senate GOP reveals different approach on tax reform MORE of Oklahoma, are concerned about the bills impact on the debt.Meanwhile, Sens.Marco Rubio Marco Antonio RubioOvernight Cybersecurity: What we learned from Carter Page's House Intel testimony | House to mark up foreign intel reform law | FBI can't access Texas shooter's phone | Sessions to testify at hearing amid Russia scrutiny Cornyn: Senate GOP tax plan to be released Thursday This week: GOP seeks to advance tax overhaul MORE (R-Fla.) and Mike Lee Michael (Mike) Shumway LeeOvernight Health Care: Trump officials to allow work requirements for Medicaid GOP senator: CBO moving the goalposts on ObamaCare mandate Cornyn: Senate GOP tax plan to be released Thursday MORE (R-Utah) are pushing for the bill to further increase the size of the child tax credit.A wild card in the process is Trump, who at times has weighed in on the tax process but is now abroad on a nearly two-week Asia trip.Following reports that lawmakers were considering reducing the cap on pretax contributions to 401(k) plans, Trump tweeted that changes to the retirement plans would not be made.More recently, Trump has been pushing for tax-reform legislation to include repeal of ObamaCares individual mandate.As of now, thats not a part of either the House or Senate bills, but the idea is still under discussion.
Three NFL players protest before games on Veterans Day weekend:::::Three NFL players protested during the national anthem prior to Sunday's games, according to multiple media reports.The NFL Players Association unanimously passed a resolution earlier in the week calling for a moment of silence during Sundays games in honor of Veterans Day.No players protested during the early games, but three players knelt during the national anthem at the game between the New York Giants and San Francisco 49ers.49ers Eric Reid and Marquise Goodwin, along with Giants defensive end Olivier Vernon, took a knee during the anthem, according to the Guardian.All three players have been protesting throughout the season.Other players who had previously knelt or raised their fists during the anthem stood this week.Tennessee Titans receiver Rishard Matthews walked onto the field holding hands with soldiers, then stood for the anthem, The Associated Press reported.ADVERTISEMENT Some organizations have previously boycotted NFL games in response to the protests.A Pittsburgh-based branch of the Veterans of Foreign Wars boycotted the Steelers game to respect Veterans Day weekend.NFL players have protested social justice issues, such as police brutality, since the 2016 season, either kneeling or raising a fist during the national anthem.The issue was brought into the spotlight again in September, when President Trump suggested those taking a knee should be fired.Players had been spotted protesting each week since Trump's remarks.Note: This story was updated on Monday to reflect protests by Reid, Goodwin and Vernon.
Brennan: Trump called us hacks to delegitimize intelligence report:::::Former CIA Director John Brennan said Sunday that President Trump called him a political hack in order to cast doubt on his and other intelligence agencies' conclusion that Russia sought to influence the 2016 election.Well first of all, he was referring to us as political hacks because he was trying to delegitimize the intelligence community assessment that was done, Brennan told CNNs State of the Union.ADVERTISEMENT Trump on Saturday said Brennan, former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and former FBI Director James Comey are political hacks.Those leaders were in charge in January, when a declassified report from those three agencies was released that said Russia called for an influence campaign aimed at interfering in the United States election.And then you hear it's 17 agencies.Well, it's three.And one is Brennan and one is whatever.I mean, give me a break.They're political hacks, Trump told reporters.So you look at it I mean, you have Brennan, you have Clapper, and you have Comey.Comey is proven now to be a liar and he's proven to be a leaker, he added.Trump also said he believes Russian President Vladimir Putin means it when he denied Moscow meddled in the United States election.He said he would not "argue" with Putin's denials.After receiving backlash, Trump said he believes the intelligence agencies.I believe that he feels that he and Russia did not meddle in the election, Trump said, referring to Putin.As to whether I believe it or not, I'm with our agencies, especially as currently constituted, with their leadership."Brennan noted that he, Clapper and Comey did not author the January report, saying other intelligence officers did.Its very clear that the Russians interfered in the election and its still puzzling as to why Mr. Trump does not acknowledge that, embrace it and also push back hard against Mr. Putin, he said.
Poll: Democrat leads Roy Moore in Alabama Senate race:::::Democrat Doug Jones is leading Republican Roy Moore in Alabama's Senate race in the wake of explosive accusations of sexual misconduct against Moore, according to a new poll released Sunday.Forty-six percent of likely voters polled said they would vote for Jones, while 42 percent said they would vote for Moore, according to the Louisiana-based JMC Analytics and Polling.The survey was conducted on Nov. 9 and Nov. 11, after The Washington Post reported that a woman said Moore had initiated a sexual encounter with her in 1979, when she was 14 years old and he was 32.In RealClearPolitics's average of polls, Moore was leading by 6 points prior to the Post report.A Friday poll, the first following the scandal, found Moore and Jones tied.ADVERTISEMENT Thirty-eight percent of voters surveyed in the Sunday poll said they were less likely to support Moore following the accusations, while 29 percent of voters said they were more likely to support him.The accusations have shaken up what was thought to be a safe Republican seat, which was previously held by Attorney General Jeff Sessions Jefferson (Jeff) Beauregard SessionsCurtis wins Chaffetz's former Utah House seat Overnight Cybersecurity: What we learned from Carter Page's House Intel testimony | House to mark up foreign intel reform law | FBI can't access Texas shooter's phone | Sessions to testify at hearing amid Russia scrutiny FBI cant unlock Texas shooters phone MORE.It has led numerous Republicans in Congress, and the White House, to call on Moore to bow out of the race if the claims are true.Moore's name will remain on the ballot regardless of whether he drops out of the race.Alabama law does not allow candidates to remove their name from the ballot this soon before an election.However, Moore has shown no sign of dropping his Senate bid, calling the accusations politically motivated."I have not been guilty of sexual misconduct with anyone.These allegations came only four-and-a-half weeks before the general election on Dec. 12," Moore said on Saturday."Why now?""People have waited to four weeks prior to the general election to bring their complaints," he later added."That's not a coincidence.It's an intentional act to stop a campaign."The JMC Analytics poll had 575 completed responses, with a margin of error of 4.1 percentage points.That puts Jones's lead within the margin of error.

12-year-old suing Sessions over marijuana policy:::::A 12-year-old girl in Colorado is suing Attorney General Jeff Sessions Jefferson (Jeff) Beauregard SessionsCurtis wins Chaffetz's former Utah House seat Overnight Cybersecurity: What we learned from Carter Page's House Intel testimony | House to mark up foreign intel reform law | FBI can't access Texas shooter's phone | Sessions to testify at hearing amid Russia scrutiny FBI cant unlock Texas shooters phone MORE over what the lawsuit claims is an unconstitutional federal prohibition on medical marijuana.Alexis Bortell, who uses a strain of cannabis oil called Haleigh's Hope to keep seizures at bay, told Fox 31 in Denver that she hopes the lawsuit will at least normalize medical marijuana.Her best hope, she said, is that it will legalize it nationwide.Marijuana is currently classified as a Schedule I drug the same classification as heroin, and considered more dangerous than substances like cocaine, methamphetamine and fentanyl, an often-deadly synthetic opioid.ADVERTISEMENT But Bortell and others contend that marijuana does, in fact, carry some medical benefits, and that the current federal prohibition ignores people that have been helped by the drug.According to Fox 31, Bortell and her family moved to Colorado to be able to legally obtain cannabis oil to treat her epilepsy.Doctors in her home state of Texas had discussed the possibility of brain surgery for the young girl."I'd say it's a lot better than brain surgery," Bortell told the news station.Medical marijuana has so far been legalized in 29 states and Washington, D.C.While the substance is still prohibited at the federal level, certain protections prevent the Justice Department from using federal funds to prosecute medical marijuana users in states where the substance is legal.But Sessions has indicated a harder line on marijuana, and has been outspoken against the use of the substance.

Roy Moore's Alleged Behavior 'Common Knowledge,' Locals Say:::::A number of residents of Gadsden, Ala., where GOP Senate candidate Roy Moore grew up and practiced law, say his alleged behavior towards teenage girls was common knowledge to locals.These stories have been going around this town for 30 years, Blake Usry, who grew up in Gadsden and lives there currently, told Al.com.Nobody could believe they hadnt come out yet.Moore, 70, has now been accused by five women of inappropriate advances when he was in his 30s and they were in their teens.Four were detailed in a Washington Post report last week.On Monday, another woman stepped forward with an allegation against Moore, saying he sexually assaulted her at 16 while she was working at a local restaurant.Him liking and dating young girls was never a secret in Gadsden when we were all in high school, Sheryl Porter told Al.com.In our neighborhoods up by Noccalula Falls we heard it all the time.Even people at the courthouse know it was a well-known secret.He watched us girls quite openly, added Victoria Beverstock, who said she was a 20-year-old waitress in 1992 working at a local restaurant Moore frequently dined at.His eyes crawled over our shirts and our backsides.He was so open about it that I would try and handle his order as quickly as possible.Despite the allegations and a number of Republican Senators urging him to withdraw from the Dec. 12 election, Moore has continued to deny all accusations and said he is pushing on with his race to beat his Democratic opponent, Doug Jones.I can tell you without hesitation, this is absolutely false, Moore said Monday of the allegations from the fifth and most recent accuser, Beverly Young Nelson.I never did what she said I did.I dont even know the woman.I dont know anything about her.I dont even know where the restaurant is or was.
Jeff Flake: There Is 'No Doubt' I'd Support a Democrat Over Roy Moore:::::Republican Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona said he would support a Democratic candidate over GOP candidate Roy Moore in Alabamas special election for Senate.If this choice is between Roy Moore and a Democrat, a Democrat, Flake told reporters Monday after questioned about who he would support.I would literally if I were in Alabama I would run to the polling place to vote for the Democrat, Flake added, later tweeting the same sentiment.Flake, who last month announced he would not seek re-election to Senate following his highly-publicized criticism of President Donald Trump, made his recent comments in the wake of sexual assault allegations against Moore involving minors.A fifth accuser, Beverly Young Nelson, said in a Monday news conference that Moore assaulted her when she was 16.The Washington Post detailed the other four women who made allegations against Moore in a report last week.Republicans in the Senate, including Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, said Moore should step aside in light of the latest accusations.Flake said that if Moore manages to get elected, he would back calls to expel Moore from the Senate.I dont think it will get to that, but if it does, yes, Flake said.Moore is running against Democratic candidate Doug Jones.The election is slated for Dec. 12 and will fill Attorney General Jeff Sessions vacated seat.
Trump Nominee Didn't Disclose Marriage to White House Lawyer:::::(WASHINGTON) The top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee says a nominee to an Alabama federal judgeship has made a glaring omission by failing to disclose to the Senate that his wife works as a White House lawyer and has been interviewed by special counsel Robert Mueller.California Democrat Dianne Feinstein says Brett Talley needs to answer additional questions about a potential conflict of interest.Talleys wife, Ann Donaldson, has reportedly been interviewed by Mueller, which Feinstein says represents a clear conflict of interest that should have been disclosed.The Judiciary panel approved Talley on a party-line vote last week despite his having received a rare unqualified rating by the American Bar Association.The 36-year-old has never tried a case.
Jury Deadlocked in Trial of New Jersey Senator Bob Menendez:::::(NEWARK, N.J.) The jury in the bribery trial of Democratic U.S. Sen. Bob Menendez and a wealthy donor and friend told the judge on Monday it couldnt reach a verdict on any of the 19 counts against them.The jurys message came after an alternate replaced a juror who was excused last week for a pre-arranged vacation.The excused juror told reporters Thursday she would have voted for acquittal but expected the trial to end in a hung jury.A mistrial would be a major defeat for the government, which spent more than two years investigating the New Jersey senators ties with Florida eye doctor Salomon Melgen and about as long in the run-up to the trial, which is in its 11th week.After the jury sent its note to U.S. District Judge William Walls on Monday, the judge told the panel to go home, have a good meal and a good sleep and clear your heads.He told the jurors to return Tuesday.Four jurors and three alternate jurors told the judge they had heard or read something about the excused jurors comments, and he questioned them individually in his chambers.Jurors have been told repeatedly not to read reports about the case.Defense attorneys argued on Monday that excused juror Evelyn Arroyo-Maultsbys comments that she was told she couldnt send the judge a note last week could represent a breach of protocol.The judge downplayed any notion that the jury had been compromised and accused defense attorney Abbe Lowell of making an issue of it because she was on your side.Prosecutors allege Menendez and Melgen engaged in a bribery scheme between 2006 and 2013 in which Menendez traded his political influence for luxury vacations and flights on the doctors private plane.The men each face about a dozen counts including bribery, fraud and conspiracy.Menendez also is charged with making false statements for failing to report Melgens gifts on Senate disclosure forms.Both men deny the allegations.Defense attorneys have sought to show jurors that the two men are longtime friends who exchanged gifts out of friendship.They also contend Menendezs meetings with government officials were focused on broad policy issues.Arroyo-Maultsbys comments appeared to indicate at least some, and possibly a majority, of the jurors may believe the defenses theory.If the newly constituted panel fails to reach a verdict over the next several days, the judge would have to weigh how long to let it continue before declaring a mistrial.The government then would choose whether to retry the pair.If Menendez is acquitted, it would reinforce the view that official bribery cases have become more difficult to prosecute, a trend traced to last years U.S. Supreme Court ruling that overturned the bribery conviction of former Republican Virginia Gov.Bob McDonnell.That ruling played a significant role in how the jury was instructed in the Menendez trial.
Fifth Accuser Says Roy Moore Sexually Assaulted Her As a Teenager:::::A fifth accuser has come forward against Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore, alleging that he sexually assaulted her when she was a minor.The woman, Beverly Young Nelson, appeared at a press conference Monday in New York City and described how Moore sexually assaulted her when she was a teenager and working as a waitress at a restaurant he frequented.Nelson said that she was 15 when she began working at the Olde Hickory House, a restaurant in Gadsden, Ala. Nelson said that, initially, Moores behavior consisted of complementing her on on her looks and occasionally pulling her hair when she would pass him, but she didnt think anything of it.I had a boyfriendeven if I had not had a boyfriend I was not interested in having a dating or sexual relationship with a man twice my age, she said Monday.Nelson also said that Moore signed her yearbook that month when she brought into work one day.The signature read to a sweeter, more beautiful girl I could not say Merry Christmas.Love Roy Moore, D.A.Allred held up a copy of the yearbook that contained the signature at the press conference.One night in December 1977, a month after Nelson turned 16, her boyfriend was late to pick her up after her shift, and Moore offered to drive her home.Nelson accepted the ride, explaining that she trusted Moore because he was the District Attorney.But she described how, once they were in the car, he drove to a dark and deserted area behind the restaurant, and began groping her when she asked what was happening.She tried to leave the vehicle, she said, but Moore locked the door, and started squeezing her neck, forcing her head toward his crotch and trying to pull her shirt off.I thought he was going to rape me.I was twisting and struggling and begging him to stop, she said, choking up at the recollection.Moore, in a brief press conference Monday night, dismissed the allegation as a political maneuver ahead of his Dec. 12 special election.I can tell you without hesitation, this is absolutely false, Moore said.I never did what she said I did.I dont even know the woman.I dont know anything about her.I dont even know where the restaurant is or was.The newest accusations come less than a week after the Washington Post reported accounts from four women detailing how Moore had pursued them romantically when they were teenagers and he was in his thirties.One of the women, Leigh Corfman, said she was 14 when she met Moore sitting outside a courtroom with her mother before a child custody hearing, and that she and Moore began seeing each other before he initiated sexual contact.Another woman, Gloria Thacker Deason, told the Post that Moore bought her alcohol on dates when she was underage.Nelson said that Moore ultimately capitulated after she fought him that night but warned of repercussions should she speak out.He then looked at me and said, you are the child.I am the District Attorney of Etowah County.If you tell anyone about this, no one will believe you, she recalled.Although Nelson had bruises from the encounter, she used makeup to cover them up.She quit her job and remained silent until two years after the incident, at which point she told her sister.She has also told her mother and her husband.I would probably have taken what Mr. Moore did to me to my grave, had it not been for the courage of four other women that were willing to speak out about their experiences with Mr. Moore, Nelson said.Allred, whose past and current clients include women who have alleged harassment against Bill Cosby, President Donald Trump, and Harvey Weinstein, said that Nelson reached out to her after the Post story was published.Allred is calling for the Senate Judiciary Committee to hold a public hearing where Nelson and Moore can both testify under oath.Moore has repeatedly denied the allegations in the Post, blasting them as fake news and even threatening to sue the Post.He acknowledged in a radio interview with Fox News Sean Hannity that he knew Deason and another woman cited in the Posts report, Debbie Wesson Gibson, but said he did not recall pursuing them romantically, and did not know Corfman.Moores campaign chairman, Bill Armistead sent out a release just minutes before Allreds presser was slated to begin, calling the attorney a sensationalist leading a witch hunt and reiterating the candidates innocence.Judge Moore is an innocent man and has never had any sexual misconduct with anyone, Armistead said.Let it be understood, the truth will come forward, we will pursue all legal options against these false claims and Judge Moore will be vindicated.
'I Believe the Women.' Even More Republicans Want Roy Moore to Step Aside:::::A growing number of Republican leaders called on Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore to step aside Monday, with Mitch McConnell telling reporters that he believes the women who accused the former state Supreme Court Justice of pursuing them when they were teens.One of the women says she was 14 when then-32-year-old Moore touched her sexually.I believe the women, yes, Sen. McConnell said when asked about the allegations at a news conference on Monday.I think he should step aside.The embattled judge fired back at the Majority Leader by suggesting he should leave the Senate.McConnells blunt assessment of Moores future came after the Senate leader and other Republicans said they thought the candidate should drop out of the race if the allegations are true.That qualifier appears to have been dropped on Monday, when more Republican Senators called on the conservative judge to leave the race.In a tweet, Maine Sen. Susan Collins said after listening to Moores radio interview with Sean Hannity and reading his statement, she also thinks he should leave the race.I did not find his denials to be convincing and believe that he should withdraw from the Senate race in Alabama, she said.Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah also tweeted that he agrees with McConnell in calling on Moore to withdraw.These are serious and disturbing accusations, he said.Hatch went on to pitch current Alabama Sen. Luther Strange, who was appointed to fill Attorney General Jeff Sessions Senate seat but lost in the primary to Moore, as an excellent alternative to the candidate.Later Monday afternoon, after a press conference in which a woman came forward to accuse Moore of sexually assaulting her when she was 16, several more Republican Senators called for Moore to drop out.If he continues this will not end well for Mr. Moore, said South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham.The appearance of grossly reprehensible behavior disqualifies him from service in the United States Senate, said Indiana Sen. Todd Young.North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis called the allegations disturbing and said he has serious concerns about Moores fitness for office, and Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake joined him.At his press conference earlier on Monday, McConnell was also asked if Strange would enter the contest as a write-in candidate.Thats an option were looking at, he said.Colorado Sen. Cory Gardner, who serves as the chair of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, released a statement on Monday afternoon calling Moore unfit to serve in the United States Senate.Gardner said that if Moore refuses to withdraw from the race and wins, the Senate should vote to expel him.I believe the individuals speaking out against Roy Moore spoke with courage and truth, proving he is unfit to serve in the United States Senate and he should not run for office, the statement reads.If he refuses to withdraw and wins, the Senate should vote to expel him, because he does not meet the ethical and moral requirements of the United States Senate.
Meet the Democrat Running Against Embattled Republican Roy Moore:::::Alabama voters will cast their ballots on Dec. 12 in a special election to fill the Senate seat left vacant by Attorney General Jeff Sessions.The Republican candidate, Roy Moore, a former state Supreme Court justice who was twice removed from the bench, has consistently led in the polls.His ultra-conservative views he has suggested that Muslims should not be able to serve in Congress and that gays and lesbians make unfit parents and his disdain for establishment Republicans seemed to have connected with voters.But earlier this month, allegations arose in a Washington Post report claiming that Moore initiated sexual contact with a 14-year-old girl and pursued relationships with other teenage women while he was in his 30s.(Moore has since threatened to file a lawsuit against the Post.)The claims have thrown the elections outcome into question, as Moores Democratic opponent, Doug Jones, has gained in the polls in recent days.Top Republicans, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, are now calling for Moore to step aside.Heres what know about Doug Jones, Roy Moores Democratic rival for Alabamas open Senate seat.Who is Doug Jones?Democrat Doug Jones is a former Alabama U.S. attorney, appointed to that position in 1997 by former President Bill Clinton.Hes best known for serving as the lead prosecutor in a successful 2002 case against two Ku Klux Klan members responsible for the 1963 Birmingham church bombing that killed four young black girls.In a 2013 interview with the Los Angeles Times, Jones said the case changed the way he felt about Birmingham for the better.It was an emotionally draining caseit would drain you every day.But from that point on, its been nothing but uplifting, he said.Jones also indicted a man who targeted an Alabama abortion clinic with a bomb in 1998, leaving one off-duty police officer dead.The bomber, Eric Robert Rudolph, plead guilty in 2005, after Jones had left office and began working as a private attorney.What policies does Doug Jones support?As a Democrat running a statewide campaign in deep-red Alabama, Jones chances might seem slim.But the candidate has been running on a platform focused on what he described in a recent conversation with reporters as kitchen-table issues.Jobs, the economy ...Healthcare is such an important issue for the state, Jones said, according to the Los Angeles Times.Were a poor state, were an unhealthy state and healthcare is probably the biggest issue thats causing folks to take a look at this race and hit a political reset button.Jones campaign website also cites civil rights, criminal justice reform, bringing integrity back to Washington, and the environment among the candidates priorities.What are Jones chances of winning?Alabama, a Republican stronghold, has not elected a Democrat to serve in the U.S. Senate in two decades.President Donald Trump trounced Hillary Clinton there in the 2016 presidential election, winning the state by 28 points.The national Democratic Party has taken a mostly hands-off approach to the state, USA Today reports.But the allegations against Moore have thrown the usual political calculus out the window, especially as an increasing number of top Republicans, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, have called for him to step aside.A RealClearPolitics average of recent polling for the race show Moore in the lead by two points.However, a poll conducted after the Washington Posts report shows Jones leading Moore with four points, with a four point.A separate poll released a day after the report found the race tied at 46.But AL.com reports at least three other surveys conducted after the Post story was published still showed Moore in the lead.
Is Joe Biden Running for President in 2020? Probably Not:::::Joe Biden is having the best week of any of his two or maybe three runs for President of the United States.Biden, the former vice president under Barack Obama, has a new memoir out, Promise Me, Dad.He was just interviewed by Oprah, telling her that he thinks he could have beaten former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in the 2016 Democratic primary.Biden had another interview with the Today show, during which he said hes not closing the door to another presidential campaign in 2020.And Biden is telling friends he may be the only Democrat who can beat Donald Trump.Meanwhile, all of Bidens flaws have been cast in a more favorable light.As he notes in the book, his reputation as a gaffe machine was no longer looking like a weakness in light of Trumps candidacy in 2016.That will be only more true in 2020.His age Biden would be 78 on inauguration day in 2021, making him the oldest U.S. president ever elected hardly seems as big a factor considering that Trump will be 74 and Vermont Democratic Sen. Bernie Sanders will be 79.And Bidens blue-collar image as the scrappy kid from Scranton, Pa., seems like a strong argument at a time when voters in depressed former steel towns like Johnstown say theyre standing by Trump.But if Joseph Robinette Biden Jr. learned anything from his failed presidential campaigns in 1988 and 2008, its that good weeks are followed by bad weeks, and that while good weeks can be nice, bad weeks can end a campaign.First, the Biden boomlet is being driven entirely by the leadership vacuum in the Democratic Party right now.House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi has little legislative power and high unfavorable ratings.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer fares a little better, but his favorability ratings have taken a hit since he took over from Harry Reid.Tom Perez?The head of the Democratic National Committee is hardly a household name.Sanders?Not technically a Democrat, but he has a following, as does Massachusetts Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren.New York Democratic Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand?California Gov.Jerry Brown?Billionaire businessman Mark Cuban?None have the sway or position necessary to lay claim to the title of de facto head of the Democratic Party.Meantime, Biden has national name recognition that boosts him in the mostly meaningless polls about 2020 being taken right now.Biden is not currently serving, which means he doesnt take any blame for the perceived ineffectiveness of the Democratic caucus.(A major reason why favorable views of the party have hit their lowest mark in a quarter century of polling.)The death of his son, Beau, from brain cancer in 2015, which Biden revisits in Promise Me, Dad, also gives him a powerful story of grief and loss, which serves as a counterpoint to Trump, a commander-in-chief who struggled with a simple condolence call to a military widow.So will Joe Biden run for president?Thats an open question.Hes been around national politics long enough to know that his book and his ideas on politics will get more attention as long as he doesnt rule it out.But even if Biden does, hell still face a huge Democratic field full of fresh faces making arguments for bold new ideas.His run-of-the-mill gaffes may not matter as much in the post-Trump era, but in a Democratic primary, the fact that Biden somehow always ends up photographed with a woman biker on his lap or giving a woman a back rub while her husband is being sworn in may play differently in the post-Harvey Weinstein era.And his style of politics offering olive branches to Republicans, arguing that Democrats should work with Trump, seeking compromise over friendly lunches with the opposition may not be much in demand among an angry liberal grassroots in 2020.Joe Biden may run for president.Or Biden may decide, as he did in 2016, that hes not interested in running.But either way, the real test will be whether Democrats are interested in him.
Mitch McConnell: Roy Moore "Should Step Aside":::::(WASHINGTON) The top Republican in the Senate said Monday GOP candidate Roy Moore should quit his Alabama race amid allegations he had sexual contact with a 14-year-old girl and pursued romantic relationships with other teenage girls decades ago.I believe the women, said Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.The Kentucky Republican said flatly that Moore should step aside for another GOP candidate days after the Washington Post report that rocked the campaign for what the GOP had considered an inevitable special election win on Dec. 12.When the story first broke last Thursday, McConnell had said Moore should step aside if the allegations were true.Less than an hour later, Moore fired back on Twitter, writing, The person who should step aside is [Mitch McConnell].He has failed conservatives and must be replaced.#DrainTheSwamp.McConnell, questioned at a tax event in Louisville, said a write-in effort by another candidate was a possibility.Thats an option were looking at whether or not there is someone who can mount a write-in campaign successfully, McConnell said.Asked specifically about current Sen. Luther Strange, the loser to Moore in a party primary, he said, Well see.On the Democratic side, one of the Senates moderate members is helping Moores challenger raise campaign funds, underscoring the partys wary approach in an Alabama race that until recently was viewed as a virtually certain win for the GOP.In fact, the fundraising bid by Sen. Joe Donnelly, D-Ind., doesnt mention allegations about Moore.Dougs opponent, Roy Moore, is an extremist with a record of putting political ideology above the rule of law, Donnelly wrote in a weekend email soliciting contributions for Democrat Doug Jones.Moore and Jones face a Dec. 12 special election to replace Strange, who was appointed to replace Jeff Sessions when Sessions was named U.S. attorney general.Donnellys email also cites Jones background as the son of a steelworker and a prosecutor who worked to lock away members of the KKK and terrorists for despicable acts of violence.Donnelly faces re-election next year in Indiana and is considered one of his partys most endangered incumbents.In a further indication of Democrats caution, the partys No.2 Senate leader, Richard Durbin, dodged a question Sunday about what the Senate should do if Moore is elected.He tried to shift the focus back to Republicans.President Trump is the leader of the Republican Party in America.Its his responsibility to step forward and say more and do more when it comes to the situation in Alabama, Durbin, D-Ill., said on CNNs State of the Union.Moore said a lawsuit will be filed over the Post report that detailed the allegations against him.While pressure to quit the race four weeks before Election Day intensified from within the Republican Party, Moore assured supporters Sunday night at a Huntsville, Alabama, gym that the article was fake news and a desperate attempt to stop my political campaign.Moore said allegations that he was involved with a minor child are untrue and said the newspaper will be sued, drawing a round of applause.The former judge also questioned why such allegations would be leveled for the first time so close to the special election in spite of his decades in public life.Why would they come now?Because there are groups that dont want me in the United States Senate, he said, naming the Democratic Party and the Republican establishment and accusing them of working together.He added, We do not plan to let anybody deter us from this race.The Post story quoted four women by name, including the woman who alleged the sexual contact at 14, and had two dozen other sources.Moore, too, has tried to raise money from the controversy, writing in a fundraising pitch that the vicious and sleazy attacks against me are growing more vicious by the minute.Even if Moore were to step aside, his name would likely remain on the ballot.And any effort to add Strange as a write-in candidate would threaten to divide the GOP vote in a way that would give the Democratic candidate a greater chance of winning.Moore is an outspoken Christian conservative and former state Supreme Court judge.While he has called the allegations completely false and misleading, in an interview with conservative radio host Sean Hannity he did not wholly rule out dating teenage girls when he was in his early 30s.Asked if that would have been usual for him, Moore said, Not generally, no.The situation has stirred concern among anxious GOP officials in Washington in a key race to fill the Senate seat once held by Sessions.Losing the special election to a Democrat would imperil Republicans already slim 52-48 majority.But a Moore victory also would pose risks if he were to join the Senate GOP under a cloud of sexual misconduct allegations.
President Trump Names Drug Company Executive to His Cabinet:::::(WASHINGTON) Turning to an industry hes rebuked, President Donald Trump on Monday picked a former top pharmaceutical and government executive be his health and human services secretary, overseeing a $1 trillion department responsible for major health insurance programs, medical research, food and drug safety, and public health.The nomination of Alex Azar is unusual because HHS secretaries have tended to come from the ranks of elected officials such as governors, leaders in academia, or top executive branch managers not industries regulated by the department.He will be a star for better healthcare and lower drug prices!Trump tweeted in announcing the nomination Monday morning.Azar, 50, a lawyer by training, has spent most of the last 10 years with pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly, rising to president of its key U.S. affiliate before leaving in January to start his own consulting firm.Hes seen as an expert on government health care regulation.As HHS secretary, Azar would have to scrupulously avoid conflicts with Lillys far-reaching interests, from drug approval to Medicare reimbursement.The drugmaker has drawn criticism from patient advocacy groups for price increases to one of its biggest products: insulin.Americans consistently rank the high cost of prescription drugs as one of their top health care priorities, putting it ahead of divisive issues like repealing Obamacare in public opinion polls.Trump has been a sharp critic of the industry.The drug companies, frankly, are getting away with murder, the president said at a Cabinet meeting this fall.Prices are out of control and have gone through the roof, Trump said.In the spring, a Trump tweet sent drug stocks tumbling after the president said he was working on a new system that would foster competition and lead to much lower prices.In meetings with industry executives, however, Trump has focused on speeding up drug approvals, a cost-reducing tactic they would back.Professionally, Azar has another set of skills that may be valuable to the president.As a top HHS official during the George W. Bush administration, the Yale law graduate developed an insiders familiarity with the complex world of federal health care regulation, serving first as the departments chief lawyer and later as deputy secretary.Frustrated by fruitless efforts to overturn the Affordable Care Act in Congress, Trump might see the regulatory route as his best chance to make a mark on health care.Congressional Democrats are likely to pounce on Azars drug ties, reminding Trump of his promise to drain the swamp of Washington influence peddling.Azar admirers say his industry experience should be considered an asset, not a liability.To the extent that the Trump administration has talked about lowering drug prices, heres a guy who understands how it works, said Tevi Troy, who served with Azar in the Bush administration and now leads the American Health Policy Institute, a think tank focused on employer health insurance.Would (Azar) have been better off if he had been meditating in an ashram after serving as deputy secretary?asked Troy.Azar spent his formative years in Maryland.He got his bachelors degree in government and economics from another Ivy League institution, Dartmouth.He once clerked for the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, a revered figure for conservatives.During the Bill Clinton years, he served a stint with independent counsel Kenneth Starr.If confirmed, Azar would be Trumps second HHS secretary, replacing former Georgia congressman Tom Price, who stepped down after just seven months, when his use of private charter planes for government travel created a public controversy that displeased the president.
Epileptic 12-Year-Old Girl Sues US Over Marijuana Law:::::Attorney General Jeff Sessions is being sued by a 12-year-old girl with epilepsy over the nation's marijuana policy.Texas-born Alexis Bortell has filed a suit in New York claiming the federal prohibition on marijuana is unconstitutional."She just wants to be like everybody else," Alexis' father, Dean Bortell, told NBC News."When she grows up she wants to be free to choose where she lives and what she does for a living.She wants to be treated like an American citizen and not just a state citizen.She doesn't want to have to fear going to jail every time she sees a police officer."The youngster, who uses a strain of cannabis oil called Haleigh's Hope to help with her seizures, had to move from Texas to Colorado because her traditional medicine was not helping and the family wanted to be able to legally obtain cannabis oils to help treat the sixth-grader."As the seizures got worse, we had to move to Colorado to get cannabis because it's illegal in Texas," Alexis told Fox affiliate in Colorado.In her complaint filed in the U.S. District Court in the Southern District of New York in July, the girl's lawyer, Michael Hiller, argues the youngster ran the gamut of prescription pills, all of which failed to control her seizures before she was left with two options: brain surgery or cannabis, NBC News reported.A drop of liquid THC twice a day has kept her seizure-free for two-and-a-half years."I'd say it's a lot better than brain surgery," which doctors had previously offered, the youngster told the Fox affiliate.Alexis and her family hope if the suit is successful, she can finally return her Texas home, NBC News reported."She's a little kid that survived big-world knocks and is still standing," Dean Bortell told NBC News.
New Republic Editor: Knee-Jerk Liberals Cloud Trump's Moderating Tone:::::President Donald Trump showed a moderated tone on foreign policy during his current Asia trip, but liberals, who should be happy about it, are instead wasting time mocking him, New Republic editor Jeet Heer writes.In a column on the New Republic's website, Heer notes much of the "knee-jerk" reaction ended up being based on false information, including the supposed gaffe of Trump dumping an entire box of fish food into a koi pond during a visit with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.It turned out Trump had only been following Abe's lead.Heer admitted he had been guilty himself when he tweeted Trump's speech in Japan had been "staggering in its ignorance" when Trump called for Japanese automakers to begin building their cars in the United States.Turns out, Trump had earlier noted he knows Japan already builds cars in the U.S., and just wants them to build even more.Heer blamed his own piling on of Trump on CBS White House reporter Mark Knoller, who had tweeted, "Pres Trump asks Japanese auto makers if they could build their cars in the US and not just ship them over."But all the liberal ridicule drowned out Trump's speech on North Korea, which liberals should have been happy with, Heer said.Trump turned from his previous tweets against North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un, whom he has mocked with the name "Little Rocket Man" and threatening to rain down "fire and fury," and instead gave an impassioned speech on how the lives of North Koreans differ from those in democratic South Korea."Far from valuing its people as equal citizens, this cruel dictatorship measures them, scores them, and ranks them based on the most arbitrary indications of their allegiance to the state," Trump said."Those who score the highest in loyalty may live in the capital city.Those who score the lowest starve."But the quickness for critics "to pile on the president, at the expense of policy analysis," shows the left's "growing problem," Heer said."Liberals and their media allies are becoming knee-jerk anti-Trumpists, always on the lookout for the president's next embarrassing, meme-able gaffe and sometimes pouncing without getting their facts straight."CNN and the Associated Press joined in the chorus of "admitted liberals" chiding Trump over the koi feeding non-gaffe, he noted.Even Trump's apparent kowtowing to Chinese President Xi Jinping requires a "nuanced critique," Heer said."Such wooing may be cringeworthy, but worth the embarrassment if it cements U.S.China cooperation, especially when it comes to regional stability," he said.And, Heer added, Trump even indicated he would be open to talks with North Korea."Liberals should welcome such news rather than hunting for pseudo-gaffes," he said.
Trump Jr. Communicated With WikiLeaks Before Election:::::Donald Trump Jr. secretly communicated with WikiLeaks leading up to the election last fall, according to a new report.The organization published classified and/or leaked content on its website, including emails from the Democratic National Committee that painted Hillary Clinton and others in a bad light.The Atlantic reported Monday that someone at WikiLeaks communicated with Trump Jr. on several occasions via direct messages on Twitter.The messages began last September and ended this July, although Trump Jr. stopped responding last October.The first communication, according to The Atlantic, occurred Sept. 20, 2016."A PAC run anti-Trump site putintrump.org is about to launch.The PAC is a recycled pro-Iraq war PAC.We have guessed the password.It is 'putintrump.'See 'About' for who is behind it.Any comments?"WikiLeaks wrote.That website was started by tech entrepreneur Rob Glaser and was bankrolled by the Progress for USA Political Action Committee."Off the record I don't know who that is, but I'll ask around.Thanks," Trump Jr. responded the following day.In the months that followed, WikiLeaks would ask Trump Jr. for favors or provide information to him.Trump Jr. did not respond to every message, The Atlantic reported.Among WikiLeaks' requests were: Asking for President Donald Trump's tax returns.Trump Jr. did not respond.Asking that President Trump request WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange be appointed Australian ambassador to the U.S. Trump Jr. did not respond.Asking that President Trump tweet a link to WikiLeaks' trove of stolen and leaked documents.President Trump posted a tweet 15 minutes later that praised WikiLeaks (it did not contain the link).Trump Jr. tweeted out the link two days later.Trump Jr.'s lawyers gave the Twitter messages to congressional investigators as they dig into whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia in any way.Trump Jr. has come under fire for meeting with Russians at Trump Tower in the summer of 2016, a meeting that was set up on the premise of providing damaging information about Clinton to the Trump camp.
Club for Growth: GOP Tax Bill Will Repeal Individual Mandate:::::Club for Growth President David McIntosh predicted Monday the Obamacare individual mandate will be repealed in the GOP tax bill and that'll have the support of Republicans in the Senate.In an interview on "Bloomberg Markets: Balance of Power," McIntosh also dismissed worries from deficit hawks about the tax reform measure."To get to sustained growth of 4 percent it will take a major major tax cut," he said.According to McIntosh, you should expect a repeal of Obamacare's individual mandate in the GOP House legislation."It keeps the expansion of Medicaid and the spending on insurance," he said."You might see it in this context, where you don't have the whole repeal of Obamacare, just that one part.i think you could get the Republicans in the Senate to vote for that."McIntosh also said his biggest concern with the House legislation is that "they haven't done enough to stimulate growth on the individual side" and for "businesses that are not large," he said "I think you'll see movement in that direction in the next few days ...The Senate bill is definitely better.""He also said lowering the top rate will "offset the loss of the state and local deduction."
Ex-CIA, NSA Hayden: 'Think Twice' Before Taking Trump Job:::::Former CIA and National Security Agency head Michael Hayden says his advice for anyone offered a high-ranking intelligence job by President Donald Trump is to think it over carefully."If someone were to call me and say 'I've been offered a senior job,' I'd tell them 'Think twice,'" Hayden told The Hill.Hayden told The Hill tensions have renewed between the president and intelligence services after Trump said during his Asia trip he believes Russian President Vladimir Putin's assertion his country did not meddle in the 2016 American presidential election.Trump has since walked back that statement to say he believes Putin "feels he and Russia did not meddle in the election," while adding, "As to whether or not I believe it or not, I'm with our agencies.I believe in our ...intelligence agencies."That answer has not satisfied many in the intel agency, including former CIA Director John Brennan and former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, who both served under President Barack Obama.Trump responded to their criticism by calling them "political hacks."Hayden said that response is doing nothing to foster morale within the ranks."For a while he was saying Putin's sincerity trumped the fact-based intelligence," Hayden said."People will ask themselves 'Does what I do still matter?'"Trump's statement he backs the intelligence community "as currently constituted" also is "an insult to the intelligence community."Hayden also told The Hill he believes Trump appointees Dan Coats, who is Director of National Intelligence, and Mike Pompeo, who runs the CIA, want to run agencies independent of their boss.But his actions put them in a position of pleasing both Trump and their staffs in public statements.If they side too closely with their employees who believe Russia meddled, they could lose access to the president.There is a way for Trump to make up, though, Hayden said."He'd need to say three sentences: 'The Russians did it.I know the Russians did it.We will not rest until we know the extent of what Russia did and what we can do to stop it from happening again,'" he said.
NYT: Two WH Officials Float Replacing Moore With Sessions:::::Two White House officials have floated the idea of replacing beleaguered Alabama GOP Senate candidate Roy Moore with Attorney General Jeff Sessions, The New York Times reports.Sessions held the seat before he was appointed to AG and could take it again if Gov.Kay Ivey of Alabama were to immediately appoint him when it becomes vacant again.A source told ABC News' Tara Palmeri that Sessions was not interested in reclaiming his old seat, saying, "this is wishful thinking by people who probably don't even know Jeff Sessions, and certainly haven't spoken to him."Source close to Sessions added: this is wishful thinking by people who probably dont even know Jeff Sessions, and certainly havent spoken to him.https://t.co/2SGjk8DUF6 Tara Palmeri (@tarapalmeri) November 13, 2017 Moore has been battling allegations reported last week by The Washington Post he had sexual contact with a 14-year-old girl decades ago when he was in his 30s and pursued romantic relationships with three other teenagers.A new accuser came forward Monday saying Moore, now 70, sexually assaulted her in the 1970s.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Moore should quit the contest, and National Republican Senatorial Committee Chair Cory Gardner said if Moore refuses to withdraw and wins, "the Senate should vote to expel him."
Jeb Bush: Roy Moore Should Step Aside:::::Former Florida Gov.Jeb Bush said Monday he would like to see Roy Moore, the Republican candidate in the Alabama Senate race, step aside because of the sexual misconduct allegations leveled at him.Bush said it does not come down to Moore being innocent or guilty in a criminal sense, but rather doing the right thing."I would," Bush told CNBC when asked if he agrees with others who say Moore should step down."This is not a question of innocence or guilt like in a criminal proceeding, this is a question of what's right and what's wrong.Acknowledging that you're dating teenagers when you're 32 years old as assistant state attorney is wrong.It's just plain wrong."Five women have come forward in the last week, saying Moore had sexual contact and/or pursued romantic relationships with them when they were teenagers several decades ago.Two of the women were minors at the time, which in Alabama means they were under the age of 16.Moore has denied doing anything wrong or breaking any laws.He served as Alabama chief justice from 2013 to 2017."We need to stand for basic principles, and decency has to be one of those," Bush said Monday."In the really poisonous political environment we have right now, one of the rules I think has to apply is that when you attack somebody on the other party, and the other team, for doing something wrong, when it happens on your team you have an obligation, I think, to speak out as well."Several other Republicans have called on Moore to step aside from the Senate race as well, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.
Former VP Joe Biden Would Have 'Never' Taken Clinton's Place, He Says:::::Joe Biden said Monday he would "never" have agreed to replace Hillary Clinton as the Democratic presidential nominee in 2016, following reports ex-DNC chair Donna Brazile said she considered switching the party's candidate after Clinton suffered a fainting spell just two months before the election."I give you my word," Biden said on NBC's "Today.""I would never have taken it.I was for Hillary.I did 83 campaign events for Hillary.I think I can say I did more events and worked harder for Hillary, as hard for Hillary, as anyone else.She would have been a first-rate president."Brazile in her book, "Hacks: The Inside Story of the Break-ins and Breakdowns That Put Donald Trump in the White House," wrote she considered using the power afforded her under the DNC's charter to replace a candidate should they become disabled.She said she received a call from Biden's chief of staff saying the vice president wanted to speak with her the morning after Clinton's spell, and she wrote she thought then, "Gee, I wonder what he wanted to talk to me about?"Biden said Brazile's book was the first time he or any of his staff heard of such a possibility.He also noted he was not ready to run for president, regardless, a decision he made long before last fall."I was not ready in terms of my family," Biden told NBC's Matt Lauer."So, no, I would never have done that."
Orrin Hatch: Luther Strange 'Excellent Alternative' to Roy Moore:::::Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, weighed in Monday on the controversy over allegations of sexual misconduct by Roy Moore, the Republican senator candidate in Alabama.Hatch recommended Luther Strange, the sitting Alabama Republican senator who lost a runoff to Moore, as an "alternative" to Moore's candidacy for the Alabama Senate.Hatch made the comment Monday in a tweet: I stand with the Majority Leader on this.These are serious and disturbing accusations, and while the decision is now in the hands of the people of Alabama, I believe Luther Strange is an excellent alternative.https://t.co/L7IallXhBc Orrin Hatch (@OrrinHatch) November 13, 2017 Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said Monday he believed the women who accused Moore and that Moore should "step aside."The Washington Post reported that a woman accused Moore of initiating a sexual encounter with her in 1979, when he was 32 and she was 14.The report also contained claims from other women, who were also teens at the time of the incidents.Strange on Thursday called the Washington Post report "very, very disturbing," according to The Hill.
Schiff: Trump's Actions Toward Putin 'Remarkable and Remarkably Bad':::::President Donald Trump "basically saying" he accepts Russian President Vladimir Putin at his word on election interference is "remarkable and remarkably bad," Rep. Adam Schiff said Monday."Here you have the president of the United States meeting with a foreign adversary basically saying, 'I not only accept Mr. Putin at his word, but it's insulting to Mr. Putin to raise these things,'" the California Democrat told MSNBC's "Andrea Mitchell Reports" program.While speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One on Saturday, Trump called former CIA Director John Brennan and former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, along with former FBI Director James Comey "political hacks."All three have said they believe Russia interfered with the election."It is really unthinkable, and while this does some more damage to the intelligence community, it mostly damages the president himself," Schiff said."It impeaches his own credibility.People know director Clapper, director Brannan, and have enormous confidence and faith in them within the intelligence community and out.We now have a situation where the president of the United States says 'Well, I raised the Russian meddling issue during the meeting,' and they're saying, "No, he didn't.'"The White House also is saying that Trump raised the matter of human rights abuses with Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte, but officials from there said that also did not happen."Who would imagine a situation, Andrea, where people around the world our allies and foes alike don't know whether they can believe the word of the president of the United States?"he told show anchor Andrea Mitchell."This is what he's brought on himself."
Sen. Collins Says 'Unconvincing' Moore Should Withdraw From Race:::::Sen. Susan Collins on Monday became the latest Republican to call for Roy Moore to step down from running in Alabama's special election.Collins, like Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell earlier in the day, abandoned the "if the charges are true" mantra to say that the former Alabama Supreme Court judge should just go away."I have now read Mr. Moore's statement and listened to his radio interview in which he denies the charges.I did not find his denials to be convincing and believe that he should withdraw from the Senate race in Alabama," Collins said in a statement on Monday.Moore has remained resolute and defiant, saying he will move forward in his race for the special election next month to replace the vacant Senate seat left by Attorney General Jeff Sessions.McConnell earlier Monday said he is mulling whether to endorse interim Sen. Luther Strange, who Moore soundly defeated in the special GOP primary, as a write-in candidate for the Dec. 12 special election.
Crowley: Republicans Increasingly Opposing GOP Tax Reform Bills:::::Republicans from states that would be hit hard by losing their deductions for state and local taxes are coming forward to oppose the party's tax reform bills, and if more join, that bill will go down, Rep. Joe Crowley said Monday."I think when you look at the fact that when you're getting rid of that state and local tax deduction, that really hits states like California, hits states like New York, hits states like Illinois, hits states like Pennsylvania, just to name a few," the New York Democrat told MSNBC's "Morning Joe" program."New Jersey is another.And much of, I think, the growth of the Republican party within those states has been in the suburban areas."Crowley said that the loss of such deductions means that about 28 percent of Americans will see an increase, not a decrease, in their taxes."That's middle class America," he told the program, and most won't want to lose money while giving the nation's wealthiest a tax break.If California keeps all its votes against the tax reform bill, and Republicans continue to oppose it, "the bill is dead," Crowley said, as "it is actually against the interests of their constituents."In addition the loss of state and local tax deductions, there are "other horrible things" in the GOP bill, Crowley said, including eliminating a tax credit for hiring veterans, or deductions for people like teachers for buying extra school supplies."There's so many little things in this bill that make it in many respects for me immoral, but I think the double taxation of states like California, like New York, like New Jersey, even Pennsylvania ...it's a very, very political document," he added.Meanwhile, Crowley has said he believes Democrats have a better than 50 percent chance of retaking the House in 2018, and on Monday he said the politics of impeachment are already becoming a campaign issue."We've seen the [Tom] Steyer ads," Crowley said."I think there's real concern about the direction of our country and where the president has taken us, not just in terms of overseas but domestically as well.The desperation to get this tax bill passed at all costs is because of the donor base."
Poll: Moore Has 10-Point Lead Over Jones in Alabama:::::Alabama Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore is favored by 55 percent of the state's voters, while his Democratic opponent, Doug Jones is backed by 45 percent, a new Emerson College poll reveals."The poll was conducted Nov. 9-11, in the immediate aftermath of a Washington Post story detailing allegations of sexual advances of Moore with an underage woman within the past 40 years," says a report accompanying the poll results.Here are the highlights from the Alabama survey released Monday: 28 percent of the polled said the Post story influence who they backed, while 59 percent said the newspaper's report made no difference.42 percent gave Moore a favorable rating, compared to 37 percent who did not.31 percent rated Jones favorably, compared to 40 percent who gave him an unfavorable rating.58 percent of those polled approved of the job Donald Trump is doing as president, compared to 36 percent who did not.According to the pollster, the 10-point gap between the two candidates represents a closing of the margin.An Emerson poll in September had shown Moore in the lead by 22 points.Six hundred people were polled.The survey has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.9 percent.
Thanks to Gerrymandering, Future Not So Rosy for Dems Despite Wins:::::Even with the Democratic victories in Virginia and elsewhere in last week's elections, experts say that gerrymandering will make it difficult to translate clear majorities of popular support into significant changes in the distribution of seats in the legislatures, The New York Times reported on Monday.A Los Angeles Times editorial explained clearly the problem.In the last three previous elections in Virginia, Republicans won two-thirds of the seats, although Democrats won a slight majority of votes in each case.Even as Democrats had their best showing overall in more than 30 years last week and won well over 50 percent of the statewide votes, this did not apparently result in winning even a majority of the seats in the Virginia House of Delegates pending the results of some recounts.The editorial points out the bottom line is that gerrymandering works by allowing a party to retain control of a legislature even as voters clearly chose the other side, and that will also hold true in next year's midterms "If Democrats win 52, 53, 54 percent of the national House vote, we're likely to see Republicans hold onto control," University of Chicago professor Nicholas Stephanopoulos, an expert on gerrymanders, told The New York Times."Unless there's a true wave, I think Democrats will be disappointed in 2018."Republicans reject the idea that gerrymandering is helping them."What you've got there is a classic fig leaf by the Democrats to explain their ineptitude and lack of focus and ultimate lack of ability to convince the voters they have a plan to move forward," said Republican State Leadership Committee President Matt Walter.In any case, Democrats have more problems than just gerrymandering.The party's base in largely clustered in a smaller number of congressional districts, even when the districts are drawn in a fair way.In addition, differences between the party's establishment and its activist base threaten to produce a divisive primary season, and President Donald Trump remains popular in large parts of the country, especially rural areas, where the appeal of Democrats has faded in recent years.Eric H. Holder Jr., the former attorney general who is heading a Democratic effort to challenge gerrymandering, told the Times he had no doubt about the challenge ahead."It's almost going to take a historic wave to overcome the gerrymandered map in a handful of states," Holder said."When you have a massive Democratic wave in Virginia and the question of who has the majority in the House of Delegates is still up in the air, I think that shows how daunting the task is going to be."Holder also cites as a problem the impact of state-level voting procedures in threatening to disadvantage lower-income and minority voters.Former New York Republican Rep. Thomas Reynolds, who headed the National Republican Congressional Committee in 2006, admitted that the congressional map was far better for the GOP now than it was a dozen years ago, the last time a Democratic wave election managed to take control of the House."Redistricting has strengthened both state chambers and the Congress, and that is much more significant in 2017 than it was in 2006," Reynolds told the Times."Look how many seats are in play.It's not that many."
Jordan: DOJ Silent on Special Counsel for Clinton Probe:::::GOP lawmakers have been calling for a special counsel to investigate the ongoing concerns over 2016 Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, former FBI Director James Comey, and the Obama White House since July, but the only answer from the Justice Department has been silence, Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, said Monday."Twenty Republicans sent a letter on July 27 calling for a special counsel," Jordan told Fox News' "America's Newsroom.""We met with [Attorney General Jeff Sessions] on Sept. 28 and some of his staff.We brought up the same issue.The response from the Justice Department has been silence."Jordan, along with Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., penned a Monday opinion piece for Fox News demanding Attorney General Jeff Sessions either take action or step down."The response from the Sessions Justice Department is no different than the response we got on a lot of questions from the [Eric] Holder and [Loretta] Lynch Justice Department," Jordan said."That's our concern.When you have all these questions, let's appoint a special counsel."Former FBI Director Robert Mueller, the special counsel in the Russia interference investigation, is "inherently compromised" because of his role in the Obama administration, Jordan said, so a special counsel needs to be appointed to get the answers about Clinton.Among those questions are why Comey referred to the probe into Clinton's use of a private email server as a "matter," rather than an investigation."Think about what James Comey did," Jordan said."[He] misled the American people, trying to call the Clinton investigation a matter and misled the American people when he let the public believe President [Donald] Trump was under investigation when he wasn't.He misled the American people twice."Further, claimed Jordan, "we know the Justice Department tried to influence the election," including with Lynch's meeting with former President Bill Clinton on an airport tarmac in Phoenix."All of it cries out for a special counsel," Jordan said."We ask Mr.Sessions to appoint a special counsel so the American people can get the answers."
Gohmert: Cohen Must Apologize to House Hearing Witness:::::Rep. Louie Gohmert, R-Texas, said Monday that his colleague, Tennessee Democratic Rep. Steve Cohen, should apologize to a conservative activist who testified on the "Heartbeat Bill," The Washington Times reports.During a hearing for the House Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution and Civil Justice on Nov. 1, activist Star Parker testified that abortion should not be classified as a health welfare program as she claimed Democrats often do.Cohen called her "ignorant," and the exchange became heated."Our witness, that we had invited, was being attacked," Gohmert said on Fox News this week."And my friend from Tennessee, as we like to say, he was demanding an apology from her after what had been done to her and her community.My word, the apology shouldve gone the other way."Parker wrote an op-ed released by The Tribune-Democrat on Monday in which she wrote that Cohen approached her after the hearing and demanded an apology."After the hearing, he approached me, put his finger in my face, and told me to come to his office and personally apologize to him," she wrote."The only apology I have to make is that I do not have more opportunities to testify against the distortions and damage caused by liberals such as Cohen."
Report: More Sex Assault Claims Forthcoming Against Roy Moore:::::Another woman is expected to reveal new sexual assault allegations against Alabama Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore, The Birmingham News is reporting.Attorney Gloria Allred has scheduled a press conference for Monday afternoon with a new accuser.According to the newspaper, the Alabama woman alleges Moore assaulted her when she was a minor.The latest claim follows a Washington Post report that a woman named Leigh Corfman claimed Moore inappropriately touched her when she was 14 and he was 32 back in 1979.The Post said three other women claimed Moore pursued them when they were between 16 and 18.On Monday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell called on Moore to drop his candidacy, CNN reported."I believe the women, yes," McConnell said.
Alabama GOP Senator: 'God Help Us as We Sort Through the Mess':::::An Alabama state senator and chairman of the Republican party in Roy Moore's home county on Monday said the four women who have accused the former judge of sexual misconduct "deserve the full measure of credibility," AL.com reported.State Sen. Phil Williams, chairman of the GOP in Etowah County, also said the whole situation "is the worst of humanity on display.""God help us as we sort through the mess," Williams told AL.com.Williams' comments come on the same day that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Moore "should step aside" as the Republican candidate to replace Attorney General Jeff Sessions in next month's special election.McConnell's statement Monday was stronger than last week's "if the allegations are true" mantra that he and other Capitol Hill Republicans issued last week.Worse for Moore, another woman is poised to levy allegations against him later Monday in a press conference arranged by famed attorney Gloria Allred.Williams wouldn't say whether he believes the accusers or Moore, saying that the women need to be heard, but that it's unfortunate that Moore can't defend himself, given that the statute of limitations has passed.The accusers "deserve the full measure of credibility that any victim should be given in cases such as these," AL.com quoted Williams.
Roy Moore: McConnell's the One Who Should Step Down:::::Alabama Republican Roy Moore says it's Mitch McConnell who should quit, not him.Moore is responding to McConnell, the Senate majority leader, who says he believes Moore's accusers and thinks he should drop out of the race for Senate.At issue is a Washington Post story saying Moore had sexual contact with a 14-year-old girl and pursued romantic relationships with other teenage girls decades ago.Moore says on Twitter: "The person who should step aside is @SenateMajLdr Mitch McConnell.He has failed conservatives and must be replaced.#DrainTheSwamp."The person who should step aside is @SenateMajLdr Mitch McConnell.He has failed conservatives and must be replaced.#DrainTheSwamp Judge Roy Moore (@MooreSenate) November 13, 2017 The election is Dec. 12 and Moore's name remains on the Alabama ballot.Moore's "drain the swamp" hashtag is popular with President Donald Trump and his supporters.
Biden: Blue Collar Rust Belt Voters 'Love Me More' Than Trump:::::Former Vice President Joe Biden defended his potential presidential bid Monday, saying he has more support among blue collar workers in the Rust Belt than President Donald Trump."Youre going to be 77 in 2020," "Today" host Megyn Kelly said to Biden in an interview Monday morning.You wouldnt have any new ideas.Youve already run twice and lost.Youd have to promise that it would be one term only.And the blue collar Rust Belt-ers who youd need to get elected already love Donald Trump.Biden paused for a moment, then said, They love me more.This was met with cheers from the studio audience before he continued."I understand the Rust Belt," Biden said."Donald Trump has no notion what those people going through.If you take a look its not a criticism, its an observation because look, but for 77,000 votes now, this would be a different race.Come on, lets take a look at this."He added, "They call me 'Middle Class Joe.'Well, its not meant as a compliment in Washington.It means Im not sophisticated.But I understand.I understand what built this country.And the only thing I know is the middle class, their hopes, their aspirations.Because its where I come from.Its what I am."
Roy Moore almost certainly isn't going to be a senator:::::(CNN) If you thought Roy Moore's political future couldn't get any more bleak after four women went on the record with The Washington Post alleging that the Alabama Republican Senate nominee sought relationships with them when they were between 14 and 18, today showed things could get worse for Moore.Much, much worse.In an appearance Monday afternoon with celebrity attorney Gloria Allred by her side, a woman named Beverly Young Nelson accused Moore of sexually assaulting her when she was a teenager."Mr. Moore attacked me when I was a child," Nelson said, recounting that Moore was a regular customer at a restaurant where she worked as a waitress when she was 15 and 16.She described a harrowing chain of events that ended with Moore attempting to force her into a sex act in a parked car -- an episode that, she said, left her with severe bruising on her neck.Perhaps the most devastating moment of the press conference, however, was when Nelson produced her 1977 high school yearbook that including this inscription : "To a sweeter more beautiful girl I could not say 'Merry Christmas' Christmas 1977 Roy Moore, D.A.12-22-77 Olde Hickory" Through a spokesman, Moore dismissed the allegation."Gloria Allred is a sensationalist leading a witch hunt, and she is only around to create a spectacle," Moore campaign chairman Bill Armistead said.But it's hard to dismiss the damage done here.What Nelson is alleging is sexual assault, not sexual misconduct.One of the four women in the Post story was 14 at the time she encountered Moore, which is below the official age of consent -- 16 -- in Alabama.The others were between 16 and 18 and said the encounters were consensual.Moore was in his early 30s at the time.Moore's defense to this point has been that the women quoted in the Post story were somehow cajoled into lying about their encounters with him -- fake news and all that.That defense completely overlooked the fact that all four women allowed the Post to print their names.None of the four women knew one another.None of them reached out to the Post in hopes of having their story told.The Post spoke to more than two dozen witnesses who knew Moore between 1977 and 1982 -- when these instances allegedly took place -- and corroborated the facts as the women relayed them.Now, Nelson adds her name to that list.Like Leigh Corfman, who alleged that Moore touched her -- and urged her to touch him -- when she was 14, Nelson said she voted for Donald Trump in the 2016 election.Which makes it difficult to cast this as some sort of politically motivated gambit.To believe Moore's denials at this point, you must also believe that: 1.All five of these women, who say they have never met one another, are not only all lying but doing so in a coordinated manner with remarkably similar stories of Moore's pursuit of them.2.The dozens of corroborating witnesses that the Post spoke to are also part of a broad -- and very well-organized -- conspiracy to keep Moore from the Senate.3.Nelson forged -- or had someone forge -- an inscription on her 1977 high school yearbook from Moore, OR Moore signing a teenage girl's high school yearbook -- and noting she was "beautiful" -- was entirely innocuous.Are there people in Alabama -- and nationally -- that believe all of those things?Sure.But it appears that Republican Senate leaders are not among them.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told reporters in Kentucky Monday morning that the time had come for Moore to "step aside."Then, even as Nelson's press conference was wrapping up, Colorado Sen. Cory Gardner, who heads the party's campaign committee, released a statement calling on Moore to be expelled from the Senate if he manages to win the special election on December 12."If (Moore) refuses to withdraw and wins, the Senate should vote to expel him, because he does not meet the ethical and moral requirements of the United States Senate," Gardner said.President Trump, who continues to travel in Asia, has not said much of anything on Moore's situation -- insisting that he has been too busy to focus on the allegations.But Trump returns to Washington on Wednesday and may be pressured to say something even sooner than that by way of clarifying where his White House comes down on Moore Regardless of what Trump says, however, it's hard to see how Moore ever actually holds a Senate seat.Gardner's pledge to vote to expel him if he wins means that such a motion would almost certainly pass.What senator -- Democrat or Republican -- could or would vote against expelling Moore at this point?If past is prologue, Moore will continue in the race -- arguing that this is all just one big conspiracy by, well, everyone, to get him.But, it seems clear now that no matter what Moore does, his chances of becoming a senator are increasingly minuscule.

Trump wants GOP to repeal individual mandate as part of their tax effort:::::Story highlights President Donald Trump has repeatedly called to repeal the individual mandate Republicans in Congress fear Trump weighing in on tax policy late in the game (CNN) President Donald Trump wants to see Republicans repeal the Obamacare individual mandate as part of their tax bill, Trump tweeted Monday morning from his trip to Asia."I am proud of the Rep. House & Senate for working so hard on cutting taxes {& reform.}We're getting close!Now, how about ending the unfair & highly unpopular Indiv Mandate in OCare & reducing taxes even further?Cut top rate to 35 % w/all of the rest going to middle income cuts?"Trump tweeted The news comes as Senate Republicans begin their markup of their plan Monday afternoon and House Republicans plan to bring their bill to the floor for a vote later this week.Neither the House nor Senate bill repeals the individual mandate despite the fact some conservatives on Capitol Hill, such as Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas, have been pushing for it.The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated last week that repealing the individual mandate would save Republicans $338 billion over the next 10 years and would give them additional revenue to cut taxes.However, many Republicans worry that interjecting health care into the tax reform debate could imperil their tax effort.This is not the first time Trump has suggested Republicans repeal the individual mandate in their tax bill, but Trump's tweet Monday is yet another example of the President interjecting policy late in the game.Many Republicans have feared that they could write a tax bill only to have their effort shadowed by late-game commentary by Trump.
GOP tax plan state of play: Senate markup day begins:::::(CNN) In the House, a harried behind-the-scenes effort to lock up the votes to pass their tax proposal on the floor.In the Senate, a harried public effort to hammer through potentially hundreds of amendments to approve their tax proposal in committee.Should GOP leaders accomplish their goals in both chambers over the next five days, this could be called the most successful legislative week in President Donald Trump's tenure.Should either of these efforts go off the rails, well, time to prep the talk of a possible health care 2.0.The mood in the House: According to several senior GOP aides and rank-and-file lawmakers CNN spoke with on Sunday, House Republicans are entering this week in a good place.Rounds of early check-ins with conference members throughout the weekend yielded positive results, two sources said."We figured we'd head into this week needing some help to get this across the line," one aide told CNN."As of now, it looks like we might not.But four days is a long time."When is the vote: As of now, leaders plan to put this bill on the floor Thursday.That is subject to change.Whom to watch: California Republican House members Leaders know anywhere between five and seven New York lawmakers are "no" or "leaning no."A handful of New Jersey lawmakers are right there with them.The issue isn't new -- the partial repeal of the state and local tax deduction, which disproportionately hits their high-tax states.But leaders can survive losses in those two states.It's the California delegation everyone needs to keep their eyes on this week.They stuck with Republicans, largely out of loyalty to majority leader (and fellow Californian) Kevin McCarthy.But several GOP districts in California -- represented by some of the most endangered GOP lawmakers in the conference -- come from districts that would also be hit hard by this repeal.Publicly, besides Rep. Darrell Issa, who is already a "no," the state delegation has largely held its fire.If they can be held in the "yes" column, the bill should have a clear path.If those lawmakers (think people like Reps. Ed Royce or Mimi Walters) bail, then Republicans have a real problem.The payoff: Rep. Tom MacArthur, a New Jersey Republican, voiced significant concerns about early iterations of the bill, yet suddenly came around early last week on the grounds that the repeal of the alternative minimum tax meant the SALT repeal wouldn't harm his district as much as he first suspected.That made him a "yes."And voila, Ivanka Trump and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin will be in his district Monday morning for a tax event.And yet: As of this moment, based on the regular check-ins from the GOP whip team, leaders feel like they are still doing well with their California members.The behind-the-scenes sell has been intensive -- district-by-district polling from the White House political operation and the Republican National Committee has been provided to lawmakers.They have been given economic analysis for each of their districts showing that, on net, their constituents will benefit overall in the near-term.The key is, and has always been, the ability to convince rank-and-file members that the plan in its entirety is more valuable than any one coveted provision.This week will finally show whether the positive response leaders have gotten thus far can hold, or whether those coveted provisions -- and the interests and political pressures behind them -- can finally take hold and cause problems.If things start to go south: House GOP leaders are ready.They've deliberately left open the possibility that House Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady would introduce substantive changes to the bill when it reaches the Rules Committee on Wednesday.At this point, it appears they may not be necessary.But if that changes, the door is open to address individual concerns/buy off those on the sidelines.How this will work: The GOP whip team has been doing constant checks on the rank and file in recent days, but tonight will be the first "hard whip" effort when lawmakers return to Washington.This will be a very important moment -- they'll find they are either on a good path or have work to do.And that will dictate the next few days.The dirty secret: House GOP lawmakers aren't displeased the President has been out of the country for this whole process .His team has been very engaged -- from providing polling data and economic analysis to answering question and receiving concerns, they've been there through it all.But several aides have noted the President's absence, along with generally not playing public role in selling the bill, as a net positive at the moment."Our guys can breathe a bit," was how one aide put it.The same aide noted that when it comes down to it, they'll need the President to sell the bill to the public.But for the moment?"Why mess with something that's working?"Across the Capitol: The Senate finance committee will begin the markup of the chamber's GOP proposal this afternoon.What kind of an experience will that be?Well, here are the 355 amendments that have been filed for consideration How the Senate bill was received: There's no question changes will be made -- Senate finance GOP staff acknowledge the bill, as it currently stands, violates the Byrd Rule when it comes to adding to the deficit outside of the first decade.That, of course, would mean Republicans couldn't pass the bill in the Senate with a simple majority.Staff pledged that would be fixed during the committee process.Along those lines, Sen. Ted Cruz has voiced concern about the full repeal of the SALT deduction, along with concerns that while the bill reduces taxes, on average, in every income group, millions would still see their taxes go up.Sens.Marco Rubio and Mike Lee want the Child Tax Credit, boosted to $1,650 and eligibility expanded in the Senate proposal, boosted to closer to $2,000.Sens.Jeff Flake and Bob Corker still have concerns about the bill's affect on the deficit.BUT: there is no outright opposition.No Republican is pledging to oppose the measure out of the gate.No party factions are holding out on specific items that would make the bill a non-starter for others.Does this have a clear path forward?Hardly.Senior GOP aides expect problems to arise and believe several members are just holding their fire for the moment.But man, oh man, is this a different experience for GOP leaders than health care.What to watch in the Senate finance committee: Keep an eye on any amendments offered by Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch of Utah.His amendments, like Brady's in the House, will be the most substantive and designed explicitly to iron out Byrd Rule problems, along with the political and policy problems in their conference.As for the Democrats As in the House, the amendment list posted by Senate finance appears to make clear that Senate Democrats will be offering amendments mainly to make Republicans take difficult votes.Everyone is still keeping a close eye on politically vulnerable 2018 Democrats like Joe Donnelly, Heidi Heitkamp and Joe Manchin to see if they show any willingness to get on board with the GOP plan.Republican leaders aren't counting on that, but if any or all of those lawmakers open the door to changes that could get them on board, aides make clear Republicans will jump at the chance.A bipartisan bill, no matter by how slim a margin, certainly is a better sell than a partisan version.Also, keep an eye on this: As CNN has reported several times, GOP leaders want no part of adding in a repeal of Obamacare's individual mandate into this process.They are still bleeding from the brutal health care failure and are terrified that adding in something that the Congressional Budget Office says would lead to millions fewer having health insurance.But as the Senate deals with Byrd Rule issues, and as the House continues to look for ways to plus-up provisions targeted at easing the tax burden on various middle-class income groups that analyses show will see tax increases in the latter part of the decade, the $338 billion in deficit savings a repeal would create over 10 years is very attractive.Of note: The very influential Wall Street Journal editorial board got behind the idea this weekend.And bookmark this, too: One area that could create major problems in the House is, well, the Senate.That's precisely why you saw House Speaker Paul Ryan explicitly commit to the bill going to conference late last week.And that's why you saw Brady explicitly say that the House wouldn't accept anything less than the SALT compromise (keep the property tax deduction, capped at $10,000) they worked out with their members.Nothing will create bigger problems, faster, than word going around that the House is going to be forced to eat whatever the Senate ends up with.House leaders are going above and beyond to say that won't happen.(Sidenote: they said the same thing on the budget.The House ended up eating the Senate version.)And finally, are Republicans on track to meet their deadline?Yes.The House has always been scheduled to pass their bill this week, the Senate the week after Thanksgiving.Then conference.At this moment, they are still on that schedule.Yes, things could change quickly.
Hill Republican dilemma: Dash to pass tax reform or face donor backlash:::::Story highlights House Republicans this week are expected to vote on their tax bill Business groups say they largely support GOP tax overhaul efforts (CNN) Republicans aren't hiding a key part of their motivation to pass tax reform in the weeks ahead: if they don't do something -- anything-- the donor class could abandon them and imperil their chances of keeping the majority in 2018 In a candid moment last week, Rep. Chris Collins conveyed out loud what many members have been thinking for months."My donors are basically saying, 'Get it done or don't ever call me again,'" the New York Republican told The Hill Republicans have pursued their tax agenda with breakneck speed in recent weeks all in the name of delivering a tax cut to the American people before the New Year, but politics is the major and motivating factor for a party struggling to overcome the perception that it has done little since their stunning election victory last November.This week, House Republicans are expected to vote on their tax bill despite some frustration among northeast Republicans that the bill could hurt their constituents.And senators are beginning to mark up their bill in the finance committee.Whether or not Republicans will ultimately be able to overcome divisions and pass a bill still remains to be seen, but there is no arguing that the party isn't motivated.
Trump asked Xi to look at cases of UCLA basketball players:::::Manila, Philippines (CNN) US President Donald Trump personally asked Chinese President Xi Jinping to help in the case of three American college basketball players accused of shoplifting last week.The three UCLA freshmen -- LiAngelo Ball, Cody Riley and Jalen Hill -- were arrested last week while their team was in Hangzhou ahead of the team's season opener in Shanghai and while Trump was on a state visit in the capital, Beijing.Trump's request was first reported by the Washington Post.Ball -- who is the younger brother of Lakers rookie Lonzo Ball -- Riley and Hill were forced to stay in their hotel and miss the game.They did not travel home with the team and are still confined to the hotel as the legal process plays outs.Ball's father, LaVar, said in a statement on social media that the process could take months.
Rand Paul returns to Senate after injuries:::::Story highlights Sen. Rand Paul suffered six broken ribs after an alleged attack His neighbor pleaded not guilty to misdemeanor assault charges Washington (CNN) Sen. Rand Paul returned to the Senate on Monday after being seriously injured at his home in an alleged attack by his neighbor earlier this month.There was "no justification" for his being attacked 10 days ago while doing yard work at his home in Kentucky, Paul told the Washington Examiner in his first interview since the incident.The report said the senator was struggling to breathe and often stopped to catch his breath and talk.Paul also said he knew of no motive that would have sparked his neighbor to hit him from behind."From my perspective, I'm not really too concerned about what someone's motive is.I'm just concerned that I was attacked from the back and somebody broke six of my ribs and gave me a damaged lung where at least for now I have trouble speaking and breathing and now I've hurt for 10 days," Paul said.Paul returned to the Senate Monday afternoon as Republicans began marking up their tax plan in the finance committee.
Human rights groups call on Tillerson to address Yemen crisis:::::Washingtonn (CNN) A group of 19 humanitarian and human rights nongovernmental organizations are calling on US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to use all diplomatic means at his disposal to end the blockade of aid to Yemen, warning that the war-torn nation faces a rapidly deteriorating situation that "puts millions of civilian lives at risk."In a letter sent Monday to Tillerson, US Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley, National Security Adviser H.R.McMaster and Defense Secretary James Mattis, the coalition of NGOs highlighted the increasingly dire humanitarian crisis in Yemen stemming from "almost 1,000 days of war."It calls on the US and the international community to work toward achieving several specific objectives aimed at addressing the situation in Yemen: Condemn all attacks on civilians by all parties, demand an urgent ceasefire by all parties to the conflict, and generate genuine commitments by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to respect international humanitarian law and end deliberate or indiscriminate attacks on civilians; Set forth a plan to reinvigorate peace talks and end unlawful attacks on civilians, through a realistic and concrete roadmap to peace."The United States bears a special responsibility to use all diplomatic means to end ongoing violations against civilians in Yemen and the recent blockade of the country, to obtain concrete commitments by all sides for unfettered humanitarian access, and to secure a ceasefire and resumption of the peace process," the letter said."The breakdown in Yemen of respect for international law and the rapidly worsening humanitarian situation puts millions of civilian lives at risk, and threatens not only regional stability but also international peace and security more broadly," it added.Saudi Arabia tightened its blockade on Yemen after Houthi rebels, who have taken over the national government and its assets, fired a ballistic missile last week toward an airport in Riyadh.The Saudis were able to intercept the projectile, but the event has rattled the region politically.The UN's humanitarian chief, Mark Lowcock, warned last week that Yemen is facing the world's worst famine in decades in which millions could die, if Saudi Arabia continues to block aid flowing into the country.Riyadh has prevented aid agencies from landing planes in the country and docking at Yemen's ports, worsening an already dire humanitarian situation, according to Lowcock.And while Saudi Arabia has said it would take into consideration "the continuation of the entry and exit of humanitarian supplies and crews," Lowcock said that UN planes have not been able to land in the country, and that he believed no other humanitarian agency had been able to gain access.Yemen is also facing one of the world's worst cholera outbreaks in modern history.The World Health Organization says there have been more than 900,000 suspected cases of cholera in Yemen since late April, many of them children, and that there are expected to be 1 million cases before the end of the year.More than 2,000 people have died so far in the cholera outbreak alone.JUST WATCHED Battling cholera inside Yemen's ruined hospitals Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Battling cholera inside Yemen's ruined hospitals 01:42 Monday's letter to top US officials echoed Lowcock's concerns."The recent decision by the Saudi Arabia- and United Arab Emirates-led coalition to temporarily close all of Yemen's land, sea, and air entry points is deeply worrying, coming as it does on top of this already-dire humanitarian situation," the letter said."This blockade already has grounded UN flights, prevented humanitarian workers from flying in and out of the country, and barred ships already in port from off-loading lifesaving food, fuel, and medical supplies bound for afflicted civilians, including children."State Department spokesperson Heather Nauert told reporters last week that the US is closely monitoring the humanitarian crisis in Yemen and is concerned that the recent blockade will only add to the suffering of the Yemeni people.But while Nauert said that the US supports "unimpeded access for commercial and humanitarian goods" into Yemen," she did not explicitly state support for the UN's call for the Saudis to immediately open borders, airspace and ports used to bring that aid into the country.The State Department did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment on Monday's letter.
9th Circuit green-lights some Trump administration travel ban restrictions:::::Washington (CNN) A federal appeals court handed the Trump administration a partial victory Monday, granting its emergency request to allow parts of its latest travel ban to go into effect while the appeal is pending.A three-judge panel -- all appointed by former President Bill Clinton -- on the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals decided Monday to keep the lower court's order in place, freezing the ban, for foreign nationals who have a "close familial relationship" with a person in the United States, but granted the Trump administration's request to allow it to go into effect for everyone else.The 9th Circuit panel is set to hear oral arguments on the case on December 6.President Donald Trump signed an executive order in January banning foreign nationals from specific Muslim-majority countries from traveling to the United States, but the restrictions have been tied up in the legal system and have since been revised multiple times.In October , a federal judge in Hawaii blocked the third iteration of the travel ban one day before it was scheduled to take effect.Read More
Roy Moore would be first senator expelled in 155 years:::::(CNN) On Monday afternoon, Colorado Sen. Cory Gardner said the Senate should vote to expel Roy Moore in the increasingly-unlikely event the Alabama Republican nominee wins a special election on December 12."If (Moore) refuses to withdraw and wins, the Senate should vote to expel him, because he does not meet the ethical and moral requirements of the United States Senate," Gardner, who runs the GOP Senate campaign arm, said in a statement.That process could begin the moment Moore was officially seated in the Senate following his victory.(The Senate has no ability to block a senator being seated.)Moore would be expelled if two-thirds of the senators present voted for him to be removed.If that came to pass, Moore would become just the 16th senator ever expelled from the chamber, according to the Senate's historical records.Fourteen of the 16 were expelled for supporting the Confederate cause during the Civil War.Tennessee Republican Sen. William Blount was expelled in 1797 after he was outed as the ringleader of a plot to attack Spanish-controlled Florida and Louisiana .The last Senator to be formally expelled from the Senate was Indiana Democratic Sen. Jesse Bright in 1862.Another 15 Senators have been considered for expulsion but either resigned, saw their Senate terms expire before any action was taken or survived the two-thirds majority requirement vote.Read More
US military launches series of strikes in Yemen and Somalia:::::(CNN) The US military conducted a series of airstrikes targeting terrorists in Somalia and Yemen over the weekend, according to multiple military officials.The US military conducted three strikes against ISIS in Yemen on Friday, Saturday and Sunday, killing five suspected militants, US Central Command spokesman Maj. Josh Jacques told CNN Monday.Jacques said all three strikes took place in Yemen's Al Bayda Governorate, an area known for ISIS and al Qaeda activity.A US military official told CNN that the strikes were carried out by unmanned drone aircraft and that the military is still assessing the results of the strikes.The series of strikes over the weekend are only the third time the US has struck the ISIS affiliate in Yemen.Read More
Woman accuses Moore of sexually assaulting her at 16:::::Washington (CNN) An Alabama woman alleges Alabama Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore sexually assaulted her when she was a teenager, her attorney Gloria Allred said Monday.Allred said her client, Beverly Young Nelson, would be willing to testify under oath and called on the Senate judiciary committee to hold a hearing and subpoena Moore."Mr. Moore attacked me when I was a child," Nelson said, adding that she was 15 when he began flirting with her and 16 at the time of the alleged assault."I want Mr. Moore to know that he no longer has any power over me."The allegations of force, if true, would be considered sexual abuse in the first degree, but the statute of limitations in effect at the time would have passed.Later Monday, Moore called the allegation "absolutely false."Nelson detailed her allegations in a statement alongside Allred, an attorney who focuses on discrimination and women's rights.Nelson said Moore was a regular at the Olde Hickory House, a restaurant she worked at when she was starting high school.At the press conference with Allred, Nelson said Moore wrote an inscription in her yearbook one day in December 1977 that said, "To a sweeter more beautiful girl, I could not say, 'Merry Christmas.'"She said he signed it "Roy Moore, D.A."She said that one evening he offered her a ride home.Instead of taking her home, Nelson said Moore pulled his car behind the restaurant and began to attack her."Mr. Moore reached over and began groping me and putting his hands on my breasts," Nelson said.She said she tried to open the car door to leave, but Moore locked it and continued to grab her."He began squeezing my neck, attempting to force my head onto his crotch.I continued to struggle," Nelson said."I thought that he was going to rape me."She said she began to cry and beg him to stop and that eventually he did relent before telling her not to speak."At some point he gave up, and he then looked at me," Nelson said."He said, 'You're just a child,' and he said, 'I am the district attorney of Etowah County and if you tell anyone about this, no one will ever believe you.'"Moore called the accusation "absolutely false" in a statement outside a fire station in Gallant, Alabama later Monday, denying that he knew Nelson and adding that he didn't know where the restaurant that she described was."I don't even know the woman," he said.His wife, Kayla Moore, spoke as well, calling this "the ugliest politics" she had seen.As reporters gathered to hear the accusations at Allred's press event, the Moore campaign released a statement denying Moore had "any sexual misconduct with anyone.""Gloria Allred is a sensationalist leading a witch hunt, and she is only around to create a spectacle," Moore campaign chairman Bill Armistead said."Allred was the attorney who claims credit for giving us Roe v. Wade, which has resulted in the murder of tens of millions of unborn babies.We've said this before and we'll say it again: Judge Moore is an innocent man and has never had any sexual misconduct with anyone.This is a witch hunt against a man who has had an impeccable career for over 30 years and has always been known as a man of high character."The accusations on Monday came after The Washington Post published a bombshell report last week based on interviews with more than 30 people, saying Moore pursued relationships with teenage women while he was in his 30s.One woman said she was 14 years old when Moore initiated sexual contact with her.Nelson said she was inspired to speak out because of the women that came forward to the Post."I would probably have taken what Mr. Moore did to me to my grave had it not been for the courage of four other women that were willing to speak out about their experiences with Mr. Moore," Nelson said.Allred said her client declined to take questions but would be willing to speak in public further should the Senate Judiciary Committee decline to hold a hearing on the matter in the next two weeks.The Alabama Senate special election is currently scheduled for December 12.
Bush 41 facing allegations he groped 16-year-old in 2003:::::In an interview with Time magazine published Monday, Roslyn Corrigan said she was 16 years old when Bush, then 79, touched her inappropriately at a November 2003 event in The Woodlands, Texas, office of the CIA, where her father had gathered with fellow intelligence officers and family members to meet Bush.Corrigan told the magazine Bush groped her buttocks as she and her mother, Sari Young, posed for a photograph with the former president."As soon as the picture was being snapped, on the one-two-three he dropped his hands from my waist down to my buttocks and gave it a nice, ripe squeeze, which would account for the fact that in the photograph my mouth is hanging wide open," Corrigan told Time, her first public interview about the incident."I was like, 'Oh my goodness, what just happened?'""My initial reaction was absolute horror.I was really, really confused," Corrigan said."The first thing I did was look at my mom and, while he was still standing there, I didn't say anything.What does a teenager say to the ex-president of the United States?Like, 'Hey dude, you shouldn't have touched me like that?'"CNN has not independently confirmed Corrigan's account.Neither Corrigan nor her attorney, Gloria Allred, would comment on the matter to CNN Monday.Corrigan's account is similar to those shared by at least three other women who say they were touched inappropriately during photo ops with the former president.The magazine spoke with seven people, including Corrigan's family members and friends, who confirmed that they had been told of the alleged groping incident prior to the other recent allegations.Jim McGrath, a spokesman for Bush, issued an apology on the former president's behalf in the wake of this latest allegation."George Bush simply does not have it in his heart to knowingly cause anyone distress, and he again apologizes to anyone he offended during a photo op," McGrath told CNN.In statement released last month in response to the previous allegations, McGrath noted the president's advanced age and his physical limitations."At age 93, President Bush has been confined to a wheelchair for roughly five years, so his arm falls on the lower waist of people with whom he takes pictures," he wrote."To try to put people at ease, the president routinely tells the same joke -- and on occasion, he has patted women's rears in what he intended to be a good-natured manner.Some have seen it as innocent; others clearly view it as inappropriate.To anyone he has offended, President Bush apologizes most sincerely."In an interview with CNN in October, actress Jordana Grolnick, one of the woman who says Bush groped her, described a 2016 incident in which she said she was groped by Bush."He came backstage to take a picture with a group of girls and he was in a wheelchair and he reached his hand around and said to the group ... 'Do you know who my favorite magician is?'And we all said, 'No, who,' and he said 'David Cop-a-Feel' and at that moment, I felt him grab my behind," she said.McGrath confirmed to CNN in October that he was referring to the David "Cop-a-Feel" joke mentioned by three of the women who have made allegations against the former president when he wrote last month's statement.Corrigan did not mention the joke in the Time piece.Actress Heather Lind, who appeared in the AMC's series 'Turn: Washington's Spies," wrote that Bush touched her inappropriately a few years ago as they were posing posting for a photograph and while she did not get into the specifics of the incident, she referred to the incident as a sexual assault."He didn't shake my hand.He touched me from behind his wheelchair with his wife, Barbara Bush, by his side and told me a dirty joke.And then, all the while being photographed, touched me again," Lind wrote in a now-deleted post on Instagram.A third woman who wished to remain anonymous told CNN she met Bush at a VIP event in Houston in 2015.She said he squeezed her buttocks "a couple times.It was unmistakable.It was not just a pat.It was a serious squeeze."Reactions to the revelations about Bush 41 have been mixed, with some coming to the former president's defense and attributing his actions to his age and physical illness -- Bush has been confined to a wheelchair for the past several years and suffers from a form of Parkinson's disease.In the photo taken with Corrigan, he was not in a wheelchair and is clearly shown standing.The incidents have also raised questions about the role of his family in preventing such contacts from occurring.In October -- before Corrigan's account was made public -- CNN spoke with neuroscience and brain imaging expert Doctor Daniel Amen, who does not treat Bush, to ask about how the former president's condition might affect his behavior.Amen said illnesses like his can lead to unusual behavior."It can also affect the front part of your brain -- things like judgment, forethought, impulse control and people who have never acted badly or inappropriately their whole life, all of the sudden they start to do things that are out of character," Amen said.He added that it is noteworthy that the incidents allegedly happened late in his life.However, Grolnick said she doesn't think that excuses Bush's behavior."No, I don't think that excuses it, and I don't think that explains it," she said."I think in order for us to have progress and for women to reach the true equality we deserve to have, we need to stop making excuses and letting that be OK."
Head of Senate campaign committee says Moore should be expelled if he wins:::::(CNN) Sen. Cory Gardner, the chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, said Monday that if Alabama Republican Senate nominee Roy Moore "refuses to withdraw and wins, the Senate should vote to expel him."Gardner said in a statement, "he does not meet the ethical and moral requirements of the United States Senate."There have only been 15 expulsions in US Senate history.Earlier Monday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told reporters that Moore should step aside.Later McConnell was asked as he left the US Senate floor, if Moore should be expelled if he is elected."I said this morning all I'm going to say today," McConnell responded."And others are speaking for themselves and you all are reporting it."Read More
Congress week ahead: Key House vote on tax reform:::::(CNN) The House of Representatives is expected to vote this week on a major tax reform bill, a top GOP policy goal that lawmakers say is a must-pass after they failed to repeal and replace Obamacare and are now a year ahead of the 2018 midterms with little to show for total control of Congress.Republican leaders in both Congress and the administration argue that middle class workers will all see tax relief, but Democrats argue the proposal is too tilted toward wealthy Americans.Congress hasn't been able to move any significant changes to the tax code in more than 30 years.Adding to the issues Republicans on Capitol Hill have to address: Fallout from the bombshell story in The Washington Post last week that Alabama GOP Senate nominee Roy Moore pursued sexual relationships with teenage girls when he was in his early 30s.Many Republican lawmakers were quick to say he should drop out of the special election if the allegations are true.But Moore has consistently blasted the coverage as attacks from the "liberal media" and shows no signs of leaving the race.Expect GOP members in both chambers to continue to be pressed to answer what, if anything, they'll to do in response.The House and Senate are both working on tax reform The House GOP bill overhauling the tax system scales back the number of tax brackets, cuts the corporate tax rate to 20%, aims to simplify the code and eliminate many tax breaks.As of the end of last week, Republican leaders don't yet have the votes to pass the legislation.Several Northeast Republicans say they still have major concerns with the bill , which repeals a popular deduction for state and local income and sales tax as well as caps property tax deductions at $10,000.This group and potential other holdouts may be able to secure even more changes to the bill, but any tweaks alter a complicated calculus because leaders need to keep the price tag at no more than $1.5 trillion in order to use special rules to avoid a Democratic filibuster in the Senate.More changes can be added when the House rules committee meets Wednesday and sets the parameters for the debate on the floor at the end of the week.But by and large, Republicans in the House have been able to portray a united front so far, with several high-profile conservatives coming out to support the bill.Members of the typically hard-to-please House Freedom Caucus have expressed support for the bill.Even Rep. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky conservative who voted against House Speaker Paul Ryan's reelection to the leadership post earlier this year, told CNN he was a "yes."The key question now is if the goodwill will hold, as Republicans from many suburban districts are faced with a floor vote on a measure that some worry could end up being a political liability in the 2018 midterm elections.In the Senate, Republicans will begin marking up their tax plan in the finance committee, a process that is expected to take several days.But obstacles -- especially those that come with arcane Senate rules -- abound.While the Senate bill met its target of costing no more than $1.5 trillion in the 10-year window, initial estimates found the bill would add to the deficit outside the 10-year window.That isn't allowed under Senate rules if the GOP wants to pass the bill with a simple majority.Leadership aides acknowledged that the Senate plan would still need to undergo some changes in upcoming days in order to pass the muster of the Senate parliamentarian.Bob Menendez A verdict could come down in the corruption trial of New Jersey Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez.In a bizarre twist, one juror deliberating on the case was released by the judge last week and publicly revealed that she was planning to find the senator was innocent of charges of bribery.The judge replaced the juror , who had a long-planned vacation, and directed an alternate and the rest of the jury to essentially start over in deciding Menendez' fate.It's unclear how the unusual public peek inside the jury will play out.But this ex-member, who participated in the nine-week trial, predicted there were others who didn't believe the government proved Menendez did anything illegal and the trial would end in a "hung jury."If the senator is found guilty, it will put pressure on Democrats to call for him to step down.But with a slim margin of control of the chamber, a major tax vote, and other year-end measures coming up, he could stay and maintain that he could keep his seat during an appeals process.Russia Attorney General Jeff Sessions will testify before the House judiciary committee Tuesday and is likely to face tough questioning about his testimony on his interactions with Russian officials during his tenure as a surrogate for the Trump campaign.Several Democratic senators maintain that Sessions was not entirely forthcoming about his communications, and his omission about one meeting at his confirmation hearing caused him to recuse himself from the ongoing investigation into Russia's meddling in the 2016 election.Rinat Akhmetshin, the Russian-American lobbyist who was one of the eight people at the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer, appears before the House intelligence committee on Monday.The committee earlier this month interviewed Ike Kaveladze, another Trump Tower meeting attendee.The House intelligence committee on Tuesday is interviewing Fusion GPS co-founder Glenn Simpson .The committee had previously issued a subpoena to Simpson and his partners for testimony, but Simpson and the panel struck an agreement last week for him to testify voluntarily.The two sides are still battling in court over Fusion GPS's bank records.National security Senate foreign relations committee Chairman Bob Corker, a strong critic of President Donald Trump, holds a hearing next Tuesday on the use of nuclear weapons at a time when the Trump administration is dealing with a major confrontation with North Korea.The House will vote next week on an annual defense authorization bill.The bill, finalized by House and Senate negotiators last week, would authorize defense spending that exceeds federally mandated budget caps.But the legislation does not create a new "space corps" initially proposed in the House version of the bill, an idea opposed by key senators and the Pentagon.
Donald Trump's admin taking steps on seizing border land, report says:::::Story highlights Roughly two-thirds of the Southern border runs through private or state-owned lands The staff notes that DHS has not answered questions about how much eminent domain it will require Washington (CNN) Although approval for a new border wall has yet to come, the Trump administration has taken subtle steps to be able to seize land to build one, including by restarting litigation that has laid dormant for years against landowners, according to a new report from Senate Democrats.Roughly two-thirds of the US-Mexico border runs through private or state-owned lands, meaning the federal government would need to purchase, seize or seek permission to use land in order to build a border wall.Based on efforts a decade ago to build border fencing, that process is likely to cost the government millions and could take years of complex litigation.And it appears the administration is gearing up for it.Democrats on the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee produced a report on eminent domain and a border wall on Monday, citing the administration's lack of clarity about what would be required to build President Donald Trump's proposed wall.The committee points to signs that the administration is preparing for a fresh round such fights, as Congress continues to debate whether to give the Department of Homeland Security any money to build new barriers on the Southern border.Read More
Moore threatens to sue Washington Post over report:::::(CNN) Alabama Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore says he will sue the Washington Post over its report alleging he pursued sexual relationships with teenagers -- including a 14-year-old -- when he was in his 30s."The Washington Post published another attack on my character and reputation because they are desperate to stop my political campaign.These attacks said I was with a minor child and are false and untrue -- and for which they will be sued," Moore said Sunday night during a campaign speech in Huntsville, Alabama.The Washington Post declined to comment Monday morning.It's not uncommon for public figures to threaten legal action against news organizations but ultimately fail to follow through.President Donald Trump threatened to sue The New York Times last year after it published the accounts of two women who claimed Trump touched them inappropriately.His lawyers never filed a lawsuit.More recently, disgraced Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein initially threatened to sue the Times after it first reported allegations of sexual misconduct against him, but that suit never materialized The Washington Post report Thursday was based on interviews with more than 30 people.As well as the allegations that Moore had sexual contact with the then 14-year-old when he was aged 32, three other women also told The Post that Moore pursued them when they were between the ages of 16 and 18.The woman who was 14 years old at the time claimed he took her to his house, undressed down to his underwear and undressed her down to her bra and underwear and touched her and moved her hand to touch his underwear, which could have been sexual offenses due to her age, but the statutes of limitations in effect during that time have passed.None of the other three women told the Post that Moore sexually harassed, or assaulted them, or forced them into a relationship.Alabama's legal age of consent is 16.Moore has denied the allegations since they were published.He called the claims " completely false " Friday when appearing on Sean Hannity's syndicated radio show.Speaking at a Veterans Day event at the Mid-Alabama Republican Club in Birmingham Saturday, Moore called the allegations "fake news" and "yet another attack on my character and reputation in a desperate attempt to stop my political campaign for the United States Senate."He added that the alleged incidents happened nearly 40 years ago and called them "very hurtful to me personally -- I have the highest regard for the protection of young children," before adding that he has never provided alcohol to a minor and has "not been guilty of sexual misconduct with anyone."Moore added that there were ongoing "investigations" looking into the motivations behind the Post article, and promised "revelations" about the story to come in the next few days, though he did not provide further specifics.A number of Republicans withdrew their endorsements of Moore following the Washington Post article, including the National Republican Senatorial Committee, which severed a joint fundraising agreement that benefits Moore's campaign.This story has been updated to reflect the Post's decision to not comment.

Trumps Asia trip, in pictures:::::President Donald Trump, accompanied by first lady Melania Trump, puts on a bomber jacket that he received from US forces in Tokyo on Sunday, November 5.President Donald Trump, accompanied by first lady Melania Trump, puts on a bomber jacket that he received from US forces in Tokyo on Sunday, November 5.President Donald Trump is on a high-stakes trip that will

Trump's Treasury secretary says most in middle class will get tax break:::::President Trump's Treasury secretary says most middle income Americans will get a tax break under the Republican plan brewing in Congress.But he stopped short of saying that break would be for all of them."By simplifying the code, we're putting everybody on a level playing field," Steven Mnuchin told CNN's Jake Tapper on "State of the Union" on Sunday."For most people -- and, again, it may not be 100 percent, but by far the majority -- both the House and Senate version provide middle-income tax relief."Mnuchin said that assessment is based on "hundreds if not thousands" of tests the Treasury has run on the bills.Mnuchin's comments came after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell walked back his claim that "nobody in the middle class is going to get a tax increase" under the Senate's version of the reform plan.On Friday, McConnell told the New York Times that he "misspoke."McConnell to NYT: I 'misspoke' on tax increase for middle class in Senate plan Mnuchin also defended the tax plan from critics, including Larry Summers, the Treasury secretary under President Bill Clinton.Summers called Mnuchin's tax cut estimates "irresponsible."Mnuchin on Sunday called those comments "unfortunate.""There are lots and lots of economists that come out and support our claims," he said."We've been completely transparent.Different models will show different things."Mnuchin added that a middle-class tax hike is not what Trump wants.He said lawmakers will "fine tune" the plan before it heads to Trump for a signature.Tapper also asked Mnuchin about Trump's claim that the tax reform bill will bring "the largest tax cuts in the history of this country.""We've tried to find a way that this is true, but it's not," Tapper said, pointing to research that shows the tax break would rank, at most, as the 3rd largest in American history.Mnuchin qualified the president's statement, saying, "This will be the largest change since President Reagan."He also singled out the proposal to slice the corporate tax rate from 35% to 20%."If that's not the biggest tax cut to make our businesses competitive, what is?"Mnuchin said.
Trump complicates his effort to build warmer Russia ties:::::Hanoi, Vietnam (CNN) President Donald Trump tore up his diplomatic script this weekend in favor of an angrier, more familiar role after his conversations with Russian President Vladimir Putin at an economic summit were limited to hallway conversations lasting little more than five minutes.The combative commander in chief re-emerged Saturday and Sunday irked that his promised thaw with Russia has been slowed by parallel investigations into Moscow's 2016 election meddling .Yet his continued vacillations on whether Russia interfered in last year's election have only clouded the matter further, thwarting the type of substantive cooperation he's seeking.Traveling through Asia this week, Trump's top aides insisted the meddling must be addressed if the two leaders met.Secretary of State Rex Tillerson told reporters in Beijing that the long list of topics up for discussion with Putin included the cyber-intrusion.Trump, however, appeared ready to move on.He told reporters as he jetted here from the seaside Vietnamese resort in Da Nang that he accepted the Russian President's denials as sincere and stressed how insulted Putin feels when the issue is raised.It's a conundrum Trump faces as investigators in Washington inch closer to his inner circle in their Russia probe.Deeply sensitive at the implication the Russian intrusion makes him appear illegitimate, Trump has been unable so far to say definitively whether Putin and his government was behind it.The unanswered question has left the matter unresolved -- and largely forestalled the type of substantive deliberations that Trump himself maintains are essential."I want to be able -- because I think it's very important -- to get along with Russia, to get along with China, to get along with Vietnam, to get along with lots of countries, because we have a lot of things we have to solve," Trump said during a news conference here on Sunday."I feel that having Russia in a friendly posture, as opposed to always fighting with them, is an asset to the world and an asset to our country, not a liability."Investigation looms JUST WATCHED Ex-adviser pitched Trump Russia trip Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Ex-adviser pitched Trump Russia trip 03:23 Standing in blue silk shirts provided by their hosts, Trump and Putin shook hands in Da Nang but never sat down for formal talks in Vietnam about Syria or North Korea -- two areas Trump has said repeatedly require Russian cooperation.The prospects for a bilateral meeting were dampened by many factors, including disagreements over Russia's role in fueling the bloody Syrian civil war.But the issue of election meddling loomed as the investigation led by special counsel Robert Mueller proceeds apace.The week before Trump departed on his diplomatic tour of Asia, three of Trump's former campaign aides were caught up in the probe -- two were indicted on the Monday ahead of Trump's departure and a third pleaded guilty and was revealed to be cooperating with investigators.Book-ending Trump's trip jetting between Asian capitals, aides have been speaking with Mueller's team.Top policy adviser Stephen Miller -- who is traveling with the President in Asia -- spoke with Mueller before he departed.Hope Hicks, another aide on the road with Trump, is due to speak with Mueller when she returns.As Trump departed Da Nang without meeting Putin, he fumed to reporters aboard Air Force One that intelligence officials from the last administration were "political hacks" and labeled the Russia investigation a "hit job" masterminded by Democrats.Waking up in Hanoi, he unleashed a stream of invective on Twitter after remaining largely calm on social media all week, calling those who question his ties to Russia "haters and fools."The response back in Washington was heated.Sen. John McCain, who was imprisoned during the Vietnam War less than a mile from where Trump was staying, wrote: "Vladimir Putin does not have America's interests at heart.To believe otherwise is not only naive but also places our national security at risk."No direct answer JUST WATCHED Smerconish: Here's who Trump doesn't believe Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Smerconish: Here's who Trump doesn't believe 01:25 Trump modulated his tone standing outside the mustard-hued presidential palace in Hanoi, saying that he sided with US intelligence agencies, who determined months ago that Russia was behind the interference.But asked directly whether Russia was responsible for the meddling, he skirted the question again and avoided putting the matter to rest."As to whether I believe it or not, I am with our agencies, especially as currently constituted with the leadership," he said.His grudging, caveated acceptance of a finding the US intelligence community arrived at months ago put him closer to the position of most of those in his administration.But it stopped short of answering the direct question he was posed about whether Russia was responsible.In polling, Americans increasingly see the Russian meddling as a grave issue.In a CNN survey conducted this month , about two-thirds (64%) now say the investigation into Russian efforts to influence the US presidential election in 2016 is a serious matter that should be fully investigated, while just 32% see it as an effort to discredit Trump's presidency.The percentage who say it's a "crisis" for the United States if the Russian government did attempt to influence the outcome of the presidential election now stands at 22%.Trump's willingness to confront Putin will be tested in the coming months.Trump is required to impose new sanctions on Russian entities by January 29 under a law passed by Congress over the summer.The same law required the administration to identify targets for the sanctions by the beginning of last month; the roster of targets arrived three weeks late In his remarks on Sunday, Trump suggested that imposing new sanctions on Russia was misguided."People don't realize Russia has been very, very heavily sanctioned," Trump said."They were sanctioned at a very high level, and that took place very recently.It's now time to get back to healing a world that is shattered and broken."
WH: Trump, Duterte discussed human rights:::::Manila (CNN) President Donald Trump and Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, who lavished pleasantries on each other during public appearances in Manila Monday, "briefly" discussed human rights and the Philippine's bloody war on drugs during their closed-door conversation, the White House said.But a spokesman for the controversial Philippine President told reporters that "human rights did not arise" during the meeting.Trump has largely eschewed public talk of human rights issues on his trip through Asia, despite the United States harboring long-held grievances with how countries in the region have treated their citizens.In Manila, the two leaders ignored shouted questions from reporters on the issue."The conversation focused on ISIS, illegal drugs and trade.Human rights briefly came up in the context of the Philippines' fight against illegal drugs," White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said.Duterte's spokesman Harry Roque told CNN, however, that the topic "was not brought up," adding that Duterte brought up the "drug menace" in the Philippines and that Trump "appeared sympathetic and did not have any official position on the matter but was merely nodding his head."White House officials did not respond when asked for clarity on what was discussed during the 40-minute during the meeting.When reporters began shouting questions during a photo spray at the beginning of the meeting, Duterte said: "We are not answering, this is not a press statement ... We are in a bilateral meeting.""We will be discussing matters that are of interest to both the Philippines and (the US) ... with you around, guys, you are the spies," Duterte joked, eliciting laughter from Trump.Duterte, as part of an effort to rid the Philippines of drug users, has publicly cheered on and inspired thousands of extrajudicial killings during his time in office, drawing scorn from human rights organizations.The Philippine President has embraced his image as a tough-on-crime leader, even bragging that he personally killed someone when he was younger.Trump's public remarks in Manila, however, focused far more on the pomp and circumstance bestowed on him during his 5-country, 13-day trip through Asia."It's a red carpet like nobody, I think, has probably ever seen," Trump said, standing alongside the Australian and Japanese prime ministers."And that really is a sign of respect, perhaps for me a little bit, but really, for our country."Though he has yet to make any major news on the trade front -- a key policy focus of his trip -- Trump teased he would make an announcement in a White House statement scheduled for Wednesday.Trump and Duterte Trump and Duterte spoke multiple times throughout the two-day ASEAN summit, including sharing a toast on Sunday night that was the front page of newspapers in Manila.Some 1,500 to 2,000 demonstrators also hit the streets on Monday, speaking out against Trump's visit, according to a police estimate shared with CNN, many of whom appeared to be from the far-left.While the two spoke fondly of one another in public, Sanders noted Trump did raise human rights concerns in private, regarding Duterte's war on drugs.The primary reason for concern among human rights organizations is that Duterte has fully embraced Trump's style, and Philippine officials, possibly in an attempt to woo the President, have said that the two leaders have a great deal in common.Roque told CNN before the visit that he sees Trump and Duterte as "very much alike in their thinking, their language and demeanor."Phelim Kine, deputy director of Human Rights Watch's Asia division and an expert on Duterte's extrajudicial campaign, told CNN that the incongruity helps is a win for the Philippine leaders, allowing his officials to spin the meeting as validation."That gives Duterte's craven spin-doctors wide latitude to deny that criticism even occurred," Kine said."What is unquestionable here is that the US President has passed on a golden opportunity to publicly show solidarity with the Philippine people by expressing concern about those thousands of deaths and to reproach Duterte's utter trashing of the concept of rule of law," he added.Previous praise JUST WATCHED Trump shows solidarity with Duterte Replay More Videos ...

Everyone wants to know what Trump's gonna say on Roy Moore:::::Washington (CNN) On Monday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell went there in regard to the candidacy of embattled former Alabama state Supreme Court Chief Justice Roy Moore."I think he should step aside," McConnell said of Moore, the Republican Senate nominee who is facing accusations from four women that he pursued relationships with them when they were teenagers -- one as young as 14 -- and he was in his early 30s."I believe the women," McConnell added.McConnell's move comes after a weekend that saw a handful of Republicans senators --- Bill Cassidy of Louisiana and Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania to name two -- calling for Moore to leave the race.The political reality -- of Moore and Alabama -- is that McConnell's decision will have approximately zero effect on the Republican Senate nominee's calculation as to whether to stay in the race or leave it before the December 12 general election.Indeed, after McConnell's remarks in Washington, Moore fired back."The person who should step aside is @SenateMajLdr Mitch McConnell.He has failed conservatives and must be replaced.#DrainTheSwamp," Moore tweeted.In fact, it's possible that there is nothing anyone not named "Roy Moore" says about the accusations will have any impact on whether or not he can win next month.But, if there is anyone who can make a difference, it's President Donald Trump.Trump is extremely popular in Alabama and -- despite endorsing Moore's GOP opponent in the primary and runoff -- carries real weight in the state.Moore ran in the primary promising to support Trump's in Washington."Don't let anyone in the press let you think that because he supported my opponent I do not support him and support his agenda," Moore said after winning the primary.So far, however, Trump, who has been traveling in Asia since the news broke, has not been willing to say all that much on Moore."I've been with you folks so I haven't gotten to see too much," Trump said when asked about the allegations against Moore during a press gaggle on a flight in Vietnam over the weekend."And believe it or not even when I am in Washington and New York I do not watch much television.I know they like to say, people that don't know me like to say I watch television."Pressed on the matter, Trump added: "Honestly, I'd have to look at it and I have to see because again I am dealing with the President of China, the President of Russia.I am dealing with the folks over here so I haven't devoted, I haven't been able to devote very much time to it."White House advisers have struck a similar tone."The President and others in the Republican Party have made clear that if the allegations are true, this man should step aside," said senior counselor Kellyanne Conway to ABC on Sunday ."But I've gone farther than that, and I've reflected something the vice president said as well which is everybody should know that conduct is disqualifying.And Mr. Moore has denied that conduct I think you've got other people are out there talking about what did or did not happen many years ago.""It appears that there is a significant issue here that needs to be addressed," said Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin on CBS You get the idea.Everyone in Trump's orbit is in a holding pattern until Trump gets back from Asia on Wednesday -- at which point it will become much, much harder for him to say he doesn't know enough about the Roy Moore situation to offer an opinion.It's hard to imagine Trump says nothing about Moore.But, what he will say is harder to predict than you might think.A typical president -- say, George W. Bush -- would likely have already issued a call for Moore to withdraw his name from the race due to the seriousness of the accusations and the fact that Moore's defense has been nothing more extensive than to say this is all "fake news."But Trump is no typical president.Trump has actively waged a campaign against the media since he began running for president in June 2015.He has claimed credit for coining the term "fake news."He identifies with Moore's outsider persona and vilification of the political establishment -- the same establishment who didn't take Trump seriously and then actively worked to keep the GOP nomination from him in 2016.Steve Bannon, Trump's chief strategist during the campaign and his sort of spirit animal in terms of approach to politics and politicians, remains an active Moore supporter.And Trump may well be once bitten, twice shy when it comes to crossing Moore.Running counter to Trump's natural anti-media and anti-establishment instincts is the fact that pressure in Washington -- from the likes of McConnell and his ilk -- will mount on the President to say something more about Moore from, roughly, the second Air Force One touches down on Wednesday.It's possible Trump won't care about that pressure.But remember that he needs McConnell to carry his tax reform measure over the coming weeks -- and he needs the rank and file Republicans in the Senate, many of whom are expressing increasing alarm about Moore, to vote for the package if he wants to have a major legislative accomplishment completed (or close to completed) before 2018 begins.Of course, it's entirely possible that Trump urges Moore to get out and Moore refuses.But, for Republicans looking for some way out of this slow-motion political car crash, Trump is their last, best hope.And that prospects should scare every establishment Republican out there.
Trump downplays past skepticism of Russian election meddling:::::Hanoi, Vietnam (CNN) President Donald Trump downplayed on Sunday his past skepticism of Russia's involvement in US election meddling, saying he sides with American intelligence agencies over Vladimir Putin when it comes to assigning culpability for the hack.But he again stopped short of stating explicitly that Russia was behind the interference in the 2016 presidential election, which US intelligence has determined was conducted to help Trum p. Speaking at a news conference in the Vietnamese capital, Trump was clarifying remarks he made a day earlier which suggested Putin was being sincere in his denials that Moscow engaged in election meddling.The President stressed he was not accepting Putin's denials at face value, instead saying he merely believed Putin was being genuine."I believe that he feels that he and Russia did not meddle in the election," Trump said."As to whether I believe it or not, I am with our agencies, especially as currently constituted with the leadership."Trump has long declined to say definitively whether he believes Russia was behind the attempts to sway last year's election.And he did not say conclusively on Sunday when asked directly whether Russia was responsible.But his nod toward American intelligence agencies, which he said were led by "very fine people," put him closer to accepting what his own government has determined happened months ago.The remarks came after Trump ignited further controversy over the Russia interference issue when he told reporters aboard Air Force One on Saturday that he believed Putin was being sincere when he denied involvement in the cyber-intrusion."I really believe that when he tells me that, he means it," Trump said.Backlash in Washington The remark prompted backlash in Washington, where intelligence officials are unanimous in their assessment that Russia sought to influence last year's contest.The CIA released an unusual statement saying the current director Mike Pompeo believes the agency's determination that Russia was behind the election meddling.Trump, however, insisted during his news conference on Sunday that his remarks were clear."I'm surprised there's conflict on this," he said."I think it was very obvious to everybody."Trump said he didn't want to engage in a public spat with his Russian counterpart over the issue of election meddling during talks this week in Vietnam."I'm not looking to stand and start arguing with somebody when there are reporters all around and cameras recording and seeing our conversation," Trump said.His meetings with Putin in Da Nang were held in private, however, and reporters did not see the two men engage in discussions.Trump said it was imperative the US and Russia work together to solve problems like Syria and North Korea."What I believe is we have to get to work," Trump said."People don't realize, Russia has been very, very heavily sanctioned.They were sanctioned at a very high level.And that took place very recently.It's now time to get back to healing a world that is shattered and broken."Tweetstorm Earlier Sunday, Trump unleashed a series of tweets as he nears the end of his epic 13-day diplomatic tour of Asia, going after "haters and fools" who question his ties to Russia and mocking the shape of North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un The stream of invective came after days of relatively restrained tweeting as Trump darted between Asian capitals on his first presidential trip to the continent."When will all the haters and fools out there realize that having a good relationship with Russia is a good thing, not a bad thing," Trump wrote at 7:18 a.m. local time in Hanoi.He spent the night here after a state dinner, and held talks and a joint news conference with Vietnamese President President Tran Dai Quang on Sunday morning."There (sic) always playing politics - bad for our country," he added."I want to solve North Korea, Syria, Ukraine, terrorism, and Russia can greatly help!"When will all the haters and fools out there realize that having a good relationship with Russia is a good thing, not a bad thing.There always playing politics - bad for our country.I want to solve North Korea, Syria, Ukraine, terrorism, and Russia can greatly help!Donald J.

Donald Trump laughed when Rodrigo Duterte called the media 'spies.' Not good.:::::Washington (CNN) Before their bilateral meeting in Manila on Monday, President Donald Trump and Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte posed for pictures.Reporters were late for what is known as the "pool spray" because, according to the pool report of the meeting, they were held up by security.When they finally got into the room, reporters asked questions of the two leaders regarding Duterte's controversial human rights record and whether Trump would raise it with him.Here's what happened next: Duterte: "We will be discussing matters that are of interest to both the Philippines and ... with you around, guys, you are the spies.""Hah, hah, hah," Trump said laughing."You are," Duterte repeated.Um, what?Even after his meeting with Duterte, Trump -- in an open session of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) meeting -- seemed entirely unfazed by his colleague's view on the press.He thanked Duterte "very much for the way you treated all of us.""Thank you," Duterte responded."This signifies the end of our open session.I would like to request media to leave us alone."He quickly added: "You may leave the room."Context matters here, and shows that Trump tolerating Duterte's behavior -- not to mention laughing at his "joke" -- is really bad.In June 2016, in the wake of two Filipino journalists being killed while working, Duterte said this : "Just because you're a journalist, you are not exempted from assassination if you're a son of a bitch.Freedom of expression cannot help you if you have done something wrong."Things haven't gotten much better for journalists in the Philippines since then.In a report on the status of journalism in the country in February , the International Press Institute writes this: "Duterte's cynicism toward the press appears to be catching on among his supporters.Journalists who criticize the president's policies or cover sensitive topics like drug trafficking or corruption face defamation suits and an online backlash.Duterte's supporters attack them outright or report their online accounts to social media platforms, demanding the takedown of 'inappropriate content.'"It's also worth noting that the Philippines is one of the most dangerous countries in the world in which to be a journalist.Since 1992, 78 journalists have been killed in the Philippines, the third highest total in the world -- behind only Iraq (186) and Syria (114), according to the Committee to Protect Journalists None of that is a laughing matter.Not even close.This also isn't the first time Trump has "joked" about restricting press freedoms.At the end of a press availability with the Kuwaiti emir at the White House in September, Trump said "I'm very happy to hear you have trouble with the press also."Kuwait isn't exactly a standard-bearer of press freedom.According to Freedom House , a US-based non-governmental organization that studies freedom of the press around the world, Kuwait's press freedom status is only "partly free" -- with a 59 out of 100 overall press freedom score."Media operate in a restricted environment," reads the 2016 writeup."Journalists and social media users deemed to have insulted the emir or Saudi Arabia often face prosecution, and the government sustains efforts to stifle criticism of its actions and policies."In October, Trump told reporters in the Oval Office that "it is frankly disgusting the press is able to write whatever it wants to write."Earlier on this 12-day Asia trip, Trump didn't protest when Chinese President Xi Jinping refused to take any questions from the media."It was at the Chinese insistence there were no questions today," said White House press secretary Sarah Sanders All of these incidents highlight an unfortunate fact: Trump either doesn't understand the role the American media plays -- both domestically and on foreign trips -- or he doesn't care.His view on the press seems to have more in common with the Philippines, China and Kuwait than it does with established western democracies.Which is telling.
Clapper, Brennan blast Donald Trump over Russia comments:::::Washington (CNN) A pair of former US intelligence chiefs blasted President Donald Trump Sunday after he attacked them a day earlier while discussing his recent conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin.Former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said Sunday on CNN"s "State of the Union" that Trump's downplaying of the threat posed by Russia's meddling in last year's election was dangerous to US national security and allows countries like Russia and China to "play" the President.Former CIA Director John Brennan said Trump is allowing Putin to get away with Russia's efforts to disrupt the presidential election.Speaking alongside Brennan, Clapper said: "The threat posed by Russia, as John just said, is manifest and obvious.To try to paint it in any other way is, I think, astounding, and in fact, poses a peril to this country."Clapper, a CNN analyst, was responding to Trump's mixed comments about alleged Russian interference in the 2016 election.'Giving Putin a pass' Brennan said Trump was in effect "giving Putin a pass," which invited other countries to seek to sway Trump.Clapper concurred, saying, "I do think both the Chinese and the Russians think they can play him."Brennan said Putin's apparent success with Trump was due to his use of flattery and Brennan's suspicion that Trump "for whatever reason" might be "intimidated" by Putin."It's either naivet, ignorance or fear in terms of what Mr. Trump is doing vis-a-vis the Russians," Brennan said.President clarifies his Saturday statement on believing Putin Trump, while speaking Sunday at a news conference in Hanoi, sought to clarify remarks he made a day earlier that suggested Russian President Vladimir Putin was being sincere in his denials that Moscow engaged in election meddling.The President stressed he was not accepting Putin's denials at face value, instead saying he merely believed Putin was being genuine."I believe that he feels that he and Russia did not meddle in the election," Trump said."As to whether I believe it or not, I am with our agencies, especially as currently constituted with the leadership."But he again stopped short of stating explicitly that Russia was behind the interference in the 2016 presidential election, which US intelligence has determined was conducted to help Trump.Trump on Saturday also dismissed former officials like Clapper, Brennan and former FBI Director James Comey as "political hacks."The intelligence community released an unclassified version of its assessment in January, saying Putin ordered the election meddling to hurt Hillary Clinton's candidacy and bolster Trump's successful bid.Putin denies the accusations, and Trump has wavered publicly on his own stance.Brennan said he considered Trump's attack on them as an attempt to undermine the credibility of that intelligence community report, which the former CIA director noted was written by intelligence and law enforcement officers, not himself, Clapper or Comey."He was referring to us as political hacks because he was trying to delegitimize the intelligence community assessment," Brennan said.The Obama-era CIA chief added that he took the criticism from Trump with pride."Considering the source of the criticism, I consider that criticism a badge of honor," Brennan said.Asked about his own knowledge of any potential collusion between Trump's associates and Russia, Brennan demurred, saying he had spoken with the congressional investigators, and went on later in the interview to praise former FBI Director Robert Mueller, who is leading the special counsel investigation.Clapper said that although he had "no direct evidence of collusion" while still on the job, he did not know about former Trump foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos' activities, which were revealed last month in unsealed court documents.Papadopoulos pleaded guilty last month to making a false statement to the FBI after he lied about his interactions with a foreign contact close to the Russian government.Since leaving government, Clapper said more information had come out that raises at least "circumstantial questions" about potential connections between Trump's associates and Russia.

Melania Trump to cap Asia trip with China stop:::::Beijing (CNN) First lady Melania Trump has arrived in Beijing , the third and final leg of her trip to Asia with President Donald Trump , who will continue on to Vietnam and the Philippines.Since starting her trip to Asia on Sunday, Trump has spoken publicly once during the trip.But she's embraced the role of a gracious guest, accompanying the President to his speeches, state visits and formal dinners, and sitting in the front row for both of his joint press conference appearances.The first lady has also spent much of her time meeting and sharing culture with her counterparts.Trump learned about the history of pearls in Japan with Akie Abe, wife of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe , and the two joined a fourth-grade class for a calligraphy lesson, showcasing a warm rapport.In South Korea, she had a traditional tea with Madam Kim Jung-sook, wife of President Moon Jae-in, who also joined her outside with the schoolchildren.On Wednesday, she will be welcomed by yet another counterpart: China's Peng Liyuan On the way to Asia.I am looking forward to seeing Mrs. Abe , First Lady Kim and Madame Peng again!#FLOTUSinAsia Joined by their husbands, Trump and Peng will tour the Forbidden City and have dinner Wednesday evening in Beijing.Trump has a busy schedule for the remainder of her trip.On Thursday, the Trumps will participate in a welcome ceremony at the Great Hall of the People, then she will attend a spousal program.Later in the day, she will meet and greet Americans at the US Embassy alongside the President, then attend a state dinner and cultural performance.Friday, Trump will have some time to play the role of tourist, visiting a zoo to interact with giant pandas and tour the Great Wall of China before returning to the United States.Trump first welcomed Peng to the United States in April; the two visited a middle school in West Palm Beach and joined their husbands for dinner at Mar-a-Lago.Madame Peng and I visited Bak Middle School of the Arts.Thank you to all talented students for a wonderful performances!pic.twitter.com/y2MVjGKuId Melania Trump (@FLOTUS) April 7, 2017 Among the elite club of the wives of world leaders, the two have much in common.Both have had successful careers in their own right.Trump was a model before meeting her husband and Peng is a folk singer who once regularly performed in front of millions of TV audiences.She was, in fact, more famous than her husband until Xi's rise to power in the mid-2000s.They draw parallels on family as well: both women are also not their husband's first wives; Trump is the President's third wife, Peng is Xi's second wife.And both take care to shield their children from the public limelight.As they navigate their husbands' time in office, each have carved out causes to champion.Peng focuses on promoting Chinese culture and tradition and is also a UN goodwill ambassador on HIV/AIDS , recently filming a public service announcement on the topic.Trump's platform centers around helping children, including preventing childhood bullying and combating the opioid epidemic.The women are also both considered fashion icons.Peng tries to highlight dresses by Chinese designers, often with a traditional flair.The US first lady, meanwhile, h as defined her own kind of fashion diplomacy , opting for bold, high fashion choices.She's not necessarily adhering to the guidelines of previous first ladies, who have highlighted American designers at home and the designers of their host countries while abroad.They also both try to stay out of their husbands' politics.For Peng, unwritten Communist Party rule dictates no spousal interference in politics since former leader Mao Zedong's wife tried to grab power during the Cultural Revolution in the 1970s.Peng, however, is a Communist Party member and was a civilian officer at the People's Liberation Army.In 1989, the Chinese first lady performed for Chinese troops who crushed pro-democracy protesters in the Tiananmen Square massacre.Photos of the performance resurfaced following Xi's elevation to the top of Chinese leadership, causing embarrassment to the authorities.
Donald Trump Jr. Had Secret Contact With WikiLeaks: Report:::::President Donald Trump and his lawyer continue to make rounds to media to downplay a meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Kremlin-connected Russian lawyer during the 2016 presidential campaign.(Published Monday, July 17, 2017) Donald Trump Jr. sporadically corresponded with WikiLeaks during the presidential campaign, according to messages obtained by The Atlantic.The secret contact via Twitter began just weeks before the election, with the anti-secrecy organization asking Trump Jr. to promote its documents online while giving the president's eldest son tips that would help the campaign, according to The Atlantic's report.In September 2016, WikiLeaks direct-messaged Trump Jr. to warn him that an anti-Trump website was about to launch.Trump Jr. responded the next day, saying he would "ask around" about the group, according to the report.Trump Jr. allegedly told Steve Bannon, Kellyanne Conway, Brad Parscale and Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner that WikiLeaks had contacted him with a tip.Former Soviet Intel Officer Was Also at Trump Team Meeting As President Trump celebrates Bastille Day in France with President Macron, additional information has surfaced about a meeting that took place between Donald Trump, Jr. and a Russian lawyer in June 2016.NBC News learned that a former soviet counter-intelligence officer also attended the meeting, something that had not been previously disclosed.(Published Friday, July 14, 2017) Trump Jr. seldom responded to WikiLeaks' messages and requests, which included asking for President Donald Trump's tax returns, but also did not rebuke the organization as it released information that benefited Russian interests, according to the report.Seemingly in response to the report, Trump Jr. tweeted what he says are screen grabs of his WikiLeaks conversation Monday evening.He wrote: "Here is the entire chain of messages with @wikileaks (with my whopping 3 responses) which one of the congressional committees has chosen to selectively leak.How ironic!"NBC News has not independently confirmed the versacity of Trump Jr.'s screenshots or The Atlantic report.NBC has reached out to the White House for comment.WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange tweeted he "cannot confirm the alleged DM's from @DonaldJTrumpJr to @WikiLeaks."He claimed WikiLeaks does not keep record of those messages and that the The Atlantic's report "does not have the full context."The American intelligence community has long suspected WikiLeaks of aiding the Russian government in the interference of the 2016 election.Donald Trump Jr.Admits He Met With Russian Lawyer Donald Trump Jr. has acknowledged he was promised information about Hillary Clinton that might be helpful to his fathers presidential campaign in a meeting with a Russian lawyer.The lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya, gave no meaningful information, Trump Jr. said, adding that his father, President Donald Trump, had no knowledge of the meeting.(Published Monday, July 10, 2017) On Election Day, WikiLeaks encouraged Trump Jr. to tell his father to "NOT conceed [sic] and spends time CHALLENGING the media and other types of rigging that occurred" if he lost.Trump Jr. did not respond.Trump Jr.'s lawyers turned the messages over to congressional investigators, according to the report.

Beyond Virginia: How Americas Big Counties Are Reshaping Politics:::::Karina Smith holds her 2-year-old son Kyler as she fills out her ballot at the polling place at Washington Mill Elementary School Nov. 7, 2017, in Alexandria, Virginia.At first glance, Virginia, with its rapid suburban population growth and deepening blue tint, may seem like the exception rather than the rule.But the pattern is one thats been replicated across the country, NBC News reported.An NBC News analysis of voting and demographic trends in each of the lower 48 states shows that, since 2000, Democrats have improved upon their presidential election margins in the lions share of the most vote-rich and populous counties in America even as their share of the vote in the remainder of each state was stagnant, decreased or at best grew at a far slower pace.The data seem to show two important trends since 2000.One, Barack Obamas candidacy and presidency blew open the partisan voting divide between the most urban counties in states and the rest of their population.The 2008 election seemed to be a watershed in the split.Two, the changes that followed 2008 were not just about the minority vote in urban centers.In 2016, without the first black president on the top of the ticket, the gaps between these counties and the rest of the states widened more.

Pat Toomey says Alabama GOP Senate candidate Roy Moore should drop out of the race following allegations he had sexual contact with a 14-year-old girl decades ago.Speaking on NBC, Toomey says because the "accusations have more credibility than the denial, I think it would be best if Roy would just step aside."The Pennsylvania senator says Moore's primary opponent, Luther Strange, should be considered as a write-in candidate to run against him.The Washington Post reported last week that the 70-year-old Moore had relationships with teenage girls while he was in his early 30s.Moore has vehemently denied the allegations.Toomey didn't rule out the possibility that Senate Republicans might work to unseat Moore if he wins the special election against Democrat Doug Jones on Dec. 12.

Trump: 'I'm With Our Agencies' on Russian Election Meddling:::::The German government released a video of world leaders shaking hands at the G-20 summit in Hamburg, Germany, on July 7, 2017, including the first meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin.(Published Friday, July 7, 2017) President Donald Trump says he believes Russian President Vladimir Putin believes it when he says Moscow did not interfere in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.But Trump says he also believes U.S. intelligence agencies, which have concluded that Russia did meddle in the election."I believe that he feels that he and Russia did not meddle in the election," Trump said of Putin at news conference with Vietnam's President Tran Dai Quang in Hanoi "As to whether I believe it, I'm with our agencies.""As currently led by fine people, I believe very much in our intelligence agencies," he added.The U.S. intelligence community has concluded that Russia interfered in the election to help the Republican defeat Democrat Hillary Clinton.Trump, Putin Discuss 'Very Good' First Sit-Down Meeting U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin addressed the media during their first in-person meeting.The talks took place during the G-20 summit in Germany.(Published Friday, July 7, 2017) Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One on Saturday, Trump had said that Putin again vehemently denied the allegations this time during an economic summit in Vietnam.Trump said he believed "that when he tells me that, he means it."Trump had also dismissed former U.S. intelligence officials as "political hacks" and accused Democrats of using the issue to try to sabotage relations between the two countries, putting lives at risk.At the news conference, Trump reiterated his view that it's crucial for the U.S. to get along with Russia, and seemed to suggest that it was time to remove the sanctions Congress has slapped on Russia in retaliation for its election meddling efforts."It's now time to get back to healing a world that is shattered and broken," said Trump."Those are very important things."As he traveled to Hanoi, the second-to-last stop of his Asia trip, Trump told reporters that Putin "said he absolutely did not meddle in our election.He did not do what they are saying he did.""Every time he sees me, he said: 'I didn't do that.'And I believe I really believe that when he tells me that, he means it," Trump said, calling the accusation an "artificial barrier" erected by Democrats.Trump Tweets Syrian Cease-Fire Negotiations With Russia President Donald Trump called for expanded cooperation with Russia on Sunday, as a cease-fire brokered by the two powers and Jordan for southern Syria went into effect.(Published Sunday, July 9, 2017) The president lashed out at the former heads of the nation's intelligence community, and said there were plenty of reasons to be suspicious of their findings."I mean, give me a break.They're political hacks," Trump said, citing by name James Clapper, the former director of national intelligence, John Brennan, the former CIA director and his ousted ex-FBI director James Comey, whom Trump said was "proven now to be a liar and he's proven to be a leaker."In a tweet sent Sunday from Hanoi, Trump bashed the "haters and fools" he said are questioning his efforts to improve relations with Russia and accused critics of "playing politics" and hurting the country.Trump's comments about Putin and "political hacks" brought criticism from lawmakers with ties to the intelligence community.Rep. Adam Schiff, the California Democrat who is his party's top member on the House's intelligence committee, said in a statement that Trump "fools no one" and that the president understands how the Russians intervened through hacking, social media and their own television coverage of the presidential race.Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., the party's presidential nominee in 2008, said in a statement that Trump's faith in Putin's denial was "naive.""There's nothing 'America First' about taking the word of a KGB colonel over that of the American intelligence community," McCain wrote, referring to Putin's former career in Soviet intelligence."Vladimir Putin does not have America's interests at heart."Trump was in Hanoi for a brief state visit, including Sunday's meeting with Quang at the presidential palace.Trump Talks Trade and Addresses Russia Meddling on Asia Trip President Donald Trump winds down his first official trip to Asia in the Philippines.After walking back from his comments that he believed Russian President Putin's denials, he heads back to the U.S. and faces a Republican Senate election controversy.(Published Monday, Nov. 13, 2017) In brief remarks after his arrival, Trump offered help negotiating with China on disputes over the South China Sea.Beijing's island-building there has drawn criticism from Washington, which argues the U.S. has a national interest in freedom of navigation in sea lanes critical for world trade.U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson earlier this month said China's "provocative actions" challenged international law and norms."If I can help mediate or arbitrate, please let me know," Trump offered."I'm a very good mediator and a very good arbitrator.I've done plenty of it from both sides."Trump also said he hoped to have more help from Chinese President Xi Jinping as well as Russia, when it comes to isolating North Korea."The North Korean situation continues to be a problem.President Xi I think is going to be a tremendous help.I hope Russia likewise will be a tremendous help.I think they can make a big difference," he said.Trump and Putin did not have a formal meeting while they were in Vietnam for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit, but the two spoke informally several times and reached an agreement on a number of principles for the future of war-torn Syria.Trump made clear that the issue of Russian meddling in the election hovers over the leaders' relationship and said it jeopardized their ability to work together on issues including North Korea's escalating nuclear program and the deadly conflict in Syria."Having a good relationship with Russia's a great, great thing.And this artificial Democratic hit job gets in the way," Trump told reporters."People will die because of it."Trump Delivers 'America First' Speech at APEC CEO Summit President Trump delivered a speech at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation CEO Summit 2017, saying he does not blame China for "taking advantage of" the U.S. when it comes to trade.(Published Friday, Nov. 10, 2017) Trump had danced around the question of whether he believed Putin's denials Saturday, telling reporters that pressing the issue would have accomplished little."Well, look, I can't stand there and argue with him," Trump said."I'd rather have him get out of Syria, to be honest with you.I'd rather have him, you know, work with him on the Ukraine than standing and arguing about whether or not 'cause that whole thing was set up by the Democrats."Multiple U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that Moscow meddled in the election to try to help Trump win.But Trump called the former heads of those agencies "political hacks" and argued there's plenty of reason to be suspicious of their findings.The comments made clear that Trump still does not take the meddling seriously and sees little benefit in punishing a nation accused of undermining the most fundamental tenet of American democracy: free and fair elections.They also suggest that Trump is unlikely to work aggressively to try to prevent future meddling despite repeated warnings from senior intelligence officials that Russia is likely to try to interfere again.Meanwhile, a special counsel investigation of potential collusion between Moscow and Trump campaign aides so far has resulted in two indictments for financial and other crimes unrelated to the campaign, as well as a guilty plea.Congressional committees have also been interviewing campaign and White House staff."Trump really raised the topic of so-called interference in US elections," Putin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, was quoted by Russian news agencies as telling reporters."Putin categorically rejected even the hypothetical possibility that Russia could have in some way interfered in the U.S. electoral process."House Republicans Get Ready to Draft DACA Legislation A broad range of House Republicans Thursday said they were ready to work to craft a new legislative fix for young immigrants, known by supporters as Dreamers, before the end of this year.(Published Thursday, Nov. 9, 2017) Associated Press writers Darlene Superville and Ken Thomas in Washington contributed to this report.

New woman accuses Roy Moore of sexual assault:::::Former Alabama Chief Justice Roy Moore faces new allegations of sexual assault today, after a woman came forward to accuse Moore, the Republican nominee in the states special Senate election next month, of sexually assaulting her in his car when she was a minor.Interested in Roy Moore?Add Roy Moore as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Roy Moore news, video, and analysis from ABC News.Add Interest Beverly Young Nelson said she met Moore when she was 15 years old while she waited tables at a restaurant in Gadsen, Alabama.The future judge acted in a flirtatious manner and even signed her yearbook Merry Christmas and Love, Roy Moore, D.A, she claimed.A short time later, after she turned 16, she said, Moore offered to give her a ride home after work one night.Instead, she said, he parked his car next to a dumpster behind the restaurant and sexually assaulted her.Mr. Moore reached over and began groping me, putting his hands on my breasts, Young Nelson alleged.I tried to open my car door to leave, but he reached over and locked it so I could not get out.I tried fighting him off, while yelling at him to stop, but instead of stopping, he began squeezing my neck, attempting to force my head onto his crotch.Young Nelson, who said she voted for Donald Trump for president, claimed Moores chokehold left her neck black and purple.Bill Clark/CQ-Roll Call,Inc./Getty Images I continued to struggle.I was determined that I was not going to allow him to force me to have sex with him.I was terrified.He was also trying to pull my shirt off.I thought that he was going to rape me.I was twisting and struggling and begging him to stop.I had tears running down my face, she said.She continued, At some point he gave up.He then looked at me and said, You are a child.I am the district attorney of Etowah County.If you tell anyone about this, no one will believe you.Moores campaign is denying the latest charges, which builds on allegations first reported by The Washington Post last week, including a claim by a woman that Moore engaged in sexual activity with her when she was 14 and he was in his 30s.Weve said this before, and well say it again: Judge Moore is an innocent man and has never had any sexual misconduct with anyone, Moore campaign Chairman Bill Armistead said.This is a witch hunt against a man who has had an impeccable career for over 30 years and has always been known as a man of high character.Moore briefly addressed the allegations on Monday night, calling the claims "absolutely false.""I never did what she said I did.I dont even know the woman," he said.Moores Democratic opponent, Doug Jones, responded to the developments through his campaign.We applaud the courage of these women.Roy Moore will be held accountable by the people of Alabama for his actions, his campaign said.The special election, to fill the Senate seat vacated by Attorney General Jeff Sessions, is scheduled Dec. 12.Several prominent Republican lawmakers, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, have called on Moore to drop out of the race.
Donald Trump Jr. communicated with WikiLeaks during 2016 campaign, sources say:::::Sources with direct knowledge confirm to ABC News that President Donald Trumps eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., communicated with representatives from WikiLeaks during the 2016 campaign via private message on Twitter.Interested in Donald Trump Jr.?Add Donald Trump Jr. as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Donald Trump Jr. news, video, and analysis from ABC News.Add Interest The sources confirm to ABC News that WikiLeaks made contact with Trump Jr. in late September 2016 and continued into the first half of this year.One source says the conversations were heavy in one direction with WikiLeaks sending many messages to Trump Jr. and the presidents son responding on a limited basis, often ignoring them.A source close to Trump Jr. tells ABC News they believe after Wikileaks initial message to him, he did send an email to campaign officials including Steve Bannon, Kellyanne Conway, Brad Parscale, and Jared Kushner sharing that Wikileaks had made contact, as first reported by The Atlantic.The sources also confirm to ABC News the correspondence was turned over by Trump Jr. to congressional investigators as part of the ongoing Russia probe.Alan Futerfas, Trump Jr.s lawyer said in a statement to ABC News that his client has cooperated with the various congressional committee investigations.Over the last several months, we have worked cooperatively with each of the committees and have voluntarily turned over thousands of documents in response to their requests, Futerfas wrote.Putting aside the question as to why or by whom such documents, provided to Congress under promises of confidentiality, have been selectively leaked, we can say with confidence that we have no concerns about these documents and any questions raised about them have been easily answered in the appropriate forum.Rep. Adam Schiff, D-California, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, says the direct message exchange is "yet another indication of the campaign's willingness at the very highest levels to accept foreign assistance.""This is yet another indication of the campaigns willingness at the very highest levels to accept foreign assistance, to accept assistance here with a cutout of the Kremlin that is publishing stolen documents that were obtained by a Russian hacking of Hillary Clintons campaign," he told ABC News."We just see this web of connections becoming more and more extensive."WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange Tweeted that he couldn't confirm the communiques to Trump Jr.I cannot confirm the alleged DM's from @DonaldJTrumpJr to @WikiLeaks.@WikiLeaks does not keep such records and the Atlantic's presentation is edited and clearly does not have the full context.However, even those published by the Atlantic show that: 1/ Julian Assange ??(@JulianAssange) November 13, 2017 WikiLeaks loves its pending publications and ignores those who ask for details.Trump Jr. was rebuffed just like Cambridge Analytica.In both cases WikiLeaks had publicly teased the publications.Thousands of people asked about them.2/ Julian Assange ??(@JulianAssange) November 13, 2017 WikiLeaks can be very effective at convincing even high profile people that it is their interest to promote links to its publications.3/ Julian Assange ??(@JulianAssange) November 13, 2017
Officials: Jeff Sessions could technically get old Senate seat back. He might not want it:::::Though Senate rules make it possible for Attorney General Jeff Sessions to be appointed to his old Senate seat by the Alabama governor if a victorious Roy Moore is voted out by his colleagues an idea several officials close to President Donald Trump have floated Sessions isn't in favor, three officials told ABC News.Interested in Roy Moore?Add Roy Moore as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Roy Moore news, video, and analysis from ABC News.Add Interest If Moore, the Republican nominee, wins in the upcoming special election, the Senate, with a two-thirds vote, could decide not to seat him.That would mean another vacancy in Alabama and an opportunity for the governor to name a replacement, possibly Sessions.But Sessions' return to that chamber is unlikely, multiple sources told ABC News.One official close to Sessions told ABC News, "This is wishful thinking from people who probably don't even know Jeff Sessions and certainly haven't spoken to him."An official in the White House insisted that even though the plan has been floated, Trump continues to have confidence in Sessions as attorney general.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky today said he believes the women who have accused Moore of sexual misconduct.Speaking at an event in his home state this morning, McConnell said he thinks Moore should drop out of the race.When a reporter asked McConnell, "Do you believe these allegations to be true?"he responded, "I believe the women, yes."McConnell said they were looking into the possibility of backing a write-in campaign for a different Republican candidate, should Moore drop out something Moore has said he has no intention of doing.Alabama Republican Party Chairwoman Terry Lathan spoke out on Monday and pushed back against that idea for now."It would be a serious error for any current elected GOP official or candidate to publicly endorse another party's candidate, an independent, a third party or a write-in candidate in a general election as well," she told ABC News in a statement."I have heard of no Alabama GOP elected official or candidate that is even considering this option."Lathan cited so-called sore-loser rules as a way the party could keep Sen. Luther Strange or Rep. Mo Brooks, who both lost in the GOP primary, from qualifying for the ballot as a candidate against Moore."This committee reserves the right to deny ballot access to a candidate for public office if in a prior election that person was a Republican office holder and either publicly participated in the primary election of another political party or publicly supported a nominee of another political party," Lathan said in the statement.Moore has repeatedly denied the sexual misconduct allegations that were first reported by The Washington Post last week.The allegations date back decades, including a claim by a woman that he engaged in sexual activity with her when she was 14 and he was in his 30s.He responded to McConnell, writing on Twitter, "The person who should step aside is @SenateMajLdr Mitch McConnell.He has failed conservatives and must be replaced.#DrainTheSwamp."The person who should step aside is @SenateMajLdr Mitch McConnell.He has failed conservatives and must be replaced.#DrainTheSwamp Judge Roy Moore (@MooreSenate) November 13, 2017 Former Alabama Chief Justice Gorman Houston ran as a Republican but now considers himself an independent.He said he thinks the turnout next month will be low."I don't know whether he will be elected or not," Houston said."I imagine there are going to be certain people who will not want to vote for the Democrat but who will not want to vote for [Moore], and I imagine that there will be a write-in.A lot of people will write in."But exactly who that write-in candidate might be remains unclear."I have heard that people would like to write in Jeff Sessions, who held that position ...He is very very popular in Alabama.It was his seat," Gorman said.ABC News' Meghan Keneally contributed to this report.
Bipartisan analysis: Senate bill would hike taxes for 13.8M:::::Interested in Taxes?Add Taxes as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Taxes news, video, and analysis from ABC News.Add Interest Promoted as needed relief for the middle class, the Senate Republican tax overhaul actually would increase taxes for some 13.8 million moderate-income American households, a bipartisan analysis showed Monday.The assessment by Congress' Joint Committee on Taxation emerged as the Senate's tax-writing committee began wading through the measure, working toward the first major revamp of the tax system in some 30 years.Barging into the carefully calibrated work that House and Senate Republicans have done, President Donald Trump called for a steeper tax cut for wealthy Americans and pressed GOP leaders to add a contentious health care change to the already complex mix.Trump's latest tweet injected a dose of uncertainty into the process as the Republicans try to deliver on his top legislative priority.He commended GOP leaders for getting the tax legislation closer to passage in recent weeks and then said, "Cut top rate to 35% w/all of the rest going to middle income cuts?"That puts him at odds with the House legislation that leaves the top rate at 39.6 percent and the Senate bill as written, with the top rate at 38.5 percent.Trump also said, "Now how about ending the unfair & highly unpopular individual mandate in (Obama)care and reducing taxes even further?"Overall, the legislation would deeply cut corporate taxes, double the standard deduction used by most Americans, and limit or repeal completely the federal deduction for state and local property, income and sales taxes.It carries high political stakes for Trump and Republican leaders in Congress, who view passage of tax cuts as critical to the GOP preserving its majorities at the polls next year.With few votes to spare, Republican leaders hope to finalize a tax overhaul by Christmas and send the legislation to Trump for his signature.The key House leader on the effort, Rep. Kevin Brady, said he's "very confident" that Republicans "do and will have the votes to pass" the measure this week.Brady, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said he doesn't expect major changes to the bill as it moves to a final vote in the House.Still, he said Trump's call for removing the requirement to have health insurance as part of the tax agreement "remains under consideration."Trump and the Republicans have promoted the legislation as a boon to the middle class, bringing tax relief to people with moderate incomes and boosting the economy to create new jobs."This bill is not a massive tax cut for the wealthy....This is not a big giveaway to corporations," Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, insisted as the panel had its first day of debate on the Senate measure.Hatch also downplayed the analysis by congressional tax experts showing a tax increase for several million U.S. households under the Senate proposal.Hatch said "a relatively small minority of taxpayers could see a slight increase in their taxes."The committee's senior Democrat, Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, said the legislation has become "a massive handout to multinational corporations and a bonanza for tax cheats and powerful political donors."The analysis found that the Senate measure would actually increase taxes in 2019 for 13.8 million households earning less than $200,000 a year.That group, about 10 percent of all U.S. taxpayers, would face tax increases of $100 to $500 in 2019.There also would be increases greater than $500 for a number of taxpayers, especially those with incomes between $75,000 and $200,000.By 2025, 21.4 million households would have steeper tax bills.The analysts previously found a similar magnitude of tax increases under the House bill.Neither bill includes a repeal of the so-called individual mandate of Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act, the requirement that Americans get health insurance or face a penalty.Several top Republicans have warned that including the provision, as Trump wants, would draw opposition and make passage tougher.A key moderate Republican in the Senate said it's too early to say whether including repeal of the insurance mandate would cost her vote on the tax bill."I'm going to see what the Finance Committee winds up with and what we do on the (Senate) floor," said Sen. Susan Collins of Maine.Collins did say she opposed Trump's idea of reducing the top tax rate for the wealthiest earners.Among the biggest differences in the two bills that have emerged: the House bill allows homeowners to deduct up to $10,000 in property taxes while the Senate proposal unveiled by GOP leaders last week eliminates the entire deduction.Both versions would eliminate deductions for state and local income taxes and sales taxes.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., asked whether the Senate's proposed repeal of the property tax deduction could bring higher taxes for some middle-class Americans, acknowledged there would be some taxpayers who end up with higher tax bills."Any way you cut it, there is a possibility that some taxpayers would get a higher rate," McConnell told reporters after a forum in Louisville, Kentucky, with local business owners and employees."You can't craft any tax bill that guarantees that every single taxpayer in America gets a tax break.What I'm telling you is the overall majority of taxpayers in every bracket would get relief."Associated Press writer Bruce Schreiner in Louisville and Kevin Freking in Washington contributed to this report.
Trump announces ex-Big Pharma exec Alex Azar as Tom Price's replacement at Health and Human Services:::::President Donald Trump today announced he's nominating Alex Azar to be Department of Health and Human Services secretary, replacing Tom Price.Interested in Trump Administration?Add Trump Administration as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Trump Administration news, video, and analysis from ABC News.Add Interest Azar is a former executive for pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly and worked as a deputy secretary at HHS under President George W. Bush.Price resigned Sept. 29 amid investigations into his use of charter jets at taxpayers' expense.After graduating from Yale Law School, Azar, 50, clerked for Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia and then worked for then-independent counsel Ken Starr on the so-called Whitewater investigation that embroiled the Clinton administration.Azar calls Starr a mentor.In a Yale Law School student profile, Azar says he entered health care largely by accident.After working on the Bush-Cheney campaign in 2000, Azar joined the George W. Bush administration as general counsel of HHS.He later became deputy secretary of HHS under Secretary Mike Leavitt.I realized I had found my life's calling: to help people around the world live longer, healthier, and happier lives, wrote Azar about his work at HHS.Former HHS Secretary Leavitt praised Trumps pick of Azar.Alex is highly competent, hes experienced, hes ideologically aligned with the president and hes been confirmed twice by the Senate for HHS, Leavitt told ABC News.There may never have been a nominee better able to hit the ground running.We worked side by side for the implementation of Medicare Part D, on pandemic preparedness and Katrina recovery.He also had complete responsibility for the administrative rulemaking process at HHS which will be used extensively in changing the existing law, said Leavitt.After serving at HHS, Azar joined Lilly USA, LLC, an affiliate of pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly and Co., where he oversaw the commercial side of the business.Azar stepped down from Lilly after more than a decade to start up a health care consulting firm, Seraphim Strategies, LLC.Trump touted Azars experience working with the drug industry in a tweet announcing his pick although his very connection to the pharmaceutical business could raise questions during his confirmation hearings.Happy to announce, I am nominating Alex Azar to be the next HHS Secretary.He will be a star for better healthcare and lower drug prices!Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 13, 2017 Comments on Obamacare The Trump administration has sought to repeal and then to weaken the Affordable Care Act, President Barack Obamas signature health care legislation.Over the course of the past year, HHS has dramatically cut outreach and advertising funding for open enrollment under Obamacare, and President Trump ended cost-sharing subsidies to help fund insurance for low-income individuals.With the Republican Congress unable to follow through with the campaign promise to repeal and replace Obamacare, Trump has signaled hes looking for regulatory avenues for dismantling the Affordable Care Act.Azars comments about aspects of the Affordable Care Act signal his potential policy positions as head of the regulatory body overseeing the law.Its certainly circling the drain, said Azar of the Affordable Care Act during an interview on the Fox Business Network.Obamacare plans are following the laws of economics.First, if youre running an insurance company youve got to be able to make money, and in order to make money youve got to be able to predict risk.The Obamacare system has made it impossible to predict risk.Theres actually fairly few levers that the government can do at this point to stabilize this broken system, said Azar.Azar has also said that the expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care has been unsuccessful.The potential loss of Medicaid expansion dollars has been a sticking point for some Republican lawmakers from Medicaid expansion states who have welcomed the increase in federal dollars.Instead of throwing more money and more beneficiaries into state-run, single-payer programs, weve demonstrated that it works to use the government money through private-sector vehicles, said Azar said in an interview with the Zetema Project in February.Senate Health Committee Chairman Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., praised Trumps choice to lead HHS.As a former Deputy Secretary of Health and Human Services and private sector executive, Alex Azar has the qualifications and experience to get results.The Senate health committee will promptly schedule a hearing on his nomination, said Alexander in a statement.Critics slam Azar's stance on Obamacare Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a statement that Azars confirmation process will be a referendum on the Trump administration's repeated efforts to sabotage our health care system and raise premiums on millions of Americans.Its time to turn over a new leaf at HHS," Schumer said."The next secretary must demonstrate a commitment to lowering premiums, and not sabotaging the Affordable Care Act and our health care system with reckless actions that hurt families.I look forward to reviewing Mr. Azar's nomination.Protect Our Care, an advocacy organization that supports the Affordable Care Act and which ran advertising campaigns against Tom Price during his nomination process, blasted Azar in a statement."President Trump has nominated in Mr. Azar someone who shares his misguided and factually flawed views on the Affordable Care Act, said Brad Woodhouse of Protect Our Care in a statement."The nomination of a new HHS Secretary could be an opportunity for Trump and Republicans to turn the page on their repeal and sabotage agenda, especially in light of last week's election results where Republicans lost across the country with the GOP's unpopular health care agenda being a leading cause.

A tale of 2 US delegations at climate talks:::::While the world meets in Bonn, Germany, to hammer out the final details of the historic Paris climate accord and lay the path forward on combating climate change, there may be some confusion over who speaks for America.The Trump administration's official delegation is a smaller team smaller than in past years and is led by the State Department to work on the Paris Agreement - even though the president intends to withdraw from the accord.But there's another delegation from the U.S. at the summit a group of elected officials, businesses, universities, and nonprofits, all of whom are committed to meeting America's promises under the agreement even without the administration's help.The summit in Bonn is the annual Conference of the Parties to the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, shortened to COP23.Delegations from around the world are negotiating crucial details of the agreement including timelines for reporting progress.Trump announced his intention to withdraw from the international climate deal in a Rose Garden speech in June, saying "I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris".Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto is one of the attendees in Germany and has signed on to support the Paris deal.The State Department formally notified the UN in August that the U.S. intends to withdraw from the agreement.However, because of the agreements legal structure the earliest withdrawal can take place is November 2020 right as Trump seeks re-election.State Department spokesperson Heather Nauert said last week that the department's position has not changed on the Paris agreement and will follow the president's direction on the subject."If we could get a more favorable deal for American businesses, American workers and taxpayers, then we will look at that.But we continue to go forward with the plan of pulling out of the Paris accords," Nauert said last Tuesday.But the White House said the delegation is not planning any negotiations on a better deal at COP23."We don't plan to talk about what those options could be," a White House official told reporters on a conference call."I don't anticipate having delegations approach us and really try to get into that kind of discussion."The administration has yet to provide any details of what a "more favorable deal" would look like or moved forward on any negotiations.A White House official said the administration'd position has not changed and they have no plans to discuss options that would lead to the U.S. remaining in the Paris deal.The official said administration officials are participating in events that aren't geared toward discussing the deal.Who is representing the U.S.?The highest level American official attending on behalf of the U.S. government is Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Tom Shannon, who will arrive this week for negotiations.The Department's Director of Global Change Trigg Talley is the lead negotiator with a team of officials who have worked on climate issues for years, including as part of the original negotiations for the Paris agreement.The White House will be represented by George David Banks, special assistant to President Trump for international energy and environment.The official delegation has been criticized for focusing on the role of fossil fuels and coal at this climate change summit.Research shows that emissions from burning fossil fuel contribute to warming temperatures.Protesters from environmental advocacy groups disrupted a U.S. government event Monday with the U.S. Energy Association on "the critical role of fossil fuels," turning their backs to the panel and singing a rendition of "Proud to Be an American" for several minutes and then walking out."I think that this panel is only controversial if we choose to bury our heads in the sand and ignore the realities of the global energy system," Banks said at the beginning of the panel.Protesters have started singing in response to the US #COP23 fossil fuel side event.pic.twitter.com/Lg8lGNFEE3 Sierra Club (@SierraClub) November 13, 2017 Banks laughed during the protest and joked that the "singing is pretty good."The U.S. registered 49 people to attend the convention.That includes people from the State Dept., agencies like the Dept.of Energy, Treasury, USDA, and EPA, as well as a five senators and some congressional staff.In comparison the United Kingdom registered 45 people, China registered 83 people, and Canada registered 161.While the U.S. delegation is present and meeting with other delegations there is reportedly no booth for the official delegation in the main pavilion.The unofficial delegation does have one it calls the U.S.Climate Action Center and has been hosting events there throughout the conference.There's also a notable absence of representation from America's main environmental agency.Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt will not attend the summit and only three people are registered from the EPA.The alternative delegation has adopted the tagline "We Are Still In" and represents more than 2,500 leaders from state and local governments, private companies, and universities, according to its website.Democratic members of Congress also attended and participated in events about how the U.S. is working to meet the goals of the Paris agreement but they are also listed as part of the official delegation.The "We Are Still In" coalition is working to show the international community that America as a whole is still committed to mitigating global warming, even if the federal government isn't.Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg and California Governor Jerry Brown announced a report showing the impact of climate action by state and local governments and they plan to present a citizen petition of support for the Paris Agreement this week.In total 20 states, 110 cities, and over 1,400 business from the U.S. have adopted targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, according to their report.America's climate leaders, representing 130 million people and $6.2 trillion in US GDP, are at #COP23 to show the world that #WeAreStillin pic.twitter.com/TCC77sb08C We Are Still In (@wearestillin) November 6, 2017 Rhode Island Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democrat, said no Republicans joined them, even though they had plenty of notice about the trip."The death grip of the fossil fuel industry on the Republican party precludes their participation in events like this without dire consequences to them and so therefore regrettably we are not a bipartisan delegation," Whitehouse said on a call with reporters.Sen. Ben Cardin said Republicans are interested in their conversations at the summit and he will be reporting back to his colleagues on the foreign relations committee.Most of the elected officials in the unofficial delegation are Democrats but there is at least one Republican, Mayor Jim Brainard of Carmel, Indiana.One concern: Will the U.S. be left behind?One reason members of the alternative American delegation said they felt it was important to attend was so the U.S. wouldn't be left behind as other countries continue to work together on climate issues.Chinese President Xi Jinping recently got a standing ovation for saying the world must act on climate change in his speech at an economic conference for Asian countries.Trump did not mention the issue of climate change in his speech at the same event.One of the questions being discussed at COP23 is whether developing countries have to follow the same timelines as the rest of the world an issue particularly important for the U.S. as it seeks to hold countries like China and India accountable for their share of greenhouse gas emissions."One of our concerns is that China may very well have a bigger role to play here at COP23 as a result of the United States not being as focused on this conference as we should be because of President Trump's comments," Sen. Ben Cardin, D-Md., said on a call with reporters last week.There have also been questions about whether the U.S. is becoming more isolated after the delegation from Syria announced at the summit last week that they would sign on to the agreement, leaving the U.S. the only country opposed to the deal.Nauert denied that this left the U.S. isolated, calling it "ironic" that Syria would say it cares about climate and carbon dioxide emissions."If the Government of Syria cared so much about what was put in the air, then it wouldn't be gassing its own people," Nauert said, referencing the regime's chemical gas attacks that have killed dozens of civilians in Syria, according to the UN.But Trump's stance on the issue is having an effect on the world stage.French President Emmanuel Macron is hosting a climate summit in December with 100 world leaders.French authorities told the Associated Press that President Trump is not invited, saying the leaders invited are "especially committed" to the Paris agreement.An invitation will be sent to the U.S. "at a diplomatic level," the official told the AP, but a State Dept.official did not respond when asked if the U.S. would send a delegation to that summit.Leaders from Canada and Mexico released a joint statement from North American climate leaders on Monday, saying they will work with a coalition of U.S. governors.The statement did not mention the U.S. federal government.The statement says the organizers plan a dialogue between the invited leaders and will discuss their shared goals at a summit in California in September.Canada's environmental minister posted a photo with California Gov.Jerry Brown and Washington Gov.Jay Inslee at the announcement.The US Climate Alliance is a bi-partisan coalition of states committed to implementing the goals of the #ParisAgreement.Proud to be working with this committed group of Americans on #ClimateAction #COP23 pic.twitter.com/oTtUXdPMMg Catherine McKenna (@cathmckenna) November 13, 2017 More high-ranking officials are expected to attend the summit this week for negotiations about how the Paris agreement will be implemented.ABC News' Jordyn Phelps contributed to this report.

Barack Obama's running mate.If he chooses to run in 2020, Biden will be 77 on Election Day.Asked today by NBC News whether his age would be a problem for voters if he mounts a 2020 campaign, Biden said, "I think it's a legitimate issue for people to raise.""I think people have a right to ask about your age, your health," he added."I think if anyone were to run for president, you should fully disclose your medical records."Since leaving the White House, Biden has launched the Biden Foundation the political action committee American Possibilities.He has also been a strong critic of President Donald Trump."I do think there's things that [Trump is] doing well," Biden said."It's more the tone of this administration that bothers me."

WH waits to see if Roy Moore allegations are true Video:::::Transcript for WH waits to see if Roy Moore allegations are true Does get more on this now from our chief political analyst Matthew Dowd also Megan McCain here.From the view and and Melanie began with this these Roy Moore allegations really seem to split the Republican Party.Some senators are now saying they believe the weight of evidence goes against.Roy Moore but that may be seen to be in a damned if you do damned if you don't.Situation with the senate candidate.Well the problem they have is that they have to pick between winning a race and principals in the course of this in my feeling about this is that default position ought to be believed the women.There is never bad incident where multiple women came forward accused a powerful man that turned out to be not.True in this so I think there's two options left for Republicans they can either support or write in candidate.Or support the Democrat Doug Jones in this race because at this point in time there is no way it looks like.Roy Moore is gonna get out erase those are the only two options push for a write in.Or support the Democrat Megan doesn't say much but for the majority of the party is going right now on this could cause a big problem for Republicans going miniatures elections but to women voters.A 100% but I also think what's fascinating about this is Brian Moore is a Steve Bannon pay for Brad tried and true.And if this sends up sort of blowing up in our face and by some miracle he doesn't end up becoming a senator.It really puts silver bullet into these candidates than T ban is putting up across the country.And we'll say the Republican Party has won the problem in general right now in this certainly isn't helping things.When you're talking about the difference between a fourteen year old a sixteen year old the age of consent.To say this isn't the messaging we should be on right here they didn't generally gave high school students and yet registered it's disgusting obviously and I think all women especially your young conservative woman he should be worried about the kind of messaging that sent across the country especially given the climate we're in right now.Let me just say four women on the record.Thirty off the record this isn't a witch hunt from the liberal need to get this is something we're gonna have to deal wet and I think that.It's it's unfortunate for people like Matt and I really just want to see good candidates be put into place and unfortunately when you care just about populism in about winning the primary.Not so much about winning the general this is where rap.This problem is not going way meantime are yours have those comments from the president about Vladimir Putin.Over the weekend as this in this movie we raise so many questions.Because the presence as well wait I don't just believe could have believed he believes it but is intelligence agencies say.Kuhn ordered the meddling in the election.Well it's like down trumpet a dating site and has a relationship of food you have to check it's complicated.I mean he's in a serious situation here because he's got all these accusations here domestically.He wants it seems like he wants to believe Vladimir Putin over any of its intelligence agencies in the course of this.I think he's in a very difficult pot spot and I think it's very concerning it that Donald Trump seems much more.Friendly with authoritarian people around the world than people that actually support human rights.OK Matthew diamond can thank you both very much.This transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.

New woman accuses Roy Moore of sexual assault:::::Former Alabama Chief Justice Roy Moore faces new allegations of sexual assault today, after a woman came forward to accuse Moore, the Republican nominee in the states special Senate election next month, of sexually assaulting her in his car when she was a minor.Interested in Roy Moore?Add Roy Moore as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Roy Moore news, video, and analysis from ABC News.Add Interest Beverly Young Nelson said she met Moore when she was 15 years old while she waited tables at a restaurant in Gadsen, Alabama.The future judge acted in a flirtatious manner and even signed her yearbook Merry Christmas and Love, Roy Moore, D.A, she claimed.A short time later, after she turned 16, she said, Moore offered to give her a ride home after work one night.Instead, she said, he parked his car next to a dumpster behind the restaurant and sexually assaulted her.Mr. Moore reached over and began groping me, putting his hands on my breasts, Young Nelson alleged.I tried to open my car door to leave, but he reached over and locked it so I could not get out.I tried fighting him off, while yelling at him to stop, but instead of stopping, he began squeezing my neck, attempting to force my head onto his crotch.Young Nelson, who said she voted for Donald Trump for president, claimed Moores chokehold left her neck black and purple.Bill Clark/CQ-Roll Call,Inc./Getty Images I continued to struggle.I was determined that I was not going to allow him to force me to have sex with him.I was terrified.He was also trying to pull my shirt off.I thought that he was going to rape me.I was twisting and struggling and begging him to stop.I had tears running down my face, she said.She continued, At some point he gave up.He then looked at me and said, You are a child.I am the district attorney of Etowah County.If you tell anyone about this, no one will believe you.Moores campaign is denying the latest charges, which builds on allegations first reported by The Washington Post last week, including a claim by a woman that Moore engaged in sexual activity with her when she was 14 and he was in his 30s.Weve said this before, and well say it again: Judge Moore is an innocent man and has never had any sexual misconduct with anyone, Moore campaign Chairman Bill Armistead said.This is a witch hunt against a man who has had an impeccable career for over 30 years and has always been known as a man of high character.Moore briefly addressed the allegations on Monday night, calling the claims "absolutely false.""I never did what she said I did.I dont even know the woman," he said.Moores Democratic opponent, Doug Jones, responded to the developments through his campaign.We applaud the courage of these women.Roy Moore will be held accountable by the people of Alabama for his actions, his campaign said.The special election, to fill the Senate seat vacated by Attorney General Jeff Sessions, is scheduled Dec. 12.Several prominent Republican lawmakers, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, have called on Moore to drop out of the race.
Parliament to get binding vote on final Brexit deal:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Davis: Parliament will be given time to debate, scrutinise and vote on the final deal with the EU Parliament is to be given a take-it-or leave-it vote on the final Brexit deal before the UK leaves the EU.Brexit Secretary David Davis said the terms of the UK's exit, such as money, citizen rights and any transition must become law via a new Act of Parliament.Labour welcomed a "climbdown" but some MPs warned of a "sham" if ministers could not be asked to renegotiate.Sources have told the BBC some Tory rebels were unimpressed, with one saying the promise was "meaningless".BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said the announcement was significant because it represented a big concession to potential Tory rebels and Labour MPs at a highly important moment in the Brexit process.It comes as MPs prepare to debate key Brexit legislation later this week with the government facing possible defeat on aspects of the EU Withdrawal Bill, which will convert EU law into UK law.The UK is due to leave the EU in March 2019, irrespective of whether MPs back or reject the terms of the deal negotiated by Theresa May's government.But updating MPs on the sixth round of talks which concluded on Friday, Mr Davis told MPs they would still play a major role and "there cannot be any doubt that Parliament will be intimately involved at every stage".The government had previously agreed to give MPs and peers a vote on a Commons motion relating to the final Brexit deal - before it has been voted upon by the European Parliament.Analysis Image copyright AFP By Laura Kuenssberg, BBC political editor A confident government wouldn't have conceded like this the day before the Brexit debate was due to come back to the Commons in earnest.This climbdown does not remotely mean that other grievances over the existing Brexit legislation will disappear.It doesn't mean that the next few weeks will suddenly become plain sailing.And if there isn't a withdrawal deal with the rest of the EU, well, then there can't be a bill that covers the withdrawal bill.It's only in the coming days that the government will know if they have done enough to get the existing plans through.And the move also of course adds to a massive load of complicated Parliamentary business that has to be cleared before we actually leave.Mr Davis said he still "intended and expected" this to happen but went further - agreeing to Labour and Tory MPs' demands for any vote to take place on substantive primary legislation, which would allow MPs and peers to amend the bill before it became law.The bill, he told MPs, would contain the contents of the withdrawal agreement that the UK hopes to seal in time ahead of its scheduled departure and all key aspects of it - such as the financial settlement between the two sides, the future status of UK and EU citizens and the terms of any implementation period."This means that Parliament will be given time to scrutinise, debate and vote on the final deal we strike with the EU," he said, adding that it was not clear when such a bill would be published.Labour's Keir Starmer said it was a "significant climbdown from a weak government on the verge of defeat"."With less than 24 hours before they had to defend their flawed bill to Parliament, they have finally backed down," the shadow Brexit secretary said."However, like everything with this government, the devil will be in the detail."Labour's Chris Leslie said what "could have been a very welcome concession instead looks like a sham that pretends to respect the sovereignty of Parliament but falls well short of what is required".The Lib Dems reiterated their call for the final deal to be put to a referendum while several Tory MPs questioned what would happen if a deal was only agreed at the last minute before the 29 March deadline - a scenario Mr Davis has suggested was conceivable - and MPs could only vote after exit.Dominic Grieve, the Conservative former Attorney General, said this would not be acceptable and if time ran out then negotiations with the EU should be extended "so all parties are able to deal with it".And Conservative MP Antoinette Sandbach pressed Mr Davis to reassure MPs how "if the bill intended to ensure a meaningful vote only comes forward after that date, the vote is in any sense meaningful".Mr Davis responded by saying MPs would have the opportunity to say "either you want the deal or you don't want it" and if the UK and EU could not agree a deal, there would be no legislation.But, in a meeting with the Conservative chief whip, a group of about a dozen Tory MPs expressed anger at the government's plans, sources have told the BBC.One of the MPs, Anna Soubry, said the idea of a Brexit Act of Parliament was "'insulting it sounds in theory very good but there's no guarantee".She suggested that the promise was "meaningless" and that the government is in "grave difficulty" over passing its Brexit legislation in the coming months.
Theresa May accuses Vladimir Putin of election meddling:::::Image copyright PA Image caption The prime minister said a "global Britain" would continue to exert its influence around the world Theresa May has launched her strongest attack on Russia yet, accusing Moscow of meddling in elections and carrying out cyber espionage.Speaking at the Lord Mayor's banquet in London, the prime minister said Vladimir Putin's government was trying to "undermine free societies".Mrs May said they were "planting fake stories" to "sow discord in the West".But, she added, whilst the UK did not want "perpetual confrontation" with Russia, it would protect its interests.Her comments are in stark contrast to those of US President Donald Trump, who last week said he believed President Putin's denial of intervening in the 2016 presidential election.Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson is due to visit Russia next month.In a major foreign policy speech at Mansion House in London, Mrs May described as a "very simple message" for President Putin, she said he must choose a very "different path" from the one that in recent years had seen Moscow annex Crimea, foment conflict in Ukraine and launch cyber attacks on governments and Parliaments across Europe.Russia could be a valuable partner of the West but only if it "plays by the rules", she argued."Russia has repeatedly violated the national airspace of several European countries and mounted a sustained campaign of cyber espionage and disruption."This has included meddling in elections and hacking the Danish Ministry of Defence and the Bundestag among many others."Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption What Boris Johnson told MPs about Russian meddling in UK elections "We know what you are doing and you will not succeed.Because you underestimate the resilience of our democracies, the enduring attraction of free and open societies and the commitment of Western nations to the alliances that bind us."She said as the UK left the EU and charted a new course in the world, it remained absolutely committed to Nato and securing a Brexit deal which "strengthens our liberal values", adding that a strong economic partnership between the UK and EU would be a bulwark against Russian agitation in Europe.Mr Johnson, who will be making his first trip to Russia since becoming foreign secretary in December, has said the UK's policy to Russia must be one of "beware but engage" following a decade of strained relations.He told MPs earlier this month that he had not seen any evidence of Russia trying to interfere in British elections or the 2016 Brexit vote, in which Moscow has insisted it remained neutral."We will take the necessary action to counter Russian activity," Mrs May added."But this is not where we want to be and not the relationship with Russia we want."We do not want to return to the Cold War or to be in a state of perpetual confrontation."As a permanent member of the UN Security Council, Russia has the reach and the responsibility to play a vital role in promoting international stability."Russia can, and I hope one day will, choose this different path.But for as long as Russia does not, we will act together to protect our interests and the international order on which they depend."In her speech, she also said the authorities in Myanmar - formerly known as Burma - must take "full responsibility" for what "looked like ethnic cleansing" of the Rohingya people in Rakhine province.Responding to Mrs May's speech, former Labour cabinet minister Ben Bradshaw - who has been raising the issue of Russian interference in UK elections for nearly a year - tweeted: "Asking why May suddenly acknowledging Russian interference now having stonewalled for months."
Heads complain of having to ask parents for school funds:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Schools say they have had to ask parents for money because of funding shortages Head teachers representing more than 5,000 schools across England are supporting a protest letter to the chancellor over "inadequate" funding.The letter, being delivered to Downing Street, warns of schools increasingly having to make "desperate requests to parents for 'voluntary' donations".Heads are calling for an extra 1.7bn per year for schools.The government has already moved 1.3bn of education funding directly into school budgets.The protest, ahead of next week's Budget, has been organised by regional groups of head teachers representing schools with 3.5 million pupils in 25 local authorities from Cornwall to Cumbria.It follows a letter warning about funding cuts, sent to the parents of more than 2.5 million pupils in September.This is the biggest collective protest so far from the school funding campaigners, who have been warning of an overall lack of investment and a failure to resolve differences in levels of per pupil spending.Funding differences "It is extraordinary that some English secondary schools will receive 60% less funding than others of the same size," says the letter to Chancellor Philip Hammond."The impact on class sizes, curriculum offer and staffing is obvious," the heads write."A school receiving over 4m more than another could, for example, afford 133 more teachers."Image caption West Sussex head Jules White co-ordinated a funding warning sent to 2.5 million families The government has recognised the regional anomalies in funding and published a new national funding formula.But the heads argue that changes in how funding is allocated will depend on there being enough overall money in the system.Despite the promise to move 1.3bn from the Department for Education's budget directly into school spending, the heads say they will still have faced a real-terms cut of 1.7bn between 2015 and 2020.Without this 1.7bn being restored, heads are warning the chancellor: they will not be able to afford to recruit teachers class sizes will rise subjects will have to be withdrawn sixth forms could close special needs pupils will not get the support they need The government has said that it has taken significant steps towards resolving funding inequalities.The National Funding Formula "has been widely welcomed and will put an end to the historic disparities in the system", a Department for Education has said about the heads' funding protests."As the independent Institute for Fiscal Studies has confirmed, overall schools funding is being protected at a national level in real terms per pupil over the next two years."Our formula will provide significant gains for under-funded schools of up to 3% per pupil in 2018-19 and a further 3% in 2019-20."
NI budget reveals health spend increase:::::Image caption A lack of devolution at Stormont means the budget will be passed into law using Westminister legislation Northern Ireland's budget for 2017/18 has been published and shows an increase in health spending of 5.4%.The bill has gone through the House of Commons, backed by all parties without a vote.It will go to the House of Lords on Tuesday.NI Secretary James Brokenshire said that public services would begin to run out of money if a budget was not in place by the end of November.He said he regretted having to bring a budget to Westminster but was hopeful an executive could be formed.Northern Ireland has been without a Stormont executive for 10 months.'Utmost reluctance' Speaking in the House of Commons, Mr Brokenshire said the passing of budget legislation "should not be a barrier to to negotiations to continue, but the ongoing lack of agreement has had tangible consequences for people and public services in Northern Ireland".Faced by DUP calls for the immediate appointment of direct-rule ministers, the secretary of state said: "That is a step that I do not intend to take while there is an opportunity for an executive to be formed."He continued: "This measure I am taking today with the utmost reluctance and only because there is no other option available."It comes after the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and Sinn Fin failed to reach a deal in political talks.Overall, the amount of money available for day-to-day spending is up by 3.2%, meaning no real increase when inflation is considered.Analysis: Julian O'Neill, BBC News NI business correspondent Better late than never, Northern Ireland finally has a budget for the 2017-18 financial year.It means a cliff-edge of running out of cash has been avoided.Civil servants have been controlling the finances since the executive collapsed before a budget was set.Overall, the allocation for day-to-day spending is up by 3.2%, or about 330m, on 2016-17.However, because of inflation, the budget has really flat-lined in real terms.The budget does not include any of the 1bn windfall that the DUP extracted for propping up the Conservative government; that is to come separately.In April, indicative figures suggested the education budget would be cut, causing an outcry from teachers and parents.However, the education budget is up by 1.5% compared to last year, the justice budget is down by 0.4% and the agriculture and environment budget is down by 3%.Image copyright Getty Images Health economists usually estimate that health service spending needs to rise by an annual rate of 3% - 5% to cope with rising demand.The Department of Finance has cautioned that the budget is not fully comparable to the 2016/17 budget, due to timing differences.The 2016/17 budget was published before the start of the financial year while this budget comes mid-year and includes in-year reallocations.Analysis: Mark Devenport, BBC News NI political editor Is this direct rule or not direct rule?It depends who you talk to.The SDLP says it is direct rule, and blames the DUP and Sinn Fin.The Alliance party says it is a "slippery slope" towards direct rule, but both James Brokenshire and Theresa May dismiss that.Mr Brokenshire is fearful of "full-fat" direct rule because it would be very hard to get back out of it.He might, therefore, try and get away with this halfway house solution, at least until the end of the year.DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds welcomed the budget move as the "right thing" to do in the absence of a deal to restore devolution.He said the decision by the secretary of state is "not full blown direct rule".The North Belfast MP also said that if a deal is not forthcoming to restore devolution, direct rule ministers of "some ilk will have to be appointed".He said the failure to restore power sharing rests with Sinn Fin and that the DUP and other parties were ready to set up an executive "in the morning".He added that the 1bn promised by the government for Northern Ireland as part of the Tory-DUP confidence and supply arrangement would be "detailed in the coming days".Image copyright Press Eye Image caption NI Secretary James Brokenshire said a budget is needed in the absence of a devolved government However, Sinn Fin's Stormont leader said the reason for the budget was "DUP opposition to a rights-based society".Michelle O'Neill said that the UK government had been "complicit in this, backing the DUP's refusal to honour the commitments previously made and blocking the delivery of equality."'Significant day' She also said her party had told Prime Minister Theresa May that direct rule was "not an option"."These issues aren't going away.It is now the responsibility of the two governments to look to the provisions of the Good Friday Agreement and for a British-Irish intergovernmental conference to meet as soon as possible."We have sought urgent meetings with both the taoiseach [Irish prime minister] and the British prime minister."The way forward now is for the two governments to fulfil their responsibility as co-guarantors of the Good Friday and St Andrews Agreements, to honour outstanding commitments, and to deliver rights enjoyed by everyone else on these islands to people here."Mr Brokenshire has said he would be willing to withdraw the budget bill if an executive is formed before December.SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said it was a "significant day" with "decisions being taken in London which should have been taken in Belfast"."This is British direct rule, delivered by the DUP and Sinn Fin," he added.'Out of date' Ulster Unionist Steve Aiken said: "We need to have executive ministers in place in January at the absolute latest because we need to get policy decisions made so we can shape the 18-19 budget for everybody in Northern Ireland - if we don't do that we're in real danger."Alliance Party leader Naomi Long said the budget "doesn't redirect money to where it's needed now, it simply disperses the money on the basis of decisions that were taken by the last executive and that's now quite considerably out of date".In a call to the DUP and Sinn Fin on Friday, Prime Minister Theresa May told the parties that Monday's budget bill was "absolutely not an indication of direct rule".Sinn Fin President Gerry Adams said he told the prime minister that direct rule was not an option and called for the establishment of an intergovernmental conference involving London and Dublin.
Emma Dent Coad MP accused of writing 'racist' blog post:::::Image copyright PA Image caption Emma Dent Coad has been accused of writing a "racist" article in a 2010 blog piece A Conservative London Assembly member has accused a Labour MP of writing a "racist" article about him before she entered Parliament.Emma Dent Coad wrote a blog piece in 2010 in which she labelled Shaun Bailey a "token ghetto boy".Mr Bailey said the MP should apologise for the "hate-filled, racist article".A spokesman for Ms Dent Coat, who was elected to Kensington in June, said she had been quoting Mr Bailey's "own comments about parts of the borough".Image copyright PA Image caption In the article Ms Dent Coad called Shaun Bailey the "'token ghetto boy' standing behind D Cameron" In the piece Ms Dent Coad claimed Mr Bailey, who was a parliamentary candidate for Hammersmith, had "stigmatised" the area he was born in by referring to it as a "ghetto"."Who can say where this man will ever fit in, however hard he tries?One day he is the 'token ghetto boy' standing behind D Cameron, the next 'looking interested' beside G Osborne.Ever felt used?," she wrote.After the blog post was highlighted, Mr Bailey said he had never been "labelled a 'token ghetto boy'" before and was "shocked and saddened" by the article.He said Ms Dent Coad's "use of language should not be acceptable for an elected politician... and she should be ashamed", he said."I am proud of where I am from and would certainly not use language like ghetto in a way to disparage the area I grew up in," the London Assembly member said.Ms Dent Coad's spokesman said it was clear in the original post she had been quoting Mr Bailey's "own comments... plus those of his Conservative colleagues on Kensington and Chelsea Council".
Carl Sargeant: 'Hanging' cause of ex-minister's death:::::Image caption Carl Sargeant was found dead after an investigation was launched into his conduct Sacked Welsh Labour minister Carl Sargeant's provisional cause of death was hanging, an inquest has heard.The 49-year-old married father-of-two, who had been Alyn and Deeside AM since 2003, was found dead at his home in Connah's Quay, Flintshire, on Tuesday.He was found four days after being sacked from his job as cabinet secretary for communities and children.At the opening of his inquest, coroner John Gittins said it was "an apparent act of self harm".Mr Gittins added he would carefully examine "the steps taken by the assembly to have regard to Mr Sargeant's mental welfare prior to his death".The inquest in Ruthin, Denbighshire, was told Mr Sargeant was found on the floor of the utility room by his wife Bernadette.Family members attempted to resuscitate him before paramedics arrived and continued those efforts, but the former minister was pronounced dead about 30 minutes later.Mr Sargeant was facing a party investigation into claims about inappropriate personal conduct and was suspended from the Welsh Labour Party prior to his death.He was removed from his role amid allegations he had "touched or groped" a number of women.Mr Gittins, coroner for North Wales East and Central, said the inquest would not consider the veracity of the allegations made against Mr Sargeant, nor would he be "looking to Cardiff and the Welsh Assembly or the Labour Party" about who was right or wrong and who could be trusted.He said he would be seeking statements from First Minister Carwyn Jones and possibly others at the Welsh Assembly in the coming weeks, but was not in a position to say whether Mr Jones would be called to give evidence.No date has been fixed for the full hearing as the coroner said a separate independent inquiry could have an impact on his responsibility to compile a prevention of future deaths report.He ended by assuring Mr Sargeant's family, friends and colleagues that "there will be a full and fair examination of the matters which are relevant to my investigation and that I shall not allow the inquest to be a trial by press, politics or personality".Image caption North Wales Police was called to Mr Sargeant's home after he was found on the floor by his wife Mr Sargeant's family called him "the glue that bound us together" and said they were "devastated beyond words".Mr Jones said he was "shocked and deeply saddened" and paid tribute to "a friend as well as a colleague".Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said Mr Sargeant's death was "deeply shocking news" while Prime Minister Theresa May said her "heart goes out to Carl Sargeant's friends and family".Mr Jones sacked Mr Sargeant from his frontbench after the first minister learned of a number of alleged incidents involving women.There will be an independent inquiry into how Mr Jones handled the case.Meanwhile, fresh claims about bullying in the Welsh Government have been made by a former adviser to Mr Jones.Steve Jones said he agreed with former cabinet minister Leighton Andrews, who has described a "toxic" atmosphere at the top of the administration.For support, Samaritans are available 24 hours a day on 116 123 in the UK and Republic of Ireland.
Universal credit callers face five minutes on hold:::::Image copyright Getty Images There has been a sharp increase in the average amount of time people have been waiting for their calls to universal credit helplines to be answered.New figures show callers to the helpline for the full service waited over five minutes in September - up from 1 minute 41 seconds in May 2017.Labour said the long waiting times were evidence of a "terrible service".The government has promised to make the calls free within weeks after criticism of the use of 0345 numbers.Calls to 0345 numbers cost up to 45p a minute from mobiles and 12p a minute from landlines, although they are included if someone has an inclusive calls package.The government does not make any money from the phone charges, as the money goes to the phone providers.Universal credit rolls six working-age benefits into one single payment.But the scheme has come under fire from charities, campaigners and politicians in recent months, as its nationwide roll-out speeds up.Critics have accused it of pushing families and individuals into poverty as claimants have to wait six weeks for their first payment and overall payments decrease.In some areas, the full service has already been rolled out to everyone, while in the rest of the country, a 'live' service is available to certain people like single jobseekers.Data obtained by the BBC using the Freedom of Information Act reveals: People trying to ring the helpline for the full universal credit service in September had to wait more than three times as long for their calls to be answered as they did in May, up from 1min 41sec to 5min 17sec Claimants calling the 'live' line waited an average of 6min 32sec in September this year, up from 1min 44sec in August 2015 Only 84% of calls were answered at all in September, down from 92% in May, suggesting callers are increasingly putting the phone down before they are answered, as the waiting times increase Frank Field MP, chairman of the House of Commons Work and Pensions Select Committee, said the new figures reveal "the full scale of the human wreckage that was created by this rip-off operation".In October the government announced it would scrap call charges to Universal credit helplines within a month after a backlash from the opposition and some Conservative Party MPs.But these figures shed new light on how much claimants may have been spending on phone calls up until now, which include urgent requests for advance payments, fixing problems with their claims and reporting changes to employment status.The Department for Work and Pensions confirmed to the BBC that charges begin as soon as a customer joins the call queue, rather than when a member of staff answers.Given that 'live' service customers were on the phone for an average of 7min 20sec once their call was answered in September, those waiting the average time for their calls to be answered could have been paying up to 7.63 for just one call, with 3.59 of this spent before the claimant had spoken to anyone.A total of 743,435 calls were made to both helplines in September alone, 624,980 of which were answered.There were 694,410 calls in May this year and 638,011 were answered.As the full service has been rolled out across the UK there has been a dramatic increase in the number of calls made, up from 195,783 in September 2015.Debbie Abrahams MP, the shadow work and pensions secretary, said it was an "absolute disgrace" that people looking for support had to put up with "such terrible service".A DWP spokesperson said: "99% of people who apply for universal credit do so online and our work coaches stand ready to support anyone who needs extra help with their claim."When people do call the helpline it is at a local rate which is free for many people as part of their call package and will be made completely free later this month."
EU business leaders press Theresa May for Brexit deal:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The CBI chief says business wants the UK and Europe to speed up Brexit negotiations European and UK business leaders have told Prime Minister Theresa May of their Brexit concerns.At a meeting in Downing Street on Monday, representatives from groups including the CBI and BusinessEurope pressed for a transitional deal that preserves the status quo after Brexit.The CBI chief, Carolyn Fairbairn, said all those at the meeting reiterated the damage "no deal" would do to trade.A German lobby group also warned that no deal would cost their economy dear.The head of the German chambers of commerce, Martin Wansleben, told a newspaper the car industry alone would face annual tariffs of more than 2bn if trade between the UK and the EU falls under World Trade Organisation rules.Emma Marcegaglia, president of BusinessEurope, said: "Business is extremely concerned with the slow pace of negotiations and the lack of progress only one month before the decisive December European Council."Business aims to avoid a cliff edge and therefore asks for a 'status quo-like' transitional arrangement with the UK staying in the customs union and the single market, as this will best provide citizens and businesses with greater certainty."Image copyright Getty Images The business groups met Mrs May at No 10, as well as Business Secretary Greg Clark, Brexit Secretary David Davis and the Economic Secretary to the Treasury, Stephen Barclay.The CBI and the Institute of Directors were represented, along with business organisations from France, Germany, Spain, Italy, the Netherlands, Ireland, Sweden, Poland, the Czech Republic and Belgium.There are concerns that future trade talks could collapse ahead of December's EU summit.EU chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, has warned that the talks will only go ahead if the UK first clarifies its financial obligations to the EU.Mr Davis has said the UK was "ready and willing" to engage with Brussels "as often and as quickly as needed".Growing urgency Earlier, Ms Fairbairn, CBI director-general, told the BBC a CBI survey found that 10% of companies had already activated their contingency plans.The pace of planning by firms was picking up, she added, with about 60% of companies saying they would implement contingency plans by the end of next March.Bernard Spitz, a director of Medef, France's biggest business lobby group, said agreement on a transition deal was important for both UK companies as well as those "across the European Union"."We know that for us, especially for the French, the relationship with the UK is absolutely key, but if business continuity is important, what is even more important is the integrity of the European market," he said.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Michel Barnier has warned of the possible collapse of Brexit talks Property developer Richard Tice, co-founder of Leave Means Leave, said if a trade deal appeared unlikely, "then actually we would be better to give certainty to everybody that actually we're going to do a different type of deal which is to go to WTO [World Trade Organization rules]".BBC business editor Simon Jack says some UK business leaders in favour of Brexit are concerned that a transition period maintaining the current arrangements will delay and frustrate Britain's attempts to strike new independent deals.
European Union gives impetus to joint defence plan:::::Image copyright AFP Image caption Latvian troops: The Baltic states near Russia are committed to the EU plan Most of the European Union's member states have signed up to a plan for closer defence co-operation.The UK and Republic of Ireland are among five states not participating.The other 23 are now committed to the permanent structured military co-operation ("Pesco") plan to boost their defence budgets and joint capabilities.EU forces have gone to some hotspots, including the Central African Republic and Kosovo.But in some cases they have been short of funding and equipment.Under Pesco, each country has to provide a plan for national contributions.The participants will be backed by a European Defence Fund that should be worth 5bn (4.5bn; $5.8bn) annually after 2020.The money will be used for weapons research and equipment purchases.Image copyright AFP Image caption An EU force went to help stabilise the troubled Central African Republic Deployment decisions would remain in the hands of national governments, an EU Council statement said.And Pesco does not replace member states' participation in Nato or UN missions.No 'European army' Jonathan Marcus - BBC defence correspondent This agreement takes formal defence co-operation in the European Union to a new level.Britain, one of Europe's most significant military players - and the one most sceptical about parallel EU defence structures to Nato - has not signed up since it is on the way out of the EU.Opponents of the EU in Britain will seize upon this as yet another step towards a "European army".This is about increased investment in defence and developing common military capabilities.There is no "European army", in the same sense that there is actually no "Nato army", it simply means that national military capabilities that exercise together can be brought under a single command at a time of crisis.Indeed deploying troops "into harm's way" is the ultimate exercise of national sovereignty and it is likely to remain jealously guarded.And better military capabilities for EU nations should clearly mean better capabilities for Nato too.UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said the UK saw promise in Pesco and pledged to be "supportive" from the outside."We are there, like a flying buttress to support the cathedral," he told reporters.US President Donald Trump has urged America's European Nato allies to spend more on their own defence, arguing that they rely too much on US protection.Russia's military intervention in Ukraine in 2014 alarmed EU members that were once part of the Russian-dominated Soviet bloc.Russia accuses the EU and Nato of unfriendly and threatening expansion up to its borders.
Brexit: Labour says 'very many' Tories share EU bill concerns:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Keir Starmer tells Today a government that can't reach a deal on anything doesn't deserve to continue Labour is planning to team up with Conservative rebels to change the government's key Brexit bill when it returns to the House of Commons.The opposition wants to ensure the European Court of Justice still has a role during the transitional period planned after March 2019.Its Brexit spokesman Keir Starmer claimed "very many" Tory MPs shared his concerns.But the Conservatives hit back, saying Labour was "confused" on Brexit.The EU Withdrawal Bill is crucial to the government's strategy for leaving the EU.EU law that currently applies in the UK will be "cut and pasted" on to the UK's statute book in an attempt to ensure a smooth transition on Brexit day.The bill returns to the House of Commons on Tuesday when it faces hundreds of attempts by MPs to change its wording.BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said the government "knows it's going to have to compromise", with concerns being raised about the draft legislation by MPs across the party divide.Setting out his party's plans, Sir Keir said it was "crunch time" for the bill.He said the legislation's current wording prevented the European Court of Justice from having a role as the UK transitions to its final Brexit arrangements.This would make it difficult to stay in organisations like the European Medicines Agency, he said.Labour's "very simple amendment" would "correct that flaw" he said, adding that his party was doing this "in the national interest".Asked if he was confident of getting the amendment through, Sir Keir said "there are very many Conservatives who are concerned about this".The government has vowed to end the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice in the UK.Sir Keir said the long-term relationship with the ECJ was "a matter for negotiation" and that its jurisdiction "would have to change" but said making it a red line had been a mistake.It was "blatantly obvious" that the final agreement would not be in place by March 2019 - when the UK leaves - he said, adding that this made the transition deal vital.But Tory MP Chris Philp dismissed his claims, saying: "Labour are so confused on Brexit, they've set out 10 different policies on it since the EU referendum."Only the Conservatives have a plan that will ensure that a smooth and orderly Brexit sees our legal system functioning on day one - the only thing Labour policy would ensure is legal chaos."Ahead of the return of the EU bill, Brexit Secretary David Davis will update MPs on the progress of negotiations later on Monday.
Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe case: Diplomatic protection 'one option':::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe's husband tells Today he doesn't think Boris Johnson should resign Offering a British-Iranian mother in prison in Iran diplomatic protection is "one of the options" being considered in the case, Downing Street has said.Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe was arrested during a visit to Iran in April 2016 and accused of trying to overthrow the regime there - a charge she denies.Her husband Richard Ratcliffe has criticised the UK's response and said it could offer diplomatic protection.Number 10 said it was working to find the "most beneficial" course of action.In a phone call, Mr Ratcliffe asked Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson to consider diplomatic protection for his wife, which under international law is a way for a state to take diplomatic action on behalf of a national.Taking such a measure would effectively escalate the case from an individual consular matter to a formal legal dispute between Britain and Iran, BBC diplomatic correspondent James Landale said.Asked about the possibility, Downing Street said it was an option, adding: "I think what we need to look at is what will work best and what can be most beneficial in this case."The government "will look" at Mr Ratcliffe's comments "very closely" and decide the "best course of action to secure her release", the Number 10 spokesman added.Mr Johnson and fellow cabinet minister Michael Gove have been accused of bungling the UK's handling of the case.The foreign secretary told MPs last week that he believed Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe had been teaching in Iran before she was arrested, while Mr Gove told the BBC he did not know what Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe had been doing in Iran.Her family have always maintained she was on holiday with her daughter.Asked about the government's official position, Downing Street said: "The government's position on this is clear.She was there on holiday.It wasn't for any other purpose."The foreign secretary reiterated that in his conversation with the Iranian foreign minister last week."The spokesman said Prime Minister Theresa May had been involved in Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's case "from the outset" and was treating it as "a priority".She had raised it with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani on at least two occasions, he added.What is 'diplomatic protection'?Image copyright PA Image caption Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe is serving a five-year sentence in Iran By James Landale, BBC diplomatic correspondent When a British citizen is jailed overseas, they normally get basic consular help from the local embassy.This could include anything from contacting family to legal support to medical help.But if the UK were assert its diplomatic protection over a British citizen, that would change things significantly.This would be a signal that the UK is no longer treating the case as a consular matter but a formal, legal dispute between Britain and that country.That's because diplomatic protection is a mechanism under international law that a state can use to help one its nationals whose rights have been breached in another country.The broad legal principle is that British diplomats would no longer be representing the interests of a citizen but the interests of their state.Speaking to Radio 4's Today programme earlier, Mr Ratcliffe said he had written to the Foreign Office following remarks made by Mr Gove.He said Mr Johnson "did promise to consider whether she'll be eligible for diplomatic protection" which "gives a different push" to what the government can do for his wife."I'm reassured that it is the position of the government," Mr Ratcliffe said.Asked about his conversation with Mr Ratcliffe, Mr Johnson told the BBC Foreign Office officials were working "very, very hard" on the case."On Iran - and on consular cases generally - they are all very sensitive and I think the key thing to understand is that we are working very, very hard and intensively and impartially on all those cases," he added.Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe - who has a three-year-old daughter, who is being cared for by family in Iran - was arrested and jailed in Iran in April 2016.The full details of the allegations against her have never been made fully public.But speaking in Westminster on 1 November, Mr Johnson appeared to contradict her own account when he wrongly said she had been training journalists.Four days later, Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was recalled to court in Iran and Mr Johnson's remark cited as evidence against her, prompting fears that her five-year sentence could be extended.Labour have since called for the foreign secretary's resignation, but Mr Ratcliffe has said he believes it is not in his wife's interests for anyone to resign.'Violation of rights' The UK government's policy for dual British nationals arrested abroad, is that UK authorities "won't get involved if someone's arrested in a country for which they hold a valid passport, unless there's a special humanitarian reason to do so".Iran, however, does not recognise dual nationality, and so does not allow consular assistance from the foreign office or the British embassy.Should Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe be granted diplomatic protection, the UK government could make representations at a political and diplomatic level instead.Mr Ratcliffe says a call for his wife's release from the United Nations last month had not been endorsed by government.In October, Jos Antonio Guevara Bermdez, chair-rapporteur of the UN's Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, and Ms Asma Jahangir, special rapporteur on human rights for Iran, called for Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's immediate release.She had been "deprived of her liberty", they said."The UK didn't endorse that call," Mr Ratcliffe said."It hasn't ever acknowledged a violation of her rights, which I find staggering."But he still hopes his family will be reunited by the end of the year."I think the best chance Nazanin has of coming home this side of Christmas is all of the weight of the Foreign Office and the foreign secretary being focused on doing that," he said.
Nicola Sturgeon set for Downing Street talks with Theresa May:::::Image caption Theresa May and Nicola Sturgeon have not held formal face-to-face talks since March Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon is to meet Prime Minister Theresa May for talks in London on Tuesday.The SNP leader will travel to Downing Street for her first face-to-face talks with the prime minister since March.Mrs May indicated earlier in the year that she wanted to speak to Ms Sturgeon in a bid to break the deadlock between the two governments over Brexit.It is thought they will also discuss the upcoming UK budget and concerns about sexual harassment in politics.The talks come as MPs consider amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill, a key piece of Brexit legislation which is at the heart of a dispute between the Scottish and UK governments.The Scottish government is refusing to put the bill forward for legislative consent at the Scottish Parliament unless changes are made to protect devolved competencies as powers return from Brussels post-Brexit.Ms Sturgeon terms current proposals a "power grab" by Westminster, while Mrs May insists the devolved parliaments will gain "significant" responsibilities when the UK leaves the EU.A series of talks between top ministers from the two governments has thus far failed to break the deadlock.A spokeswoman for the Scottish government said Ms Sturgeon would be "seeking clarity" on Brexit and the Withdrawal Bill, as well as other topics.Image copyright PA Image caption Ms Sturgeon has described previous talks with Mrs May as "very frustrating" In September, the first minister said in an interview with New Statesman that prior meetings with Mrs May were "very frustrating", saying she had found it "impossible to get any human connection" with the prime minister.She said: "This is a woman who sits in meetings where it's just the two of you and reads from a script."As well as Brexit, Ms Sturgeon is expected to press her government's economic priorities ahead of Chancellor Philip Hammond's autumn budget on 22 November.Scottish Finance Secretary Derek Mackay, whose own draft budget will follow in December, has written to Mr Hammond urging him to ditch austerity cuts, halt the rollout of Universal Credit and provide more money to Scotland's farmers and railways while exempting the national police and fire services from VAT.And the UK's two most prominent female political leaders are also expected to discuss the issue of sexual harassment and inappropriate behaviour at Westminster and Holyrood, which has seen ministers forced to resign from each of their governments.Defence Secretary Michael Fallon and Scottish early years minister Mark McDonald both left their ministerial posts following complaints about their conduct, and both party leaders have called for better measures to crack down on misconduct and support victims.
Brexit: Environment watchdog planned says Gove:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Some MPs are concerned Brexit poses a risk to UK wildlife and habitats A new environment watchdog to protect UK wildlife, land, water and air once Britain leaves the European Union is being planned by the government.Environment Secretary Michael Gove said the body would hold the powerful to account and deliver a green Brexit.The plans come amid concerns that environmental regulations enshrined in EU law could be lost after Brexit.Mr Gove told the Andrew Marr Show standards would not be sacrificed as part of a potential US free trade deal.Wildlife prioritised Mr Gove wants the watchdog to be independent of government - able to speak its mind freely, he said, with clear legal authority.Writing in The Telegraph, he said the watchdog would have "real bite" but did not outline exact planned powers.He said it was important that environmental enforcement and policymaking remained bound to a clear set of principles once Britain leaves the EU.He added that the watchdog would make a national policy statement to ensure policymakers protect the environment, and remain grounded by rigorous scientific evidence.Speaking to Andrew Marr, Mr Gove rejected suggestions from US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross that the UK may relax its policies to secure an agreement post-Brexit."While we do want a trade deal with the United States, we will not lower environment or animal welfare standards," he said."Free trade is a good thing, but free trade flounders on the rocks of public opinion if it is used as a Trojan horse for lowering environmental standards, so we're not going there."Some MPs are worried Brexit poses a risk to UK wildlife and habitats - with the cross-party Environmental Audit Committee calling for the creation of new environmental protection law.Labour's Mary Creagh, chair of the committee, told BBC News earlier this year: "European law protects huge amounts of the UK's environment, farming and countryside."The government has said the EU Withdrawal Bill - which goes before MPs for debate this week - will incorporate many of these regulations.Supporting British farmers Mr Gove also outlined his vision for British agriculture and wildlife once Britain leaves the EU.Describing British farmers as the "best in the world", he said he wanted to "help support farmers produce food in a sustainable and productive way".Mr Gove told Marr that in the event of a no deal scenario, British food would still be "increasingly in demand worldwide"."The trend overall globally is toward greater quality and British farmers are in the best position to meet that," he added.He also revealed plans to plant 11 million trees over the next decade, and encourage a "wider range of species"."I want the number of birds to increase - particularly farmland birds," he concluded.
EU preparing for possible collapse of Brexit talks:::::Image copyright AFP Image caption Michel Barnier says "everyone needs to plan" for the possible collapse of Brexit negotiations The EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, says he is planning for the possible collapse of Brexit negotiations with the UK.Mr Barnier was talking to French newspaper Le Journal du Dimanche days after giving the UK a two-week deadline to clarify key issues.Failing to reach an agreement was not his preferred option, he stressed.The UK's Brexit Secretary David Davis has said it is time for both sides "to work to find solutions".On Friday, Mr Davis insisted good progress was being made across the board, and that the negotiations had narrowed to a "few outstanding, albeit important, issues".Discussing the likelihood of the talks collapsing, Mr Barnier said: "It's not my option, but it's a possibility.Everyone needs to plan for it, member states and businesses alike.We too are preparing for it technically."A failure of the negotiations would have consequences on multiple domains."Mr Barnier has asked the UK to clarify its stance on its financial obligations to the EU if future trade talks are to go ahead in December.But Mr Davis has made conflicting remarks, suggesting the UK would not have to give a figure for a financial settlement before it could move on to talks about a future trading relationship.Speaking to Sky News on Sunday, he said: "In every negotiation, each side tries to control the timetable.The real deadline on this is, of course, December."Mr Davis was referring to the next EU summit which will take place in Brussels in December.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption David Davis says there cannot be a new border within the UK He said British taxpayers "would not want me to just come along and just give away billions of pounds".He added: "We've been very, very careful, and it's taking time and we will take our time to get to the right answer."His comments followed a sixth round of talks between Mr Davis and Mr Barnier in Brussels.Speaking after the talks on Friday, Mr Davis said any solution for the Irish border could not be at the expense of the constitutional integrity of the UK.
'Bullying and toxicity' in Welsh Government, says ex-aide:::::Fresh claims about bullying in the Welsh Government have been made by a former adviser to Wales' first minister.Steve Jones said he agreed with former cabinet minister Leighton Andrews, who has described a "toxic" atmosphere at the top of the administration.They spoke out following the death of sacked former communities minister Carl Sargeant who was found dead on Tuesday.The Welsh Government said it did not recognise Mr Jones's claims.Mr Sargeant was found dead at home four days after being sacked by First Minister Carwyn Jones over allegations of improper conduct towards women.Before leaving the Welsh Government in September 2014, Steve Jones was a media adviser for the first minister and also worked on his Labour leadership campaign.In a statement, he said he agreed entirely with Mr Andrews's description of "toxicity" in the government and said that the behaviour of some was "pure poison".Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Mr Jones, speaking to BBC Wales Today via Skype, claims there was "constant undermining" of ministers "Ministers were undermined by senior advisers playing power games and seeking to exert unreasonable control over government and the first minister himself," he said.Some ministers, including Mr Sargeant, "would have their diaries unreasonably monitored and questioned, their policy proposals shelved and direct access to the first minister blocked"."It went way beyond any 'office politics' or personality clashes," he said.Mr Jones said at one stage he intended to resign because of the effect on his wellbeing but changed his mind when the first minister urged him to reconsider."Things improved for a few months, then the poison returned and it began to engulf others - advisers and ministers alike."It was clear that all this was getting Carl down.Mr Jones added: "It became increasingly obvious that Carwyn was either unwilling or unable to address the culture that existed within his office.He allowed it to develop, fester and grow."Image caption Carwyn Jones has ordered an independent inquiry into how he handled allegations against Carl Sargeant The Welsh Government said: "We do not recognise these comments.All complaints regarding staff and special adviser conduct are taken seriously and dealt with accordingly."Former communities secretary Mr Sargeant was being investigated over claims of "touching or groping" and was also suspended by Welsh Labour.The first minister has said he will order an independent inquiry into his handling of Mr Sargeant's dismissal.On Sunday, Wales' health secretary Vaughan Gething said he did not believe Mr Jones would resign following anger and criticism of his actions.But Bernie Attridge, a lifelong friend of Mr Sargeant and the deputy leader of Flintshire council, has called on the first minister to step aside.
Brexit: Gove 'wouldn't block' PM over EU divorce bill:::::Image copyright BBC/Jeff Overs Michael Gove has said the PM must be given "flexibility" to negotiate a Brexit deal and he would not stop her if it meant paying more to the EU."I would not block the prime minister in doing what she believed was right," he told BBC One's Andrew Marr Show.The so-called divorce bill has been one of the main sticking points in Brexit negotiations so far.Theresa May has said the UK will honour commitments made but has not put a final figure on what will be paid.But there have been reports that some Brexiteers are prepared for the UK to pay more than the 20bn euros (about 18bn) that has previously been suggested.The money is among issues that must be resolved before the EU will agree to move on to talking about a transitional deal and future trade deal.Last week, the EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier said the UK had two weeks to clarify what it would pay to settle its accounts, if the talks were to make "sufficient progress" before the next big EU leaders' meeting in December.'Walk away' On Sunday, he told French newspaper Le Journal du Dimanche he was making plans for the possible failure of talks, adding: "It's not my (preferred) option... but it's a possibility.Everyone needs to plan for it, member states and businesses alike.We too are preparing for it technically."Leave campaigner and entrepreneur James Dyson, also interviewed on the Marr programme, said it was "quite outrageous" for the EU to demand "billions and billions" before agreeing to negotiate on a future deal."I would walk away.I think that's the only way to deal with them," he said.'Good deal' But Environment Secretary Mr Gove, who headed up the successful Vote Leave campaign during the EU referendum, said: "I can understand James's point of view but on this occasion, respectfully, disagree with him."I think it's far better for us to be engaged in these negotiations."Asked if he would block the prime minister if securing a deal meant the UK had to offer more money, he said: "I certainly would not.I would not block the prime minister in doing what she believed was right.""We have to make sure that when we are negotiating on money or anything else that we both respect Britain's interests but also make sure, as the prime minister has said, that no EU country is out of pocket as a result of the decisions that we have made.""My view is the prime minister and [Brexit Secretary] David Davis should be given the flexibility that they need in order to secure that good deal."Asked about a Mail on Sunday story reporting that both Mr Gove and Mr Johnson had written to the prime minister expressing their "worry" that "in some parts of government the current preparations are not proceeding with anything like sufficient energy".He told the BBC: "As a departmental minister I have a responsibility .. to make sure that we are ready for any eventuality."He stressed the cabinet wanted to achieve a "good Brexit deal" but added: "We are also making sure that whatever may happen in these negotiations, that Britain can make the best of them."
Borth zoo lynx killing defended by Ceredigion council:::::Image copyright Borth Wild Animal Kingdom Image caption Lilleth went missing some time in the last three weeks A council which ordered an escaped Eurasian lynx to be shot dead by a marksman has defended its decision.Ceredigion council said it sought expert advice before ordering Lilleth be 'humanely destroyed' on Friday.She escaped from Borth Wild Animal Kingdom, near Aberystwyth, three weeks ago and on Saturday the zoo's owners said they were "outraged".Meanwhile, Dyfed-Powys Police said it was investigating threats against the marksman.In a statement on Sunday evening, the council said Lilleth was "not afraid of humans" and had entered a populated area.They said that the shooting had been approved beforehand by the police, the Welsh government and the chief veterinary officer for Wales.A council spokeswoman said: "It was not possible to assess the condition or temperament of the lynx but there were concerns about its likely behavioural response if it was startled or inadvertently confronted by a member of the public, especially by a young child."It must be remembered that the lynx is classified in legislation as 'dangerous and wild' and the authorities were dealing with an unmanaged escape situation."She added that using a tranquiliser instead was "specifically discussed" but the terrain and vegetation in the area meant they were told it was "not an option".She said: "On other occasions and in different circumstances it may be fitting to attempt to tranquilise an escaped animal but, based on the factors involved with this incident, it was decided that it was not appropriate."Image caption Flowers have been left outside the zoo in tribute to Lilleth The council has been investigating the animal's escape "to establish whether there have been any breaches of the operating licence and other related matters".She is believed to have escaped after making a "giant leap" over an electrified fence.There had been a number of sightings but she evaded capture and was at one point thought to be hiding in bushes near the zoo.Ceredigion council and Dyfed-Powys Police said they had tried a "range of measures" to capture the Lynx, including baited traps.The local authority has previously said it would carry out an inspection of the zoo later this month.
Brexit: Will you be able to take your pet to the EU after UK exit?:::::The claim: If Brexit negotiations fail it will make it harder to travel with pets from the UK to the EU.Reality Check verdict: If there is no deal then it will indeed be harder to take pets to the EU.The pet passport scheme includes countries that are not EU members, but a deal would need to be done.EU negotiator Michel Barnier has warned French newspaper Le Journal du Dimanche of some of the consequences of the UK leaving the EU without a deal.Among those, he spoke about "the ability... of dogs and cats to cross the Channel".At the moment you can take your pet dog, cat, or indeed ferret, from the UK to the EU and back again without quarantine provided that certain conditions are met, such as having a pet passport and your pet being microchipped.Pet passports are issued by EU countries and a short list of other countries such as Greenland, Iceland and Switzerland.The UK could be added to this list, but clearly agreements would be needed to make that happen - it would not be automatic.For pets from countries that do not issue passports, the EU distinguishes between listed and non-listed countries, depending on whether they have suitably robust surveillance and reporting systems for diseases such as rabies.Pets from listed countries such as the US, Japan and Russia, need to have paperwork filled out, including health certificates from their vets, if they are to avoid blood tests or quarantine at the border.They will have had to have a test for rabies within three months of the date of travel, for example.Mr Barnier was talking to a French publication and of course the added difficulties for British pets crossing the Channel would be the same for French and other EU pets crossing the other way.Image copyright PA Image caption In 2002 this dog was the first to travel to the UK using a pet passport Read more from Reality Check Follow us on Twitter
Guide to the EU bill as it faces close scrutiny by MPs:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Voting on the second reading of the EU Withdrawal Bill went on until late into the night...This winter, Parliament is going to be dominated by committee stage of the EU (Withdrawal) Bill.The bill aims to incorporate EU law into UK domestic law.The government won the vote at second reading - meaning that the bill was agreed to in principle.MPs voted to approve the second reading of the bill, officially known as the EU (Withdrawal) Bill, by 326 votes to 290.But now comes the nitty-gritty.So what's committee stage?There are several stages of a bill - first reading (that's when it's published), second reading (MPs debate the general principles of a bill), committee stage, report stage and third reading.Each one has a purpose.The committee stage is a chance for MPs to examine the bill line by line.Committee stage often happens away from the television cameras in a Public Bill Committee - but for really important bills they are examined in the Commons chamber, in what's called a committee of the whole House.EU Withdrawal Bill: How your MP voted A taste of things to come Report stage looks at the changes that have been made at committee stage - and then comes third reading where the bill is agreed to.But that's only in the Commons.After that, of course, the bill heads off to the Lords.What happens in the Commons?This bill's committee stage is subject to a programme motion.That means MPs have eight days to talk about the bill at committee stage; and each day has eight hours allocated.The debate will be timetabled and subjects will be designated for a particular day.What are amendments and what do they do?Every clause in the bill is agreed to, changed or removed from the bill, although this may happen (particularly under a programme order) without debate.In a committee of the whole House, every MP is able to take part because the debate is in the chamber of the House of Commons rather than in a Public Bill Committee.The selection and grouping of amendments in a committee of the whole House is decided by the Chairman of Ways and Means (Deputy Speaker).There are currently 186 pages of amendments to the bill (as of 7 November) - and there could be more to come.Amendments essentially do what the word describes - they alter and amend the bill.The amendments will have be drafted with the help of the clerks of the Commons, who can advise on points of law.Helpfully, amendments now have explanatory notes so even someone without an in-depth training in the law can understand the thrust of the proposed change.For example - this amendment shown below is in the name of the Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn.The section beginning "Clause 5, page 3, line 26" relates to the actual amendment and how it would change or amend the bill; but the explanatory statement helpfully outlines what it intends to do.Image copyright Hoc Who decides what amendments are debated?Deputy Speaker Lindsay Hoyle, as Chairman of Ways and Means, chooses the amendments to be debated.Most of it is done on the advice of the clerks and there may be some behind-the-scenes diplomacy about what gets called.First of all, amendments will be divided into subject groups - this is called grouping - and the lead amendment on each group is always voted on.The amendments are taken in the order in which they would appear in the text of the bill.After that, priority would be given to a government amendment; otherwise it's the one that is laid down first - hence the scrum of MPs the eagle-eyed among you will have spotted round the amendment table straight after second reading (MPs can pop along to the vote office afterwards to table an amendment, but they'll be at the back of the queue).New clauses - which add a new point to the bill - come after amendments, which change the wording of the bill as laid out by the government.A new clause has to remain within the scope of the bill, remember, which means the subject has to relate to the long title of the bill.But this bill is subject to an elaborate programme motion which takes each clause of the bill separately, along with new clauses and schedules belonging to that bit.So - it's a case of looking at the back of the blue amendment paper which MPs will have.What happens next?When it comes to amendments there will usually be a debate on those laid down by the main opposition party; other parties may get a look in as well - but some of the most important amendments may come from groups of backbenchers and groups of cross-party MPs, who co-ordinate amendments among themselves.And that's where Lindsay Hoyle will judge which of those should be considered; and he may earmark some of them for a separate vote, in advance.Then, listening to the debate, he may decide there's a real head of steam behind one issue or another - and allow a separate vote on it.So if a lot of MPs weigh in behind a particular amendment, Mr Hoyle may decide to put it to a vote.What about the EU Bill itself?The bill's amendments can be found here.There are plenty of amendments, and the list is growing.What happens next?The first day of committee stage of the EU Withdrawal Bill is Tuesday 14 November.Andrea Leadsom, during the Business Statement on Thursday 12 October, said, when asked about the non-appearance of the bill: "What I can say to all members is of course, there are some 300 amendments and 54 new clauses being proposed, quite rightly, by members who have very real concerns about the bill."Those are being closely evaluated.That is taking a bit of time to have proper, thoughtful, well considered responses to those.But we will of course be bringing forward the committee of the whole House just as soon as we're able to."That delay could mean that the government has been seeking to evaluate how many Conservative rebels there are, and what some of their MPs may be prepared to be persuaded on.The whips will be busy, evaluating possible bear traps ahead.And then, of course, once the bill has passed the Commons, all eyes will turn to the Lords, where a new set of considerations will come into play for the government.
Was there really a time sexual harassment was acceptable?:::::Image copyright Getty Images It has been said that attitudes towards sexual harassment have changed in recent years.But research into the experiences of women in government suggests it is the expectation they will put up with it that has shifted."The culture has changed over the years, what might have been acceptable 15, 10 years ago is clearly not acceptable now."This comment, made by Sir Michael Fallon after his resignation as defence secretary, is very revealing.First, for raising the question "Acceptable to whom?", and second for highlighting the culture and employment practices at Westminster lag behind those of many other workplaces.Party leaders, who have agreed a new complaints procedure amid multiple allegations of sexual misconduct, might find it informative to look at the experience of women in Whitehall - another part of government.Institutional sexism During interviews for a history of women in the civil service, we found many who spoke of experiences of sexual discrimination and harassment - by both civil servants and ministers - 30, 40 or 50 years ago.It wasn't acceptable to them back then either.What was different was that a culture existed where they were just expected to put up with it.This, they said, had changed only in the past 20 or so years.One interviewee described how women were held back from career-advancing positions close to ministers because of fears those ministers might have affairs with them.Image copyright Getty Images We were told about more senior colleagues who were known to make unwanted sexual advances and should be avoided.One woman described how she had been sexually harassed by her line manager in the early 1980s, but did not make a formal complaint.She said: "I just told my colleagues, and everybody said, 'Oh yeah, he does that to everybody,' and just dismissed it and laughed it off."That, she said, was not how she would respond today.Another senior civil servant recalled the Ministry of Defence when she joined in 1975 as a place where "institutional sexism bordering on sexual harassment was the norm".There were other kinds of discrimination to contend with: bosses who didn't want to employ women who might get married and go off to have children; bosses who didn't like promoting women generally.Power relationships It's worth remembering that those we interviewed often stressed that these experiences had not dominated their career.They had much to say in praise of their jobs and the people they worked with.Image copyright Reuters Image caption Theresa May has called for a new culture of respect in Westminster But they did remember such occasions, brought them up without being prompted, and could often recall specific instances vividly.These were memories that stuck.The stories we heard, though historical, are relevant to the current debate on sexual harassment at Westminster because both speak to the kinds of power relationships that can occur in and around government and politics.There were also wider factors, beyond harassment and sexism, which are relevant to the question of Parliament today.Interviewees also often talked about how important patronage could be to promotion: having a boss who championed you, being known and praised by a minister.That culture adds to the pressure on people not to complain.While there is undoubtedly still work to do, the civil service started to tackle issues of equal pay, discrimination and sexual harassment many years ago.It has a stated aim to be one of the UK's most inclusive employers.There are many reasons why Parliament lags behind, not least the way in which staff are employed by parties, or individual MPs.Complaints are often handled by those who may be responsible for career advancement (party headquarters), keeping their members in line (the Whips' Office), or minimising scandals (communications officers).This wouldn't happen in many other sectors.MPs are also not employed by the party or by Parliament - they are voted into and out of office.The final arbiter on whether they have done anything wrong is their fellow MPs.In 2016, a new power for MPs to be "recalled" was introduced, but it takes a high threshold to be initiated.Parliament has made efforts on representation of women MPs and has brought in some new employment practices.For example, since becoming Speaker, John Bercow has introduced a creche and reduced the amount of late-night sittings.The current crisis may lead to the development of an independent body to investigate and deal with complaints about Parliament.It can learn from how harassment is handled in many other sectors.The question of how to change its culture is perhaps more difficult.Dr Catherine Haddon is a senior fellow and resident historian at the Institute for Government, which describes itself as a think tank "working to make government more effective".Follow her @cath_haddon.Edited by Duncan Walker
Perplexed about Brexit? Here are six things to watch:::::Image copyright Getty Images We're now halfway between the Brexit referendum and the day the UK is supposed to leave the EU, and the entire process seems to be clouded in confusion.Don't take my word for it.I've spent the last three weeks talking to a variety of people, from Irish thoroughbred breeders to chief executives of construction companies, from nuclear scientists to taxi drivers.And everyone wants to know where on earth all this is heading.I've seen it argued that Leavers and Remainers find it difficult to have a constructive debate because the Leave side tend to focus on broad political themes (Take Back Control, anyone?)while the Remain side focus on the detail.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption On 29 March 2017, European Council President Donald Tusk received the letter which triggered the UK's withdrawal from the EU That's why some advocates of Remain still have difficulty accepting the fact that a big political decision was made in the referendum.At the same time a government that has committed itself to Brexit, but is divided about what that actually means, is trying to master the detail in record time.And if there's one thing about Brexit that does become clearer every week, it is that this is a process of unprecedented complexity.Like unstitching a blanket, or unbaking a cake: you can choose your own simile, but the inference is clear.No advanced industrial economy has ever tried to do anything quite like this before - extricating itself in an astonishingly short space of time from more than 40 years of shared sovereignty and close economic co-ordination with its nearest neighbours.. No wonder we're still a wee bit perplexed.Explaining Brexit is a bit like stapling jelly.But here, slightly at random and in no particular order, are a few things that emerged from our series, which may be worth keeping an eye on.1.Direct effect Image copyright Getty Images If a deal is to emerge soon on the issue of citizens' rights (for EU citizens here in the UK in particular) then the notion of "direct effect" is likely to loom large.It is a really important principle of the European Court of Justice, because it means individuals can invoke European law before national courts.In this case, the Brexit withdrawal agreement (with European law enshrined within it) could be written directly into UK law rather than relying on a separate piece of UK legislation to implement it.The EU thought that the UK had conceded this point; if that turns out not to be so, it will cause problems.2.Ireland Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Theresa May met Ireland's Prime Minister Leo Varadkar in Downing Street in September 2017 It's not just about the border, and the effect on Northern Ireland, critically important though that is.A total of 80% of Irish exports go to or through the UK, which is also critical for Irish energy supplies, and no other country outside the UK has nearly as much at stake in the Brexit debate as the Republic of Ireland."There is hardly any area of Irish life that won't be affected in one way or another," says Tony Connelly, author of the book Brexit and Ireland.That means Dublin needs a good deal with the UK after Brexit.But it doesn't mean Ireland won't play tough.In the Brexit negotiations it is sticking with the mantra of the unity of the EU27, and exasperation with UK politics is mounting.3.Robots Image copyright Getty Images Anna Wallace, the director of political relations at the professional services firm PricewaterhouseCoopers, told the story of a manufacturing company in Wales that has decided to replace EU migrant workers with machines, rather than with a locally hired workforce."They knew they were probably going to do that in five years' time," she says."But good businesses are now thinking about all of those things together."It is a reminder that Brexit is only one part of a much larger economic debate, as another technological revolution looms large.Automation would be changing the working lives of many people come what may (in fact, it already is).But the effect of Brexit will probably speed up things.The good thing about change?It always brings opportunity as well as risk.4.The labour market Image copyright Getty Images The end of the free movement of people from the EU could well lead to some liberalisation of UK immigration policy for the rest of the world.That may not come as a surprise to many economists who deal with immigration issues, but it may not have been what many Leave supporters thought they were voting for.The UK will still need immigrant labour to keep its economy moving.Even the pressure group Migration Watch advocates the creation of new schemes for seasonal agricultural workers from the EU, and for young people between the ages of 18 and 30 to work in the UK for up to two years.But immigration policy isn't just about the UK choosing whom it wants.They have to want to come to the UK too.The rest of the world beyond Europe may have to fill some gaps in the market.5.JET Image copyright EUROfusion Consortium The Joint European Torus in Oxfordshire can lay convincing claim to be the greatest scientific experiment in the UK.The long-term aim is to produce an unlimited supply of clean energy through nuclear fusion.But Jet is run under the auspices of Euratom, the European Atomic Energy Community.And alongside the EU, we're leaving Euratom too.The trouble is that funding for Jet runs out at the end of 2018.And until we know the future relationship between Euratom and the UK after Brexit, no one can say for certain that funding will be extended.Surely, you cry, they won't just pull the giant Torus plug?"I work in fusion research so by definition I think I'm an optimist," says Ian Chapman, the chief executive of the UK Atomic Energy Authority."But everybody is anxious, and everybody wants a resolution to this as quickly as possible."6.(Continent cut off by) fog Image copyright Getty Images You probably know this one already, but it is worth repeating.When it comes to Brexit, no one has any idea what is going to happen next."I've been following British politics professionally for almost 50 years," says the pollster Peter Kellner."Never before have I been so uncertain as to where British politics has been heading."We're looking at a mountain ahead of us shrouded in fog.We can't see the pass and we don't know what's on the other side."The battle for Brexit seems to have been around forever, but it may be that the critical phase is only just beginning.Stay tuned.Chris Morris presents Brexit: A Guide for the Perplexed on BBC Radio 4.You can listen online, or download the programme podcast.
Profile: Priti Patel:::::Image copyright PA Long seen as a rising star in the Conservative Party, Priti Patel has now resigned from the cabinet minister after it emerged she had held undisclosed meetings with Israeli officials while on holiday.Elected as an MP in 2010 the prominent Brexiteer, 45, became a Treasury minister in 2014, before becoming Employment Minister after the 2015 general election.And shortly after Theresa May became Prime Minister - following the June 2016 EU referendum - Ms Patel was promoted to Secretary of State for International Development.Born in London to Gujarati parents who fled Uganda in the 1960s, she was educated at Watford Grammar School for Girls.She went on to study at Keele and Essex universities before getting a job at Conservative Central Office, which she left to head up the press office for the Referendum Party, under Sir James Goldsmith, from 1995 to 1997.After William Hague became Conservative leader, she returned to the party to be his deputy press secretary, from 1997 to 2000.She went on to spend a number of years working with the Weber Shandwick public affairs consultancy - advising Ikea and the Meat & Livestock Commission among others - and had a spell as international public policy adviser for drinks giant Diageo.Ms Patel sought to get elected to Parliament in 2005 but lost out in Nottingham North.A year later, she was one of those selected for new leader David Cameron's A-list of candidates and went on to become MP for Witham, Essex, in 2010.Factfile Born: 29 March, 1972, in London 29 March, 1972, in London Education: Watford Grammar School; economics degree from Keele University, MSc in British government and politics from University of Essex Watford Grammar School; economics degree from Keele University, MSc in British government and politics from University of Essex Family: Born to Gujarati parents who fled Uganda in the 1960s.Married with a seven-year-old son Born to Gujarati parents who fled Uganda in the 1960s.Married with a seven-year-old son Career: Elected Witham MP in 2010.Became Treasury minister in 2014 and Minister for Employment in 2015.Appointed Secretary of State for International Development in July 2016 She is positioned on the right of the party, voted against gay marriage, campaigned against the smoking ban, and previously advocated bringing back the death penalty, before later saying she did not support it.Ms Patel, whose father stood as a UKIP councillor in 2013, cites Margaret Thatcher as her political hero.A longstanding Eurosceptic, dating back to at least her Referendum Party days, Ms Patel was a leading figure in the successful Vote Leave campaign.There was also controversy when it emerged she once called for the foreign aid department to be scrapped in its current form.She told the Daily Telegraph in 2013: "A long-term strategic assessment is required, including the consideration to replace DfID [the Department for International Development] with a Department for International Trade and Development in order to enable the UK to focus on enhancing trade with the developing world and seek out new investment opportunities in the global race."She later said she did want DfID to continue in its current form and backed Britain's legal commitment to spend 0.7% of gross national income on aid, although she insisted that it should provide better value for money.
What politicians can learn from chimps:::::Image copyright PA/Getty Image caption Prof Tilley presents Primate Politics on BBC Radio 4 The word "politics" probably conjures up an image of Theresa May facing Jeremy Corbyn over the despatch box - and despite the hooting from the backbenches we might not think that this has much to do with chimpanzees.Yet many of our fellow primates are our equal in their desire for power and ability to manoeuvre others to get hold of that power.Chimpanzees are intensely political animals.They live in social groups of about 50 with male leaders who have to engage in a variety of political manoeuvres to get to the top.Professor Frans de Waal's book Chimpanzee Politics details the shifting coalitions created among chimpanzees to take power at Arnhem Zoo in the Netherlands.He argues that it is not enough to simply be the strongest."The best alpha males in chimpanzee communities are not necessarily the biggest and strongest males," he says."You have to have supporters which means you have to keep these supporters happy.You have to be diplomatic."Building a coalition Image copyright AFP/Getty Image caption Coalitions aren't just for humans Part of this diplomacy involves forming coalitions with other males.This can be very strategic and mirrors what we see politicians within parties doing all the time."If you have three males and one of them is overwhelmingly strong then there's a tendency for the other two to gang up together against that male," says Prof de Waal."Because if they attach their political weight to the top male who is that strong male they're just an accessory to his power."The other crucial part of diplomacy is getting support from the masses.This involves being "nice" - would-be chimpanzee leaders are as keen on kissing babies as human politicians - but also distributing resources, typically meat, to build up support: "The Japanese scientist Toshisada Nishida studied one chimpanzee who ruled for 12 years," says Mr de Waal."He would appropriate the meat of other males and then selectively share with his supporters and selectively not share with his rivals.He had a whole bribery system that worked very much to his advantage."In effect, that chimpanzee leader was taxing the group and then returning those resources to selected supporters.Clearly bribing voters with their own money is not unique to human politicians.Primates at war Image copyright Getty Images Another similarity involves conflict between groups.Chimpanzees often raid and ambush other troops, brutally killing rival group members.They also face danger from other animals such as snakes.And just as in human politics, these external threats can silence internal dissent and shore up support for leaders.Marc Hetherington, a professor of political science at Vanderbilt University in Tennessee, studies how voters sometimes "rally around the flag"."George W Bush in the early 2000s went from not being a particularly popular president, especially at the beginning of his term, to having 90% approval after the September 11 2001 terrorist attacks."This is one of the textbook examples of rallying round the flag."Other primates show the same tendencies.Dr Alison Cronin is a primatologist, and director of Monkey World in Dorset."If you have an external threat that's a danger effectively to everybody, it brings the group together, you rally together," she says."And people who you might not even like on a day-to-day basis, if you're going to join up as a band of brothers to defend the realm, then all for one and one for all."Humans are primates These parallels shouldn't be too surprising.Human are primates.And for most of human evolutionary history we lived in small tight-knit groups of hunters and foragers in which coalitions of individuals vied for leadership.That history can mean that we are potentially making political decisions in a way that is often poorly suited to the modern world.Professor Michael Bang Petersen is an expert in evolutionary political psychology at Aarhus University in Denmark."We act as if we still live in a small-scale society," he says."Our brain is built to assume a small-scale environment and the solutions that we think are intuitively right are the solutions that work well in a small-scale society."Image caption Alison Cronin and James Tilley with chimpanzees at Monkey World This can make it difficult for people to hold principled political attitudes as we naturally prefer to think about things on a case-by-case basis as we did in small groups.For example, Prof Bang Petersen says, rather than considering which punishments fit which crime, we prefer to think about which punishments fit which criminal.Remarkably, these hangovers from our past even extend to basic questions about income inequality.Prof Bang Petersen argues that, on average, physically strong people prefer less income redistribution because they forget that redistribution policies are determined by factions in Parliament not whether they can enforce them physically.At the same time, our willingness to cooperate is a crucial part of why democracy works and this too can be traced back to when we lived in small groups.Think about voting.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Does our evolutionary history explain why so many of us turn out to vote?No individual vote will make any difference to the result, so why do so many people vote?Prof Bang Petersen argues that this too is part of evolutionary heritage."People feel that voting is important and that makes intuitive sense for our mind that is designed to navigate small-scale politics where each individual could indeed be decisive."That stems from high levels of cooperativeness."Of course, we should be a bit cautious about saying that we are simply products of our evolutionary history and that other primate behaviour is just a mirror of our own.There's an obvious difference between humans and other primates: language.Language, alongside greater cognitive capacity, allows us to make laws and plan ahead.Language allows us to create groups that are national, not just local, and include people we will never meet.But that can still mean that we sometimes behave as if those groups consist of 50 people on the savannah scratching a living from hunting and foraging.And next time you are watching PMQs, it is worth remembering that we are, in the end, just one political primate among many.
The case for the voting age to be lowered to 16:::::At the moment, 1.5 million 16 and 17-year-olds are too young to vote.They pay taxes, but aren't old enough to elect the men and women who decide how to spend them.Yet after a General Election where younger people turned out in numbers not seen for decades, the question of whether it's undemocratic to continue to deny 16-year-olds the vote is being asked again.Leading the teenage charge this time around is Jim McMahon, Labour MP for Oldham West and Royton.His proposal not only calls for the voting age to be lowered, but for political education to be taught in schools."The young people that I come in to contact with understand issues and they get behind campaigns," he told Newsbeat.Seventeen-year-olds Nathan Randles, Samah Khalil and Jess Consterdine, from Oldham's youth council, are a case in point."I pay tax as an apprentice and I have no say on where it goes," says Nathan."I want a say in how much my education costs," Jess chimes in."There's no test you take at 18 which means you are informed," argues Samah.And their case is backed by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn.The Scottish National Party, the Lib Dems and Green Party are all on board too - but crucially the Conservatives aren't.Speaking just before this year's General Election, Prime Minister Theresa May said: "You have to pick a point at which you think it is right for the voting age to be."I continue to think it is right for it to be 18."Some claim that position is based on a fear that not enough younger voters would vote for the Conservatives.But the PM is not alone in her thinking.Austria is the only country in the EU where 16-year-olds can vote in general elections.And although supporters for lowering the electoral age say you can get married, join the Army and work full-time at 16 - that's not entirely true.You can now vote in the Scottish parliamentary and local elections at 16.The Welsh Assembly is looking at doing the same for local elections there.Labour MP Jim McMahon believes the momentum is with his campaign to push forward a bill proposing votes at 16."If you are giving 16-year-olds the right to vote in Scotland and Wales, you ought to be doing the same for 16-year-olds in England too," he says.Find us on Instagram at BBCNewsbeat and follow us on Snapchat, search for bbc_newsbeat
Balfour Declaration: The divisive legacy of 67 words:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The Balfour Declaration: 100 years of conflict The British peer Arthur Balfour barely makes an appearance in UK schoolbooks, but many Israeli and Palestinian students could tell you about him.His Balfour Declaration, made on 2 November 1917, is taught in their respective history classes and forms a key chapter in their two very different, national narratives.It can be seen as a starting point for the Arab-Israeli conflict.The declaration by the then foreign secretary was included in a letter to Lord Walter Rothschild, a leading proponent of Zionism, a movement advocating self-determination for the Jewish people in their historical homeland - from the Mediterranean to the eastern flank of the River Jordan, an area which came to be known as Palestine.It stated that the British government supported "the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people".Image caption The key 67 words of Balfour's letter At the same time, it said that nothing should "prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities".Palestinians see this as a great betrayal, particularly given a separate promise made to enlist the political and military support of the Arabs - then ruled by the Ottoman Turks - in World War One.This suggested Britain would back their struggle for independence in most of the lands of the Ottoman Empire, which consisted of much of the Middle East.The Arabs understood this to include Palestine, though it had not been specifically mentioned."Do you think Britain committed a crime against the Palestinian people?"asks a teacher during a lesson in a Palestinian school in the West Bank city of Ramallah.Image caption Palestinians regard the declaration as an historical injustice Everyone puts up a hand."Yes," a 15-year-old girl answers."This declaration was illegitimate because Palestine was still part of the Ottoman Empire and Britain did not control it.""Britain considered the Arabs as a minority while they formed over 90% of the population."'Huge hope' Israeli children, inevitably, tend to see British involvement more positively when they study the Balfour Declaration in a lesson towards the end of their high-school years.In Balfouria, a village in northern Israel, nine-year-old Noga Yehezekeli is already proudly able to recite a Hebrew version of the text off by heart."In the moment it was given, the declaration gave huge hope and a huge push for the Zionist movement," says her father, Neve."People saw that if the British government gave such a declaration there was a chance that one day the Jewish nation would be established, which really happened later in '48" - the year the State of Israel was formed.Image caption The declaration gave Zionists huge hope, says Neve Yehezekeli (right) Residents of Balfouria - including Neve's grandfather - were part of a growing Jewish community in Palestine when Lord Balfour visited in 1925.They gave him a hero's welcome.By that time, the area was under British administration.The Balfour Declaration had been formally enshrined in the British Mandate for Palestine, which had been endorsed by the League of Nations.During the first half of the Mandate period, Britain allowed waves of Jewish immigration.But amid an Arab backlash and rising violence, Israelis remember how it later blocked many fleeing persecution, particularly during the Holocaust.Hard to deliver At the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, inaugurated by Balfour, Professor Ruth Lapidoth has studied the 67-word document.An expert on international law, Prof Lapidoth argues it was a legally binding declaration, but says Britain found it hard to deliver on its pledge.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Lord Balfour was given a hero's welcome by the Jewish community in Jerusalem in 1925 "The political situation was very bad when the Nazis came to power and then England needed the help, the friendship of the Arab countries," she says."Then they had to limit the implementation of the declaration, which is a pity."Prof Lapidoth left Germany in 1938, a year before the start of World War Two, and so has a personal interest in the pronouncement."I'm still very grateful for it," she says."It was really the source of our right to come back to Palestine, including my own."'Long-due promise' Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, describes the Balfour Declaration as "a central milestone" in the process of establishing his country.The British government has invited him to London for events to mark the centenary on Thursday.That decision, at a time of dimming hopes for Israeli-Palestinian peace, has infuriated Palestinians, who plan a day of protests.Image copyright EPA Image caption Palestinians say Britain's declaration deprived them of a state They want Britain to apologise for the Balfour Declaration."As the time passes, I think British people are forgetting about the lessons of history," says Palestinian Education Minister Sabri Saidam.He points out that Palestinians still seek the creation of a state of their own - which alongside Israel would form the basis of the so-called two-state solution to the conflict, a formula supported by the international community."The time has come for Palestine to be independent and for that long-due promise to be fulfilled," he says.
Tackling the 'boys' club' of political cartoons:::::Image copyright Ella Bucknall / WHIP Why do the UK's national newspapers' full-time cartoonists never seem to be women?Out of nearly 180 cartoons featured in last year's edition of Britain's Best Political Cartoons not one was drawn by a woman.It was flicking through a copy of the book that first highlighted the gender imbalance in the industry for Ella Bucknall, an illustrator currently studying at Camberwell College of Arts in London.This realisation prompted her to start Whip, a magazine of political cartoons by women, to give them a platform that didn't exist elsewhere."Particularly at the moment when there are so many aspects of politics affecting women's lives, from Trump to the DUP, we need to be able to have our own voice.We need to be able to argue back," she said.Image copyright Rosie O'Driscoll / WHIP The "boys' club" is a common complaint of women working as cartoonists.Nicola Jennings, whose work has been published in the Guardian, said: "Political cartoons are a sort of running joke between the boys.I wonder whether men find it too difficult to be lampooned by a woman?"Men lampooning each other is like an in-joke and they're just slapping each other on the back, whereas if it's a woman it's seen as much stronger criticism."The editorial cartoons of the national newspapers remain a distinctly male affair.Tim Benson, editor of Britain's Best Political Cartoons, defended his selection as simply a reflection of the state of the industry."My criteria is that the cartoon has to be published in a national newspaper.There are lots of female cartoonists who publish their work online or draw for the Morning Star but they are unpaid," he said, "If you want to be able to call yourself a political cartoonist you have to be able to earn your living as one.I can only pick cartoons from what is available."My view is that anyone with the perseverance and the skills will rise to the top, whatever their gender is.Personally I don't think there's a woman out there at the moment who can compete with the very best."I've got Nicola Jennings in this year's book but only because she's been published in national newspapers.I would love to have more work by female cartoonists but I'm not going to include them in my book if I don't think they're good enough.I never decide on gender lines.As far as my book is concerned there is absolutely no gender bias at all."Image copyright Ella Bucknall / WHIP To find female political cartoonists at the moment, it is necessary to look beyond the national newspapers.Nicola Streeten, an illustrator and comics scholar, has researched the history of British feminist cartoons and comics from the 1970s.What she found was that outside the national media there were a host of women drawing political cartoons, from the Suffragettes to 1960s feminist magazine Spare Rib.She is currently co-editing a collection of 250 years of female cartoonists in Britain, The Inking Woman, following an exhibition of the same name at the Cartoon Museum."The more we looked the more women we found.You just have to take the trouble to look.Some people are against having a women's-only publication or exhibition but at the moment there just aren't the platforms for women," she said.There are only six full-time political cartoonists working for national newspapers.As far as we can tell there has never been a woman among them and most of the men have held their positions for years."There was a tradition of editorial cartoonists having a job for life.Those jobs were already taken by men 50 years ago so there haven't been any open doors for women," explained Martha Richler, otherwise known as Marf, one of the few women to have worked as a political cartoonist on Fleet Street, for London's Evening Standard.Image copyright Martha Richler Ms Richler, who was made redundant from the Standard in 2008 after the recession hit, said: "As budgets were cut, cartoonists were considered a luxury.But the story's not over if you look online."She admits she misses her salary but prefers the freedom of working online."There were times at the Standard when I wasn't allowed to do a darker cartoon.Online I have total freedom and there are no prejudices about what women can draw.We can self-publish.There are amazing opportunities if only we can crack the problem of monetising it."Ms Richler also said she faced sexism in Fleet Street.In 2004 the Daily Telegraph claimed her jokes were "regularly rewritten by backbench executives".The paper later published an apology.Ms Richler said the attack suggested there was an assumption women simply couldn't be good political cartoonists.Image copyright Alice Skinner / WHIP So how do things look now?Emma Allen was recently appointed as the New Yorker's cartoon editor.The work of Ms Jennings and Kate Evans has been featured in the Guardian.Political blog The Canary has recently launched an

Profile: Who is Gavin Williamson, the new defence secretary?:::::Image copyright Getty Images He's the Tory enforcer who kept a tarantula on his desk and joked about using a "sharpened carrot" to get his way.Now Gavin Williamson has been propelled into his first cabinet role in the wake of Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon's sudden resignation.So what more do we know about a politician seen as rising star but whose rapid elevation has apparently upset some of his colleagues?Theresa May's chief whip, first elected to Parliament in 2010, wasn't among the bookmakers' favourites for the Ministry of Defence vacancy.The South Staffordshire MP has no military background and had little opportunity to build up a public profile because his role in the whips office meant he did not speak in Parliament.Raised near Scarborough by Labour-supporting parents, he ran a Staffordshire pottery firm, making and selling ceramic tableware, before becoming an MP.After entering Parliament, Mr Williamson was given a role in the Northern Ireland Office in 2011, and then became David Cameron's backbench aide.He was appointed a CBE in the ex-PM's controversial resignation honours list, telling the Stourbridge News he was "extremely honoured and humbled" at the award.And he didn't fall out of favour as Theresa May took over in July 2016 - "literally walking out with one prime minister and in with the next" in the words of friend and fellow Tory MP James Wharton.Factfile Date of birth: 25 June 1976 (aged 41) Job: MP for South Staffordshire, since 2010.Chief whip from June 2016, now defence secretary Education: Went to to Raincliffe Comprehensive School and Scarborough Sixth Form College; studied social sciences at the University of Bradford Family: Married with two children.His father worked at the local council, his mother at a job centre.Both were Labour voters Married with two children.His father worked at the local council, his mother at a job centre.Both were Labour voters Honours: Awarded a CBE in 2016 in David Cameron's resignation honours for political and public service After a disappointing general election for the Conservatives, he played a key role in brokering the 1bn deal with the DUP to prop up their minority government.But until now, that tarantula might have been the most commonly-cited fact about the 41-year-old - whose successor as chief whip tweeted a picture of his desk on taking over.He has described the creature, known as Cronus, as "a perfect example of an incredibly clean, ruthless killer" - who reportedly fell foul of the strict rules about animals on the Parliamentary estate.Kate Moody, who sold it to him at his local garden centre, told BBC Radio 4 the MP had thought it would be a "great addition" to his office.She recalls Mr Williamson joking that he was having a "mid-life" crisis when he bought the red-legged Mexican tarantula, saying "it was a sports car or a tarantula and the tarantula won".Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Gavin Williamson (right) shakes hands with the DUP's Jeffrey Donaldson And spiders aren't the only animals close to his heart - he's also a patron of the World Owl Trust and has built a house for hedgehogs in his garden.He might be kind to animals, but there was a hint of a less accommodating approach in his speech to the Conservative Party conference as he described his methods in the whips office."We take a carrot and stick approach," he told delegates."Personally I don't much like the stick, but it is amazing what can be achieved with a sharpened carrot."In his own words Image copyright AFP On being appointed as chief whip: "I was absolutely flabbergasted, but I accepted immediately."On his pet tarantula: "You have to look at all different ways to persuade people to vote with the government and it's great to have Cronus as part of the team" In the Commons: "It's very important to use our gardens which are a specific habitat for hedgehogs.Just recently in my own garden I built a hedgehog house.Sadly I have no residents in it but hopefully it will encourage them and the growth of hedgehogs in South Staffordshire."What others say
Countdown to Brexit: How to divide food sold to the EU:::::Image copyright Getty Images Here's a Brexit recipe: lamb with grapes and lemon.I haven't tried it, but the recipe does exist and it looks delicious in the pictures I've seen.It also gives us the ingredients for looking at one of the food issues that comes up as the UK prepares to leave the European Union.All of them are covered by a trade arrangement that most people have spent their lives blissfully unaware of.It goes by the name of "tariff rate quotas".Now what on Earth does that mean?When countries import goods, including foods, they often impose a tariff, a tax that is applied only to traded goods.The UK does not currently have its own national tariffs.They are set by the EU for all member nations.Countries and blocs of countries such as the EU, that are members of the World Trade Organization, have made commitments to the others that the tariffs will not exceed certain levels.Many countries have agreed to import a certain quantity of some goods at a lower or even zero tariff, as a negotiated compromise between the interests of: overseas exporters domestic producers concerned about exposure to foreign competition consumers That quantity of goods that gets in on the lower tax rate is called a tariff rate quota.It is a bread and butter dish on the trade negotiating menu, routine enough to have its own acronym, which is TRQ.TRQs are often used for farm products.The EU has about 100, negotiated at the WTO on behalf of all member states, which currently have an impact on the UK.All three of our ingredients have a TRQ for imports into the EU.Image copyright Getty Images In the case of lamb, 280,340 tonnes a year can be imported at a reduced tariff.There's a quota for table grapes of 1,500 tonnes, and for lemons it's 10,000 tonnes.So how does Brexit come into this picture?The UK and the remainder of the EU have to work out how to divide the existing TRQs.The EU doesn't want to take the existing TRQs for the 28 states and use them for the remaining 27, because each EU country may end up importing more food on the low tariffs, therefore creating tougher competition for EU farmers.Image copyright Getty Images Unlike on many other Brexit issues the UK and the EU actually agreed, and told the other WTO members, in a letter, that they wanted to divide the TRQs in line with recent trade flows.That would mean, for example, the UK taking a large share of the quota for lamb because comparatively the UK has been importing more lamb than the other EU countries.But the proposal was met with a raspberry by several countries, including the United States, Canada and New Zealand.Although the UK-EU proposal would give the same total TRQs as today, they would lose flexibility.As things stand, if the price of lamb fell in the UK, they could divert some or all of it to other parts of the EU.After Brexit, that would not be possible.Image copyright Getty Images The other WTO countries feel they should be compensated with a higher combined TRQ in order to maintain the same commercial benefit they currently enjoy.In other words, they see Brexit as an opportunity to negotiate better access for their goods to Europe.There is another option.In some cases, the UK could decide to remove the tariffs altogether.Now, some economists think we should do that anyway with all tariffs, that Brexit is a glorious opportunity for unilateral free trade.This seems politically unlikely for products where there are UK producers.In our recipe, lamb is a case in point.Unrestricted tariff free access for lamb from anywhere in the world would be a problem for many British lamb producers.With lemons, that is not an issue.We are not citrus producers.There are British table grapes.It's not a big industry, but it is a new one so that might need some consultation with producer and consumer groups too.There's another complication: cross-Channel trade.British farmers can now automatically sell, for example, their lamb to France tariff free.The same applies to French cheese sold in the UK.Depending on what sort of deal there is, that might not be true after Brexit.So will the UK and the EU get some share of each other's TRQs?That's another thing to be negotiated.Read more from Reality Check Follow us on Twitter
A pint of view: What do farmers think about Brexit?:::::What do the farmers out in the field, in the dairy and in the milking parlour think about Brexit?No-one knows what's around the corner for the dairy industry.Specific negotiations over a future trade deal haven't even started.Some experts predict oblivion; others see opportunity.So let's start with what we do know: the state of the industry 20 years ago, and what it's like today.Image caption Currently the EU is UK dairy's biggest trading partner, with 80 per cent of exports going there.The number of dairy farmers has shrunk dramatically: In 1996 there were around 35,000.Now there are around 13,000 - a drop of almost two-thirds.Farms are getting bigger: The average herd size was 75 cows and now it's 140.And as for the cost of a pint: back in 1996 it was 36 pence, now it's 43 pence - and many farmers say it's too low.So how do those working in the industry feel about what the next 20 years may hold?Image caption James and Rhiannan feel that Brexit has given them - and their son Ethan - the chance of a more secure future.James and Rhiannan Lomas have a dairy farm of around 200 cows in Cheshire.They almost went out of business two years ago because of the collapse in the milk price.But now they are part of a small number of farms starting to export liquid milk (as opposed to powdered or products such as cheese) to Qatar.The Middle East nation was left without milk almost overnight after a blockade imposed by Saudi Arabia and its allies.Mr Lomas says: "It's amazing.Every day we thought of giving it all up.But hopefully now Brexit will improve our outlook and open up a lot of markets - if the politicians get it right."He adds that there have definitely been some dark times."Hopefully it will give us a chance to make us a more of a secure and better future.Certainly the fluctuation of the dairy business will always be there, but the ability to change markets might give us the chance to go elsewhere."Ms Lomas explains: "It makes you feel a lot more positive for us."Looking down at her son Ethan, she adds: "And for him."China exports Andrew Henderson is the man who secured the deal with a hypermarket chain in Qatar.He runs a dairy called Nemi, also based in Cheshire.It bottles milk from farmers in the surrounding counties and could soon be the first in the UK to export fresh milk to China.These cows are given an enriched feed so they produce milk high in selenium, which can be in short supply in the Chinese diet.A supermarket there has just placed an order.Image caption Brand GB: A prototype of the bottle that could carry the first British fresh milk to China.Note the gold Houses of Parliament and British flag."Brexit is having a very positive effect - we have farmers who are getting a much better milk price and we also have more interest from countries inside Europe and outside Europe for fresh British milk.We are trying to supply that need."He says the Chinese are interested in British milk because they see it as "pure".They also want to know exactly which farm the product is coming from."We were in China in June and we were sitting with some highly decorated officials from the Chinese government and they made a point of saying it's very easy to do a deal with one country - but very difficult to do a deal with 27."Would this be happening without the Brexit vote?"I believe not.There was no will from the major European cooperatives and organisations to deliver our fresh milk to China as they are already within those markets with dried milk and other products from Europe," says Mr Henderson.His business partner is Mark Langslow, from County Milk Products."Regarding Brexit, I think we've made the right decision.I think it makes us want to stand on our own two feet, and forces us to stand on our own two feet."Image caption Dairy farms are closing because they can't find able staff to take on the roles available.However not too far away, near Uttoxeter in Staffordshire, David Brookes has a dairy herd of 180 cows.He's a member of the West Midlands Dairy Board.He relies on his daughter to help with the business and talks of what experts have referred to as the "shocking crisis" in the dairy labour industry."There's only around 1% on jobseekers allowance in Staffordshire.Whether it's the butchery side of things and processing meat or whether it's processing dairy products we have become reliant on a migrant labour force, mainly from Eastern Europe," he says."We need the skilled labour.And at the moment they are not coming over."He says that the devaluation of the pound is largely to blame, but also the uncertainty surrounding Brexit."One of the problems is the classification of 'labour'.Because the government is very keen to get a lot of skilled labour.A lot of our processing workers (such as those that operate milking equipment) are skilled, but their skills are not clearly defined as skilled under government guidelines," Mr Brookes explains.He believes that if restrictions are imposed "it could be very difficult".Further south, in Wiltshire, Jenny Quick helps to run a small family dairy herd."People may tell you their view," she says, "But no one knows.We just have no idea yet."Follow Claire on Twitter.
Westminster sexual harassment: MPs outline claims:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Chi Onwurah: Male and female researchers left 'uncomfortable' in Westminster bar MPs have been speaking out about sexual harassment in the corridors of Westminster - including one claim that bad behaviour at a parliamentary bar was dismissed as typical "pub" talk.Commons leader Andrea Leadsom vowed to stamp out "sleazy, sexist or homophobic banter", as she faced MPs in light of allegations of sexual harassment in Parliament.One of those to speak out, Labour's Chi Onwurah, said some male and female researchers had been made to feel "deeply uncomfortable" by MPs while at a parliamentary bar, the Sports and Social club - but her complaint was ignored.The Labour MP said: "When I complained recently to an officer of Parliament who had some responsibility in this area...I was told that happens in pubs all over the country."Ms Leadsom gave her "absolute assurance" that people going to restaurants and bars in Westminster should feel safe."There should be no place here on the estate or in our constituency offices where people can be abused or allegations not taken seriously," she said.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Liz Saville Roberts says she was told "distrust is endemic" among staff of MPs Liz Saville Roberts, of Plaid Cymru, said she had been told by one employee of an MP that authorities failed to act when she reported an assault claim - leaving the woman "deeply disappointed and distrustful"."She reported being sexually assaulted to the proper authorities earlier this year, who did nothing," she said, adding: "She tells me that distrust is endemic."Ms Saville Roberts asked: "How can I assure her that her complaint will now be treated differently?"For her part, Ms Leadsom said she would be willing to take the complaint up herself.One MP already being investigated for inappropriate behaviour is international trade minister, Mark Garnier, who reportedly asked his secretary to buy sex toys and called her "sugar tits".Secret text Conservative MP Matthew Offord said he was recently sent a text message that accused a current MP of being "utterly foul" towards a woman - but he did not reveal the name of the sender or the politician.Mr Offord said the sender had described the incident as a "problem he saw in this place".He quoted the text as saying the MP was "utterly foul and I'm sure it's a pattern of behaviour on his part - but in this instance I don't think it'd be fair on the woman in question to name him."He added that the sender asked him to "do the best you can" to widen the investigation from sexual harassment claims to also address complaints about bullying and treating staff like "dirt".Monday's question-and-answer Commons session took place in response to an urgent question on plans to tackle sexual harassment in Parliament, brought by Labour MP Harriet Harman.Ms Leadsom's statement prompted "wittering about a witch hunt", according to Labour's Jess Phillips.She told the chamber: "As I walked in here, as I rushed in here today to come to this statement, I overheard two male colleagues walking through the halls wittering about a witch hunt that was going on in Parliament."Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The PM is "too weak" to tackle abuse allegations amongst her own ministers, says Labour's Lucy Powell Conservative Graham Brady, chairman of the backbench 1922 committee, confirmed that some people had expressed "anguish" that the allegations could "unfairly tarnish" innocent MPs.He insisted that Parliament was not a "den of inequity".Earlier, Labour MP Lucy Powell told the BBC that there was an "imbalance of power" in Westminster that left employees open to being abused."When you have that mix of lots of desperate people in that environment [you get] this sort of power abuse - because that's what it is," she said.
Cyber-crime: Security Minister Ben Wallace's claim about arrests unpicked:::::The Claim: Security Minister Ben Wallace told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "There is some good news which never gets reported - nine out of 10 of the latest, most serious cyber-crime attacks have resulted in arrest or charges."Reality Check verdict: The relevant figure is slightly less positive to the one Mr Wallace cited on air.Between October 2016 and May 2017, the National Crime Agency (NCA) and regional organised crime units identified suspects in nine, and made arrests in seven, of the 10 most serious cyber-incidents under investigation.No-one was charged during the relevant period.We all know a burglary when we see one.Smashed window.TV gone.But large numbers of people - and entire organisations - don't necessarily realise when they've been a target or victim of a digital smash-and-grab.That's the public awareness challenge that makes combating the growth of this 21st Century crime so difficult.Put simplest, cyber-crimes and attacks fall into three broad categories: Personal crimes - such as a fraud committed through a bogus online shop or auction - but also bank card cloning and other identity-related scams in which your personal details are taken, sold in online market places and used, ultimately, to steal money.Attacks against organisations - such as this year's huge Wannacry attack which caused major disruption within the NHS.The criminals demanded payment in an untraceable online currency before they would hand back control of computers.Attacks possibly organised by a state against another state's institutions or infrastructure.The alleged involvement of Russian agents in the US president election would be an example of this kind of cyber-attack, if proven to be true.Starting at the bottom and working up, a few years ago the Metropolitan Police estimated that the annual number of online fraud offences nationwide would overtake all types of burglary by, at the latest, autumn 2017.That already looks spot on.In the year to June 2017, the police recorded just over 423,000 burglaries across England and Wales.The Office for National Statistics says there were 653,000 frauds - and all experts in this field think there are many more unreported incidents.Separate experimental data from the Crime Survey for England and Wales, a rolling survey of our experiences, estimates there were 3.3 million frauds in the year to June - and more than half of those were "cyber-related".On top of all that, there were an additional 1.6 million incidents of "computer misuse", generally meaning hacking or virus attacks.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption GCHQ is one of the government agencies tasked with tackling cyber-crime If a hacker steals your personal data, that can be used by organised crime gangs to create fake bank cards in your name.Viruses can be used to hold machines to ransom or, without your even knowing about it, turn your PC into a "zombie" that becomes part of a global attack on a major institution.And that's where many of these individual crimes fit into a bigger picture.Since it was set up in October 2016, the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) dealt with 590 "significant" incidents.The most well-known of these was the Wannacry attack, which prompted the Home Secretary to hold the first ever Cobra meeting (a government emergency response committee) dedicated to a cyber-attack.National priority So what about the response?The Home Office says cyber-crime is a national priority and the NCA plays the lead role in pursuing suspects and building the intelligence picture.It runs some investigations itself and assists others being led by detectives inside the country's regional organised crime units.But individual police forces are also under sustained pressure to up their game.While some have well-developed units, such as the Metropolitan Police's "Operation Falcon", others are struggling to recruit because they need detectives with highly specialist skills.One of the major problems is working out who is supposed to be investigating a particular incident because the crime gang behind an attack could be anywhere in the world.It's very difficult to count how many cyber-related criminals have been successfully prosecuted.Many suspects will be charged with fraud or theft offences but there's no breakdown on how many of those were related to online swindles.Only 55 people were convicted of computer misuse offences relating to hacking last year.During his interview Mr Wallace was referring to the NCA's list of the most serious cyber-incidents between October 2016 and May 2017.These are categorised by assessing the following factors: Threat and risk Public impact Financial harm Nature of the incident Victims Mr Wallace claimed: "We are getting there."Are we?The government believes it is, arguing that the NCSC is a world-beating body, backed up by expert investigators in the National Crime Agency, MI5 and GCHQ.But Parliament's Public Accounts Committee said in February that a skills shortage and "chaotic" handling of personal data breaches were undermining confidence in the government's ability to protect the UK from cyber-attacks.The MPs said ministers had taken too long to consolidate an "alphabet soup" of agencies - although some experts said the report was unfair and failed to take into account the resources now being thrown at this very modern threat.Read more from Reality Check Follow us on Twitter
Brexit: All you need to know about the UK leaving the EU:::::Here is an easy-to-understand guide to Brexit - beginning with the basics, then a look at the negotiations, followed by a selection of answers to questions we've been sent.What's happening now?The UK has voted to leave the European Union.It is scheduled to depart 11pm on Friday 29 March, 2019.Talks are currently taking place on three aspects of how Brexit will work - focusing on how much the UK owes the EU, what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK.The UK wants to talk about future trade relations - and a plan for a two year "transition" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations.But the EU says they will not talk about the future until enough progress has been made on the other issues.What does Brexit mean?It is a word that has become used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past.Why is Britain leaving the European Union?A referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union.Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%.The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Find the result in your area What was the breakdown across the UK?England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%.Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%.Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU.Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave.See the results in more detail.What changed in government after the referendum?Image copyright PA Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May.The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum.Like Mr Cameron, Mrs May was against Britain leaving the EU but she played only a very low-key role in the campaign and was never seen as much of an enthusiast for the EU.She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out.Where does Theresa May stand on Brexit?Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want.Her key message has been that "Brexit means Brexit" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017.She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk.She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy.How did the snap election change things?Image copyright Getty Images Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had been due in 2020).She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders.She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy.However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.What has happened to the UK economy since the Brexit vote?David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum - and remains around 10% lower against the dollar and 15% down against the euro.But predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations.The UK economy has continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017.Inflation has risen since June 2016 to stand at 3.9%, but unemployment has continued to fall, to stand at a 42 year low of 4.3%.Annual house price increases have fallen from 9.4% in June 2016 but were still at an inflation-beating 5% in the year to August 2017, according to official ONS figures.Brexit talks are under way They finally, officially, started on 19 June, 2017.Here's a picture from that first session: Image copyright Reuters The UK and EU negotiating teams meet face-to-face for one week each month.Their first tasks have been trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called "divorce bill", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border.You can find out more about the talks here.What is the European Union?The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list).It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other.It has since grown to become a "single market" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country.It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges.Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption How does the European Union work?What is Article 50?Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU.It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009.Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure.What date will the UK will leave the EU?For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split.Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave on Friday, 29 March 2019.It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May is seeking to put it into British law.What's going to happen to all the EU laws in force in the UK?The Conservative government has introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament.If passed, it will end the primacy of EU law in the UK.This "Great Repeal Bill" as it has been called, is supposed to incorporate all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove.The government is facing claims from Remain supporting MPs that it is giving itself sweeping powers to change legislation without proper Parliamentary scrutiny.Read a full guide to the bill.What is the Labour Party's position on Brexit?Labour's position on Brexit was tweaked in mid-August, when the shadow Brexit secretary, Sir Keir Starmer, announced that the party now wanted to keep the UK in the single market and a customs union during a transition that could last for up to four years.Labour would also accept free movement of people, payments into the EU budget and the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice during the transition.This is a considerably "softer" version of Brexit than the one advocated by the government, but there are still divisions within the party about whether the UK should try to stay in the single market in the longer term.What do 'soft' and 'hard' Brexit mean?These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU.There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, "hard" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if meant leaving the single market.At the other end of the scale, a "soft" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.What is the single market?The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place.Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market.In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country.It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it.The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices.But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a "level playing field".Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs.Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule.Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has said continued membership of the single has to be an option in negotiations with Brussels.Read more: A free trade area v EU single market What's the difference between the single market and the customs union?The customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU.It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area.In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The single market is a very different beast - it is not just about the trade in goods.It allows the free movement of people, money and services as if the EU was a single country.Who is negotiating Britain's exit from the EU?Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit.Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary.These three are each set to play roles in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although Mrs May, as prime minister will play the key role.Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.How long will it take for Britain to leave the EU?The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019.EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member.But there is currently uncertainty about how final the break will be on that day - a number of UK and EU figures back the idea of having a "transition" period of up to three years to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc.Why might Brexit take so long?Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task.It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators will, to some extent, be making it up as they go along.The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.So why can't the UK just cut all ties in March 2019?The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a "cliff-edge" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight.They think it would harm the economy.How are the talks going?There have been agreements on some technical points, but the chief EU negotiator, Michel Barnier, has said there had been no decisive progress on any of the main issues.The UK's Brexit Secretary, David Davis, insists progress has been made.The main sticking point at the moment is money - and the size of the bill the UK will pay to cover its outstanding obligations when it leaves.The UK wants this to be as low as possible.All the other countries in the EU want it to be as high as possible.Because when the UK leaves, there will be a hole in the EU budget and they will have to cover the shortfall.The UK government has published a series of papers setting out its position on issues such as future customs arrangements, and on the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.Government policy is now that the UK will leave the single market and the customs union on the day of Brexit, but that it will try to replicate existing customs arrangements during a time-limited transition period.What happens if there is no deal with the EU?Prime Minister Theresa May says leaving the EU with no deal whatsoever would be better than signing the UK up to a bad one.Without an agreement on trade, the UK would have to operate under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border check for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland.There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care.Here is a full explanation of what 'no deal' could mean What happens to EU citizens living in the UK?It has yet to be agreed.All EU nationals lawfully resident in the UK for at least five years will be able to apply for "settled status" and be able to bring over spouses and children, under a 15-page proposal unveiled by Theresa May.Mrs May says she wants to give reassurance and certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of the three EEA countries and Switzerland.But any deal on their future legal status and rights must be reciprocal and also give certainty to the 1.2 million British expats living on the continent after the UK leaves the EU - expected to be on 29 March 2019, she says.Michel Barnier, who is leading the Brexit negotiations for the EU, said the UK's proposals did not go far enough and he wanted the same level of protection citizens currently have under EU law.He has demanded more clarity and ambition from the UK government.The key points of the UK's proposals are: Those granted settled status will be able to live, work, study and claim benefits just as they can now The cut-off date for eligibility is undecided but will be between 29 March 2017 and 29 March 2019 Family members of EU citizens living abroad will be able to return and apply for settled status EU nationals in the UK for less than five years at the specified date will be able to continue living and working in the UK Once resident for five years, they can apply for settled status Those arriving after the cut-off point will be able to stay temporarily But there should be "no expectation" they will be granted permanent residence A period of "blanket residence permission" may apply to give officials time to process applications to stay in the UK The Home Office will no longer require evidence that EU citizens who weren't working held "comprehensive sickness insurance" Labour has said it would guarantee the rights of of EU citizens living in the UK to stay there on "day one" of a Labour government.EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit.What happens to UK citizens working in the EU?A lot depends on the kind of deal the UK agrees with the EU.If the government opted to impose work permit restrictions on EU nationals, then other countries could reciprocate, meaning Britons would have to apply for visas to work.What about EU nationals who want to work in the UK Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit.The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a "transition" phase of up to three years.However they will have to register.A permanent proposal for post-Brexit immigration is not likely to be known for a few months yet, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.What does the fall in the value of the pound mean for prices in the shops?Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Shoppers will need to keep a close eye on how much they are spending People travelling overseas from the UK have found their pounds are buying fewer euros or dollars after the Brexit vote.Even if the pound regains some of its value, currency experts expect it in the longer term to remain at least 10% below where it was when the referendum happened.This means exports should get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper, but imported goods will get more expensive - some price rises for food, clothing and homeware goods have been seen.The latest UK inflation figures have the rate at 3%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Will immigration be cut?Image copyright PA Prime Minister Theresa May has said one of the main messages she has taken from the Leave vote is that the British people want to see a reduction in immigration.She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a "sustainable" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year.The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed significantly since the Brexit vote.This has largely been driven by an increase in emigration from the UK by citizens of Poland and the other East and Central European countries.There were still 246,000 more people coming to live in the UK than leaving in the year to March 2017, according to the latest estimates - some way above the government's target of 100,000.Could there be a second referendum?It seems highly unlikely.Both the Conservatives and the Labour Party have ruled out another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave.Will MPs get a vote on the Brexit deal?Yes.Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process.This vote is currently proposed as a "take it or leave it" one.Labour wants the vote to have the option of sending the UK team back to renegotiate.It is worth mentioning that any deal also has to be agreed by the European Parliament - with British MEPs getting a chance to vote on it there.Will I need a visa to travel to the EU?The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals.No agreement has been reached yet, however.If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Image copyright Reuters Will I still be able to use my passport?Yes.It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same.In theory, the government could, if it wanted, decide to change the colour, which is currently standardised for EU countries.Has any other member state ever left the EU?No nation state has ever left the EU.But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation.The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.What does this mean for Scotland?Image copyright Reuters Image caption Nicola Sturgeon says a new independence referendum in Scotland is likely Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was "democratically unacceptable" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain.Ms Sturgeon has officially asked for permission for a second referendum to be held.She had wanted the vote to be held between the autumn of 2018 and spring 2019, but after losing seats at the 2017 general election she has put her plans on hold with no referendum likely until 2021.Theresa May has said a second referendum should not be held during the Brexit process.What does it mean for Northern Ireland?The land border between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland is a key part of the Brexit talks.There is currently a common travel area between the UK and the Republic.Like Scotland, Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in last year's referendum.The result in Northern Ireland was 56% for Remain and 44% for Leave.The UK government has published a paper setting out its vision for a post-Brexit border.It wants to avoid returning to a "hard border" - that means no physical infrastructure, such as customs posts.There would be no CCTV cameras or number plate recognition technology at the border, or set back from it.Instead, the UK government is arguing for a wide-ranging exemption under which small and medium-sized businesses will not have to comply with any new customs tariffs.If the proposals are accepted, customs officials envisage using a mix of technology and physical checks to monitor the compliance of bigger businesses engaged in international trade.Critics say the proposals lack credible detail, with Labour deriding the plans for the border as "a fantasy frontier".Sinn Fein, which was part of the ruling coalition in the Northern Ireland Assembly before it was suspended, has called for a referendum on leaving the UK and joining the Republic of Ireland as soon as possible.The Conservatives have rejected Sinn Fein's call, saying there was no evidence opinion had shifted in favour of a united Ireland.How much has Brexit cost so far and how much will it cost by the end?There is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.There have been no official estimates published of the size of the bill, which covers things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments.Various figures ranging from 50bn (44bn) to 100bn (88bn) euros have been bandied about but although the UK has agreed to meet its financial obligations, Brexit secretary David Davis has said: "We will not be paying 100bn."The UK could leave without any Brexit "divorce bill" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court.If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.How will pensions, savings, investments and mortgages be affected?During the referendum campaign, David Cameron said the so-called "triple lock" for state pensions would be threatened by a UK exit.This is the agreement by which pensions increase by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest.Theresa May had proposed ditching the 2.5% part of the lock in the party's election manifesto, but as part of the post-election deal with the DUP the triple lock was again guaranteed.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low.There are few signs yet that rising inflation have worried the Bank of England enough to consider raising interest rates.But if that happened it would make mortgages and loans more expensive to repay - but would be good news for savers.Will duty-free sales on Europe journeys return?Image copyright Thinkstock Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an "upside" or "silver lining" of Brexit.As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the "customs union" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.Will EHIC cards still be valid?Image copyright Thinkstock If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more here.Will cars need new number plates?Probably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.Could MPs block an EU exit?Could the necessary legislation pass the Commons, given that a lot of MPs in the current Parliament - all SNP and Lib Dems, nearly all Labour and many Conservatives - were in favour of staying?The referendum result is not legally binding - Parliament still has to pass the laws that will get Britain out of the 28 nation bloc, starting with the repeal of the 1972 European Communities Act.The withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament - the House of Lords and/or the Commons could vote against ratification, according to a House of Commons library report.So in theory they could block the UK's EU exit.But in practice that is seen as very unlikely given that a majority of people voted for Brexit in the referendum.Will leaving the EU mean we don't have to abide by the European Court of Human Rights?The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution.It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine.So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.There have been longstanding plans to repeal the act and replace it with a British Bill of Rights.What about the European Court of Justice?The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority.It is based in Luxembourg.It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects.The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade.It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does.Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the "direct" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit.But the UK government has not ruled out remaining under its jurisdiction during the Brexit transition period that is planned after March 2019.After that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided.There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The UK has set out some ideas in a position paper, which was criticised for being too "vague".The EU is insisting that its citizens in the UK should continue to enjoy the legal protection of the ECJ even after Brexit, guaranteeing their right to work and access to benefits among other things.This is a major sticking point in the negotiations, with the UK saying EU citizens living in the UK should be subject to British law only.Will the UK be able to rejoin the EU in the future?BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU.Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining.But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands.New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.Who wanted the UK to leave the EU?The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU.They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet.A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving.What were their reasons for wanting the UK to leave?They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return.They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work.One of the main principles of EU membership is "free movement", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country.The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of "ever closer union" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a "United States of Europe".Who wanted the UK to stay in the EU?Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in.He said the deal would give Britain "special" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in.The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign.The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in.The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU, as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.What were their reasons for wanting the UK to stay?Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services.They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.What about businesses?Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world.Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU.Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound.Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU.Image copyright Reuters Image caption Boris Johnson was one of the most prominent Leave campaigners Who led the rival sides in the campaign?Britain Stronger in Europe - the main cross-party group campaigning for Britain to remain in the EU was headed by former Marks and Spencer chairman Lord Rose.It was backed by key figures from the Conservative Party, including Prime Minister David Cameron and Chancellor George Osborne, most Labour MPs, including party leader Jeremy Corbyn and Alan Johnson, who ran the Labour In for Britain campaign, the Lib Dems, Plaid Cymru, the Alliance party and the SDLP in Northern Ireland, and the Green Party.Who funded the campaign: Britain Stronger in Europe raised 6.88m, boosted by two donations totalling 2.3m from the supermarket magnate and Labour peer Lord Sainsbury.Other prominent Remain donors included hedge fund manager David Harding (750,000), businessman and Travelex founder Lloyd Dorfman (500,000) and the Tower Limited Partnership (500,000).Read a Who's Who guide.Who else campaigned to remain : The SNP ran its own remain campaign in Scotland as it did not want to share a platform with the Conservatives.Several smaller groups also registered to campaign.Britain Stronger in Europe raised 6.88m, boosted by two donations totalling

campaign: Vote Leave raised 2.78m.Its largest supporter was businessman Patrick Barbour, who gave 500,000.Former Conservative Party treasurer Peter Cruddas gave a 350,000 donation and construction mogul Terence Adams handed over 300,000.Read a Who's Who guide.Who else campaigned to leave: UKIP leader Nigel Farage was not part of Vote Leave.His party ran its own campaign.The Trade Union and Socialist Coalition also ran its own out campaign.Several smaller groups also registered to campaign.Will the EU still use English?Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler.There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - "much to France's chagrin", she says.Will Brexit harm product safety?Probably not, is the answer.It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards.Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this page Which MPs were for staying and which for leaving?The good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list.Click here for the latest version.How much does the UK contribute to the EU and how much do we get in return?In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out.Only France and Germany contribute more.In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.Image copyright Thinkstock Image caption The UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to 4.6bn in 2014/15.According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was 8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10.The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was 5.7bn.Read more number crunching from Reality Check.If I retire to Spain or another EU country will my healthcare costs still be covered?David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans.This is one of those issues where it is not possible to say definitively what would happen.At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS.After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment.In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.If Britain remains in the single market, or the European Economic Area as it is known, it might be able to continue with this arrangement, according to a House of Commons library research note.If Britain has to negotiate trade deals with individual member states, it may opt to continue paying for expats' healthcare through the NHS or decide that they would have to cover their own costs if they continue to live abroad, if the country where they live declines to do so.What will happen to protected species?Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.The answer is that they would remain in place, initially at least.After the Leave vote, the government will probably review all EU-derived laws in the two years leading up to the official exit date to see which ones to keep or scrap.The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied.The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.The government would want to avoid a legislative vacuum caused by the repeal of EU laws before new UK laws are in place - it would also continue to abide by other international agreements covering environmental protection.How much money will the UK save through changes to migrant child benefits and welfare payments?Martin, from Poole, in Dorset, wanted to know what taxpayers would have got back from the benefit curbs negotiated by David Cameron in Brussels.We don't exactly know because the details were never worked out.HM Revenue and Customs suggested about 20,000 EU nationals receive child benefit payments in respect of 34,000 children in their country of origin at an estimated cost of about 30m.But the total saving would have been significantly less than that because Mr Cameron did not get the blanket ban he wanted.Instead, payments would have been linked to the cost of living in the countries where the children live.David Cameron said as many as 40% of EU migrant families who come to Britain could lose an average of 6,000 a year of in-work benefits when his "emergency brake" was applied.The DWP estimated between 128,700 and 155,100 people would be affected.But the cuts would have been phased in.New arrivals would not have got tax credits and other in-work benefits straight away but would have gradually gained access to them over a four year period at a rate that had not been decided.The plan will never be implemented now.Will we be barred from the Eurovision Song Contest?Image copyright BBC/Guy Levy Image caption To participate in the Eurovision Song Contest countries need to be a member of the European Broadcasting Union, which is independent of the EU Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry.We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: "All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union.The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe.Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC."What will happen to pet passports?The answer to Alan Rippington's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws.It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: "The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU."Has Brexit made house prices fall?Image copyright PA So far, the answer is no.But there has been anecdotal evidence of house prices falling at the top of the market in Central London and the annual increase in the price of property has fallen from 9.4% at the time of the referendum to 4.9% a year later.What is the 'red tape' that opponents of the EU complain about?Ged, from Liverpool, suspects "red tape" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection.According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related.The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs 4.7bn a year, tops the list.The working time directive (4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019.Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them.Brexit may also generate "red tape" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Will Britain be party to the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership?Ste, in Bolton, asked about this.The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of 10bn a year.But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights.US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the TTIP agreement, which means it is now seen as unlikely to be agreed - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it will not be part of TTIP and will have to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.What impact will leaving the EU have on the NHS?Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS.This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was 350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead.The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses.The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as "scaremongering" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned.EU citizens working for the NHS are expected to get the right to stay in the UK, although details on EU citizens in the UK and UK citizens elsewhere in the EU are yet to be finalised (see earlier answer).Sally Miller bought a house in Spain nine years ago and plans to retire there in the next five years.She asked how Brexit will affect this.Image copyright Getty Images The BBC's Kevin Connolly says: The issue of free movement - the rights of EU citizens to live and work in the UK - was a huge issue in the Brexit referendum of course, and will be a big part of the exit negotiations.We've heard quite a bit from the British side already with the government saying that securing the status and rights of EU nationals in the UK and UK nationals in the EU is one of the government's earliest priorities, and specifically that it is looking for a reciprocal deal.So you might feel the mood music is encouraging but all we can say for sure is that, while there are no guarantees yet, it will be a big part of the Brexit negotiations to come.Jonathan Eaton is a Briton living in the Netherlands with his wife, who is Dutch.He asks what rights to benefits and housing he will have if he has to return to the UK.Image copyright Getty Images BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith says: The short answer is there is no easy access to benefits.As it stands at the moment, Brexit aside, you will have to pass what's known as a habitual residence test which was introduced in 1994 and applies to British citizens just as EU citizens.The rules have been tightened up which means for some benefits, if you have been out of the country you can't even think about applying for the test for several months.For example, when it comes to jobseeker's allowance, you cannot even take the test to apply for those benefits for three months.And that was done to stop EU citizens coming here and just getting on benefits straight away.After three months, you can take the test which looks at your English language skills, what sort of efforts you made to find work before coming to the UK.It also considers how strong a tie you have to the UK, whether you have property or family here and what your intentions are in terms of staying and working, or returning.But once you have taken the test, if you pass it then you should be eligible to apply for a range of benefits, as long as you meet the usual requirements in terms of income and showing you are looking for work.That is likely to continue when we move fully on to Universal Credit.The one sort of unknown in the whole system is what happens with Brexit negotiations, in terms of guaranteeing the rights of British nationals abroad.And we simply don't know what that will involve and whether in any way that might impact on how soon you can apply for benefits when you come back to Britain.Will I have to buy a new passport and driving licence, and will my rights to use them freely across Europe be taken away from me after Brexit, asks Francis Lee.Image copyright Getty Images Kevin Connolly says: At the moment UK passports carry the words European Union and British driving licences have the blue square with yellow flags of the EU.That will presumably change after Brexit but it seems likely that the change will be phased in so that you'll simply get documents with the new design when the old ones expire.That's what happened, I seem to remember, when the UK joined the EU.Anything else would be expensive and risk flooding the system, after all.The right to use them freely is an interesting question.When we talk about restrictions on freedom of movement we generally mean the freedom to live and work in another country.If Britain poses restrictions on the EU in that respect then it can expect some kind of response.But in terms of tourism there are plenty of non-EU countries whose citizens can visit the UK for up to 90 days without a visa.And, as part of the Brexit negotiations, you'd expect similar arrangements to be discussed for the UK.Both sides need each others' tourists and, after all, if you can drive a car in the United States on a UK licence then it doesn't seem fanciful to assume that you'll be able to do the same in Europe in future.It is very clear that the PM and the government want to leave the tyranny of the European Court of Justice.Why has leaving the European Court of Human Rights (an organisation far more hated than the ECJ) been ignored, asks Barry Fryer.Image copyright Getty Images Kevin Connolly says: Two different courts here of course, so two different bits of politics.Crucially, the European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law.So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.Adrian Wallis runs a small electronics company and wants to know about export tariffs after Brexit, and what they'd mean for his business.Kevin Connolly says: As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs.That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free.On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own.That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU.Image copyright Thinkstock One bit of good news is that the UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU.That matters because in the period when the UK is negotiating a new trade deal with the EU, and that could take years, trade would be conducted under WTO rules.At the moment, for non-food items, that implies an average tariff of about 2.3%.But suppose the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, for example.Well, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars.In theory, an economist would say that creates a situation where everyone has an incentive to sort out a better deal for their consumers.The snag is that these things take years, if not decades.They tend to be done on a country-by-country and sector-by-sector basis.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then I'm afraid he's going to have to be patient.Maybe very, very patient.What impact will leaving the European Union have on the UK's long term political influence in Europe, asks Peter Hoare.Norman Smith says: There are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.My take is that not much is probably going to change.I say that because the UK'll still be a member of significant organisations such as the UN and Nato, and will still be co-operating with EU partners.For example, there will still be close ties on defence with the French.The UK will still be the same old Britain, will still have significant military force, will still be a wealthy country and will still be a nuclear power, so I don't think people will suddenly think the UK's an entirely different country.Are other countries likely to leave the EU and if so could we start a new free trade area, asks David John.Kevin Connolly says: Funnily enough, I was discussing this question just the other day with a French politician, a conservative and a real Europhile, and he said he thought if there was a free vote in France tomorrow, as the right wing National Front would like, that the French would vote to leave.But generally speaking I can't see much prospect of a tidal wave of insurrectionist, exitism sweeping the continent.When a country like Ireland has a spat with the EU about tax, for example, it does annoy Irish politicians, but most mainstream leaders in the Europe have grown up with the idea that the EU has brought peace and prosperity for decades.Image copyright Getty Images Lots of them see plenty that irritates them about the European Union, but they mainly argue that the benefits hugely outweigh the irritations.And in countries where you do find Euroscepticism, such as Poland and Hungary, there is also a healthy awareness that there are huge financial benefits to membership.As for the future, we will see.If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, I think it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Britain could perhaps join the Free Trade Association along with Norway, Lichtenstein and Switzerland.But of course it would be joining under existing rules, so the likeliest future for a post-Brexit UK, I think, is a future where it tries to do the best deal possible with the EU and then looks around for other free trade deals.But that would fall short of creating a free trade area based on the UK itself.What will happen to the borders in Gibraltar and Northern Ireland, asks Nigel May.Kevin Connolly says: I think the question of what is going to happen to borders after Brexit is one of the most difficult of the lot.Since 1985 when Spain joined the EU, it has basically been prevented from closing the border with Gibraltar as a way of applying pressure to the British territory.In fact, 12,000 Spanish people cross into the territory to work every day and the area of Spain around Gibraltar is a pretty depressed area so they are important jobs.On the other hand, the Spanish have talked openly about this being an opportunity to get Gibraltar back.Jose Manuel Garcia-Margallo, its minister of foreign affairs, said in September the UK's vote to leave the EU was "a unique historical opportunity in more than three hundred years to get Gibraltar back".But at a minimum, as things stand, it looks to me as though they could certainly re-impose border controls if they chose to.Image copyright Getty Images The situation with Ireland's border is more complex.For those of us for whom Northern Ireland is home, the total disappearance of military check points on the border is one of the most tangible daily reminders of the end of the Troubles and no one wants a border like that back.But, when the day comes when Ireland is in the EU and the UK is not, then the Irish border of course is also going to be the UK's land border with the European Union.Conservative leader Theresa May has said we don't see a return to the borders of the past, but the reality is that if Britain leaves the common customs area, then presumably some sort of checks are going to be necessary on that border.And if the UK wants to stop Polish or Romanian migrant workers using Dublin airport as a back door into the UK, then it is going to have to do something about that too.The UK has published a paper setting out its preferred options.Of course, what it will all mean for towns and villages like Belleek and Belcoo in County Fermanagh, which more or less straddle the border, is hard to imagine.How will access to healthcare change for expats living in the EU, asks Veronique Bradley, who lives in Italy.Kevin Connolly says: Healthcare is one of those issues that remains relatively simple as long as the UK remains in the EU.It is just part of a range of citizens' rights that apply across the entire union.After Brexit, I suppose there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.What will happen to EU nationals who lived and worked in the UK and now receive a British state pension, asks Peter Barz, a German citizen living in the UK.Norman Smith says: If you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Image copyright Getty Images Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, "I paid in there", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Is it possible to be both an EU citizen and not an EU citizen, asks Declan O'Neill, who holds an Irish passport.Kevin Connolly says: I should probably declare some sort of interest here as a dual Irish and British national myself.Of course, anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.Image copyright Getty Images The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.Is there a get-out clause for Article 50, asks Gillian Coates.Norman Smith says: I think the honest answer is you would have to be a legal eagle to answer this.But my take on it is that legally it looks like once we trigger Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.Image copyright Thinkstock However, in the real world I think it is likely to be rather different, whatever the legal protocol.I think the truth is, if we were trundling along and decided it was all going to be catastrophic and we have got to pull up the handbrake pretty sharpish, a lot of other EU countries would be probably be laughing at us, but I think at the same time they would probably be quite pleased we weren't going.So I think the short answer is: legally, it doesn't look so good if you want to get out of it, but politically, it probably can be done with the support of other European leaders.Eric Degerland asks when UK passports are going to change.Kevin Connolly says: This takes us to the heart of an issue that lots of people really care about.It will be a real and palpable sign of Brexit when there is a new UK passport without the words "European Union" on the front cover.Sadly, the short answer is we don't really know when the change will come about.Image copyright Getty Images But we can say that the cheapest thing for the government to do would be to phase in the new passports as people's old ones expire.So if you're looking forward to getting back that blue hard-back passport we had in the old days, you may have a long time to wait.The BBC's Reality Check team answered some of your questions about Theresa May's plans for EU citizens living in the UK.Will Irish citizens be exempt from this five-year residency requirement, and continue to be afforded equal treatment with UK nationals?Yes, Irish citizens residing in the UK will not need to apply for settled status to protect their entitlements as the UK government is committed to protecting the Common Travel Area arrangements.Would EU citizens still be able to move to the UK in the next two years until March 2019?Yes, they would.The UK is a member of the EU until it withdraws, so the freedom of movement rules will apply until then.Why shouldn't British courts have full jurisdiction over the rights of EU citizens living in the UK?Wasn't that the whole point of Brexit?The UK government says the European Court of Justice will not have jurisdiction over EU citizens' rights.The EU demands that it does.This is an important sticking point in the Brexit negotiations.How can a lifetime stay be guaranteed?Could a future government change the law?Once the UK leaves the EU, any future government will in principle be able to propose amendments to the rules and the UK Parliament would decide on the new law.I plan to retire to France within the next two years and buy a property.Will this be possible after Brexit?You can buy property and retire anywhere in the world, subject to the rules of the country you are retiring in.So, you'll be able to do that but we don't know what your exact rights will be until the UK and EU conclude the citizens' rights negotiations.I'm an EU national living in the UK but my wife is from outside the EU.Is her status going to change?Your wife, as a family member of an eligible EU citizen who has been resident in the UK before we leave the EU, will also be eligible to apply for settled status with you, provided that she too meets the settlement criteria and has been in a genuine relationship with you while resident in the UK.

Guide: 2017 political party conferences:::::Autumn sees Britain's political parties gathering by the sea - or in big city conference centres - here's a round-up of this year's.Conservatives - 1-4 October in Manchester Image copyright PA The most memorable moments of the 2017 Conservative conference came at the very end, in a speech more eventful than Theresa May and her team could have imagined.The prime minister was plagued by a cough which left her relying on gulps of water - and even a cough sweet handed to her by the chancellor - to complete some lines.If that wasn't bad enough, prankster Simon Brodkin had somehow gained access to the conference floor and handed her a mocked-up P45."I was about to talk about somebody I'd like to give a P45 to, and that's Jeremy Corbyn," the PM quipped, to cheers from the party faithful.It didn't end there - some of the letters fell off the conference stage backdrop behind her, leaving it as: "Building a country that works or everyon."The speech had been billed as the PM's attempt to reassert her authority after the ill-fated snap general election and reports of splits in her cabinet over Brexit.It also contained policy pledges on social housing and a cap on standard tariff energy bills, while Home Secretary Amber Rudd announced a ban on acid sales to under 18s and a tightening of the laws on viewing terrorist content online.In his speech, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - who has been accused of undermining the PM with his interventions on Brexit strategy - said it was time to "let the British lion roar".Mrs May ended the conference being publicly supported by her MPs and ministers although there were reports of "emerging plots" among some MPs.Labour - 24-27 September in Brighton Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption In full: Jeremy Corbyn's 75 minute speech Jeremy Corbyn ended Labour's week in Brighton with a speech to delegates in which he claimed the party was "on the threshold of power".The centre ground of British politics had shifted, he argued, and his Labour Party was now in the "political mainstream" because its polices were "what most people in our country actually want".He used the speech to announce some new policies - such as rent controls and curbs on gentrification - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another election campaign, with the Tory government "hanging by a thread".His supporters in the hall loved it, although they were chanting "Oh, Jeremy Corbyn" for a full two minutes before he had even begun.This conference cemented Mr Corbyn's dominance of the party, following his better-than-expected general election result.There was a row about Brexit, with moderate MPs, who want Mr Corbyn to commit to keeping the UK in the single market and customs union, feeling they had been denied a vote on this issue and the chance to debate it more fully.And Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell caused a stir when he warned Labour must prepare for all eventualities in government, including a possible run on the pound.But delegates approved changes to the way leaders are elected, which could make it easier to elect a left-wing successor to Mr Corbyn.SNP - 8-10 October in Glasgow Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Opening her conference speech, Nicola Sturgeon says: "At the risk of tempting fate, I have come prepared" SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon insisted her party will "always make the case for independence" as she used her keynote speech to focus on domestic priorities rather than constitutional matters.Although the Scottish government has delayed plans for a second independence referendum, Ms Sturgeon said her party still had a mandate for a vote on the issue.The "essence of independence", she told activists, was being "in the driving seat and not simply at the mercy of events" as she stressed the case for leaving the UK did not merely hinge on Brexit.Her headline policy announcement was a plan to set up a publicly-owned, not-for-profit energy company by 2021.She argued the venture would give people - particularly on low incomes - more choice of which supplier to use with energy sold at "close to cost price as possible".Spending on early-years childcare in Scotland will be doubled to 840m by 2020, a move the SNP said would be "truly transformational", while there will be a new scheme to provide free sanitary products in schools, colleges and universities from next August.Liberal Democrats - 16-19 September in Bournemouth Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Liberal Democrat conference: Sir Vince Cable's full speech The Liberal Democrats gathered by the seaside having modestly increased their tally of MPs to 12 in the recent general election, following an electoral drubbing in 2015 that left them with just eight.In his keynote speech to conference, new leader Sir Vince Cable said he could lead the Lib Dems back to power by offering a mix of "hope and realism".He called for higher taxes on foreign property speculators and second home owners to help tackle inequality.And he claimed Brexit would be an act of "masochism", leaving the UK poorer.UKIP - 29-30 September in Torquay Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Mr Bolton won the UKIP leadership contest with 30% of the vote UKIP members met for a two-day conference in which new leader Henry Bolton was crowned.The former soldier, who saw off challenges from better-known candidates, told members: "Brexit is our core task.However it is not the end of the line."Controversial anti-Islam candidate Anne Marie Waters finished second.Some MEPs had threatened to quit if she had won.UKIP's share of the vote in the general election collapsed to just 1.8%, prompting the resignation of then-leader Paul Nuttall.Green Party - 7-10 October in Harrogate Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Greens told to look on the bright side after disappointing election Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley spoke of the "hurt" he and others felt at the party's loss of ground in June's election, where its vote share more than halved.While the Greens had suffered at the hands of the two-party system in England and Wales, he said it could be proud of the causes it had espoused and the influence it had had on debates around austerity and fracking.Through its national and local representation, he said the party would stick up for the "little guy" as it made the case for far-reaching economic change.He called for more public input into the funding of services, locally controlled energy schemes and bank investment in "community bonds".Plaid Cymru - 20-21 October in Caernarfon Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Leanne Wood said Plaid Cymru had "the ambition to show a new way for Wales" Leanne Wood vowed to stay on as leader of Plaid Cymru at the party's conference.She told the conference they needed to earn the trust of non-Plaid Cymru voters whilst announcing the party could back a second Brexit referendum if there was no deal with the EU by March 2019.Ms Wood also announced proposals to re-train manual workers whose jobs are threatened by automation and promised a "rail revolution".The party saw a drop in their share of the vote in June's general election, although they gained a seat.Meanwhile Plaid Cymru AM Neil McEvoy, who was suspended from the party following a row over policy on council house sales, dismissed suggestions he was planning a leadership challenge at a fringe meeting.
Boris Johnson statement after Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe comments:::::Video Boris Johnson is to visit Iran later this year, he has told the House of Commons, after apologising to Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe over his previous comments which could and should have been clearer".The foreign secretary said all MPs had "deep concern" about the case, and would want to join him in "urging the Iranian authorities to release her on humanitarian grounds".He said "the government has no doubt" that Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was on holiday when arrested in April 2016, and that the humanitarian case to release her was so overwhelming.
CBI: 'Pick up the pace' on Brexit talks:::::Video CBI director-general Carolyn Fairbairn says businesses in both the UK and Europe want faster Brexit negotiations to provide the certainty needed to protect jobs.
