Proposed changes to frequent-flyer programmes may be bad news for budget travellers:::::ALONGSIDE Eurocrats, straight bananas and anyone who opposes Brexit, Britains tabloid press has found something new to hate this year: British Airways (BA).Britains flag carrier has been criticised for cutting legroom in economy, axeing free food and drink on short-haul flights andhorror of horrorthe amuse bouche that used to be served before dinner in first class.To save face, this week BAs chief executive, Alex Cruz, who has come under sustained criticism for the cuts to service quality, announced that the carrier would be tarting up its offer.This would include more free meals, better Wi-Fi and 72 new planes.Were bringing back the glory days, Mr Cruz proudly crowed.But not all of the improvements may be as good for frequent flyers as he advertised.Among the changes planned for 2018, BA is moving to so-called dynamic award pricing in Executive Club, its loyalty programme.This means that tickets paid for with points from the programme will be no longer calculated in distance, but the cost BA is selling the ticket at.Air France-KLM, a rival legacy carrier, also announced similar changes as part of an overhaul of its Flying Blue loyalty programme.Starting in April, in addition to dynamic award pricing, members of the scheme will also earn points based on how much they spend on a ticket rather than how far they fly.Upgrade your inbox Receive our Daily Dispatch and Editors' Picks newsletters.This shift will fundamentally change the relationship between loyalty-programme members and airlines.Instead of earning miles as a function of distance travelled, passengers will soon be rewarded for spending the most money.And instead of published tiers dictating the price of an award ticket, the way loyalty programmes traditionally managed the fares, dynamic pricing will allow the required points needed for a free flight to fluctuate dramatically as the retail price of the ticket changes.There is no doubt that the changes will shrink the loyalty programmes to focus on those that tend to be high spenders on tickets.But from the airlines perspective, a smaller scheme with fewer potential liabilities is what is necessary to compete with the likes of Norwegian, a low-cost carrier with much lower overheads.The impact of these changes will gradually be felt by BA and Air Frances frequent flyers, as the incoming stream of miles slows to a trickle and as it becomes more expensive to swap points for free flights.Such schemes used to be a key part of their strategy to keep passengers coming back to them, rather than change to budget airlines that offer lower fares but leaner offerings for frequent flyers.The question that remains is whether BA and other legacy carriers are sacrificing the very thing that keeps their passengers away from the clutches of Norwegian and the like.
Japan’s top two lavatory-makers are at last making inroads overseas:::::WHEN staff at the Louvre in Paris head to the bathroom, the toilet lid opens as they approach, a warm seat heats their derrires , and, once done, their nether regions are washed and dried precisely.Selling the equipment is a coup for Toto, Japans biggest producer of shower toilets.Toto and its rival Lixil carve up the Japanese market for fancy, multi-function loos between them.At home they have market shares of 60% and 30% respectively, according to Nomura Securities, a brokerage.Yet they have struggled to win foreign bottoms over to luxuries enjoyed in Japan for many decades.Upgrade your inbox Receive our Daily Dispatch and Editors' Picks newsletters.Today 26% of Totos and 30% of Lixils revenues come from abroad (much of it from products other than shower toilets).The Japanese market is profitable, but their loos are already ubiquitous there (including in public facilities, from Tokyos metro system to remote hiking trails); the majority of domestic sales come from the renovation of private homes and hotels.And whereas Japans population is declining, in other countries sanitaryware is a rapidly growing market as people get richer, says Daisuke Fukushima of Nomura Securities.But it is not an easy sell abroad.In Japan, shower toilets appeal because of their heated seats in dwellings that are usually kept cold, and due to a Japanese obsession with hygiene and a horror of inconveniencing others (some models play music to hide noises).Other cultures are less stringent.And the toilets are expensive; Totos Neorest model ranges in price from 270,000-540,000 ($2,365-$4,730), before tax.Toto and Lixil differ in their approaches to these challenges.Toto is expanding under its own name, opening showrooms and getting its loos into hotels and buildings where lots of people will see them.People have to experience it to want to buy it, says Madoka Kitamura, its president, who wants to create Toto fans.In contrast, Lixil, formed in 2011 by a merger of five Japanese companies, is buying foreign competitors.In 2013 it acquired American Standard and a year later Grohe, a German bathroom-fittings giant.It sells a high-tech toilet under the Grohe brand.Lixils strategy is sensible.It does not have quite the same brand recognition as Toto.Kinya Seto, its president, who took over last year, readily admits that Toto currently betters it abroad as well as at home.He is trying to make the company a little less Japanese, whereas Toto is more culturally conservative (a motto, take pride in your work and strive to do your best, is recited by every worker in every factory every day to aid team-building).Mixing Japanese technology and Grohes European design could give an edge.Lixil is also casting its net wider in terms of products.Toto is putting more emphasis on those that are not available abroadmeaning high-tech lavatories.In some countries, such as India, Lixil is selling (and donating) basic, cheap kitplastic pans to use with pit latrinesbetting that in several years people will get richer and upgrade.No market can match the potential of China, yet many mainlanders opt for products from lower down the price range.So for near-term profits, the two companies are looking to America and Europe.There they encounter obstacles such as strict regulations (on water use, say), an absence of sockets in bathrooms and the lack of a wet culture beyond southern Europe.But Totos positioning of its toilets in America as better for the environment is going down well.And Lixil launched a new Grohe-branded shower toilet worldwide last year which is selling particularly well in Germany.It is designed to look good from the side (Japanese toilets are usually in a separate tiny room, so are seen only from above) and is made from ceramic (in Japan plastic seats are the norm).Aficionados will be glad that other features, such as a remote-control panel with multiple buttons and anatomical diagrams, remain the same.Correction (November 10th 2017): The original version of this article suggested that Lixil was smaller than Toto; Lixil is bigger in terms of revenues overall.This has been corrected.
Trouble for the AT&T-Time Warner deal:::::THE titans of media in America have decided this is an opportune moment to join together in mega-mergers, the better to take on the giants of Silicon Valley.The problem for them is that the Department of Justice (DoJ), and President Donald Trump himself, are less keen.On November 8th reports surfaced that the DoJ is preparing to block a proposed $109bn acquisition by AT&T of Time Warner, owner of CNN, HBO and the Warner Brothers film studioa deal that was announced a year ago and which had been expected to win approval by the end of 2017.The DoJ have reportedly told AT&T executives that to get the merger through they would have to sell off assets: either Time Warners Turner Broadcasting division, including CNN, which Mr Trump has repeatedly attacked as fake news, or DirecTV, the wireless giants satellite-TV business.Randall Stephenson, AT&Ts chief executive, said on November 8th he would not sell CNN to secure the deal.Upgrade your inbox Receive our Daily Dispatch and Editors' Picks newsletters.Time Warners share price fell by 6.5% in one day, to nearly $20 below the agreed acquisition price of $107.50 per share.A possible court battle looms, at a time when other industry players are eyeing consolidation.It was also reported this week that Disney has had talks with 21st Century Fox about buying much of the group; although the discussions ended inconclusively, Rupert Murdoch and his sons, James and Lachlan, who together oversee Fox, may be open to the idea of selling.The travails of AT&T and Time Warner could give clues to the fate of other possible media deals.Some suggest politics is at work: that Mr Trump intervened with the DoJ to scuttle a deal that he criticised during his election campaign as a symbol of unfair concentration of media power.But if Mr Trump is not directly involved, what else is going on?The acquisition does not involve conventional antitrust concerns, in that it is a vertical integration of distribution (wireless, broadband and satellite-TV) and content (TV networks, HBO and films).In the past the DoJ has been more concerned with horizontal mergers that create market dominance in one industry.Yet there is legitimate reason for scrutiny.AT&Ts commanding presence in distribution, especially in wirelessit has but one like-sized rival, Verizonraises the potential for abuse as it sells content.It is true that regulators could seek a promise from AT&T that it not favour its own networks, such as HBO, and that it not discriminate against rival companies networks as it sets carriage terms.Similar assurances were extracted from Comcast when it bought NBC Universal in 2011, a vertical merger that went through.But it is difficult to enforce such behavioural conditions.Nor would a forced sale of assets necessarily solve competition issues.Selling DirecTV would not dent the carriers strength in wireless.Selling the Turner networks would still leave AT&T with the firms most valuable content brand, HBO.Either sale might be so onerous to execute, however, that it would probably stop the merger.Whatever the DoJ decides, the logic of mergers remains.Netflix delivers content to 109m customers; Amazon is doing the same for tens of millions of Prime customers.To compete in the future TV market, media executives believe that they need to achieve scale in both distribution and content.They may have persuaded Wall Street of their case but not, it seems, the right people in Washington, DC.
Publishers are wary of Facebook and Google but must work with them:::::IN RECENT months Google and Facebook have made changes that may escape the notice of most of their billions of users, but not of news organisations.Facebook began displaying the logos of publishers in some of its posts, so readers can identify the news source.And Google for the first time gave publishers the ability to control how many times the search engines users can visit news sites free of charge.Both will directly help papers to sell subscriptions.To critics of the social-media giants, that might look like wolves offering to help the sheep while still feasting on the herd.The business of both Facebook and Alphabet, parent of Google and YouTube, is to occupy peoples time and attention with their free services and content, and to sell ads against those eyeballs.For them, quality journalism is just another hook.Upgrade your inbox Receive our Daily Dispatch and Editors' Picks newsletters.Facebook calls its News Feed offering its most important product, but in recent years it has tweaked the feed in ways that de-emphasise actual news, instead prioritising updates from friends and family over those from publishers.The associated ad revenues for many publishers have been either nominal, in the case of Facebooks fast-loading instant articles, or as yet mostly non-existent, in the case of videos they make for the social network.News sites have found they have no choice but to work with the two tech giants, however: Facebook, with its 2bn users, and Google, which directs 10bn clicks a month to publishers, are where their readers are.So there is no confusion about where the power lies.That is unlikely to change much in future, although publishers are fighting back a bit.In America a consortium of nearly 2,000 news organisations, the News Media Alliance, is asking Congress for an antitrust exemption to allow publishers to negotiate collectively with the two firms.David Chavern, the consortiums president, lists some of the demands: more ad revenue; the sharing of data about their audiences on the tech platforms; better branding for publishers, as the use of logos is very limited (people simply say, I read that on Facebook, says Mr Chavern); and support for subscriptions.That the tech giants are making concessions on some of these points may be because they sense that the political mood is turning against them in America and in Europe, or because of genuine concern for the media ecosystem.Recently Google News Lab, formed in 2015, helped fund Report for America, which will put an initial 18 reporters in small-town newsrooms across the country, with more to come in future years.Facebook started a Journalism Project in January to help develop news products in collaboration with newsrooms.Several newspaper executives say Googles dealings with them seemed more sincere than Facebooks.But both firms changes to click-through policies are significant.Googles old policy for users directed to make their first visit to a newspaper website was called first click free, but it actually gave users three free clicks on a newspapers site every day.As more publishers put up paywalls online, they lobbied Google to limit free access.Google prefers an entirely free, open webthe better for searching and for ad placementsbut in the end it relented.Were pleased that the conversation has moved on from this ideological position that all content should be free, says an executive at the Wall Street Journal , which charges readers for digital access.Earlier this year the Journal opted out of first click free and experienced a 50% decline in traffic from Google.It also saw a quadrupling of conversions to subscription among those who came to the site and hit the paywall.To the Journal , both data points confirmed the sheer power of tech platforms over publishers.As for Facebook, users today get all instant articles free of charge.It has signed up ten publishers (including The Economist ) for a trial that gives some users of Facebooks mobile app access to ten free instant articles per month but then sends them to a publishers paywall.Even so, many readers are not likely to encounter one.Media executives at firms that rely more on selling ads than subscriptions are more enthusiastic about Facebook and Google.We see them as a friend, says Paul Zwillenberg, chief executive of Britains Daily Mail and General Trust, owner of the Daily Mail .Mail Online has doubled daily visitors and engagement in part by making videos for Facebook and YouTube.That does not mean giving up on direct internet traffic (on which Mail Online can sell ads without sharing revenue with Facebook or Google).About 35% of Mail Onlines traffic in America still comes directly to the news sites homepage, or front door, according to SimilarWeb, an analytics firm, which is slightly higher than the rate for the homepages of the biggest American papers.But selling digital ads on their own websites is a challenge for most news organisations, in part because of the competition from the duopoly.Facebook and Alphabet will take the majority of all digital-ad revenue globally this year, and, by some measures, have recently taken 80-90% of the growth in such revenue.Their data on users browsing activities give them a huge advantage in micro-targeting users.Wherever journalism turns, Facebook and Google loom large.Their recent moves, although welcome to many publishers, are unlikely to alter the trajectory of the relationship.Correction (November 10th 2017): Facebooks Journalism Project aims to help develop news products in collaboration with newsrooms, not newspapers as the original article stated.
Regulators begin to tackle the craze for initial coin offerings:::::IM GONNA make a $hit t$n of money on August 2nd on the Stox.com ICO.Written in July on Instagram, these words made Floyd Mayweather, a boxer, the first big celebrity to endorse an initial coin offering, a form of crowdfunding that issues cryptographic coins, or tokens.Stox, an online prediction market, went on to raise more than $30m, some of which seems to have gone directly into Mr Mayweathers pocket.Other VIPs, including Paris Hilton, a socialite, followed suit and endorsed ICOs.But this source of easy cash may now be drying up: on November 1st Americas Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) warned that such promotions may be unlawful, if celebrities fail to disclose what they receive in return.The endorsements and the SECs attempt to rein them in are the latest episodes of token mania.Virtually unknown a year ago, ICOs are now more celebrated than initial public offerings (IPOs), the conventional way of floating a firm.Over the past 12 months $3.3bn has been raised in more than 200 ICOs, according to Coinschedule, a data providercompared with only about $70m in the same period a year ago.This surge is one reason for the boom in bitcoin, a crypto-currency, which was worth around $7,500 on November 2nd.As Benjamin Lawsky, a former securities regulator in New York, put it recently: Regulators have never seen a new financial product explode with the speed and velocity [of ICOs].Upgrade your inbox Receive our Daily Dispatch and Editors' Picks newsletters.Unsurprisingly, supervisors have stepped in.China and South Korea, where ICOs had become part of the local gambling culture, have already outlawed them.Many regulators in Western countries have by now made clear that they consider at least some of the coins (or tokens) that are distributed in an ICO to be securities, which need to be regulated as such, with all that this entails in disclosure and other requirements.Leading the pack, the SEC said in a report on the DAO, an ill-fated early ICO, that offerings of this kind need to be registered (or apply for an exemption).But big regulatory problems remain unsolved.The most pressing open question is what a token really represents, says Peter van Valkenburgh of Coin Centre, a think-tank.Technically, the answer is straightforward, at least for those familiar with crypto-currencies.Tokens are mostly entries on Ethereum, a blockchain, or distributed ledger, copies of which live on many connected computers around the worldmuch like the one that underlies bitcoin.The Ethereum ledger, however, not only keeps track of a currency, called ether, but hosts what are known as smart contracts, programs that encode business rules.Investors send ether to an ICOs smart contract, which generates tokens that can be traded.The ICOs issuer can keep the ether, and use the funds to develop its project.Legally, things are more complicated, says Kevin Werbach of Wharton, a business school at the University of Pennsylvania.The SEC, for instance, argues that the technology is irrelevant: when tokens are used to raise funds, they are securities.By contrast, champions of ICOs hold that, although they are initially used to raise funds, they also often have a function in the projects they finance and hence should be treated differently.In Filecoin, an online market for digital storage that raised a record $257m, the tokens will be used to pay or get paid for space on disk drives.Tokens of affection Most issuers will have a hard time convincing the SEC and other regulators that theirs is a utility token.For many existing firms, such as Kik, a messaging app, which raised nearly $100m, raising funds seems the priority.For other issuers the problem is that the tokens they are selling are for projects that exist only on paper, and so have no other function than to bring in money.And most investors currently buy tokens not for their utility, but because they are betting that their value will rocket.To avoid the heaviest regulation, issuers are keeping the lawyers busy.One increasingly popular legal construct in America is called SAFT (Simple Agreement for Future Tokens)in effect, options to buy tokens, rather than tokens themselves, thus dodging the problem posed by projects that do not yet use the tokens.As raising money gets harder, marketing becomes more important.One result is the pre-sale, in which early investors often get a big discount to help boost demand for the ICO.A second big open question is where tokens will fit into the regulatory landscape.Being pieces of code, they can take on the form of any financial product.They collapse all asset classes into one, says Lex Sokolin of Autonomous Research, a consultancy.This will cause legal friction, particularly in America, where different asset classes are regulated by different agencies.Other jurisdictions are easier to navigate.Many crypto firms are based in Zug, Switzerland, where they can save taxes and tokens are less likely to be considered securities.In January a distributed-ledger technology framework will go into effect in Gibraltar (although it does not specifically address ICOs).A big unknown is China which, despite its ICO ban, is clearly interested in all things crypto, as long as it can control them.And third, there is the question of how the organisations financed by ICOs will be governed.Finding robust solutions is vital: many of these entities see themselves as a new type of firm.The idea is that because founders, employees and users all hold tokens, their incentives are aligned: all have an interest in expanding their network, which will drive up the tokens value.These organisations will be decentralised, meaning that no single group will be in charge, and they will be managed, at least partially, by smart contracts to keep them on track.Making all this work will be hard, as shown by the case of Tezos, which raised $232m to finance the development of another blockchain.Its version will come with a sophisticated governance mechanism to avoid the problems that beset bitcoin, which in August split in two when developers and firms that cryptographically mint (mine) the currency disagreed on the way forward.(A further fork was just called off.)Holders of Tezos tokens will get a vote commensurate with their holdings or be able to delegate it to someone else.Ironically, though, Tezos is the first substantial token-financed organisation that has run into serious governance problems.The founders opted for a complex legal structure, which involves a Swiss foundation that controls the proceeds of the ICO.They are now embroiled in a public quarrel with the head of this foundation over how it should be run.Moreover, the founders and others involved are being sued by an ICO contributor for alleged breaches of securities law, which Tezos denies.Tezoss travails, as well as the general token mania, have pushed some issuers to rethink.Blockstack, whose ICO will start on November 13th, will do without a pre-sale, instead giving users a discount.It has turned itself into a public-benefit corporation, obliged to pursue the public good as well as profit.The firm, which has also said it wont raise more than $110m, has a lofty ambition: to develop software and services to bring the internet, now dominated by a few tech giants, back to its decentralised roots.If Blockstack runs into trouble, too, the very concept of distributed organisations may be at risk.Correction (November 10th, 2017): A previous version of this piece said that Blockstack was expected to beat Filecoins fundraising record of $257m.The company has said it would not raise more than $110m.This has been amended.
A German hardware giant tries to become an ultra-secure tech platform:::::BOSCH is everywhere.It has 440 subsidiaries and employs 400,000 people in 60 countries.Its technology opens Londons Tower Bridge and closes packets of crisps and biscuits in factories from India to Mexico.Analysts call it a car-parts maker: it is the worlds largest, making everything from fuel-injection pumps to windscreen wipers.Consumers know it for white goods and power tools synonymous with Made in Germany solidity.The company itself prefers to be called a supplier of technology and services, or the IoT [internet-of-things] company.On a hill overlooking Stuttgart, robotic lawnmowers whizz around its headquarters and a window displays dishwashers and blenders.Inside are signs of a company in transition: posters call on staff to rip off ties, celebrate error-culture and just do it opposite a quote from Robert Bosch, the founder: Whatever is made in my name must be both first-class and faultless.Upgrade your inbox Receive our Daily Dispatch and Editors' Picks newsletters.The 130-year-old giants attempts to become more like a tech company reflect a world where value comes increasingly from software, services and data, not things.When software and hardware meet, as they do in the field of autonomous cars or the IoTs world of internet-connected objects, manufacturers risk becoming mere commodity suppliers.Part of Boschs answer is to position itself as a trusted custodian of data.Orwells 1984 is kindergarten compared to the IoT-world.When it comes, and people re-evaluate privacy, Bosch will be prepared, says Peter Schnaebele, its head of smart homes.Soft power as well as hard Bosch is 92%-owned by a foundation, freeing it to invest in long-term innovation.In 2016 it spent nearly a tenth of its revenue of 73bn ($85bn) on R&D.Recently it opened a glitzy research campus in Renningen.It also has a 420m venture fund and a startup incubator.In a converted warehouse in Ludwigsburg, north of Stuttgart, six teams of former employees work to turn more radical ideas into businesses.Volkmar Denner, its CEO, says that he still sees Boschs future as a product company, but one that is heavily involved in software and middleware and that provides services on top.It has invested in software; built a platform (on which it runs IoT services and apps and allows other firms to do the same), called Bosch IoT suite; and last year launched its own cloud and data centre.That is unusual; two other industrial giants, General Electric and Siemens, use Amazons cloud to run their platforms.Bosch says it is seeking greater speed, flexibility and data security.It plans to open several more centres next year.Boschs mantra is to increase the value of hardware with a 3S strategy: sensors, software and services.Over half of its electrical-product classes are web-enabled; by 2020 all should be.Among its more telling bets is a 1bn investment in a semiconductor plant in Dresden for chips and sensors, to act as the eyes and ears of the IoT.The long-term prize will be to use the data to teach things to thinkby, for example, training the lawnmowers to respond to unexpected objects.The company last year started an artificial-intelligence (AI) centre, with 100 employees in Bangalore, Palo Alto and Renningen.Because machines will be only as smart as the data they are fed, Boschwhich already hosts over 100,000 terabytes annually (1 terabyte fills 1,428 CD-Roms)is gathering as much as it can.It crunches data from some British Gas customers to anticipate energy-maintenance needs, for example; data also pour in from factory floors and farmers fields filled with sensors.Today we sell products and practically dont have to care for them again becausebeing German-madetheyll last, says Christoph Peylo, Boschs head of AI.But in future products may need updating every two weeks, so perhaps well charge by volume of data, not hardware.Coup, an electric-scooter sharing scheme in Berlin and Paris (pictured), has no Bosch hardware at all.The company just provides the platform and buys the scooters in from Taiwan.It is Boschs first direct-to-consumer business in mobility.This arealoosely, anything that involves getting people from point A to point Bis crucial to Bosch, generating over half its revenue.The firm invests 400m per year in electro-mobility, or developing parts for electric cars, bikes, charging stations and so on.Some 3,000 developers work on driver-assistance systems.It holds nearly 1,000 patents for automated driving and by 2019 expects to make 2bn from driver assistance (double what it earned in 2016).Sharing economy Whether it is cars or the IoT, partnerships have become an efficient way to innovate.It was not always in the companys culture to share with outsiders, says Lothar Baum, a data scientist at the firm.Indeed, Bosch is still seen by many as too conservative, cautious and cost-sensitive.But it is making connections with all sorts of other companies; from a map-building partnership with Apollo, a Chinese platform owned by Baidu, to working with Tesla on autonomous cars, to a deal with Amazon to use Alexaits voice-controlled computerto steer Bosch smart-home systems.Especially in the pre-competitive stage, sharing makes sense, says Mr Baum.The big unknown is what will happen in the competitive stage.The race among leading IoT platforms is wide open.Eric Lamarre of McKinsey, a consultancy, divides the field into the horizontal tech platforms, such as Amazon; the more vertical manufacturers, such as Bosch and GE; and startup platforms.This is when questions around data become critical.Bosch thinks that customers will soon value data more than they do today.At the launch of the Bosch IoT Cloud Mr Denner noted that many companies and consumers say data-security concerns stop them using cloud technologies and connectivity products, offering its own cloud as an answer.The firm hopes that manufacturing nous will still count for something, too.Even in a super-connected world you dont want to be surrounded by shoddy devices which are cheaply built, says Mr Peylo.Last month Boschs smart security camera won the German Design Award; its white goods are selling like hot cakes in Asia.The company will continue to make non-shoddy products and to put its sensors into factories, homes and cars.It will almost certainly remain a big part of the T in IoT.The question is whether it can become far more than that.
3G Capital, magicians of the consumer industry, need to learn a new act:::::OCCASIONALLY a business idea emerges that is so simple you cannot believe it works.Consider the five founders of 3G Capital, an investment firm.Warren Buffett co-invests with them and calls them among the best businessmen in the world.They use debt to buy consumer-product firms, then they revamp their brands and slash costs.In total, since 1997, they have launched $470bn of deals, through 3G Capital or earlier entities (for simplicity this article lumps these all together and calls them 3G).That makes 3G the second most acquisitive organisation in modern history.It sells every Budweiser slurped, Whopper burger munched and bottle of Heinz ketchup squirted on the planet.Yet despite its superb long-term record, 3G is losing steam.In the past two years its total portfolio has lagged slightly behind the S&P 500 index, Schumpeter estimates.Its two biggest firms, AB InBev, a beer giant, and Kraft Heinz, a food company, have returned 6% and 16% respectively, well behind the S&P 500 (29%) and a basket of 20 big rivals (24%).On November 1st shares in Kraft fell after poor results.Once, 3G seemed to be reinventing the consumer industry.Now a better description is that it brilliantly took advantage of a window of opportunity that is closing.Upgrade your inbox Receive our Daily Dispatch and Editors' Picks newsletters.By their own description 3Gs founders started out, in Brazil, as mere finance guys.The first big deal was the acquisition of Brahma, a local beer firm, in 1989.In the booze industry they bought Interbrew in 2004, Anheuser-Busch, maker of Budweiser, in 2008, and SAB Miller in 2016.The resulting beer colossus, AB InBev, is Europes third most valuable company.In the food business, 3G took control of Heinz in 2013 in partnership with Mr Buffett.Heinz then bought Kraft in 2015, and the combined firm tried and failed to buy Unilever in February.3G also controls Burger King, which it has merged with Tim Hortons, a Canadian fast-food chain where hypothermic Torontonians huddle in winter.3G is expert at zero-based budgeting, a technique that involves scrutinising consumer firms bloated costs.But its magic rests on two simple insights formed decades ago.First, it noted that although the cost of debt financing was low, the yield on consumer firms shares was quite high, meaning a juicy spread.Second, conventional managers underestimated how resilient consumer-product firms sales are thanks to strong brands and oligopolistic market shares.So costs could be cut (including marketing) without prompting a fall in the top line.The takeover of Anheuser-Busch, worth $62bn, shows these principles in action.The deal was mostly financed by debt with an annual post-tax cost of 3%.The firm being bought yielded 6% (its annual cashflow after capital spending, as a share of its market capitalisation plus net borrowings).Cost cuts eventually lifted that return to 8%.Normally such high leverage is reckless, because profits are volatile.But Anheuser was different.It had a 48% market share in America, with famous brands that people would keep chugging come hell or high water.After the 2007-08 financial crisis, share prices and interest rates fell, pushing the gap between the cost of debt and consumer firms yields wider still.3G pursued big deals around the world, eventually paying $123bn in 2016 for London-listed SAB Miller.Those two original insights are getting tired, though.First, the gap between the cost of debt and the yield of consumer firms has narrowed as their market values have risen.The median yield for a basket of 20 big consumer firms has fallen from 7% in 2010 to 4% now, making deals less profitable.Some firms are pricier than they would otherwise be because their share prices reflect speculation that 3G might make a bid.Mondelez and others have all been rumoured targets in a Wall Street game of whos next?.The cost of debt may start to rise as monetary policy normalises.The second intuitionthat consumer firms sales are near-indestructibleis no longer safe.Many customers are opting for niche brands; craft ales instead of Bud Light, or organic take-home meals instead of Krafts classic Macaroni and Cheese.In the last quarter, both AB InBev and Kraft Heinz reported stagnant volumes globally and shrinking sales in America.In the medium term e-commerce could reduce the power of big brands.Instead of having a privileged spot on Walmarts finite shelf space, established consumer companies must now slug it out with smaller brands on Amazon.Such shifts will not threaten 3Gs current firms.Cost savings are still going to help their bottom lines.Profits at AB InBev and Kraft Heinz would have to fall by two-thirds or more before they struggled to make interest payments.And their combined debt pile, though huge (equivalent to the fourth-largest of any non-financial firm in the world), is well-organised, with repayments spread out over years.Even so, a decade of mediocrity beckons.The numbers up One option is a final flurry of deals.The possibility cannot be ruled outwhich is why consumer-product firms must stay on their toes.But as well as being expensive, cross-border deals and job cuts have become more politically sensitive (Kraft Heinz has cut 10,000 jobs since 2013).3Gs bid for Unilever caused a stink in Britain and the Netherlands.Trustbusters would block another big beer deal.Perhaps reflecting this, 3G is trying a new approach, of expanding firms through investment and innovation.Here, AB InBev is in a reasonable position, given its exposure to fast-growing emerging economies and its experience of turning niche beer brands into big sellers.Energising Kraft is a taller order, since creativity is not in its DNA and 69% of its sales are in America.3Gs pivot will be a struggle.But what a run it has had.It took advantage of a time when rates were low, stockmarkets were cheap, protectionist instincts subdued, anger over job losses muted and digital competition still nascent.Its adventures have not necessarily made the world a fairer place, but as a piece of intelligent, opportunistic investing they deserve three cheers.
The Paradise Papers shed new light on offshore finance:::::THIS week was uncomfortable for a host of well-heeled figures.In the frame were U2s Bono, Americas commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, and Britains Queen Elizabeth, as well as some of the worlds most valuable companies, including Apple and Nike.All these, and many more, feature in the Paradise Papers, a trove of more than 13m documents, many of them stolen from Appleby, a leading offshore law firm.The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) and its 95 press partners, including the BBC and the New York Times , began publishing stories based on the papers on November 5th.Dozens appeared this week, with more to follow after The Economist went to press.The ICIJs last big splash, the Panama Papers in April 2016, shed light on some of the darkest corners of offshore finance.In contrast, many of the activities highlighted by this leak are legal.But they would be widely seen as flouting the spirit of national tax laws by exploiting the gaps that open up between them when finance straddles borders.Among the most enlightening documents are those concerning the tax gymnastics employed by Apple and Nike to shift profits to havens.For Nike, moving the rights to its swoosh design and other trademarks to Bermuda helped cut its worldwide tax rate to between 10% and 20%, down from over 30% ten years ago.Upgrade your inbox Receive our Daily Dispatch and Editors' Picks newsletters.By contrast, an investment in a Cayman-registered fund by the queens private estatemade much of by the BBCappears to have carried no tax advantages.If investing through offshore funds is, in itself, wrong, then millions of Britons are guilty, too.Thousands of private-equity and hedge funds are registered in tax havens.This is often to avoid an extra layer of taxation in the funds country of domicile, not to dodge tax owed in the investors home country.Most if not all large pension schemesthe BBCs includedinvest some of their money in such offshore vehicles.The global impact of the Paradise Papers is unlikely to be as spectacular as that of their Panamanian predecessor.That felled the leaders of Pakistan and Iceland, and sparked many criminal investigations into tax evasion and money-laundering, including 66 in Britain alone.But already there have been calls for official inquiries and investigations, including into the business links of Mr Ross, who was revealed to have had an indirect relationship with Russian figures with Kremlin ties, through an oil-transport firm.(He says he was unaware of these.)Several national tax agencies, including Indias and Spains, have launched probes.European Union finance ministers called this week for a blacklist of tax havens to be drawn up by next month.The revelations about multinationals creative tax-planning will add to pressure to fix the patchwork of rules and treaties governing cross-border business taxation.The OECD, a think-tank, has led attempts to close the loopholes, which it estimates cost up to $240bn a year in lost tax revenue.But getting lots of countries to agree on a fix is like herding catsespecially when America and the EU are at odds over American tech giants tax arrangements.More broadly, the leak will fuel a debate raging since the global financial crisis, over the pros and cons of offshore finance for the world economy.Detractorsamong them Angus Deaton, a Nobel prize-winning economistsay tax havens serve no useful purpose, merely allowing a financial elite to dodge regulations and financial obligations that apply to everyone else.Defenders say they oil cross-border investment by, for instance, offering individuals from different countries tax-neutral venues in which to make pooled investments; and offer a legitimate financial refuge for citizens of countries in turmoil.This defence elicits little public sympathy.But it is true that small offshore centres have got little credit for clean-ups over the past decade.On some measures of tax and corporate transparency and combating money-laundering, Jersey, the Cayman Islands and some other havens score better than many rich countries.Plenty of dubious or downright nefarious things happen offshore.But it would be a pity if the Paradise Papers were to reinforce the clich that the culprits are palm-fringed islands, when it is the much larger, onshore financial centres, such as London, New York and Miami, that offer the most attractive combination of respectability and secrecymaking them magnets of unparalleled power for the worlds tainted money.
America’s Republicans take aim at mortgage subsidies:::::IN THE 1980s Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan were both proud of their efforts to expand home ownership.In Britain, Thatcher presided over a fire sale of state-owned homes to tenants.In America, Reagan deregulated financial markets and expanded mortgage lending.At the time both countries provided generous mortgage-related tax breaks, making it easier to flog homes to the masses.Upgrade your inbox Receive our Daily Dispatch and Editors' Picks newsletters.Britains 1980s housing boom turned to bust; the mortgage subsidies that helped to fuel it were abolished.America still subsidises mortgages to the tune of $64bn a year, by allowing homeowners to deduct interest costs from their tax liabilities.But a tax plan unveiled by Republicans on November 2nd proposes to limit the subsidy.Twelve European Union countries also include some form of mortgage-interest deduction (MID) in their tax code.The average European subsidy, however, is around a tenth of Americasabout 0.05% of GDP.The Netherlands is much the most generous, at 2% of GDP.Evidence that MID schemes boost home ownership is scant.Recent research covering rich countries suggests it has no effect.Moreover, subsidising mortgages might actually hurt economies by helping inflate housing bubbles.The European Commission blames Swedens generous MID scheme for encouraging a household-debt binge and inflating house prices.All but three EU countries have either reformed or repealed their MID schemes since the 2007-08 financial crisis.Ireland, Spain and Greece, for example, withdrew subsidies after suffering property busts.But withdrawing MID cannot on its own prevent property-market bubbles.According to The Economist s round-up of global house prices, Australia, New Zealand and Canada all have overvalued housing markets despite the absence of mortgage subsidies (see table).Interest deductibility might be more defensible if its benefits were more evenly spread.In the Netherlands and elsewhere in Europe, the biggest benefits accrue to the richest householders, although many European countries tend to combine MID schemes with other generous housing welfare.In America 70% of the subsidy is claimed by the top 20% of earners.The country spends more on housing subsidies for 7m households earning over $200,000 a year than it does on the 55m making less than $50,000.Regardless of its redistributive effects, Americas MID is a blunt tool, notes Edward Glaeser, an economist at Harvard.The Republican plan hopes to save the Treasury $100bn over ten years by limiting the subsidy to the first $500,000 of any outstanding mortgage and to first homes.Yet the change would affect just 3% of outstanding mortgages, according to CoreLogic, a data firm.Changes to how ordinary people file tax returns may reduce the number who claim MID and further focus its benefits on top-rate taxpayers.With interest rates near historic lows, this might seem an opportune time to end MID altogether.If that were to happen, some estimates suggest house prices might fall by 10-15%.But they would stabilise as the pace of house-building slowed.When the Netherlands adjusted its mortgage subsidy in 2012, house prices fell by 10%, but they are now climbing again at a decent clip.Prices in Britain are partly buoyed by the private rented sector where landlords have been able to deduct interest expenses from their rental income.The government began phasing out that deduction in April.That will have a big effect on the market.Reagan reckoned that home ownership brought stability and rootedness.That may be so, but it also brings rigid labour markets.Yet few politicians are willing to praise the merits of renting.Thatchers and Reagans housing reforms were thought to be driven by a fear of a slow creep of socialism.They would look enviously at Russia today.Home ownership rates in Britain and America have fallen in recent years; Russias has increased by 30 percentage points in two decades.
ING, a Dutch bank, finds a winning digital strategy:::::GERMANYS third-biggest retail bank has no branches.It is also Dutch.And it is highly profitable.ING-DiBa, an online bank owned by ING, the Netherlands biggest lender, looks after 133bn ($154bn) of deposits for over 8m customers.In a fragmented marketmost Germans entrust their savings to small, local banksthat means a share of around 6%.ING-DiBas lack of branches keeps costs down, allowing it to resist charging for current accounts and offer savers a tad more than rivals, despite a recent cut; and it has won a name for good service in a country not renowned for it.While other banks struggle after years of ultra-low interest rates, ING-DiBa thrives.Its return on equity exceeds 20%.ING as a whole is in fair shape, too.On November 2nd it reported net third-quarter earnings of 1.4bn, slightly more than a year earlier.The groups return on equity was a healthy 11%, nearly two percentage points up.Since 2014 the number of primary customers (with an active current account and another product) has climbed by 25%, to 10.5m.By 2020 ING aims to have 14m.They are especially valuable because they want further services and because frequent transactions yield reams of data.Upgrade your inbox Receive our Daily Dispatch and Editors' Picks newsletters.Banks prattle a lot about digital strategy.At ING, the talk is far more convincing than in most.Last year Ralph Hamers, the chief executive, unveiled a plan costing 800m to bring the whole bank onto one digital platform and to save 900m a year by 2021.It is closing 600 Belgian branches; 7,000 jobs will go.Roel Louwhoff, who is overseeing the digital transformation, explains that ING aims to build componentsprocesses and productsthat can be used across the group, so that costs can be saved and customers better served.Examples include the way new customers are taken on, and security procedures.The bank has borrowed from other industries, for instance by studying how carmakers use common parts in several models.In INGs honeycomb of a headquarters in Amsterdam is an Obeya room (Japanese for big room: Toyota was a pioneer of the idea) in which plans are co-ordinated and updated.(It is closed to visiting journalists.)One fruit will be Model Bank, the standardisation of processes in European online banks (except in Germany), based on those already followed in Spain and Portugal.A 180-strong team in Madrid is developing Model Bank, which ING will deploy next year in the Czech Republic before moving on to Austria, France and Italy.It helps that ING has for years been on the digital trail abroad: it bought 49% of DiBa in 1998 and has owned all of it since 2003.Yet the early start was almost INGs undoing.Before the financial crisis, says Koos Timmermans, the chief financial officer, it managed the balance-sheets as well as the operations of the foreign online banks and the conventional business separately.The online banks attracted plenty of deposits but lacked assets; they bought lots of bonds, many backed by American mortgages.The domestic bank had ample loans but relied on wholesale funding.When the crisis struck, this dual exposure to capital markets proved calamitous.The Dutch government bailed ING out to the tune of 10bn in 2008 and later took over the American mortgage securities (on which it eventually made a profit).As a condition of state aid, the European Commission obliged ING to sell its insurance arm and its online bank in America.Other businesses, including online banks in Britain and Canada, were also offloaded.ING finished repaying the aid in 2014.Dividends restarted the next year.Dutch treat Nevertheless, says Mr Timmermans, branchless banking was a smash hit.ING has learnt its lesson, he adds.Now the balance-sheets are more in sync.At the foreign online banks, savings still outstrip loans (mostly mortgages).Trying to lend more where people are more inclined to save may not pay.But todays ING is wary of bonds.Never, ever, will we collect savings and invest in the bond market, Mr Timmermans says, except for liquidity needs.Instead, ING smooths imbalances internallyfor example, by putting $5bn of loan assets generated in America onto its German balance-sheet.There are gaps.ING hopes to lift the share of revenues from fees and commissions from 15% to 20% in the next four years, reducing its dependence on interest income.Stefan Nedialkov of Citigroup notes that European banks averaged a 24% share last yearbut also that ING is picking up the pace.In the first nine months of 2017 fees rose by 12% year on year.The online banks are pushing into more sophisticated products than current and savings accounts and mortgages.ING is happy to find allies.In September it formed a partnership in Germany with Scalable Capital, a robo-adviser.Last year, with Kabbage, an American financial-technology company in which it has a stake, it started offering online loans, available within minutes, to small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in Spain.It has recently started doing the same in France and Italy.In October the bank launched a 300m fund to invest in fintechs.This shift is a test for branchless banking.The jury is still out on whether we will accomplish the same on the SME side as in basic retail banking, says Mr Timmermans, though he believes young entrepreneurs will be keen.ING has not yet cracked the nut of avoiding bad credits.But, he adds, it makes no sense to open branches just for SMEs.With ever fewer people visiting banks, the online model must move on.How far and how fast?ING will be among the first to find out.
Activist shareholders take on the London Stock Exchange:::::ACTIVIST hedge funds like Elliott Management, Cevian Capital or The Childrens Investment Fund (TCI) are famed for pushing for change at the companies they buy into.A favoured tactic is to install a new chief executive at a floundering firm.So it is odd to find a fund lobbying for an existing boss to stay on, as TCI has done in a spat with the London Stock Exchange (LSE).In over eight years at the LSE, Xavier Rolet has transformed it from a share-trading venue to a clearing and data-services powerhouse, through acquisitions such as Russell, an index-maker, and a majority stake in LCH, a clearing-house.His hope of merging with the LSEs big German rival, Deutsche Brse, fell through, largely because of Britains vote to leave the EU.But Mr Rolet remains widely respected.So eyebrows were raised when the LSEs announcement on October 19th that Mr Rolet would leave in 2018 gave no reason.Upgrade your inbox Receive our Daily Dispatch and Editors' Picks newsletters.In a fiery letter penned on November 3rd, TCIs founder, Sir Chris Hohn, said it was clear to [TCI] that Mr Rolet had been forcedto leave against his wishes.Sir Chris called not only for Mr Rolet to stay but for the LSEs chairman, Donald Brydon, to go, having given no satisfactory answer about Mr Rolets departure.In a second letter on November 7th, Sir Chris called for the waiving of a confidentiality agreement that he says the LSE signed with Mr Rolet, preventing him from speaking out.The LSE has largely kept mum, merely noting the receipt of the first letter and insisting it had followed a proper process to lay the ground for an orderly succession.It had no comment on the second letter.At least one other big shareholder, Egerton Capital, a London-based fund, agrees with TCIs position.Jeff Blumberg, the chief executive, says it is mystified by Mr Rolets departure and would vote for his reappointment.TCI thinks most shareholders want to keep Mr Rolet, and has threatened to call an extraordinary general meeting to depose Mr Brydon.Whether or not the meeting occurs, Sir Chris has already exposed an internal struggle at one of Britains most esteemed financial institutions.And placing the status quo at the heart of an activist campaign may not be as strange as it seems.TCI contends the issue is at heart one of poor corporate governanceprecisely the target activists usually aim at.Lobbying for stability at a successful firm is consistent with demanding change at an unsuccessful one.
Venezuela seeks the restructuring of its massive foreign debts:::::INVESTORS have long seen a default on Venezuelan sovereign debt as a question of when, not if.Its bonds have been priced at levels implying imminent bankruptcy, but somehow the cash-strapped oil exporter has stayed afloat.Until now.On November 2nd Nicols Maduro, the countrys authoritarian president, announced that he would order a refinancing and restructuring of foreign debt worth about $105bn.The prices of government bonds fell by up to half.Markets braced themselves for one of historys most complex sovereign-debt renegotiations.Mr Maduros brief statement was cryptic as to the concrete steps he will take.He invited everyone involved in foreign debt to talks in Caracas, the capital, on November 13th.Many creditors want a neutral venue.Moreover, Mr Maduro appears to have pre-emptively dashed any hope of a voluntary agreement by naming his vice-president, Tareck El Aissami, as head of his debt-restructuring committee.Americas Treasury department has designated Mr El Assami a drug kingpin, meaning that Americans cannot deal with him.Upgrade your inbox Receive our Daily Dispatch and Editors' Picks newsletters.Sanctions also prevent American entities from buying any new debt issued by the Republic of Venezuela with maturities longer than 30 days, or 90 days for the debt of PDVSA, the state oil companya problem if, say, a restructuring involved an exchange of defaulted bonds for new ones.In theory, President Donald Trump could adjust the rules but still prevent any new money from flowing to Mr Maduro.For now, however, no proposed changes to the American sanctions have been aired.If Venezuela runs out of cash without reaching an agreement, it could simply stop paying its debts.But that would be risky, because PDVSA holds valuable property abroad, including Citgo, a refiner in America, and a fleet of oil tankers.After a default, creditors might be able to seize those assets.That would severely disrupt PDVSAs operations and wreak further havoc on the Venezuelan economy, which has shrunk by over a third since 2013.So Mr Maduros plan is a mysteryif he has one at all.On the day he announced the refinancing, he also said that PDVSA would make the final $1.2bn payment on a maturing bond.The money has yet to reach creditors, but most of it is reported to have left PDVSAs accounts.American sanctions have scared off banks, creating logistical hurdles that can delay transfers.Another payment a week earlier was held up for days but eventually completed.If Venezuela were indeed about to renege on its debts, an extra $1.2bn would surely come in handy.One interpretation of Mr Maduros perplexing approach is that he may hope to continue servicing PDVSAs debts but welsh on those contracted by the state.It is PDVSA that holds the vulnerable assets abroad.And more of its bonds than the Republics lack collective-action clauses.That makes it impossible to force holdout creditors into a deal agreed to by a majority of bondholders.However, foreign courts are likely to frown on any effort by Mr Maduro to pick and choose which lenders to snub.Separately, Crystallex, a Canadian mining firm, has filed a lawsuit in America claiming that PDVSA is an alter ego of the Republic.If it succeeds, government-bond holders could press claims against PDVSA.Another theory, advanced by Rafael Guzmn, an opposition congressman, is that Mr Maduro may have wanted a sell-off of the countrys bonds.Venezuela or its foreign patrons, mainly Russia and China, could then buy them up cheaply so Venezuela could retire its debt at lower cost, or leave it in the hands of sympathetic allies.An even more conspiratorial explanation has been mooted by Javier Ruz of Caracas Chronicles, an opposition-friendly blog.The government had spooked markets by using 30-day grace periods to delay interest payments, lowering bond prices.Mr Ruz wondered whether the government had tipped insiders off that it would actually cough up the final $1.2bn, as a last stop on the Venezuelan-debt gravy train before payments ceased.Besides exploiting contractual grace periods, Venezuela has yet to miss a payment.And its bonds still mostly trade at 20-30 cents on the dollara big discount, but far above the single-digit prices to which defaulted debt often sinks.In part, those prices reflect Venezuelas long-run fundamentals.It has the worlds largest proven oil reserves.A government that pursued sensible economic policies could probably service the debts within a few years.But the relatively high prices may also suggest that some investors think Mr Maduro is bluffing.Venezuelas biggest payments of 2017 are now behind it, and the oil price has recently risen.Moreover, Vladimir Putin, Russias president, appears to be sticking by his Venezuelan friends.Russian-controlled entities have already provided the country with at least $17bn of financing.And Russian officials recently agreed to restructure a $3bn loan.If Mr Putin sees a commercial advantage to Russia in propping up his oil-rich anti-American ally at a cost of a few billion dollars, picking up Venezuelan debt on the cheap may yet turn out to be a bargain.
$100M family feud threatens Palm steakhouse future:::::The knives are out in a $100 million Manhattan family feud that threatens the future of the legendary Palm steakhouses from LA to New York.The Palms story starts in 1926 when Italian immigrants Pio Bozzi and John Ganzi applied to open a restaurant on Second Avenue and 45th St. under the name of their hometown, La Parma.Because of a language difference it became The Palm and its been The Palm since 1926, attorney Frederic Newman said in Manhattan Supreme Court Monday.The botched name and the costs of franchising it are at the heart of a trial unfolding in Manhattan Supreme Court.Newman represents two of founder John Ganzis grandkids Garry Ganzi and his sister Claire Breen in a suit against their cousin Walter Ganzi Jr. and his partner Bruce Bozzi Sr., Pio Bozzis grandson.The siblings claim they were sliced out of profits from the companys now 21 locations nationwide.They get a 20 percent stake, while the partners control the remaining 80 percent.The partners pay an annual $6,000 licensing fee for each additional restaurant.The siblings lawyer, Frederic Newman, called that figure nuts and a product of self-dealing.The eateries are nearly identical in dcor and a menu that ranges from Italian classics like veal marsala to 36-ounce New York Strip steaks sliced table side and 3-pound Nova Scotia lobsters.Ian Shapiro, who represents Walter Ganzi Jr. and Bruce Bozzi Sr. said in opening statements Monday that the siblings are hungry for money they didnt earn.The business partners own energy, creativity and risk taking was responsible for transforming their familys restaurant into a well-known national brand Shapiro said.Their grandfathers only ran the original steakhouse on Second Avenue in Manhattan.The partners opened the first offshoot at the urging of George H.W.Bush in 1972 in Washington, D.C. when he was President Nixons UN Ambassador.Newman, countered that the success of the national franchises is owed to the iconic New York steakhouse opened by the grandfathers and closed two years ago.There are still three Manhattan locationsone on Second Avenue across from the original, another in Midtown West and a third in Tribeca.Newman is asking the judge to award his clients a 5 percent cut of the national restaurants profits.That amount would destroy the company, Shapiro argued.The royalty they are seeking would exceed the restaurants average net income over many years, Shapiro said.A $100 million payment to the siblings would mean catastrophic personal consequences for his clients, Shapiro said.
Hasbro reportedly has sights set on Barbie-maker Mattel:::::GI Joe is making the moves on Barbie and the show has Wall Street wagging its tongue.Shares of Barbies owner, Mattel, surged 21 percent Monday to $17.64 on a report that Hasbro which makes GI Joe wants to buy the company.Investors liked the potential deal, first reported by the Wall Street Journal on Friday, as struggling Mattel desperately needs a boost and Hasbro is seen as capable of pulling off a turnaround.Shares of Mattel have tumbled 47 percent this year, dragged down by slackening demand for Barbie dolls.Meanwhile, Hasbros shares have climbed 18 percent, lifted partly by the companys grip on the Star Wars toy franchise.A combined entity would account for more than a 50 percent share of such key toy categories as dolls, model vehicles, and action figures, Jefferies analyst Stephanie Wissink said in a research note.Together they would command 34 percent of the US market, according to Wissink.As such, risk does exist that the deal could run into antitrust concerns with the Federal Trade Commision, Wissink said.They would control all of the major toy brands with the exception of The Lego Group, said toy consultant Richard Gottlieb.Among Mattels biggest brands are Fisher Price, Hot Wheels and Matchbox, while Hasbro has Nerf, Play-Doh, Transformers and Star Wars.Last year, Hasbro wrangled the licensing rights to Disneys Star Wars franchise from Mattel, also grabbing the rights to the lucrative Disney Princess dolls.Still, the prospect of Hasbro buying Mattel is likely to alarm licensors like Disney, experts say.If there is no Mattel to bid against the dollars go down, said Gottlieb, adding It wouldnt surprise me to see Disney make a run at Mattel.If Disney were to own Mattel it could keep the licensing in-house.It wouldnt be the first time the toy giants tried to hook up.In 1996, Mattel tried to buy Hasbro, but was rebuffed.Last year, there also were rumors that Hasbro was trying to buy Mattel.
Credit Suisse used trading software to rip off its own customers:::::Credit Suisse rigged currency markets for years with a bag of tricks that included chatroom cartels, anti-competitive business practices, and even software programs that were designed to automatically rip off the banking giants own customers, New York regulators said Monday.The states Department of Financial Services, led by Superintendent Maria T. Vullo, slapped Credit Suisse with a $135 million fine for the deceptive practices, which it said went on for seven years until 2015, according to a consent order with the bank.Certain Credit Suisse executives in the banks foreign exchange unit deliberately fostered a corrupt culture, Vullo said in a statement.The settlement Monday was spurred by subpoenas that the DFS sent to banks in 2015, demanding information on the source code in their trading programs that may have been used rig currency markets.In addition to Credit Suisse, Goldman Sachs, as well as French banks BNP Paribas and Societe Generale, were being investigated, according to a person familiar with the matter.Those investigations are still ongoing, the person said.Credit Suisse was so brazen in its drive to rip off its own customers that they programmed its electronic trading system, called eFX, to automatically front-run the banks own clients on as many as 72,000 orders, according to the consent order.Front-running, or secretly trading ahead of a clients order in order to get an advantage, can be massively profitable and Credit Suisse predicted that this program would generate an extra $2 million in profits in 2013, according to the DFS.Credit Suisses crooked algorithm, which it used from 2010 to 2013, measured the likelihood of when a clients trade would go through or stop because of pre-set limits on what they would pay, according to the DFS.Traders would be given information about those limits in order to trade around them, the regulator said.It is the name of the game if we front-run orders, one unidentified trader wrote to the head of eFX.Sometimes you win sometimes you lose.Its up to us to define the front run rules.The fine appears to be the first to hit a major bank for specifically programming market rigging into its computer systems.In addition to the algorithm, traders would conspire to fix prices in an electronic chatroom, as well as give multiple orders to a single trader in order to not compete with one another, share client information with other banks, and lied about cancelling order at the last second if they werent profitable, the DFS said.The bank didnt admit or deny the allegations, but has agreed to pay the settlement and to revamp its policies around FX trading.The traders have been either fired or let go for other reasons, according to the settlement.Credit Suisse is pleased to have reached a settlement with the DFS that allows the bank to put this matter behind it, bank spokeswoman Nicole Sharp said in a statement.The fine comes about two years after Justice Department cut a $4.3 billion settlement with six banks for rigging currency markets, just one of the many Wall Street antitrust suits that have proliferated since 2012.
Chipotle’s stock hit after Jeremy Jordan says he got violently sick:::::Chipotles shares took a hit Monday after Supergirl star Jeremy Jordan said he got violently ill from eating at one of the chains burrito joints late last week.The stock tumbled as much as 6 percent to $263, and was recently off 1.6 percent at $275.The Broadway performer posted an account of his ordeal Thursday night in a now-expired Instagram story, saying he was hospitalized and blaming his illness on his Chipotle meal, reportedly at a Houston eatery.I, as you can see, am in the hospital and I have fluids in my arm because the food did not agree with me and I almost died, Jordan wrote.Chipotle, for its part, signaled it might have doubts about the actors account.We were sorry to hear Jeremy was sick and were able to get in touch with him directly regarding where and when he ate.There have been no other reported claims of illness at the restaurant where he dined.We take all claims seriously, but we cant confirm any link to Chipotle given the details he shared with us.As of Friday, Chipotle shares were off 26 percent this year, slammed by reports of a norovirus outbreak earlier this year at a Virginia Chipotle eatery and a Dallas Chipotle that closed after a video went viral showing mice scurrying in the restaurant and falling from a ceiling.
Bitcoin surges more than $1,000 after a painful slide:::::Bitcoin surged on Monday, recovering more than $1,000 after losing almost a third of its value in less than four days as traders bought back into the volatile cryptocurrency.Bitcoin tumbled as low as $5,555 on the Luxembourg-based Bitstamp exchange on Sunday, a slide of almost 30 percent from a record high just shy of $7,900 on Wednesday.It rebounded on Monday, trading up more than 14 percent on the day at $6,718, though that was still more than $1,000 less than last weeks record high.Market watchers said the fall had been driven by a decision on Wednesday to abandon a planned software upgrade that could have split the cryptocurrency in a so-called fork a move that had initially had a positive impact on the digital coin, sending it to a record high of $7,888 on the view that this marked a resolution of a long-term dispute.But some were disappointed that Segwit2x fork had been abandoned.It would have increased the capacity of the blocks transactions are processed in, thereby reducing competition to get payments processed and lowering transaction fees.Consequently, analysts said, some of those who see low fees as important to the future of bitcoin were selling it for a clone called Bitcoin Cash that spun off from the original in August.Its block sizes are larger, and therefore transaction fees are lower.Bitcoin Cash tripled in value at the end of the week as bitcoin slid, reaching an all-time high just below $2,000 on Sunday and briefly overtaking Ethereum as the worlds second-biggest cryptocurrency.But traders bought back into the original bitcoin on Monday, sending Bitcoin Cash plummeting.It was trading down over 30 percent on the day at around $1,097, according to industry website Coinmarketcap.Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash will co-exist and serve different use cases, just like Bitcoin and Ethereum.Its not a zero sum game, bitcoin and security expert Andreas Antopolous said in a post on Twitter.Bitcoin is up more than 500 percent so far this year.
GE is slashing its business, and its dividend:::::General Electric will focus on aviation, power and health care, radically shrinking the most famous US conglomerate into a smaller company betting on industries where it has strong technology and a large customer base.In a plan unveiled Monday by new chief executive John Flannery, GE cut its dividend and profit outlook in half, sending its stock down 2.7 percent, as Wall Street worried about how the slimmed-down company will generate cash to justify its valuation.By the numbers, we see a core operating performance that is below plan, and, currently, a consensus expectations curve that we think remains too high, said JPMorgan analyst Stephen Tusa said.The stock is the worst-performing Dow component this year, down 35 percent through Fridays close.The refocusing of the company will likely mean a sweeping sale of $20 billion of assets, but GE did not detail exactly which parts of its business it plans to shed.The dividend cut, only the third in the companys 125-year history and the first not in a broader financial crisis, is expected to save about $4 billion in cash annually.GE forecast adjusted 2018 industrial free cash flow of $6 billion to $7 billion, up from an estimated $3 billion in 2017.The move to make GE smaller and nimbler is a turnaround from the previous multi-business approach taken by former CEOs Jack Welch and Jeff Immelt.Flannerys changes repudiate much of Immelts vision of a digital industrial company that builds software to manage and optimize GEs jet engines, power plants, locomotives and other products.Conglomerates are out of favor on Wall Street, where investors prefer to bet on specific industries rather than a mixed portfolio.GE forecast 2018 adjusted earnings per share of $1 to $1.07 per share, compared with its earlier estimate of $2 per share.Wall Street was expecting $1.16, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.The company on Monday cut its quarterly dividend to 12 cents per share from 24 cents starting in December.GEs dividend cut a bid to save cash when the companys cash flow is deteriorating is the third in its history; the other two came during the Great Depression and the global financial crisis of 2007-2009.Flannerys strategy is a turning point for the company, which over several decades built itself into a sprawling conglomerate with interests across media, energy, banking, aviation, railroads, marine engines and chemicals.GE executives have said analysts have undervalued the companys digital business.They argue the digital units should be valued more like Amazon, Alphabet Inc.s Google and other fast-growing tech companies.GE will also cut its board to 12 from 18 members.
Qualcomm rejects Broadcom’s $103 billion takeover bid:::::Mobile chipmaker Qualcomm on Monday rejected rival Broadcoms $103-billion takeover bid, saying the offer dramatically undervalued the US company.Shares of Qualcomm were up 1 percent at $65.25 in premarket trading, while those of Broadcom fell 0.7 percent to $263.After a comprehensive review, conducted in consultation with our financial and legal advisors, the board has concluded that Broadcoms proposal dramatically undervalues Qualcomm and comes with significant regulatory uncertainty, Qualcomms Presiding Director Tom Horton said in a statement.Broadcom made an unsolicited bid last week in its efforts to become the dominant supplier of chips used in the 1.5 billion or so smartphones expected to be sold around the world this year.Reuters reported on Sunday that Qualcomm would rebuff the $70 per share offer, citing people familiar with the matter.Broadcom could not immediately be reached for comment.The offer also comes at a time when Qualcomm is trying to close its pending $38-billion acquisition of automotive chipmaker NXP Semiconductors NV.Broadcom has indicated it is willing to buy Qualcomm irrespective of whether it closes the NXP deal.A sale to Broadcom would also need a nod from the antitrust officials, who are still considering Qualcomms purchase of NXP.Qualcomm, an early pioneer in mobile phone chips, supplies so-called modem chips to phone makers such as Apple, Samsung and LG that help the phones connect to wireless data networks.No company is better positioned in mobile, IoT, automotive, edge computing and networking within the semiconductor industry, Qualcomms Chief Executive Steve Mollenkopf said.We are confident in our ability to create significant additional value for our stockholders.
Wall Street bonuses may jump this year, thanks to Trump:::::Wall Street bonuses may climb as much as 10 percent this year, in the first meaningful jump for the industry since 2013, according to a closely watched report.Bankers who advise companies on issuing stock or bonds could see an even bigger pay jump, as much as 20 percent, compensation firm Johnson Associates said on Sunday.A reduced emphasis on financial regulation under President Trump has boosted shares of banks to peak levels on hopes higher interest rates, lower taxes and faster economic growth under the Trump administration would lift profits.The KBW Nasdaq Bank Index, which measures the largest US banks, has risen 34 percent since the election, compared with the benchmark S&P 500 indexs 24 percent gain over the same period.But looser banking regulations havent translated yet into better trading results amid low market volatility and tepid client activity.Wall Street firms bond trading revenue has fallen for about seven years amid new rules on trading and capital.Banks, including Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, that once relied heavily on trading, are now leaning more heavily on businesses like private equity and wealth management.As a result, fixed income traders are likely to see their bonuses fall as much as 10 percent, the report said.The profit engine of fixed income continues to sputter, Johnson Associates managing director Alan Johnson said in an interview.There are a lot of people who dont think that business is coming back.
Uber board makes peace to clear way for Softbank investment:::::Ubers warring board members have struck a peace deal that allows a multibillion-dollar investment by SoftBank Group to proceed, and which would resolve a legal battle between former Chief Executive Travis Kalanick and a prominent shareholder.Venture capital firm Benchmark, an early investor with a board seat in the ride-services company, and Kalanick have reached an agreement over terms of the SoftBank investment, which could be worth up to $10 billion, according to two people familiar with the matter.The Uber board first agreed more than a month ago to bring in SoftBank as an investor and board member, but negotiations have been slowed by ongoing fighting between Benchmark and Kalanick.The agreement struck on Sunday removed the final obstacle to allowing SoftBank to proceed with an offer to buy to stock.Uber confirmed the deal was moving forward.Weve entered into an agreement with a consortium led by SoftBank and Dragoneer on a potential investment, an Uber spokesman said.We believe this agreement is a strong vote of confidence in Ubers long-term potential.SoftBank, a Japanese conglomerate that has become a heavyweight in Silicon Valley tech investing, is joined by Dragoneer Investment Group in leading a consortium of investors that plans to invest $1 billion to $1.25 billion in Uber, and in addition, will buy up to 17 percent of existing shares from investors and employees in a secondary transaction.The terms were signed on Sunday, although the tender offer would likely take weeks to complete.Uber is valued at $68 billion, the most highly valued venture-backed company in the world.SoftBanks roughly $1 billion investment of fresh funding is expected to be at the same valuation.The secondary transaction, or the purchases from employees and existing investors, would be at a lower valuation.A spokeswoman for Benchmark did not immediately respond to a request for comment, and a spokesman for Kalanick declined to comment.Completing the SoftBank deal would allow Uber to open a new chapter after a year of controversy, including the resignation of Kalanick, the ouster of several top executives, sexual harassment and discrimination allegations, and multiple federal criminal probes.The deal is also tied to new governance rules that aim to distribute power more equally and bring more oversight to the company.Uber had a remarkable first six or seven years, a bumpy past two years, and now the SoftBank deal allows for a full reset, said Bradley Tusk, an Uber investor and political strategist who works with tech companies.It would also be a major victory for Ubers new CEO, Dara Khosrowshahi, who often served as a mediator to help broker the agreement, according to a third person familiar with the matter.To allow the deal to go forward, Benchmark has agreed to immediately suspend its lawsuit against Kalanick, which it filed in August in an effort to diminish the ex-CEOs power at the company and force him off the board, one of the sources said.On the successful completion of the SoftBank investment, Benchmark would drop the lawsuit entirely, the person said.In turn, Kalanick must receive majority board approval should he want to replace the board seats over which he has control, according to the source.In addition to his own seat, Kalanick controls two more, which are occupied by Ursula Brown, the former Xerox Corp CEO, and former Merrill Lynch CEO John Thain.Kalanick appointed them in September without first consulting with the board.Ending the litigation is a big step forward if it finally ends the specter of Kalanick retaking control, said Erik Gordon, an entrepreneurship expert at the University of Michigans Ross School of Business.Ubers board already approved a slate of governance reforms that are contingent on completion of the SoftBank deal.They include removing super-voting rights that gave Kalanick and his allies outsized power, adding new independent directors and increasing the size of the board to 17.Uber plans to run newspaper ads informing investors about the share purchase, and SoftBank will propose a price at which it will buy stock.The company has threatened to invest in ride-hailing rival Lyft if it does not get the Uber deal done.The deal gives early investors such as Benchmark, whose Uber stake is worth nearly $9 billion, the opportunity to cash out a very lucrative investment.
Charter’s CEO butts heads with biggest shareholder:::::Theres a battle raging inside Charter Communications, and the outcome could decide whether the cable giant continues its acquisition spree or gets gobbled up itself.Charters Chief Executive Tom Rutledge who last year swallowed Time Warner Cable and renamed it Spectrum, making Charter the nations third-biggest pay-TV operator insists that he can increase Charters dominance with still more purchases, sources said.The Post reported in June that Charter was weighing an approach to Cox Communications, an Atlanta-based regional cable provider.More recently, rumors have circulated that Charter has been in talks to do a deal with Altice, which most recently scooped up New York-based Cablevision.But 76-year-old billionaire John Malone, who is Charters biggest shareholder with control of 27 percent of its stock, is meanwhile showing signs that hes willing to head in the other direction namely, a sale of Charter at the right price, insiders say.I think Malone is a seller, one source told The Post.The source added that Malone, though, doesnt control Charter, and the board is totally behind Rutledge.The Post reported exclusively Nov. 1 that SoftBank, the Japan-based buyout fund that owns Sprint, had rekindled on-again, off-again talks to acquire Charter.SoftBanks billionaire boss Masayoshi Son has tried in multiple ways to energize Charter, the source said.It is an ongoing engagement.High-level talks have occurred, with SoftBank recently offering $540 a share for Charter, a source said.Although a deal isnt imminent, I wouldnt count Malone out, a telecom executive told The Post.There is a 50-percent chance a SoftBank-Charter deal happens in six months.Apart from keeping his status as a cable bigwig, insiders say, Rutledge appears to be clinging to stock options that, according to securities filings, would pay out tens of millions of dollars if Charter shares rise above the $564 mark.My guess is Rutledge has a few quarters to increase the share price, the telecom exec said.Skeptics say a tidal wave of cord-cutting, as viewers flock to cheaper streaming services from Netflix and Amazon, is making that look iffy.Charters shares on Friday closed at $338.44, well off a Sept. 6 peak of $403.65.Still, insiders say Rutledge believes he can boost Charters business by hoovering up more cable assets, or even by merging or partnering with other big players.On Sunday, a spokesman for French cable giant Altice told The Post rumors it is in talks with Charter about a business combination are absolutely false.Asked whether any such discussions took place in the recent past, the spokesman declined to comment.Altice lately has seen its shares hammered by the industrys woes, leading some investors to argue that it looks vulnerable.Last week CEO Michel Combes resigned, with founder Patrick Drahi returning as president.Nevertheless, one telecom exec opined that Patrick just got started in the US.He is young and has big ambitions.Both Charter and Altice, as well as Comcast, would like to buy Cox Communications, but there are no indications that family-controlled Cox is open to selling, especially since it just installed a young management team last year, the executive added.Trends in pay TV are working against Charter.In 2017, the sector will lose 2.9 million subscribers, JPMorgan predicted in an Oct. 26 report, more than double the 1.23 million it lost last year.Also, Charters footprint largely overlaps with AT&Ts.If AT&Ts DirecTV service gains more content through its proposed merger with Time Warner, owner of stations like HBO, CNN and TNT, it could pick off more Charter subscribers.If telcos continue to aggressively promote triple plays and wireless bundles, subscriber losses at Charter could be worse than we model, JPMorgan said.Charter declined to comment.Liberty, which holds its annual meeting Thursday, did not return calls.
Emirates to buy 40 Boeing 787s in multibillion-dollar deal:::::DUBAI Dubais Emirates unveiled a provisional order for 40 Boeing 787-10 jetliners, worth $12.5 billion at list prices, at the Dubai Airshow on Sunday.Emirates chairman, Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed al-Maktoum, said the carrier had chosen the latest version of Boeings mid-sized wide-body jet after comparing it with the Airbus A350.Deliveries will start in 2022, he added.Reuters earlier reported that Boeing was close to clinching a deal for around 40 of the 787-10 jets.
Celebs turn out for Tina Brown’s book launch:::::It was a star-studded night at Michaels to celebrate the launch of Tina Browns latest book, The Vanity Fair Diaries and they were partying like it was 1989.It was a great moment when Alec Baldwin, Anna Wintour and Tom Wolfe all arrived at once, like an old issue of VF in its 80s heyday, said Brown, who edited the magazine from 1984 until 1992.All it needed was Donald Trump!Trump has only been known to step into Michaels once, in 2004.Michaels GM Steve Millington recalled that Trump and Melania were actually booked there for a quiet lunch on Election Day 2016 only to discover that Hillary Clinton and entourage had taken up residence down the street at the Peninsula Hotel.He ate elsewhere so as not to create a nightmare for the Secret Service.Wintour and The New Yorker Editor David Remnick could easily have picked the future editor of Vanity Fair from among the attendees.Joanna Coles, the chief content officer of Hearst whose name had bubbled up early on was on hand, and so was Lucy Danziger, the former editor of Self.Diane von Furstenberg recalled that Harry Evans told her that when he first met Brown then a miniskirted, 20-something writer she was wearing one of von Furstenbergs dresses.Von Furstenberg added, If you want to age and stay relevant, the best way is to continue to be friends with Tina.Brown described the memoir as a love story about a career that captures the sheer fun of the roaring 80s, when magazines mattered more and the industry was respected, profitable and glamorous.I want to make a toast to those wonderful days, she said before the digital disruption fked it all up.
Quit bickering over tax reform and unite for once:::::The Senate wants to play political football with tax reform.And thats the rub.When politicians talk reform, that generally translates into trouble.But when politicians cut taxes, that generally translates into economic and wage growth.Thats just what this economy needs both a corporate and an individual tax cut, where all taxpaying workers and all corporations end up paying lower taxes at the end of the day.The problem isnt with President Trumps desire to lower rates.The problem begins and ends with DC politicians.It must be ingrained in their DNA: They just cant make a simple thing simple.Lowering taxes for consumers and corporations does not have to be an arduous or complicated process.Congress could have cut each existing rate on corporations and individuals by five percentage points, 10 percent to 5 percent, 25 percent to 20 percent and so on.Then it could just sit back and watch the economy grow.In the US, the corporate rate is 35 percent, the highest in the developed world.Thats much too high to keep solid, sustainable jobs in America or bring them back here.The tax plan should not be a plan in which the bulk of the benefits only go to corporate America.When you compare corporate Americas balance sheets to the individual Americans, its not even close.Corporate America has stellar balance sheets and excess cash that wont be invested here because of our high tax rates.But the consumers balance sheet is still a mess, courtesy of the housing crisis, eight straight years of sub-2 percent gross domestic product growth and skyrocketing health-care and college tuition costs.In no way should the tax code be used as a football to start political warfare, or to pit socioeconomic classes against one another.Let it be a uniting experience.
Do passwords even matter anymore?:::::Dear John: A question: In the grand scheme of things, what is the point of having a password?Equifax gets hacked, Yahoo gets hacked.I dont put my mothers maiden name or my Social Security number on any of my password-protected accounts because those who do provide such information seem to get hacked.Passwords provide a false sense of security.Oh, and make sure your password includes letters, numbers and a certain number of digits, blah, blah, blah, so it is difficult to remember and difficult to compromise.Yeah, sure!M.K.Dear M.K.: I have a question for you.Why do they say you should wear clean underwear in case you get into an accident?If you get into an accident, your underwear isnt going to stay clean.Its the same thing for passwords.THEY say you have to do it, so just do it.Besides, all those different password combinations are improving your memory.And speaking of which, dont make your password anything like youve used before, or any logical series of letters or numbers, and make sure theres a symbol and some caps.In other words, make sure its nothing you will ever remember.Hackers could make a living selling us clues to our own passwords.Dear John: Dr. Janet Yellen, head of the Federal Reserve, is in a bad spot for a Ph.D. economist who has only worked in academia or government.She has too much faith in low-confidence data without questioning their provenance.And she has an academic/political bias against data, contrary to her expectations.Worse, her theories are being tested in a real economy on real people in the real world who will bear the brunt of her (and her predecessors) failures.Laurence J. Peter in The Peter Principle noted, In time, every post tends to be occupied by an employee who is incompetent to carry out assigned duties and that work is accomplished by those employees who have not yet reached their level of incompetence.It appears that the first part of Dr. Peters observation has been true for a couple of decades, but what is worrisome is that the number of competent government employees is rapidly decreasing and the limited number of survivors are being overwhelmed by the tsunami of incompetence washing over the country.Someone actually made a movie (titled Idiocracy) about the inevitable result of fulfilling the entire Peter Principle.Its a silly movie, but like all satires, it has a generous dose of truth buried in it.A.Z.Dear A.Z.: Ive been saying for a long time that the Fed and its governors were out of touch with reality.Yellen proved it when she recently said the Fed had been overestimating the strength of the job market.Well, no kidding!Academics are buried in universities and dont get much recognition or pay.Thats why a lot of the economic positions in government are filled with people fleeing universities.It takes them out of the shadows.And they come with plenty of theories, and not a lot of experience, say, as to what is affecting middle-class families.Dear John: Why is it that the Clintons seem like Teflon?I spend most of my week earning a paycheck to support my family, and my wife works as well.We are amazed at how much the Clintons get away with.It seems they always get a free pass from the press and no one cares how they earn their money.What the hell is going on in this country?I am not naive but it is true.R.F.Dear R.F.: I cant prove it, but I think the Clintons have a pact with the devil.But even the devil will eventually get tired of all this nonsense.
Can I get a break on my student loans?:::::Dear John: I need your help.I have a student loan that I have deferred over the years.I was helping out my family, so I was unable to pay.Attached is a copy of my bill.It has more than doubled.The interest rate is 6.9 percent.Can you help me refinance it or get this bill knocked down?Please help!M.C.Dear M.C.: If you go to the Web site simpletuition.com, you will see a range of financial institutions that refinance student loans.Your rate will depend on your credit.And if you havent paid your bills over the years, then Im sure you wont get the best rate.Anyway, I see on the site rates as low as 3.35 percent, and some higher than you are paying.But there are a lot of choices.Good luck.
Feel-good investing is the new trend on Wall Street:::::Feel-good investing is becoming all the rage with Wall Street as small investors want to see some societal good come with their profits, say supporters of this new investing style.ESG investing which includes companies that value environmental, social and corporate governance factors was once mostly confined to institutional investors.But it is now registering with retail investors, say analysts who track the trend.ESG assets are now at $9 trillion, a 33 percent increase since 2014, according to USSIF, a foundation that follows ESG investments.The number of big financial firms interested in ESG is growing, and includes BlackRock, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, among others.All the big firms are participating, said Jon Hale, an analyst who follows ESG for Morningstar, a fund rating service.The big boys getting into ESG is a good thing, not so unlike many of the large car manufacturers getting into electric cars now that they see a growing demand, said Jeff Gitterman.He is one of the leaders of the ESG movement and the founder of the New Jersey-based Gitterman Wealth Management.The leaders of the ESG movement say they want to change the way American corporations conduct business.They want to use investment dollars to address problems such as water scarcity and a lack of diversity in the workplace.Hale predicts the explosive growth of ESG will continue because young people and women generally like it.As more millennials and more women become investment decision-makers, I think ESG is going to expand, Hale said.Goldman Sachs Asset Management, for instance, has set up a special ESG unit.I would say that there has been a dramatic increase and interest over the past four years from all sorts of our clients in ESG and impact investing, said Hugh J. Lawson, Global Head of ESG and Impact Investing for Goldman Sachs.As of June, Goldman Sachs said it had $10.6 billion in ESG assets under management.
Group calls for boycott of NFL on Veterans Day Weekend:::::As if NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell didnt have enough on his plate, the league is facing yet another boycott.This one centers around season-ticket holders as well as viewers.A Facebook group called Boycott the NFL is asking ticket holders to stay home and viewers to tune out the leagues games this Veterans Day weekend.Boycott the NFL, which has 220,000 followers going into the weekend, added that its members plan to resist watching as long as millionaire football players protest the national anthem.
Argentinian president’s moves are making country an investing hotspot:::::The next investing hotspot is way south of the border, according to a hedge fund manager.Despite effectively being shut out of global markets for the past 15 years, Argentina is rapidly emerging as one of the more intriguing locations for return-hungry investors thanks largely to President Mauricio Macri being elected in 2015.Theres a lot of opportunity in Argentina, and there arent a lot of places in the world with a similar return profile and with a big tailwind, David Tawil of Maglan Capital told our Carleton English over coffee at a recently opened posh Buenos Aires hotel.Tawils remarks mark a stark contrast to how Argentina was perceived just a few years ago, when the country led by former President Cristina Kirchner was embroiled in a bitter 15-year-long battle with hedge fund Elliott Management over defaulted bonds.Argentina has been locked out of international markets for years, so there arent necessarily the professionals here who can do all that can or must be done, Tawil said Everyone is putting their hopes on Macri, and so far, that hope has been vindicated, Tawil said.
Calypso St. Barth’s skirts on paying bills amid major cash crunch:::::A chain of swanky fashion boutiques that counts Gwyneth Paltrow and Cameron Diaz as clients is having trouble keeping the lights on literally.Calypso St. Barth whose tropical-themed togs include $95 T-shirts and $165 swimsuits has been skimping on paying its clothing suppliers, employees and even its overdue electricity bills as it grapples with a cash crunch, sources told The Post.Over the past month, boutiques in New York, Connecticut, Seattle, Dallas, Denver, and Florida have quietly shuttered, insiders said.With them, scores of sales people have been laid off without being paid for their final weeks of service, sources said.The money spigot is getting closed by Solera Capital, a New York-based private-equity shop whose principals include Diana Taylor, the girlfriend of billionaire Michael Bloomberg.In August, Calypso told its sales staff that even the music thats piped into its stores, computers and phone lines was getting shut off, according to internal e-mails obtained by The Post.Some employees said they showed up to work in recent weeks, only to head back home because the lights wouldnt switch on.As our inventory dwindles, we reassure our customers that we arent closing because thats what weve been told to say, one fed-up employee griped in an email last month to management and workers that went nationwide.But now that our phones dont ring and the UPS no longer delivers packages and were selling a schizophrenic mash-up of spring, summer and fall to try to keep our rack full, those words feel hollow and rather delusional.When The Post called Solera Capital on Friday for comment, the person who answered the phone said Im sorry I cant help you, and hung up.A subsequent message was not returned.Imagine that you have no phones, no new product, youre getting eviction notices and you are trying to stay positive because you love your store, said one former sales associate in the New York area.We are all trying to get answers and many of us cant pay our rent and bills, said the former worker, who lost her job in October and has not gotten her last paycheck.At one time, the 40-year-old brand had as many as 35 stores.There were 22 listed on its website Friday, but many of them have closed in recent weeks, including those in Greenwich and Westport, Conn.; Dallas; Palm Beach and Naples, Fla.; and Tribeca in the Big Apple, sources said.Even Calypsos posh boutique at Madison Avenue and 72nd Street, one of its last remaining locations, has no telephone service.When The Post visited the Madison store earlier this week, a saleswoman who refused to give her name testily insisted that it wasnt closing and that anyone who has said otherwise is garbage.Last week, Calypsos creditors filed a Chapter 7 petition to force Calypso into liquidation.Some were startled to learn this week that the company doesnt even own its intellectual property, according to the creditors lawyer, Kenneth Rosen, of Lowenstein Sandler.Ive received calls from investment bankers and companies that buy brands inquiring about Calypsos intellectual property, Rosen told The Post, adding that both Calypso and Solera have lawyered up now.
‘Costco for millennials’ inks deal with Telaflora:::::Want a bouquet with those rolls of toilet paper?Boxed.com, the online retailer thats billed as the Costco for millennials, just inked a deal with Telaflora to provide flower delivery services from some 11,000 florists, which will begin this weekend.The 4-year-old discounter has been quietly adding products like fresh food, wine and hotel booking services and now flowers with an eye towards launching a premium membership program, founder and chief executive Chieh Huang told The Post.Big Apple-based Boxed models itself on the warehouse clubs like Costco, BJs and Sams Club minus the membership fees.That could be changing, at least for those willing to pay for the prospect of deeper discounts.Likely customers for this service would be Boxed corporate customers, but Huang believes a fee will appeal to consumers as well, especially if it includes free shipping.We have been launching more services with the ultimate goal of wrapping them as a premium tier, Huang said, adding that we are still studying it.Flower orders will arrive separately from Boxeds bulk items.
Analysts pan GE restructuring, CEO 'needed to do more':::::GE also announced it now sees adjusted earnings for the year ahead of $1 to $1.07 a share and free cash flow still at significantly reduced levels of $6 billion to $7 billion, which it pledged to improve.Scott Davis, CEO of Melius Research, said he doesn't think the businesses GE is focusing on should be together."[Flannery] needed to announce something bigger," he said in an interview with "Closing Bell.""He needs to cut costs to a much greater extent than what he announced today, and he needs to be accountable for where the share price is trading now.He's been 100 days on the job, and it's been straight down for 100 days," he added.However, Morningstar analyst Barbara Noverini said she thinks GE made the right choice by retaining health care, power and energy."There is still a collection of assets here that under better management should be able to return to a much healthier free cash-flow generation ability over the long run," she said in an interview with "Power Lunch."Copley thinks the only way to make the company less complex is to break it into much more substantial pieces."You sell the pieces you can sell, frankly, rather than try to create something on paper to begin with.If there's a good price for the health-care business, sell it.If aviation has a good public market value, spin it out and see what you're left with," he said.CNBC's Jeff Cox contributed to this report.
Wal-Mart strikes deal with Lord & Taylor, growing in fashion against Amazon:::::Wal-Mart is creating a home for luxury fashion online.The big-box retailer announced Monday it has partnered with Lord & Taylor to create an online "flagship store" for the apparel retailer.The landing page will launch on Walmart.com in spring 2018."Our goal is to create a premium fashion destination on Walmart.com," Denise Incandela, head of fashion for Wal-Mart's U.S. e-commerce division, said in a statement."We see customers on our site searching for higher-end items, and we are expanding our business online to focus on adding specialized and premium shopping experience, starting with fashion."Incandela previously worked as chief marketing officer for Saks Fifth Avenue, which, like Lord & Taylor, is part of Hudson's Bay.She just moved to Wal-Mart in October and is responsible for the company's fashion business across Walmart.com, Jet.com and Shoes.com.Through this partnership, Walmart.com will provide Lord & Taylor dedicated space on its website, as the department store chain continues to operate its own e-commerce platform."Walmart.com is a shopping destination that reaches a wide base of customers looking for premium fashion brands," Lord & Taylor President Liz Rodbell said in a statement."As retail continues to change, this flagship store creates enormous growth opportunities for Lord & Taylor and our brand partners."It was rumored in October that this deal would come to fruition.The Wall Street Journal reported at the time that this was part of Wal-Mart's broader effort to build a shopping destination online that rivaled that of Amazon.com.The Arkansas-based retailer's strategy of late has been to acquire smaller brands, many of them with a focus on fashion.The list of apparel and accessories brands now owned by Wal-Mart includes Bonobos, Modcloth, Shoebuy and Moosejaw.In a move to beef up its grocery offering, Wal-Mart also acquired Jet.com, bringing Quidsi co-founder Marc Lore to its management team.Lore has specifically said he wants to "elevate the Walmart.com brands."At a recent investor day, he also explained that Wal-Mart has plans to redesign its website, with a focus on household goods and fashion."Expect to see those experiences get elevated," Lore said about Wal-Mart's home and fashion departments.Wal-Mart said Monday it's beginning to build out "elements of discovery and inspiration" within the fashion portion of its website.The company declined to comment on whether there will be more brand partnerships in the future.In working with Lord & Taylor, Wal-Mart could begin to shift Walmart.com's image away from that of a discount site for consumer packaged goods and into that of an online platform with luxury brands.Meantime, Lord & Taylor has problems of its own, met with declining sales and weaker foot traffic.In a bid for fresh capital, the retailer recently announced that its flagship store on Fifth Avenue will soon become the new global headquarters of WeWork.After the holidays, Lord & Taylor will occupy only a small portion of the building.A Wal-Mart partnership could entice more shoppers and new ones at that to the department store chain's brands.The two companies have yet to reveal which retailer will be shipping purchased items.But the Journal reported in October that in the event of a deal Lord & Taylor would own the inventory and fulfill orders from the new website.Monday's announcement comes as Amazon has been making its own push into fashion.One example of this is Prime Wardrobe.The internet giant also recently unveiled two private-label athletic apparel brands, as it continues to lure top brands, such as Nike, to sell directly from Amazon.com.Earlier this year, Amazon began working with department store chain Kohl's to sell some of its electronics in the retailer's stores.In turn, analysts are already predicting Kohl's locations will be a testing ground for Amazon's private-label apparel business.Kohl's and Amazon declined to comment on future initiatives.All things considered, competition is only intensifying within the industry.Wal-Mart is also reportedly raising prices on some items across its website, in a move to drive store traffic where Amazon doesn't operate, the Journal reported Sunday.Wal-Mart is set to report third-quarter earnings before the bell on Thursday.CNBC's Courtney Reagan contributed to this reporting.
US transportation workers to face testing for prescription opioids next year:::::Safety-sensitive transportation workers including flight crew, air traffic controllers, truck drivers and train engineers will be screened for several common opioid painkillers starting next year, according to a new federal rule published Monday.Previous drug tests screened for cocaine and marijuana.The rule adds screening for hydrocodone, hydromorphone, oxymorphone and oxycodone, the Department of Transportation said.President Donald Trump last month declared the opioid crisis, which claimed the lives of 64,000 Americans last year, a public health emergency, calling it a "national shame and a human tragedy."The broadened testing will take effect Jan. 1, 2018."The opioid crisis is a threat to public safety when it involves safety-sensitive employees involved in the operation of any kind of vehicle or transport," Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao said in a release."The ability to test for a broader range of opioids will advance transportation safety significantly and provide another deterrence to opioid abuse, which will better protect the public and ultimately save lives."
Roark Capital has made an offer to buy Buffalo Wild Wings:::::Roark Capital has made an offer to buy Buffalo Wild Wings, a source familiar with the matter told CNBC.Roark made an offer of more than $150 per share, the person told CNBC.Shares surged nearly 28 percent after The Wall Street Journal initially reported the offer.The person who spoke to CNBC asked not to be named because the information is confidential.Buffalo Wild Wings and Roark did not immediately respond to requests for comment A private equity buyout of the the chicken wing restaurant chain would come months after it lost a bitter proxy contest that led to the retirement announcement of its CEO and the addition of three new directors to its board.Activist investor Marcato had pushed Buffalo Wild Wings to move away from its strategy of mostly owning its restaurants to a more capital-light franchised model.After the proxy fight concluded in June, CEO Sally Smith said she would retire by the end of the year.Marcato added three of its four nominees to the board, including Marcato manager Mick McGuire.Buffalo Wild Wing's stock had dropped 34 percent over the last year from $163 a share to $108 a share, before surprising the street last month when it beat its third quarter earnings expectations.As of Monday's close, the stock was down more than 28 percent over the past 12 months.For Roark, the acquisition would fit well within its restaurant heavy investment portfolio, including sandwich chain restaurant Arby's.Arby's earlier this year tried buy Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen.The deal would also be notable for potentially marking the return of private equity buyouts of publicly traded restaurants.Such deals have slowed, as restaurants have largely traded too expensively for financial buyers.Recent challenges though, including increased competition and preference for dining at home, have lowered share prices.
Budweiser maker's new US chief faces a slumping market for classic beer brands:::::Michel Doukeris is taking over as CEO of Anheuser-Busch, AB InBev's North American unit, and he's tasked with growing U.S. sales, a problem that has vexed the global brewer.AB InBev announced Monday that Doukeris would replace current North America Zone President and Anheuser-Bush CEO, Joao Castro Neves.The company said 22-year-veteran Neves would leave to pursue other interests.Sales in the U.S. have slumped, as consumers drink more craft and imported beer as well as wine and spirits.Staples like Budweiser and Bud Light have struggled, while Mexican beers like Corona have thrived.Doukeris, a 21-year-veteran who currently serves as chief sales officer, grew Budweiser in China and spearheaded AB InBev's efforts to make the company's portfolio more premium.Unlike Neves and previous CEO Luiz Edmond, his background is in sales, not finance, and that's a key shift for a company that has relied on cost-cutting and mergers and acquisitions, said Jefferies analyst Ed Mundy."They're masters at integration and cost cutting, but they're at the end of the road with (mergers and acquisitions)," Mundy said."There are few other roads they could go down, so this business needs to focus much more on organic growth and that hasn't been a core of the ABI skillset."Growing Bud Light and Budweiser will be two of Doukeris' most obvious challenges.Bud Light's sales have slid 5.8 percent this year, and Budweiser's have skid 6.7 percent, according to Nielsen data compiled by Beer Marketer's Insights.That's down from losses of 3 percent and 2.5 percent last year.But that probably won't be Doukeris' only focus.Mundy pointed to Michelob Ultra, which has become an important piece of the company's portfolio.Sales have risen 21.9 percent this year and 22.8 percent last year, according to Nielsen data compiled by Beer Marketer's Insights.Michelob Ultra is nearing 10 percent of Anheuser-Busch's total volume in the U.S., though Bud Light and Bud combined still represent about 50 percent, according to Beer Marketer's Insights.Because of that breakdown, Doukeris will likely focus on both stemming declines in Bud and Bud Light while also growing Michelob Ultra, Mundy said.At the very last, he said, the shakeup shows AB InBev's commitment to topline growth in the U.S.The company made a point of stating that in its press release announcing the change.AB InBev CEO Carlos Brito said, in a statement, "The US is our most important market and we recognize the need to continue to focus on driving topline growth across our portfolio...(Doukeris) is the ideal person to lead North America at this time, together with an emerging group of leaders being elevated in the company."Anheuser-Busch also announced a slate of personnel changes, including Northeast Region leader and former PepsiCo veteran Brendan Whitworth being named vice president of sales.He will replace Alex Medicis.All changes are slated to be effective Jan. 1.Shares of AB InBev fell 0.4 percent on Monday.They've gained 11.7 percent this year.
Loft Orbital is launching a specialty service that leases space on satellites:::::Venture capital continues to flow into the burgeoning satellite industry.Loft Orbital is the latest entrant, offering a "rideshare service" of buying satellites and then leasing space onboard to multiple customers.The company announced Monday it raised $3.2 million in a recent seed funding round led by Uncork Capital."We want to make the experience of accessing space as easy as buying cloud services from Amazon Web Services," CEO Antoine de Chassy told CNBC."Instead of building or buying a satellite for your sensor, just lease space onboard one of our satellites and fly with us."With its first satellite launch planned for 2019, de Chassy says Loft will now focus on purchasing satellites from manufacturing partners and bringing on more customers.He says Loft is tapping into an underserved market, due to the traditionally complex and capital-heavy requirements for launching a satellite."We're targeting the smaller, more fragmented landscape of smaller sensors roughly $1 million to $2 million per year deal size for us," de Chassy said."It's similar to how Boeing and Airbus sell aircraft directly to large customers ... but also sell to aircraft leasing companies who lease aircraft to smaller airlines."One of the investors in the most recent round, MDI Ventures, is an arm of Telkom Indonesia the largest telecom company in the southeast Asian country.CEO Nicko Widjaja says his venture capital group has been looking to invest in the space industry for two years, looking at over half a dozen companies throughout the San Francisco bay area and Texas."While most are still in early deployment, Loft has already attracted customers and it's related to what we do at Telkom Indonesia," Widjaja said."What Loft offers makes sense for our corporate customers."Loft aims to fly 12 to 15 satellites per year, negotiating the launch contracts with rocket companies for its customers and operating the units once in orbit.While recent buzz has focused on the development of smaller cubesats, Loft will fly "washing machine-sized satellites.""We want to use standard satellites because it enables us to create a USB-like interface," de Chassy added."Our interface will ultimately be able to accommodate any sensor looking for a ride to space [which] dramatically reduces the cost and time to integrate and test the satellite."
General Electric cutting dividend by 50% to 12 cents a share from 24 cents a share:::::Flannery took some heat at the investor day presentation, with one attendee telling the CEO that an early proclamation that the dividend was safe "hurt your credibility right out of the gate.""Fundamentally, that dividend was predicated on us growing to a certain level that we just did not see happening in terms of industrial cash flow," Flannery said.Heading into Monday's announcement, and as GE's shares cratered, its dividend yield had ballooned to the second-highest in the Dow behind Verizon at 4.7 percent (Verizon's yield is 5.3 percent).That caused many analysts to speculate the payout was unsustainable, which explains why the stock was stable in early trading as this decision was long expected.The new dividend yield will be 2.3 percent.GE has paid a dividend since 1899 and has only cut it twice: in 1939 and in 2009.Wall Street had been expecting some type of action on the dividend, with speculation that GE might opt to eliminate it.GE's free cash flow, or the level of cash flow less capital expenditures, had contracted to about $7 billion, about half its normal level.The dividend slash is expected to generate $4 billion in cash annually."If you look at the last five years, the industrial cash flow of General Electric has not covered the dividend," Jeffrey Sprague, Vertical Research Partners founder and a long-time GE analyst, told CNBC."That was fine previously when you had GE Capital there to pay its fair share.But with Capital gone, there's just no way to pay the dividend."The move comes as the company tries to sharpen its focus, under heavy criticism from investors and analysts who believe GE's sprawling interests have become unwieldy and unmanageable.Among expected changes to the company is a focus on three of the company's prime business lines aviation, power and health care, according to a report in The Wall Street Journal.There do not appear to be plans for an imminent breakup, but the company is expected to exit most other business lines, the Journal reported.GE is expected to shed its majority stake in oil and gas operator Baker Hughes, which became a separate publicly traded company in July after it merged with GE's oil and gas operations.The dividend cut is considered a landmark decision considering GE's tradition as a must-own stock for investors concerned with income generation.The move, along with the company's other troubles, has sparked speculation that GE actually may lose its standing as a Dow industrials component, even though it is the sole original member of the blue-chip index.However, Langenberg & Co. actually upgraded its rating of the stock to a buy, the first time it has held that view since March 2015.Analyst Brian Langenberg said the dividend cut is already priced into the stock, and he sees GE able to regain some confidence through improved corporate governance.With reporting by CNBC's Morgan Brennan.
Ex-GE transportation CEO: It's 'painful' to see the 'dismantling of this legendary company':::::Robert Nardelli on GE: John Flannery has no choice but to let the chips fall as they may 9 Hours Ago | 03:08 Former General Electric transportation CEO Bob Nardelli told CNBC on Monday that it's "very painful" for him to watch the "dismantling of this legendary company."Shares of GE were lower Monday after the company said it would cut its quarterly dividend in half to help free up capital to fund a turnaround, and announced an aggressive corporate restructuring.During a presentation at the company's investor day Monday, Chairman and CEO John Flannery said the future of the company is going to be "more focused" and admitted that its performance has been "unacceptable.""I continue to get hundreds of emails and texts about what's going on," said Nardelli, also the former GE power systems CEO."I think John has no choice but to push it all to the center of the table and kind of let the chips fall where they are given the situation, which certainly sounds more direr than any of us had been led to believe."The conglomerate said Monday it sees adjusted earnings for the year ahead between $1 and $1.07 a share.The board of directors will be reduced from 18 to 12, with three new members slated "with relevant industry experience."The board being reduced is "probably appropriate given the downsize of the business," Nardelli told "Squawk on the Street.""I just hope they get someone on the board with industrial experience, [which] would be very beneficial."Flannery has a challenging environment, Nardelli said, but "I think he's doing the right things.Open the kimono, put it all out there, and work like heck to try to bring it back."Nardelli added it would be unfair to put all of the blame GE's previous CEO, Jeff Immelt, for its performance."I mean there was an 18-person board that reviewed and approved all those things," he said.
AB InBev to replace head of North America division:::::The world's biggest brewer, Anheuser-Busch InBev, is replacing the head of its North America business to stem a slide in sales in its largest market.AB InBev said Joao Castro Neves had decided to step down and his place would be taken on Jan. 1 by another Brazilian company veteran, Michel Doukeris, currently chief sales officer.Consumers in the United States are shifting from AB InBev's mainstream lagers Budweiser and Bud Light to craft beers made by smaller brewers, Mexican imports or wines and spirits.AB InBev has sold less beer in North America in each year since 2014, with a steep 6.2 percent drop in the third quarter of this year."People are trading up," said Liberum analyst Nico von Stackelberg."I don't think anyone is really hoping for dramatic volume turnarounds.Just stopping the bleeding is the hope."Doukeris has previously headed up the company's Chinese and Asia Pacific operations, helping to expand Budweiser globally and launching AB InBev's U.S. unit focused on import and craft beer brands, which have grown."The U.S. is our most important market and we recognize the need to continue to focus on driving topline growth across our portfolio," said AB InBev Chief Executive Carlos Brito.
It’s going to take 'five years’ to turn General Electric around, analyst says:::::General Electric is trying to turn things around, as the company announced Monday it was slashing its dividend in half and restructuring to focus primarily on three units."To really turn this company around operationally and culturally, it's going to take CEO John Flannery if he does it right five years," industrial analyst Brian Langenberg said on CNBC's "Squawk Box."Langenberg compares GE's current situation to that of Honeywell over a decade ago.He says Honeywell went from being "a burned-out husk" of a company to "about four or five years" later being "credible with investors" again."There is a path to doing that, but it is not going to be a quick fix," Langenberg said.GE spent years "buying high and selling low," according to Langenberg.For years the company overpaid for acquisitions and crippled its cash flow, a reality Vertical Research Partners founder Jeffrey Sprague also identified on "Squawk Box.""It could have been fixable but there were many capital allocation mistakes over the years," Sprague said."GE was slow to admit or recognize the pressures there, but they've been coming for awhile."As a result, GE "absolutely had to cut the dividend," Sprague says.He says he fully expected GE's announcement to cut its quarterly dividend in half, to 12 cents a share from 24 cents a share, effective in December."It's very clear the power markets are in bad shape, and that's the biggest business at GE," Sprague said."They have gotten themselves extended on cash flow here over the last several years and then had their biggest market turn on them.""It really just left them no out," Sprague added.Shares of GE were down 33 percent this year as of Friday's close, according to FactSet.The shares were down 1.6 percent on Monday shortly after the open.
GE announces dividend cut, broad restructuring:::::General Electric set forth a new agenda on Monday as it tries to restructure its way back to stronger growth, with earnings estimates lower than Wall Street forecasts, a reduced dividend and an aggressive corporate restructuring.The Boston-based 125-year-old industrial conglomerate also said it was cutting the number of seats on its board as part of what its chief executive called "a reset year" in 2018.GE also will be slicing 25 percent of staff from the home office.Investors recoiled at the news about the dividend and restructuring, sending shares down 7.2 percent Monday in heavy trading.The selling pressure picked up as the trading day went on with the shares down as much as 8.5 percent at one point.It was the stock's worst single-day decline since April 2009 when the company was still caught in the throes of the housing recession."The GE of the future is going to be a more focused industrial company," CEO John Flannery said during his presentation at the company's investor day Monday."It will leverage a lot of game-changing capabilities."The event happened amid a plunging share price and as Flannery announced an "extremely painful" halving of the quarterly dividend to 12 cents a share.The restructuring plan said the dividend was set "with a path to grow going forward" but marks the largest cut by an S&P 500 during an nonfinancial crisis year.
Major US mall owner rallies on $14.8 billion bid, but some say offer should be sweeter:::::Escalating retail headwinds aren't only impacting retailers these days just take a look at their landlords.General Growth Properties, one of the largest publicly traded U.S. mall owners, received a nearly $15 billion bid on Saturday from Brookfield Property Partners to acquire the shares it currently doesn't own in the real estate investment trust.The news comes after reports that Brookfield had held "preliminary discussions" with GGP about taking the company private.Chicago-based GGP is often considered top of its peer group, with a real estate portfolio consisting mainly of "Class A" malls, or those that draw the most sales per square foot.To be sure, like its REIT rivals, GGP has still struggled with retail bankruptcies, store closures and a shift in spending to online platforms."We believe GGP is negotiating a privatization transaction from a position of weakness," Wells Fargo analyst Jeff Donnelly wrote in a note to clients.Brookfield has offered to pay $23 per share for the remaining 66 percent of GGP split between cash and equity.The Wall Street Journal first reported on the proposal Sunday evening."Brookfield's access to large-scale capital and deep operating expertise across multiple real estate sectors combined with GGP's high-quality retail asset base will allow us to maximize the value of these irreplaceable assets," Brookfield CEO Brian Kingston said in a statement.GGP said it formed a special committee of independent directors to review the bid, bringing on Goldman Sachs as a financial advisor.GGP shares surged 6.7 percent Monday to $23.69 above the offer price, implying the pot could get even sweeter.According to analysts, a $14.8 billion price tag likely won't be enough for GGP."The $23 price should set a floor for GGP shares," Boenning & Scattergood analyst Floris van Dijkum said."We believe this initial offer is too low while [Brookfield] has a history of raising its offer for takeover candidates."Dijkum said he's expects an offer closer to $30 per share."While the offer is encouraging, cementing BPY's rumored interest and the recent M&A euphoria, it falls short of GGP private market value estimates and investor expectations," Mizuho analyst Haendel St. Juste said."This is just 'round one' of a fluid situation."Brookfield's 34 percent stake in GGP has a market value of roughly $21 billion.GGP shares were down more than 25 percent for the year before surging last week on buyout chatter.Now, Wall Street is rallying behind a potential take private, and short sellers are seen fleeing.Brookfield took its first stake in GGP as part of an agreement to bring the REIT out of bankruptcy in 2010.It acquired more GGP warrants in early 2013, filings show, and agreed to maintain its stake in the company below a 45 percent threshold through last January.A year earlier, Brookfield reportedly was considering acquiring the REIT, which at the time had a market value of $24 billion.The two were also in talks prior to GGP seeking bankruptcy protection in 2009, as it prepared to restructure its $27 billion debt load.This year, GGP has focused efforts around renovating locations and filling vacated spaces within its malls.The REIT has reduced its exposure to apparel tenants, for example, and added more food options."One of the key tenets of our business plan is capitalizing on the embedded opportunity with our portfolio to redevelop anchor boxes," CEO Sandeep Mathrani said on a recent conference call with analysts and investors.In October alone, GGP acquired two Sears locations in Pennsylvania and Louisiana.To date, GGP has invested more than $2 billion in redeveloping 115 of its properties, reaping "very attractive returns," Mathrani said.A tie-up with Brookfield could give GGP the opportunity to pursue a more mixed-use strategy, incorporating apartments and office buildings into its properties, something Mathrani has expressed interest in doing.Brookfield has a much more diversified real estate portfolio that includes office properties, retail boxes, multifamily housing units, student housing and self-storage centers.The proposed transaction with GGP would allot Brookfield ownership interest in roughly $100 billion of real estate assets globally.As retailers face more challenges from online competitors like Amazon, their landlords are increasingly of interest.Other retail REITs are being targeted by activist investors who demand change at a more rapid clip.Just last week, Dan Loeb's Third Point hedge fund revealed it had built a position in mall owner Macerich.Loeb could push for a potential sale of the company over time, according to reports.One of the biggest activists in the real estate industry is Jonathan Litt, a former managing director at Citigroup.He founded the hedge fund Land and Buildings in 2008 and has recently pressured Taubman Centers to explore strategic options.Taubman's portfolio consists mainly of U.S. shopping centers, but the REIT also has a small presence in China and South Korea.In a separate attack, Litt is urging Hudson's Bay the parent company to Lord & Taylor and Saks Fifth Avenue to consider being taken private by management or consider other uses for its real estate.Mall owners including GGP, Taubman, Macerich, Simon Property Group, CBL Properties, Washington Prime Group, Seritage, and Pennsylvania REIT have seen their stocks fall in 2017, some by more than 40 percent.
Membership revoked? Veteran GE's spot in exclusive Dow may be shaky:::::It is hard to imagine the Dow Jones industrial average without General Electric.The U.S. industrial conglomerate's stock is the lone original component of the venerable blue-chip index that debuted in 1896.But GE's dwindling share price and the likelihood that its new chief executive will dramatically slim down its sprawling operations is leading some index-watchers to consider the possibility of the company losing its membership in the elite 30-stock Dow."Since it is trading at a low share price and has a small weighting in the index, that does put it at an increased risk of getting removed," said Alex Bryan, director of passive strategies research at Morningstar in Chicago."I don't think it's obvious that it is going to be removed from the index, but it certainly is at risk."GE's shares last week closed under $20 for the first time in more than five years, its struggles made clear by a disappointing third-quarter earnings report last month.The stock closed at $20.49 on Friday, marking a 35 percent decline in 2017.The stock price is now the lowest among Dow members.Because the Dow is a price-weighted index, unlike the benchmark S&P 500. which is influenced by the market values of its constituents, that means GE has the least impact on the Dow's daily swings.As of Friday, GE's weight stood at only 0.6 percent.By comparison, aircraft maker Boeing, whose stock is above $260, has a 7.7 percent weight.Changes to the Dow are made on an as-needed basis and selection is not governed by quantitative rules, according to the published methodology for the index.A spokesman for S&P Dow Jones Indices said the committee that oversees the Dow index meets regularly and that its discussions are confidential.GE declined to comment.Ivan Cajic, vice president for index and ETF research for ITG, said if the Dow were to make a change in the near future, GE is the likeliest to be removed."I wouldn't be surprised if the company is safe for the time being and Dow Jones adopts a wait-and-see approach over the next few months to see how both the stock price and what the overall company looks like in the coming months," Cajic said.
GE to focus on three key units, exit most other operations: WSJ:::::General Electric's Chief Executive John Flannery plans to disclose a roadmap for the company on Monday that will focus on three of its biggest business lines aviation, power and health care, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing a person familiar with the matter.The report also says the plan stops short of a breakup or more radical restructuring of the 125-year-old company, but Flannery will look to exit most of its other operations.GE announced Monday it plans to slash its quarterly dividend by 50 percent to 12 cents a share from 24 cents a share.The Boston-based company also plans to shed its majority stake in Baker Hughes, which became a separate public company in July after merging with GE's oil and gas operations, the report said."We don't have a comment until the presentation is released at 8:30 a.m.ET," GE spokeswoman Deirdre Latour said in an email when contacted by Reuters.GE was reported to be laying off sales staff and other employees in its software division, according to sources, last week, ahead of Flannery's expected announcement on Monday of a plan to slash costs and jettison units in an effort to improve the company's profits.
Richard Branson played Coke and Pepsi against each other at high school aged 14:::::Billionaire entrepreneur Richard Branson's commercial acumen was honed at a young age.When he was just 14 years old, Branson started a student magazine and pitted two of the world's biggest business rivals against each other Coca-Cola and Pepsi.First, he would persuade the telephone operator to connect him to companies."I was working out of the school phone box where you had to put money in.So instead of putting the money in, I just rang up the operator and said: 'I put the money in,'" he told CNBC's "The Brave Ones.""The operator became my secretary and (would say): 'Hello, I have Mr Branson for you.'And I would go straight through to Coca-Cola or Pepsi without paying."Branson soon realized that the best way to get competitors to advertise in his magazine was to tell them that their rival had agreed to do so.He said: "I soon learned the art that if I let Coke know that Pepsi were definitely in, that Coke would then jump in.And my education started.It was an exciting time."But the magazine eventually cost Branson his formal education, with the school principle giving him an ultimatum to quit the publication or quit high school."I said: 'Thank you for that choice.I'm off to run the magazine,'" he told his teacher.So Branson left high school, aged 15.His magazine made a profit, and soon after he founded Virgin.
Trump bailed on a trade deal, and now a bunch of US businesses may suffer:::::One of the defining actions of President Donald Trump's tenure in the White House so far is his decision to withdraw the U.S. from a 12-nation trade pact that would have had wide-ranging implications for the global economy.Now that deal the Trans-Pacific Partnership looks like it's going to be settled without the U.S.. That may mean American farmers and small business owners will soon regret Washington's exit."The U.S. business community that's going to get hit the hardest when TPP happens is going to be agriculture and small and medium-sized enterprises," said Steve Okun, senior advisor at international trade consultancy McLarty Associates and a former deputy general counsel at the U.S. transportation department.Progress on the agreement, now known as the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, hit a milestone over the weekend as the 11 remaining members agreed on core elements for a new framework without the U.S. Once the new deal is implemented, American farmers could be left at a disadvantage: The agreement seeks lower tariffs for goods traded among members, the bulk of which are Asia-Pacific nations.That means non-member countries, such as the U.S., will still face high rates when shipping to Asia-Pacific."It's going to really benefit farmers and agricultural producers here in Asia-Pacific and not the U.S.," Okun told CNBC.
Target CEO tries to find a ray of light amid growing doom and gloom in retail:::::Target CEO Brian Cornell says he's optimistic about the holiday season and consumer confidence, and still sees lots of opportunities in retail.As all stores head into the crucial season, the Minneapolis-based discounter he has led since 2014 has been revamping its stores, opening smaller locations in urban markets and trying to offer more expert customer help in areas like food, clothing, and electronics.Retailers overall are under pressure to make the stores more inviting and offer experiences shoppers couldn't get online, as customers increasingly opt for the convenience of shopping online.Target is offering new store brands, eight of which will be available for the first time for the holiday season.That includes the much-anticipated Heart & Hand by Magnolia, a lifestyle brand from Chip and Joanna Gaines of HGTV's "Fixer Upper."Target's also been expanding online services including now shipping online orders from 1,400 of its 1,800 stores for faster delivery.It's hiring 100,000 temporary workers, a 40 percent increase from last year, to working in its stores, stocking shelves or fulfilling online orders.Cornell spoke recently with The Associated Press about the holiday season and how consumers are feeling.The interview was edited for length and clarity.Q: Why do you feel optimistic about the season?A: I feel really good.We've been working all year to bring our new brand offerings to life, to bring more value to the guest.We have done a lot of work to reimagine stores and move into new neighborhoods, so the holiday season is where it all comes together.Q: What's been the reaction to Target's move to add dedicated experts?A: If you shop beauty today, we have someone there that can help you, who understands the category, that's there to assist you and make a decision.In apparel, there's someone who can put together an outfit for Friday night.So the guest reaction has been really positive.I'm absolutely confident that is leading to market-share improvements.We're seeing stability and improvements in food and beverage and a big uptick in produce.We now have produce experts.Q: What's the state of the consumer?A: The consumer has been incredibly resilient.I look at the latest consumer confidence numbers.They look really positive, and we're seeing traffic up at the stores.We're seeing visits (to our) store site grow.I think we are going into the holiday season with a stable consumer environment.Q: Given a rash of layoffs at stores, do you think the retail industry is still the entry point into the workforce?A: We're a big part of the American economy.Things are changing.There may be different types of retail opportunities, whether it is in a store or as a visual merchant or working in fulfilment so the jobs may change over time, but there's lots of opportunities.I still believe that for well-run retailers that have great financial fundamentals who are investing in the business, there's great opportunity to take market share.I am absolutely determined to make sure Target is one of those winners.
Money will start flowing out of China again, but it'll be much more targeted:::::In early November, Beijing issued a new set of draft guidelines aimed to make outbound M&A easier.As part of those new rules, China is streamlining a process for domestic companies investing over $300 million overseas to gain the required approval from authorities, Reuters reported.Yet at the same time, Beijing will also increase oversight on the investment practices of overseas subsidiaries of Chinese companies.Previously, businesses could set up foreign companies and use funds through them to do deals, thereby skipping many of China's capital outflow restrictions.Beijing's recent draft followed guidelines it issued in August dictating what kind of overseas investments would be banned, restricted or encouraged.The move formalized Beijing's attempts beginning last November to control what it called "irrational" foreign investments.But the Chinese government is doing more than just limiting some kinds of deals, it's also explicitly encouraging other kinds: Experts agreed that the government's strong support for the Belt and Road Initiative, which was written into the Communist Party constitution last month, will mean some redirection to related activities in outbound M&A.The Belt and Road Initiative involves 65 countries, which together account for one-third of global GDP and 60 percent of the world's population, according to Oxford Economics.As such, experts say certain sectors, and countries, are expected to benefit from the expansion efforts of Chinese companies.Lian Lian, JPMorgan's managing director and co-head of North Asia M&A, told CNBC investments that can "create need for China's industrial capacity [and] manufacturing capabilities" will likely benefit.Those sectors include infrastructure, natural resources, agriculture, trade, culture and logistics."These are clearly what they outlined as favored industries," she said, referring to the August guidelines.Overseas deals in those areas are likely to get faster approvals from the government.Lian added that a few other sectors will also receive government support, even if they were not mentioned in the August guidelines.Those sectors include food safety, health care and investments that can create more employment in China."These, although they were not specifically listed in the encouraged list, we believe also will bring benefits to China's economy and should receive support," she said.Overall, Lian said she is optimistic about deal activities next year, but mega deals will remain more challenging than before Beijing's intervention.Citi's Banfield added that Beijing would also favor investments that enhance China's manufacturing capabilities in equipment and technology, and provide access to exploration and development of offshore resources.Meanwhile, although the U.S. and the European Union have always been favored destinations for Chinese overseas M&A, there was interest emerging in countries falling under the Belt and Road Initiative, according to Alicia Garcia-Herrero and Jianwei Xu, economists at French investment bank Natixis.Association of Southeast Asian nations, particularly Singapore, as well as South Korea and South Asia have become focal points since the announcement of the initiative, the economists added.Garcia-Herrero told CNBC that it would be "really impossible" for Chinese overseas spending to exclusively fit into a Belt and Road framework, but investments in heavy assets like industrials and infrastructure would be "mainly Belt and Road-related."On the other hand, she said, more asset-light targets such as health care, retail, services or technology will "continue to be West-driven."
Backing Big Brother: Investors are pouring into Chinese facial recognition firms:::::Buoyed by China's plans to build a ubiquitous CCTV surveillance network, Chinese and some foreign investors are pouring money into start-up technology firms that specialize in facial recognition software.At stake for firms such as SenseTime Group, Face++ and DeepGlint, is a multi-billion dollar global public and private market for facial recognition technology that can quickly identify individuals by measuring major elements of their faces, such as the distance between the eyes and the curve of the cheekbones.With the use of artificial intelligence (AI) the technology can recognise and track those wanted by the authorities by seeking a match from a database of photographs.In the commercial world it can be used for security at homes, workplaces and ATM machines, and as a part of payments systems at stores and restaurants.According to estimates from IHS Markit, video surveillance including the equipment and video management software was a $6.4 billion market in China in 2016, with 176 million surveillance cameras already installed by the authorities or private companies.That market, the largest in the world, is set for a compound annual growth rate of 12.4 percent through 2021, according to IHS.By comparison, the US market was estimated to be worth only $2.9 billion and growing at just 0.7 percent a year.In China, though, the supercharged growth has added to concerns about controls on dissidents or activists by the government of President Xi Jinping, especially when combined with the potential for the Chinese authorities to track phones being increasingly used for electronic payments and their stepped up monitoring of Internet traffic.That hasn't appeared to deter investors, who include leading U.S. venture capital firms such as the China arm of Sequoia Capital, which is one of the best-known Silicon Valley venture capital firms.
Mars and space medicine: Human survival traveling outside Earth:::::Plans to rocket humans to Earth's closest neighbor continue to advance, with the year 2024 a near-term goal at least if Elon Musk has his way.Yet space medicine expert Jim Logan said recently the effects on the human body from spending extensive time outside of Earth's gravity remain unresolved."We need a huge sample size and right now we have a sample size of one, and soon maybe two," Logan told CNBC at the New Worlds conference in Austin, Texas.Logan referenced astronauts Scott Kelly, who spent 340 days in space; and Peggy Whitson, who recently returned from the International Space Station after 290 days."We need to fly a lot of people, for long durations, if we're going to make any progress.You cannot talk about human colonization without that," Logan said.Logan spent 20 years helping diagnose and treat NASA's astronauts.He said the main obstacle to sending humans to Mars is what he calls "the gravity prescription."He said: "We know what Earth's gravity one G for 24 hours a day does.And we know that zero gravity, after four months, begins serious health deterioration."
Uber Is Close to Deal to Sell Stake to SoftBank:::::SAN FRANCISCO Uber was close on Sunday to finalizing a deal to sell a significant stake of itself to SoftBank, a Japanese conglomerate, paving the way for the ride-hailing company to make sweeping governance changes and to go public by 2019.Under the agreement, a consortium of investors led by SoftBank will buy at least 14 percent of Uber through a combination of new and existing stock, according to three people briefed on the process, who spoke on condition of anonymity because those details are confidential.SoftBank plans to buy about $1 billion of fresh stock at Ubers current valuation of about $68.5 billion, but the bulk of the deal will be purchasing existing Uber shares from current investors.SoftBank is to buy the existing Uber shares in a process called a tender offer, which takes at least a month to complete.During that process, a price will be set for the existing Uber shares.If investors are reluctant to sell and SoftBank cannot hit its threshold of 14 percent ownership of Uber, SoftBank can walk away from the deal, the people said.An Uber spokesman declined to comment on Sunday.People from SoftBank did not immediately respond to requests for comment.The agreement follows an Oct. 3 Uber board meeting, in which directors voted to move forward with an investment from SoftBank.As part of the deal, Ubers board agreed to carry out a set of sweeping governance changes, including measures that reduce the influence that Travis Kalanick, Ubers former chief executive, has at the company.He still has a seat on the companys board.The SoftBank investment also sets up Uber to go public by 2019, another provision that was contingent on the deal.More from The New York Times: Can You Draw the Starbucks Logo Without Cheating?Probably Not.Where Self-Driving Cars Go to Learn Plugging Into the Gig Economy, From Home With a Headset Since that meeting, SoftBank, Uber and Ubers early investors have haggled over deal terms.Some of Ubers early investors, like the venture capital firm Benchmark, initially wanted to retain certain shareholder rights that they hold through their Uber stock, according to two of the people briefed on the discussions.Benchmark and others ultimately agreed to waive those rights in exchange for concessions from SoftBank over the tender offer process, the people said.Benchmark has agreed not to work with other investors to prop up the price during the tender offer.The firm will also suspend the lawsuit that it filed against Mr. Kalanick, and drop the suit upon completion of the tender offer.SoftBank plans to purchase the Uber shares along with other investors, including Dragoneer, an investment firm.SoftBank will gain two Uber board seats as part of the investment.Uber does not necessarily need new money, as it has raised more than $10 billion in debt and equity and has some $5 billion in the bank.But the SoftBank investment will let some of the companys investors sell their shares to lock in huge gains.Early employees also stand to sell for significant sums.SoftBank also owns pieces of ride-hailing companies around the world, including Didi Chuxing in China, Ola in India, Grab in Southeast Asia and 99 in Brazil.The firm, led by Masayoshi Son, could help Uber navigate its relationships with those global rivals.Uber left the China market in 2016 by selling its operation to Didi and taking a minority investment stake in the new company.SoftBanks investment in Uber pressures Ubers main American rival, Lyft, to raise more money to compete on driver incentive deals and lower prices.As the two companies battle for market share, both have lost hundreds of millions of dollars a year.Follow Katie Benner on Twitter @ktbenner and Mike Isaac @MikeIsaac
Etienne Schneider: The space industry is now 2% of Luxembourg’s GDP:::::One of Europe's smallest countries now holds claim to being a giant in the space industry.Luxembourg, with a population less than the state of Vermont, now generates nearly 2 percent of its annual gross domestic product from the space industry, according to Deputy Prime Minister Etienne Schneider.The country's economy checked in just shy of $61 billion in 2016, according to the CIA World Factbook."We have grown from nothing to the most dynamic in Europe," Schneider told an audience Saturday, in a speech at the New Worlds conference in Austin, Texas.He added that the country's space program was first launched just over 30 years ago.Schneider, who also serves as Luxembourg's economic minister, told the conference that he is often questioned about why Luxembourg is so "keen on exploiting space resources."He replied by saying the same "liberal, extremely business friendly climate" that pushed the country's financial sector boom is now being reapplied to attracting space companies."I have more than 70 space companies in the pipeline," Schneider told CNBC after the speech.Luxembourg's "space resources initiative" is the country's plan to make the most out of a quickly growing global industry, the minister said."It's a series of measures to position Luxembourg as the European heart of exploration and use of space resources."He highlighted U.S. companies Deep Space Industries and Planetary Resources, as well as Japanese ispace as three key, rising players in Luxembourg.With a per capita GDP of $103,000, Schneider says the space industry has "strong public support."Space mining is Luxembourg's present focus, but it is not the country's first.In 1985, Luxembourg launched a public-private partnership with satellite operator SES.While Schneider said he believes the satellite business has not plateaued, he does not anticipate the space industry growing beyond the 2 percent GDP mark any time soon."It could be 5 percent, but that may be 10 or 15 years," Schneider said."Right now we have dozens of companies that are here but have yet to make money.We have startup incubators and investment funds are being established."The key then, to Schneider, is his nation's legal framework of ownership.The United States and Luxembourg are the only two countries in the world to have passed laws giving corporations ownership of materials mined in space, but only after they've been extracted."Allowing companies to have ownership of future materials gives venture capital firms incentive to come here and buy into these opportunities," Schneider added.
A political shock throws Lebanon’s economy back into crisis:::::"We don't know how things will escalate," said Rida Shayto, an associate director at the pharmaceutical manufacturer Algorithm, which does half its sales to the Gulf.The developments have stunned the Mediterranean country, which once looked to Saudi Arabia as a pillar to its own stability.The kingdom brokered the Taif agreement in 1989 that ushered in peace for Lebanon after 15 years of civil war.The kingdom has plowed decades of investment into Lebanon, opened markets to trade and allowed generations of talented and ambitious Lebanese to work in its oil-based economy.The concern now is that the kingdom and other Gulf nations will throw out Lebanese workers, as they did with Qatar this summer in a rage over that country's perceived closeness to Iran.Some 220,000 Lebanese work in Saudi Arabia and send back close to $2 billion in remittances each year, according to Mounir Rached, a senior economic adviser to the Finance Ministry.Lebanese are hoping Saudi Arabia will be too wary of the negative impact on its own economy from such a mass expulsion.Many Lebanese hold managerial positions, including in the kingdom's all-important oil sector, and it would take time to refill the posts.An expulsion would also undermine decades of Saudi efforts to cultivate ties with Lebanese Sunnis."I think those who are invested in Lebanon are not going to come and destroy everything that they did in terms of relationships and associations and credibility," said Kamel Wazni, an economist and sometimes adviser to Hariri's government.But the kingdom and its powerful Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman, who has made his name by dramatic or reckless, as his critics put it moves, can't be seen as doing nothing, said Randa Slim, a Lebanese analyst at the Washington-based Middle East Institute."They have locked themselves into an escalatory path without giving themselves an exit," she said.The kingdom could expel Lebanese Shiites and Christians, she said.Shiites are Hezbollah's constituency and some Christian parties have allied with it.They number 10,000 to 20,000 in Saudi Arabia, according to Rached, the Finance Ministry adviser.As it is, the biggest threat now is a retreat to the political paralysis that has crimped growth since 2011.Lebanon, once a beacon of free market growth and joie de vivre living, was paralyzed for years over how to respond to the catastrophic civil war consuming its neighbor and trade partner, Syria.Hariri's Future Movement, the largest party in Parliament, wanted Lebanon out of Syrian affairs, while Hezbollah was sending its militias there to fight on behalf of President Bashar Assad.The political log-jam resulted in Lebanon not having a president for more than two years and no economic vision to attract investment.Meanwhile, refugees poured into the country more than one million of them, equivalent to a quarter of Lebanon's population depressing wages in service and labor sectors.Hariri became premier under a deal that broke the deadlock and allowed the election of a Hezbollah-friendly president.The political breakthrough also brought an end to the stagnation in economic policy.The country passed its first budget since 2005, raising taxes and public salaries and opening up two oil and gas blocks off its coastline for drilling in a bid to bring in some sorely-needed investment.That project and a $21 billion investment plan to improve the country's woefully inadequate infrastructure are now on ice."The council of ministers will not be able to take a decision in the current conditions," said Nassib Ghobril, the chief economist at Lebanon's Byblos Bank, of the gas and oil bills.The government also needs to find revenues to service a public debt that has reached more than $75 billion 140 percent of the gross domestic product, a debt-to-GDP ratio that is among the highest in the world.A key factor for stability has been the strength of its currency, the pound, pegged at 1,500 pounds to the dollar since the 1990s.For now, at least, experts believe that seems safe.The Central Bank holds $43.5 billion in foreign currency reserves, enough to sustain the peg for one to two decades at the current pace of currency conversions.There has been a flurry of transactions from pound to dollar among Lebanese accounts, bankers have told The Associated Press.But as long as the dollars stay circulating in Lebanon's already largely dollarized economy, the peg will remain stable."I don't have any concern about the stability of the exchange rate," said Ghobril.
Likely FDA approval for postpartum depression drug pushes Sage Therapeutics stock up 40%:::::Shares of Cambridge, Mass.-based biopharmaceutical company Sage Therapeutics are popping after the company announced positive results in trials for a drug that may someday be available to treat those with postpartum depression.The company is up more than 40 percent to $96.75 this week following two Phase 3 trials evaluating brexanolone.The drug, formerly known as SAGE-547, achieved a significant reduction in depression symptoms after only 60 hours, a rapid reduction in treatment time compared to the options currently available to those suffering from the condition."We are on the cusp of a major discovery," CEO Jeff Jonas said Friday on CNBC's Power Lunch.Analysts from Canaccord Genuity said the probability of FDA approval following the trials increased to about 80 percent.Postpartum depression occurs in nearly 15 percent of births, according to the National Institute of Mental Health.It can include feelings of sadness and anxiety that can limit the ability of those suffering from the condition to take care of themselves or their families.Current treatment for the condition includes counseling and medication, including anti-depressants.Anti-depressants can take weeks to be effective.Brexanolone is administered intravenously.The company is also working on an oral treatment called SAGE-217.The analysts at Canaccord upped their price target for the company to $140.
Louis C.K. on sex misconduct accusations: 'These stories are true':::::On Friday, FX announced it was ending its association with C.K.The network canceled its deal with his production company, Pig Newton, and removed him as executive producer on four shows - Better Things, Baskets, One Mississippi and The Cops.He also will also no longer receive compensation for those shows.The distribution company behind C.K.'s latest film "I Love You, Daddy," set for release next week, pulled the plug on the project Friday morning.In addition, Netflix opted out of an upcoming comedy special featuring the comedian, and HBO dropped C.K.from its "Night of Too Many Stars" special.His full statement is below (Note contents of his statement contains graphic language): I want to address the stories told to the New York Times by five women named Abby, Rebecca, Dana, Julia who felt able to name themselves and one who did not.These stories are true.At the time, I said to myself that what I did was okay because I never showed a woman my dick without asking first, which is also true.But what I learned later in life, too late, is that when you have power over another person, asking them to look at your dick isn't a question.It's a predicament for them.The power I had over these women is that they admired me.And I wielded that power irresponsibly.I have been remorseful of my actions.And I've tried to learn from them.And run from them.Now I'm aware of the extent of the impact of my actions.I learned yesterday the extent to which I left these women who admired me feeling badly about themselves and cautious around other men who would never have put them in that position.I also took advantage of the fact that I was widely admired in my and their community, which disabled them from sharing their story and brought hardship to them when they tried because people who look up to me didn't want to hear it.I didn't think that I was doing any of that because my position allowed me not to think about it.There is nothing about this that I forgive myself for.And I have to reconcile it with who I am.Which is nothing compared to the task I left them with.I wish I had reacted to their admiration of me by being a good example to them as a man and given them some guidance as a comedian, including because I admired their work.The hardest regret to live with is what you've done to hurt someone else.And I can hardly wrap my head around the scope of hurt I brought on them.I'd be remiss to exclude the hurt that I've brought on people who I work with and have worked with who's professional and personal lives have been impacted by all of this, including projects currently in production: the cast and crew of Better Things, Baskets, The Cops, One Mississippi, and I Love You Daddy.I deeply regret that this has brought negative attention to my manager Dave Becky who only tried to mediate a situation that I caused.I've brought anguish and hardship to the people at FX who have given me so much The Orchard who took a chance on my movie.and every other entity that has bet on me through the years.I've brought pain to my family, my friends, my children and their mother.I have spent my long and lucky career talking and saying anything I want.I will now step back and take a long time to listen.Thank you for reading.
GE limps into investor day with shareholders demanding answers on dividend and turnaround plan:::::Not that long ago, General Electric was seen as the very model of corporate success, the American capitalist system in action under a sprawling umbrella of synergized interests.No more.As the company limps into its investor day presentation Monday, it has gone from a paradigm of success to a morass of excess.Where GE once was held as a beacon of how a multinational conglomerate is supposed to function, it now faces an uncertain future and a bevy of questions from investors and analysts.The crisis is not quite existential, but conditions are critical.Company executives must convince their constituency that there is a viable path forward."That will be up to GE," said Eric Ause, who covers GE for Fitch Ratings."How they do it will be up to GE's management team.They've got a new CEO and a new CFO, and they've been making some changes to the board.That will all play into their long-term decisions, what the mix of their business should be and how they get there."Investors have shown little confidence that even with the management shake-up, GE has a clear direction forward.The company has pledged to trim the parts of the operation that don't work, like GE Capital and the industrial solutions business, and focus on the future with core industrial businesses and GE Digital.The market, though, has been hard to please.GE shares have tumbled 37 percent in 2017 and are less than half where they stood when Jeffrey Immelt took over as CEO in September 2001.Immelt left the company in October, leaving behind a bevy of questions that likely will be addressed at Monday's event.The shares traded higher by more than 2 percent on Friday as it appeared the company had already begun taking some of the hard steps it will unveil Monday by reportedly cutting staff in its GE Digital division.
Pop-up shops still popular with retailers for the holidays:::::Pop-up shops are still popular among retailers, especially around the holidays.There is a "burst" of pop-ups expected to round out the year, an annual holiday survey from commercial real estate firm CBRE found.The holiday season offers companies a sliver of time to test new features, experiment where there is heavier foot traffic, or bring their online operations offline as companies such as Warby Parker, Bonobos and Allbirds have done.More importantly, "landlords have an appetite for pop-ups that they didn't have in the past," Melina Cordero, head of CBRE Americas' retail research division, told CNBC."Given customers are increasingly bored with the copy-paste mall model, [pop-ups] can be a pretty effective traffic driver."It's true more mall owners are opening up to the idea of putting pop-up spaces even permanent ones within their properties.Simon Property Group is opening "The Edit," which will rotate retailers throughout the year on short-term contracts.Washington Prime Group, another U.S. mall landlord, is finalizing plans to launch a pop-up marketplace called "Tangible" in its malls."A lot of times landlords themselves are actually investing in these projects," Cordero said."I think this is at the forefront of the holidays."Toys R Us has its holiday pop-up near Times Square this year.Yankee Candle is opening its first pop-up store in New York's SoHo neighborhood, through Jan. 3.Sharper Image, once a staple retailer in American malls, is also opening a temporary shop in New York for the holiday season.And these are just a few examples.Amazon is also bringing holiday pop-ups to some Whole Foods locations.CBRE's 2017 holiday survey found other trends this season to be: more shopping completed on mobile devices, off-price players winning with their discounts, and more warehouse space needed on a short-term basis to fulfill a surge in online orders.As a retailer, "you really need to be as efficient as possible," Cordero said.And around the holidays, no one company can risk not following consumer trends.In a separate holiday sentiment survey, real estate investment firm Jones Lang LaSalle is predicting a 6 percent increase in spending this season after speaking with more than 2,000 consumers."As we head into the holiday season, consumer confidence is the highest it's been in nearly 17 years," Greg Maloney, CEO of JLL Retail, said in a statement."We expect that holiday spending will mirror overall retail sales trends ... due to favorable economic conditions and the strength of the labor market."Nearly 40 percent of consumers surveyed will shop at more than six stores throughout the holidays, JLL found.And roughly two-thirds of shoppers indicated they will shop at superstores this year, while 44 percent said they plan to make purchases online.
Uber suffers another setback in the UK as a judge rules that drivers require workers' rights:::::Uber lost an appeal at a U.K. employment tribunal Friday when a judge ruled that its drivers should be classified as formal workers and not self-employed.The tribunal found that two drivers, Yaseen Aslam and James Farrar, were working for Uber and consequently entitled to a minimum wage and holiday pay, among other rights.Uber has long argued that its drivers are self-employed rather than workers employed directly by the firm.The tribunal's decision is not only a challenge for Uber's business in Britain, but for the so-called "gig economy" as a whole."For Uber's estimated 40,000 drivers in the U.K., this is another positive sign that their true employment status is that of a 'worker' and, as such, they should be entitled to worker rights," Alan Price, employment law director at Peninsula, said in a note Friday."The decision is also a further indication to 'gig economy' employers and companies with similar business models that they may need to reassess their treatment of their staff to ensure they are giving the correct rights."Another firm operating in the gig economy, online takeaway service Deliveroo, was faced with a legal challenge of its own from delivery drivers earlier this month.Deliveroo's riders are seeking to gain employment rights including the minimum wage.Uber has said it plans to appeal the ruling, either through Britain's Court of Appeal or through the Supreme Court, the nation's highest court for civil matters.In a statement, Tom Elvidge, acting general manager at Uber U.K., said: "Almost all taxi and private hire drivers have been self-employed for decades, long before our app existed.The main reason why drivers use Uber is because they value the freedom to choose if, when and where they drive and so we intend to appeal."The tribunal relies on the assertion that drivers are required to take 80 percent of trips sent to them when logged into the app.As drivers who use Uber know, this has never been the case in the U.K. "Over the last year we have made a number of changes to our app to give drivers even more control.We've also invested in things like access to illness and injury cover and we'll keep introducing changes to make driving with Uber even better."
News Corp. earnings Q1 2018:::::News Corp. blew past earnings expectations Thursday, as the company presses ahead with efforts to turn its print news publications, such as The Wall Street Journal, into digital-first operations.Here's how the company did compared to what Wall Street expected: EPS: 7 cents vs. 1 cent expected, according to Thomson Reuters Revenue: $2.06 billion vs. $1.97 billion expected, according to Thomson Reuters News Corp. shares initially jumped more than 2 percent in after-hours trading Thursday, before falling flat.In the year-ago quarter, News Corp. posted earnings per share a penny on $1.96 billion in revenue.News Corp. is the publishing arm of Rupert Murdoch's global media empire.Properties include financial publisher Dow Jones, book publisher HarperCollins and the New York Post.Through Dow Jones, New Corp. owns The Wall Street Journal, MarketWatch and Barron's.As the media landscape becomes increasingly digital, News Corp. has struggled to keep up advertising, circulation and subscription revenue in its news and information business, which includes its flagship property, The Wall Street Journal.In response, News Corp. has sought to shift the focus of its news publications away from print.The Wall Street Journal, for example, is in the midst of a major restructuring to become a digital-first operation.But as News Corp. has sought to make digital inroads, it has butted heads with the likes of Google, which plays a key role in whether or not content is visible through its search engine.News Corp. CEO Robert Thomson said Google's recent decision to end its "first click free" policy, in which news outlets had to offer three free articles daily in exchange for visibility in search engine results, would help support premium content behind paywalls at outlets like the Wall Street Journal.News Corp. has had some success in its digital push.Digital operations represented 27 percent of the information and news division's quarterly revenue, compared to 24 percent the year prior.The Wall Street Journal's total subscribers across its print and digital editions increased to 2.2 million, a 13.3-percent increase over the year prior.Digital subscribers at The Journal increased to 1,318,000, up from 967,000 in the year prior.Overall, revenue at the news and information division rose 2 percent to $1.2 billion compared to the year prior.Advertising revenue, however, remained a point of weakness.Print advertising revenue was flat, while digital advertising revenue saw only a modest increase.
Disney to price streaming service 'substantially below' Netflix, shares take another leg higher:::::The stock initially fell more than 3 percent in extended trade after the company reported year-over-year declines for most of its businesses.Media networks, the company's biggest segment, saw that figure decline 12 percent year over year.The company said it saw lower advertising revenue at Freeform, ESPN as well as its company-owned television stations.But longtime CEO Bob Iger reassured investors during the earnings call, saying he believes Disney will be able to tackle current headwinds in the media landscape.Here's what each segment reported in operating income compared to StreetAccount consensus estimates: Media networks: $1.48 billion, vs. $1.58 billion Parks and resorts: $746 million, vs. $735.1 million Studio: $218 million, vs. $364.4 million Consumer and interactive: $373 million, vs. $470.4 million The stock initially fell about 3 percent in after-hours trade, but later reversed to trade 1 percent higher.Longtime CEO Bob Iger said in a statement that Disney "will continue to invest for the future and take the smart risks required to deliver shareholder value."Earlier this week, CNBC reported that Disney approached 21st Century Fox about acquiring some of its entertainment assets, which would leave the latter with a news and sports-focused business.When asked about the talks in a Thursday earnings call, Disney said it wouldn't take questions on press speculation.Fox was similarly tight-lipped on the subject.In a Wednesday earnings call, Executive Chairman Lachlan Murdoch maintained that Fox has the necessary scale to grow and compete in a media landscape that's becoming increasingly digital.That is a challenge for both Disney and Fox as tech-savvy competitors like Netflix continue to post eye-popping revenue growth.On Thursday, Disney reported a 3 percent year-over-year decline in revenue.Here's how the company did compared with what Wall Street expected: EPS: $1.07 vs. $1.12 expected according to Thomson Reuters Revenue: $12.78 billion vs. $13.23 billion expected according to Thomson Reuters In the year-ago quarter, Disney reported adjusted earnings of $1.10 a share on $13.14 billion in revenue.The company has lately suffered a bruising media battle that ended with Disney backtracking on its decision to bar the Los Angeles Times from its movie screenings amid backlash from the news organizations and notable Hollywood figures.Disney had yanked the newspaper's access after it published a two-part investigation that detailed Disney's financial dealings with the city of Anaheim.Shares of Disney have edged about 0.7 percent lower, year to date.This is breaking news.Please check back for updates.CNBC's David Faber contributed reporting.
Haste on Tax Measures May Leave a Trail of Loopholes:::::An incentive to invest in slipshod, money-losing ventures would be created by the combination of a new proposal to immediately expense investments with the Senates suggested delay in the corporate tax cut.Rules designed to prevent highly paid doctors, lawyers and other service providers from cashing in on new benefits aimed at small businesses can be easily circumvented.Even those who applaud the aim of reducing the corporate tax rate and transforming the way global profits are taxed worry that specific provisions will miss the mark.Republican leaders, responding to political pressure to move quickly, defend the process, saying Congress has held dozens of hearings on tax reform in recent years.Tax bills, by nature complex, are shaped by a galaxy of competing pressures.And withholding details until the final vote as a way of shielding the legislation from special interests is not a new strategy.Yet several veterans of previous tax battles argue what is different this time is the mix of breakneck speed and enormous scope.Consider the plans shift from a worldwide system, where profits are taxed no matter where they are earned, to a territorial system, which exempts profits earned outside the United States, bringing the American tax system in line with those in most other nations.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Because the switch could end up encouraging American companies to move even more profits offshore to avoid paying any domestic income tax, both the House and Senate versions of the bill impose rules to deter most multinationals with annual revenues of more than $100 million from exploiting such tactics.But the effort to catch the giants under the new territorial system sets a financial bar that small and medium-size businesses can limbo under.Mr. Shay said accounting firms were likely to start marketing off-the-shelf tax shelters allowing companies to set up foreign offices in low-tax countries like Bermuda or Luxembourg to shrink their tax bills.Theyre just opening us up to the next round of tax shelters on the international side, he said.And the I.R.S., underfunded as it is, isnt going to be able to check anything.At the same time, he said, some safeguards aimed at multinationals could still be bypassed.To reduce their home tax bill, companies like Google and Pfizer, for instance, often relocate patents and copyrights in tax havens and then sell use of that intellectual property back to their American subsidiaries at eye-popping prices.These are the higher-than-normal profits which Senate bill drafters have cunningly called Gilti (for global intangible low-tax income) that Republican bills are trying to stop from leaking out of the tax system.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Multinationals, though, could avoid some of the Gilti tax by shifting more tangible property like production and research facilities abroad.Other problems arise from the push to reduce the rate on pass-through businesses (sole proprietorships, partnerships and S corporations that currently pay taxes at the individual rate).Lawmakers have advertised the cut as relief for smaller businesses, but high-income investors in hedge and private-equity funds could use the provision to reduce the tax paid on rent and interest income by as much as a third.Hedge-fund investors have an additional opportunity for a windfall with a simple reporting technique, said Steven M. Rosenthal, a senior fellow at the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center and former legislation counsel with Congresss nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation.The funds decision to mark their trading positions at their market price (instead of their initial purchase price) would enable any gains to qualify for pass-through treatment at the newly reduced rate of 25 percent instead of being treated as short-term capital gains, at a top rate that nears 40 percent.The pass-through changes present other tax dodges.Benefits for pass-throughs that provide services like doctors, lawyers and accountants are supposed to be phased out for individuals with incomes above $75,000 and for married couples with income above $150,000.But a firm could skirt that limit by creating multiple partnerships with different functions, with one providing services, and the other handling, say, licensing or leasing, said Dan Shaviro, a professor of taxation at New York University Law School who helped write the 1986 tax overhaul.Photo There is not a single advantage this has, except for students of people like me, who will get paid more to figure out how to game the system, he said.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Individual proposals that might make sense on their own can also set off unintended consequences when paired together.Although the Senates plan to wait until 2019 to cut the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent has infuriated some shareholders, it saves money so that Congress can reach its budget goals.Some tax experts go further and argue that any cut should be phased in over a 10-year period to smooth out investment and reduce windfall gains.Yet enacting a 20 percent corporate tax rate to take effect one year in advance while allowing investors to immediately deduct their expenses at 35 percent operates like a subsidy, and could encourage investing in money-losing projects simply for a tax gain.That could lead to silly stuff where you have a loss before the tax, but a gain after the tax, Mr. Shaviro said.(He offered an example for the mathematically inclined.Normally no one would invest $100 to earn only $90 back.But under the Senate plan, where some business expenses could be immediately deducted at a 35 percent rate, you would get $35 back in 2018.So your actual cost is $65.By the time your $90 earnings are paid in 2019, though, the tax rate would be 20 percent.That would cost you $18 in taxes, and leave $72 in your wallet.So even though your investment lost $10, you are still coming out ahead: with $72 on a net investment of $65.)Other experts pointed to constantly shifting cost estimates of proposals that suddenly gained or lost tens of billions of dollars overnight.At the end of 10 years, the very safeguards that are supposed to prevent international tax avoidance actually lose money, according to the Joint Committees revenue estimates of the House bill, said Kimberly Clausing, an economist at Reed College.This is a big giveaway in future years, she said.On net, the whole system is ineffective.The shortcomings are fixable to some degree, critics say, but the Republican strategy of pushing through a bill without Democratic votes before the end of the year on tax rules that take effect a few weeks later will not leave sufficient time.To some supporters, though, thats the price of success.Will they find things that need to be fixed afterward because the process was moving so fast?Yes, said Rachelle Bernstein, vice president and tax counsel at the National Retail Federation, which represents big chains like Macys and Saks Fifth Avenue.But there are always technical corrections to tax bills after they pass, Ms. Bernstein said, and retailers have been waiting so long for a corporate rate cut that they dont mind if it finally happens with an imperfect bill.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Its part of how the sausage is made, but its better to make this sausage than cut it off, Ms. Bernstein said.
Disney Ban Elevated Tension at Los Angeles Times Newsroom:::::On the surface, Mr. DVorkins social media directive worked: Disneys aggressive move stirred a backlash among critics organizations and other news outlets, and last Tuesday the company reversed its decision after what it described in a statement as productive discussions with the newly installed leadership at the paper.The statement, though, heightened the skepticism of some employees, who questioned whether the social media edict was part of a deal Mr. DVorkin had struck with Disney.In a telephone interview on Friday, Mr. DVorkin, 65, said he had had a nice conversation with Disney, adding that there was no deal.I listened to their point of view, they listened to what I felt was our point of view, and we agreed to move forward and report and work with each other as the two companies have done for decades, Mr. DVorkin said.The warnings about social media were intended to remind the staff to stay away from opinion and stay away from drama, he said.Times employees have long expressed frustration with management, having endured years of newsroom turmoil, a wider downturn in the newspaper industry and a corporate parent that has cut resources.In August, the previous top editors were ousted after an internal investigation prompted in part by complaints about their handling of an investigative story on a former dean at the University of Southern Californias medical school.Many staff members were cautiously optimistic that the new leaders brought in by the parent company, Tronc, would return the newspaper to financial strength and encourage the kind of journalistic excellence that has been rewarded with 44 Pulitzer Prizes.But in interviews, numerous employees at The Times described a newsroom still on edge.(The employees spoke on the condition of anonymity, citing fear of reprisal from the company.)Photo Ross Levinsohn, the new publisher of The Times, said he hoped the staff would stop dwelling on the past.Theres been so much energy devoted to tearing down this place from within these walls that I think over the years weve missed opportunities to grow this place, Mr. Levinsohn, 54, said.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. DVorkin, who joined the newspaper as editor in chief on Nov. 1, said he valued investigative journalism, saying he grew up with media royalty, including Katharine Graham, the famed publisher of The Washington Post, and Norman Pearlstine, a former top editor at Time Inc. and The Wall Street Journal.I learned at the feet of all these people, he said, and Im hoping that I can bring those things that I learned and make a difference here.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.A media veteran who has worked at Forbes, The Wall Street Journal, Newsweek and The New York Times, Mr. DVorkin was handpicked by Mr. Levinsohn.He has a somewhat unusual background for someone in his position.Before he joined The Los Angeles Times, Mr. DVorkin helped start the celebrity news site TMZ, and as the chief products officer at Forbes, he broadened the companys native advertising offerings.The editor and publisher had worked together previously: Mr. Levinsohn was a partner at a venture capital firm, Fuse Capital, that invested in a journalism company Mr. DVorkin started in the late 2000s called True/Slant.Times journalists remain proud of their work.In addition to the Disney series, published in September, they pointed to recent articles about sexual harassment accusations against the Hollywood figures James Toback and Brett Ratner.(The articles were reported before Mr. DVorkins arrival.)Tronc, which also publishes The Chicago Tribune and The Baltimore Sun, is optimistic that its Los Angeles property will one day draw a national and even an international audience.For now, it remains a regional newspaper with a declining readership and revenue.Print advertising revenue at The Times through early September was down 20 percent from last year, according to a person briefed on the companys financials, and digital advertising revenue had fallen by roughly 5 percent in the same period.What was once a staff of more than 1,000 now numbers roughly 400.Against this backdrop, unionization efforts at The Times have gained traction.Last week, some reporters plastered their cubicles with signs saying they supported the NewsGuild-Communications Workers of America labor union.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Levinsohn, the publisher, said, If the newsroom decides to unionize, thats their call.For now, he added, the leadership team is focused on building a new strategy and conveying that vision to employees.During an all-staff meeting on Wednesday, Mr. DVorkin laid out his priorities, saying he wanted to focus on digital transformation, diversity in the newsroom and great journalism, according to a recording of the meeting obtained by The New York Times.The meeting grew contentious as employees peppered him with questions concerning the social media policy.Some asked why The Times had published only a few paragraphs on what had occurred between the newspaper and Disney, given the national attention it had drawn.Mr. DVorkin replied that those few paragraphs were all that was required to tell the story.He also told the staff that he had made no concessions to Disney and dismissed suggestions that he should announce that to the public.As the meeting drew to a close, Mr. DVorkin added, Somehow, we are going to figure this out so we can move forward.
G.E. Rolls Back the Breadth of Its Ambitions:::::That complexity was long a part of the companys pitch to investors.Past executives like Jack Welch argued that they could efficiently manage businesses that had little in common, like television, with NBC, and financial services.Other companies followed that thinking as well, leading to a wave of deal-making.The streamlining began under Jeffrey R. Immelt, who led G.E.for 16 years after Mr. Welch retired in 2001.Mr. Immelts goal for G.E.was to create an industrial company for the internet age, adding software and sensors to industrial equipment to make smart machines.It was a bold plan, and Mr. Immelt once predicted that G.E.would become a Top 10 software company by 2020.No more.While the digital strategy is still vital to G.E., Mr. Flannery said he was cutting that units spending by $400 million in 2018, and focusing on a few products.Even the G.E.board of directors is being reduced, to 12 members from 18.Three of the dozen will be new directors.Mr. Flannery sought to portray the path ahead not as a retreat but as an inspiring challenge.This is the opportunity of a lifetime to reinvent an iconic company, he said.Still, the hoped-for reinvention, even if successful, is going to take time.G.E.lowered its earnings target for next year and reiterated that 2018 would be a reset year.And the outlook for 2019, while improving, is expected to be challenging as well for its big power-turbine business, which fell off sharply this year.It will also change the complexion of the company.G.E., the countrys largest manufacturing company, had nearly 300,000 employees worldwide at the end of last year.The impending sales of several businesses and other cost-cutting initiatives will undoubtedly leave it with far fewer in the coming years, in more focused areas.Advertisement Continue reading the main story John Flannery is generally saying and doing the right things, said Scott Davis, chief executive of Melius Research, an independent financial analysis firm.But I was looking for more faster and more aggressive moves, both on cost-cutting and thinning the portfolio of businesses.Concerns about the pace of change and the dividend cut sent G.E.shares, which had already dropped by 35 percent this year through Friday, down more than 7 percent on Monday.Mr. Flannery had previously given broad outlines of his strategy, including that the company would shed at least $20 billion in assets over the next two years.What came on Monday were details that confirmed a shortlist of businesses that are up for sale, like lighting, which has quietly been on sale for months.He also emphasized his belief in the vitality of a smaller G.E., and nodded to products like electric generators, jet engines and medical-imaging equipment.Because of those products, Mr. Flannery said, the company will continue to power the world, transport people safely and save lives.He also described other parts of the businesses as fundamentally strong, including wind turbines for renewable energy, and the companys railroad-equipment unit, which is expected to be sold off.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Mr. Flannerys strategy will accelerate the streamlining job begun by his immediate predecessor.Mr. Immelt described the company he inherited as a classic conglomerate.During his tenure, G.E.sold off its media business, NBC Universal, to Comcast and its consumer appliance business, among others.But the biggest move was to shed nearly all of the companys finance arm, GE Capital.At its peak, the finance unit accounted for more than half of the companys profits, and its lending ranged from home mortgages in Japan to reinsurance for long-term care for the aged.Mr. Flannery has attacked expenses, and he spoke repeatedly on Monday about injecting more rigor and accountability into the G.E.culture.Mr. Immelt departed earlier than expected as chief executive after Trian Fund Management, an activist hedge fund, persistently pressured G.E.to improve its financial performance.Edward Garden of Trian joined the G.E.board last month.To link management behavior more tightly to financial performance, Mr. Flannery is changing the compensation program for G.E.s top 5,000 managers.The current plan, he explained, is about 70 percent in cash and the remainder in stock.The new plan, he added, will flip that ratio, with 70 percent of compensation in stock.Advertisement Continue reading the main story His own pay package, Mr. Flannery said, will be 100 percent in stock, with the amount of shares determined by the performance of the company.Since becoming chief executive, Mr. Flannery has grounded the corporate jet fleet, stretched out the construction schedule for G.E.s new headquarters in Boston, closed down several international research-and-development labs and trimmed the work force in units like GE Digital.GE Digital, Mr. Flannery said, continues to be vital to the company.But its spending will be trimmed sharply as it concentrates on a narrower set of products that improve the efficiency and performance of G.E.s industrial equipment.G.E.last cut its dividend in 2009 in the throes of the financial crisis, when it was the nations largest non-bank financial institution.The move announced on Monday reflects the companys declining cash flow, but it is also a byproduct of the streamlining strategy.In the future, there will be fewer businesses to put cash in the corporate till.The total dividend payout had been $8.4 billion a year, among the most costly for American corporations.But the cash flow to cover that bill has faltered.When G.E.reported its third-quarter earnings last month, it said cash flow for the year would be about $7 billion, down from an initial target of $12 billion to $14 billion.The 12-cent quarterly dividend will consume only $4.2 billion.Mr. Flannery acknowledged the gravity of this decision, especially for individual shareholders who rely on dividend income.But it is necessary, he said, to restore the oxygen of cash to the company.
Kalashnikov, AK-47 Maker, Goes Private as Russian Government Sheds Stake:::::In this way, Kalashnikov Kontsern had typified a broader strategy in Russias defense industry under President Vladimir V. Putin.A state holding company created early in Mr. Putins tenure, Rostec, has been trying to improve corporate governance at defense factories and, where possible, to diversify product lines, with an eye toward selling shares to private investors.Rostec sold just under 50 percent of Kalashnikov in 2013, in a partial privatization.That sale left Rostec with a majority stake in Kalashnikov, while Mr. Krivoruchko held around a quarter of the company, and two other investors, Andrei Bokarev and Iskander Makhmudov, held the remainder.Two sales one announced on Friday, the other on Monday will reshuffle the companys ownership and put a majority share into private hands.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Rostec has received government approval to sell a 26 percent stake in Kalashnikov, Sergei V. Chemezov, the holding companys director, said on Monday in Dubai, where he was attending an air show.Rostec first floated the idea of the privatization in February, but it had not received an endorsement from the government until now.At the time, Kalashnikov said in a press release that Mr. Krivoruchko, a Russian industrialist, would be a buyer.Mr. Krivoruchkos other investments include shares in suburban commuter trains in Moscow.We have just finalized the decision to sell a stake of 26 percent minus one share, Mr. Chemezov said, in comments carried by Zvezda, a Russian military news site.His comments did not specify the buyer.Mr. Bokarev and Mr. Makhmudov announced on Friday that they would sell their stakes to Mr. Krivoruchko, the Kommersant newspaper reported on Friday.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Together, the two sales will give Mr. Krivoruchko control of Kalashnikov, with about a 75 percent stake in the company.Rostec executives say Kalashnikov is profitable and ready for privatization.Last year, the gun maker reported sales of 18.3 billion rubles, or $308 million at current exchange rates, and profit of 3 billion rubles, or $51 million.Until the crisis in Ukraine prompted the imposition of American sanctions, Kalashnikov had done a brisk business selling civilian rifles in the United States under the Baikal and Saiga brands.The United States is the worlds largest civilian firearms market, and Kalashnikov was selling more rifles to the countrys civilian market than to the Russian military before the sanctions were imposed.The company has since tried to sell guns elsewhere to compensate for the lost business.Last month, Kalashnikov signed a licensing agreement to produce one variant of the rifle, the AK-103, in Saudi Arabia.It has also encouraged wider civilian gun ownership in Russia.After the American sanctions took effect, the company created a new logo, a line of branded clothing and advertising targeting Russian buyers.
Radhika Jones, Vanity Fair’s Surprise Choice, Is Ready to Go:::::Whip-smart and unassuming, with meticulous handwriting and an erstwhile fondness for Tetris, Ms. Jones seems suited to a new era of transformation but also of restraint at Vanity Fair and Cond Nast.In Radhika, we are so proud to have a fearless and brilliant editor whose intelligence and curiosity will define the future of Vanity Fair in the years to come, Anna Wintour, the editor in chief of Vogue and Cond Nasts artistic director, said in a statement.A compendium of culture high and low, politics and distinctive visuals, Vanity Fair was resuscitated in 1983, after a 47-year absence, to add some swank and intelligence to the Cond Nast stable in the days before the company had purchased The New Yorker.Its pages have featured the combative essays of Christopher Hitchens, the dishy features of Dominick Dunne and the high-production portraits of Annie Leibovitz but the magazine has also remained a holdout as its publisher looks to become leaner and less tied to its print titles.Mr. Carter has said he mulled leaving the magazine earlier this year but for the election of a longtime foil, Donald J. Trump.(The magazine saw a spike in subscriptions after Mr. Trump tweeted last year that the magazine was Way down, big trouble, dead!)He had balked at Cond Nasts belt-tightening and resisted efforts inside the company to consolidate its design, research, photo and copy teams.It was not a good time at Cond Nast, or anywhere else in the cash-strapped magazine industry, to scoff at cost-cutting.The company expects to bring in $100 million less in revenue this year than it did in 2016, and it is in the middle of laying off 80 employees.This month, it said it was reducing the print frequency of titles like GQ, Glamour and Architectural Digest and shuttering the print edition of Teen Vogue.To follow Mr. Carters long run, executives sought an editor who could carry on Vanity Fairs journalistic traditions and travel seamlessly between the spheres of Hollywood, Washington and New York.At the same time, the new editor would be charged with taking the title beyond its printed form and with fewer resources according to an executive briefed on the selection process.Guessing Mr. Carters replacement became a parlor game at media industry parties.Among the names that surfaced were Adam Moss, the editor of New York magazine; Janice Min, who revitalized Us Weekly and The Hollywood Reporter; and Andrew Ross Sorkin, a columnist at The New York Times and a host of CNBCs Squawk Box.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The decision was ultimately up to Robert Sauerberg, the chief executive of Cond Nast, who oversaw the search along with Ms. Wintour.David Remnick, the editor of The New Yorker, was also heavily involved.Photo It was Mr. Remnick who brought in and championed Ms. Jones, the executive said, and she eventually won over the others.We didnt need a name for the sake of a name or a celebrity, Steven O. Newhouse, a nephew of the late Samuel I. Newhouse and a top executive at Cond Nasts parent company, Advance Publications, said in an interview.We really wanted someone who could do the job and be a worthy successor to Graydon, and I think we found someone.She has vision and energy and a very active mind, Mr. Newhouse added, and I think thats what Vanity Fair needs.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Ms. Jones was the only candidate Mr. Newhouse met.A product of Ridgefield, Conn., by way of New York and Cincinnati, Ms. Jones graduated from Harvard College and received a doctoral degree in English and comparative literature from Columbia University.She has lived in Taipei and Moscow, where she got her start in journalism as the arts editor at The Moscow Times, an English-language newspaper.(Her Russian, she said, is rusty.)Many editors in her position would proclaim their love of magazines, particularly the one they are about to sit atop, but Ms. Jones was characteristically candid.Its hard for me to exactly figure out when I became obsessed with magazines, she said.Did she read Vanity Fair growing up?On and off, she said.She declined to describe her plans for Vanity Fair.I need to get oriented first theres a lot to take in, she said.She also demurred when asked about any writers she was considering.Im just really interested in discovery, she said.Ms. Jones, who joined The Times last November, is not the first person to make the move from Times books coverage to the top editorial position at Vanity Fair.In 1981, as Cond Nast announced its plan to revive the Jazz Age title, it appointed Richard Locke, an editor at The New York Times Book Review, to run it.We take risks, Alexander Liberman, then Cond Nasts editorial director, said when asked about the selection.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Locke was replaced by a Cond Nast veteran, Leo Lerman, four issues into his run.Those who know Ms. Jones believe she will thrive, citing her academic background as well as the breadth of her interests.Before she joined The Times, she was a deputy managing editor at Time magazine, where she transformed the Time 100 franchise into an eclectic mix of celebrities and unheralded visionaries.After the issues corresponding annual gala, she would host an all-night karaoke party at a Midtown dive.At The Paris Review, the literary quarterly able to make a young writers career, she served as managing editor.She once referred to herself as a formerly shy person, as someone who had to learn how to speak out, said Nancy Gibbs, who recently stepped down as the top editor at Time.She doesnt come on incredibly strong.She doesnt overpower you with her ideas shes a different kind of presence.In his quarter century at Vanity Fair, Mr. Carter parlayed its editorship into elite social status.A party host, producer of documentary films and Broadway shows, political commentator and restaurateur, he became part of the celebrity fabric.On his watch, Vanity Fairs annual post-Oscar party became one of the years most glittery, star-studded affairs.It is perhaps inevitable that Ms. Jones will invite comparisons with Mr. Carter, just as he had to live up to the expectations of readers who had grown to love the version of Vanity Fair created by his predecessor, Tina Brown.Some in the media world are already scrutinizing her experience for signs she will not measure up, particularly when it comes to Mr. Carters ability to navigate Hollywood.Her supporters reject any notion she will not succeed on every level.And in case anyone was wondering, yes, she will preside over the 2018 Oscar party.The reality is, she has incredible credentials to direct a magazine thats so focused on culture, Mr. Newhouse said.I think that shes fully capable of all the elements of Vanity Fair, he added.Obviously, you dont start out as Graydon didnt start out the way that Graydon ended up.
Self-Driving Trucks May Be Closer Than They Appear:::::Drivers Training Trucks One afternoon in Florida, a 59-year-old career truck driver named Jeff Runions sat alertly in the cab of an 18-wheeler watching the road while his 11-ton cargo of stone tile made its way up the Ronald Reagan Turnpike.He was watching his steering wheel, too, but his hands were at his side: A computer was in control.Mr. Runions works for Starsky Robotics, a San Francisco start-up that for the past two years has been testing its self-driving technology by running freight up and down Florida.The runs help collect data and hone the technology, in hopes of convincing regulators and the company itself that self-driving trucks are ready for business.There are still plenty of kinks.Sitting next to Mr. Runions was an Irish engineer named Rebecca Feeney Barry.As the vehicle spent hours driving past swamps and billboards for accident lawyers, Ms. Feeney Barry balanced a laptop on her knees and watched how the trucks sensors interpreted the road and nearby cars.At one point the computers vision briefly lost sight of the freeway because an overpass shaded the road.Later, the truck didnt take a turn hard enough, prompting Mr. Runions to grab the wheel.Ms. Feeney Barry logged all of it.Later, after some computer code had been altered to tell the truck to tug the wheel a bit harder, it made a similar turn more smoothly.Sometimes it kind of messes me up when I go back to driving because now Im used to the truck driving, Mr. Runions said.Starskys ultimate plan, of course, is to eliminate Mr. Runionss job.But they do not want him to be out of one.Stefan Seltz-Axmacher, Starskys 27-year-old chief executive, foresees using self-driving technology to replace long-haul drivers on freeways, but having people like Mr. Runions navigate at either end of the trip with remote control consoles that look like an arcade racing game.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Drivers would go off to work in offices and might spend their day driving trucks through the last few miles of several different routes in several different cities before heading home for dinner.One driver can drive 10 to 30 trucks per day, Mr. Seltz-Axmacher said.The March of Automation Starskys vision of a remote operation is unique.But the basic idea having trucks drive themselves on highways and letting human drivers take over in complicated city environments is something of an industry consensus.Advertisement Continue reading the main story One of the big misconceptions about self-driving technology is that it is going to emerge and be able to drive all the time in all circumstances, said Alden Woodrow, the product manager for Ubers self-driving truck unit.As part of their partnership, Embark, Ryder and Electrolux are conducting what amounts to elaborate dry runs to imagine what self-driving-truck routes will look like.The runs start with human drivers leaving an Electrolux warehouse in El Paso and driving to the edge of the city, where they hitch the trailer to one of Embarks autonomous trucks.From there the truck drives itself for 650 highway miles (with a safety driver in tow) to Ontario, Calif., where the Embark drivers transfer their trailer to another Ryder driver, who drives the final few miles to one of Electroluxs California warehouses.Its a mirror of what we would do if there werent a driver inside, said Mr. Rodrigues, the Embark chief.A few miles from Googles headquarters in Mountain View, Calif., a company called Peloton Technology is betting that there is a business to be built in a less radical version of automation.Peloton is on the cusp of rolling out a system that will make it easier and safer for trucks to travel one after the other on the highway, in a formation called platooning, helping them save gas by reducing wind drag.Trucks with drivers already do this.But Pelotons technology aims to make platooning safer with a mix of cameras, sensors and networking equipment, allowing the trucks to talk to each other and helping to prevent the second driver from ramming into the first truck after a sudden stop.Josh Switkes, the companys chief executive, said that because Pelotons technology helps drivers get better at doing something they are familiar with, he thinks it can be quickly commercialized.Our basic approach is lets bring real value to the fleet and society now, Mr. Switkes said.
A Rightward Tilt and Big Ratings at Fox News:::::President Trump, the catalyst for this disruption, is a bit of a wild card, perhaps explaining Mr. Hannitys equivocation: Mr. Trump endorsed Mr. Moores primary opponent, Luther Strange, but then cheered Mr. Moores victory and erased his pro-Strange Twitter posts.On Saturday, the president said of Mr. Moore: Id have to look at it and Id have to see.In the past, conservative lodestars like Fox Newss prime time hosts and the editorial page of The Wall Street Journal would most likely be in lock step with Republican Party leadership in denouncing a candidate with such serious allegations against him.On Friday, The Journals editorial board stopped short of asking Mr. Moore to withdraw, while calling the charges against him disqualifying, if unprovable at this remove.At Fox News, the hosts were more sanguine.On the Friday edition of Tucker Carlson Tonight, the 8 p.m. show on Fox News, the host referred to The Post as a paper I never read before making his main point about the allegations against Mr. Moore.Some of it sounds true to me actually, Mr. Carlson said.The problem is that I, and I think a lot of other people, so distrust the media that even when maybe what theyre reporting is correct, its hard to know, exactly.Laura Ingraham, who was recently given the networks 10 p.m. slot, said with a smirk that establishment media figures are salivating over the scandal, before ticking off liberals like Louis C. K. and Harvey Weinstein who have also been accused of sexual misconduct.To Democrats, she warned, I dont think you want to go there.Ive got two words for you: Bill Clinton.Photo It seems there has been a shift at Fox News since 2015, when its anchors like Bret Baier and Megyn Kelly subjected Mr. Trump to tough questions about his statements and conduct.Bill OReilly, who was then the channels 8 p.m. host, was also occasionally skeptical of the upstart candidate.And when Mr. Trump attacked Ms. Kelly in sexist terms suggesting her tough questions to him were a result of blood coming out of her wherever the channels then-chairman, Roger Ailes, denounced Mr. Trumps comments as unacceptable and disturbing.Two years later, the prime-time Fox News lineup is a Trump safe space, with a dose of Bannonist populism once considered on the fringe.Days before her debut on Oct. 30, Ms. Ingraham, who also spoke at the convention when Mr. Trump received the Republican nomination, stood beside Mr. Bannon at political rally in Arizona as the Breitbart head warned of a coming war against elites.Advertisement Continue reading the main story How is this playing with viewers?Superbly.After falling behind MSNBC on weeknights among the sought-after 25-to-54 demographic, Fox News has surged back.And Ms. Ingraham pulled 2.7 million total viewers her first week, nearly half a million more than her competition on MSNBC, Lawrence ODonnell.Mr. Hannity beat Rachel Maddow on MSNBC last week by about 300,000 viewers.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Ben Shapiro, a conservative writer and former editor at large at Breitbart, noted that Fox News was forced to remake its prime time after Ms. Kelly defected to NBC News and Mr. OReilly was fired amid a sexual harassment scandal.Some of this is happenstance, and some of this is that Trump enjoys a 80 percent approval rating among Republicans, Mr. Shapiro said.So if youre a conservative news outlet, what are you going to do get somebody thats anti-Trump?Still, David Frum, a conservative writer and a former speechwriter for George W. Bush, said that the old reflexes of right-wing media were being tested by increasingly outlandish scenarios, like the allegations against Mr. Moore.What youre seeing in conservative media are standard templates, into which is being plugged ever more extreme content, said Mr. Frum, who is a vocal critic of Mr. Trump.Rush Limbaughs defense of Roy Moore is exactly the same defense hes given every Republican sex scandal since he went on the air.(Mr. Limbaugh, on his radio show, suggested that Democrats in sex scandals like Mr. Clinton were treated better than Mr.Moore.)What you see there is just how out-of-date the reflexes are, Mr. Frum said.Breitbart remains more militant than older-school right-wing outlets: On Sunday, the site claimed it had discovered false reporting by The Post because of an apparent discrepancy over whether one of Mr. Moores accusers had a telephone in her childhood bedroom.The story appeared to be part of Mr. Bannons effort to prop up Mr. Moores candidacy.Still, some conservatives were stunned last month when The Journals editorial page known for its gray-flannel boardroom conservatism called for the resignation of Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel investigating Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.At least four editors and columnists who were seen as critics of Mr. Trump have left The Journal in recent months.Given Fox Newss ascendant ratings, it seems clear that hard-line views attract a big audience.Last week, though, in a speech that flew under the radar, Chris Wallace, the anchor of Fox News Sunday, startled some guests at a journalists gala by stating, flatly: President Trump is engaged in the most direct, sustained assault on a free press in our history.His words marked a departure from the media-bashing that is now a regular feature of the networks prime time lineup, buttressed by recent hires like Sebastian Gorka, the former White House aide and Breitbart editor.On Friday, Mr. Hannity ended his show by asking Mr. Gorka about Mr. Moore.His media appearances have to be judged in light of his background, that he isnt somebody whos lived in the swamp for 30 years, Mr. Gorka said.If anything inappropriate happened, it should be investigated.But again, its a presumption of innocence.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Presumption of innocence, dont rush to judgment, Mr. Hannity replied.The media has been so wrong, so often.Were just going to pursue the truth here.Thats our promise.More Hannity straight ahead.
Behind the Lucrative Assembly Line of Student Debt Lawsuits:::::The affiants are a critical link in the litigation chain, swearing in many cases that they had personal knowledge of the business records, according to court records.But Transworlds employees did not have personal knowledge, the consumer bureau said in its complaint against the debt collector.Other companies had created the records reviewed by Transworld employees.Those workers, the consumer bureau said, did not know how the data was maintained and whether it was correct.Even so, employees signed the forms for fear of losing their jobs, according to the bureaus complaint.The hasty review process obscured defects.More than 800 cases involved apparent time travel: In those instances, Transworld employees swore that borrowers loans had been purchased by investors on dates that were months or even years before the loans were actually made.Transworld, based in Fort Washington, Pa., said it disagreed with many of the consumer bureaus accusations.The company agreed to settle the case, it said in a statement, to avoid the cost and distraction of litigation.The companys review process accords with all industry best practices and relevant law, David Zwick, Transworlds chief financial officer, said in a statement to The Times.Transworld processes thousands of affidavits, and while our error rate is exceptionally low, we believe that any mistake is unacceptable, Mr. Zwick said.We will continue to regularly review everything we do in order to ensure the highest standards of quality control.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Lisa Kyser, in Pataskala, Ohio, said she got tangled up in one of Transworlds mistakes.She took out half a dozen student loans as she juggled her college studies with full-time jobs, but she thought she had all of them under control.In June 2016, Ms. Kyser got a summons notifying her that she was being sued for falling behind on a $12,000 loan made in 2006.Two weeks later, she got a second summons also seeking payment to a different creditor, for a different amount on the same loan.I called the opposing counsel from both firms and said, You cant both be right, said Emily White, a lawyer in Columbus, Ohio, who represented Ms. Kyser.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.The cases lingered for five months, while Ms. Kyser racked up legal fees.In the end, after her lawyer continually pestered them, the law firms that sued Ms. Kyser both working for Transworld withdrew the cases.Courts Digging Deeper The stacks of legal documents Transworld prepared in that Georgia office park made their way to courts across the country.Many of the cases sailed through, unchallenged.Borrowers often do not fight collection lawsuits, which allows the creditor to win by default.Even when defendants did respond, some judges brushed off their objections.In Miami, a law firm working for Transworld brought a lawsuit last year against Antonio Fuentes, seeking payment on a $13,356 student loan.With interest and fees, Mr. Fuentes now owed $25,322.31, according to the complaint.Mr. Fuentes, representing himself, admitted that he had taken the loan but disputed the amount he was said to owe.A Transworld employee swore in an affidavit that the tally was correct.The judge sided with Transworld and ordered Mr. Fuentes to pay the full amount.The courts are often not sympathetic to these cases, said N. James Turner, a lawyer in Orlando, Fla., who represents borrowers.Many judges take the attitude: I paid my student loans.You ought to pay yours.Dont give me this nonsense about technicalities.Advertisement Continue reading the main story But some judges are starting to raise questions about collection cases.Last year, a California appeals court cast doubt on the companys affidavits.Employees of Transword, then known as NCO Financial Systems, were not personally familiar with the records they swore were accurate, the judges wrote, and therefore could not vouch for them in court.The case was tossed out.Its not just debt collectors facing judicial skepticism, but also the creditors themselves.A New York judge questioned whether Navient, the nations largest owner of private student loan debt, had a right to collect on some loans at all in the state.
Foiling Cyberspies on Business Trips:::::Advertisement Foiling Cyberspies on Business Trips Image Credit Michael Waraksa The admonitions to business travelers headed to other countries should be familiar by now: Keep your laptop with you at all times.Stay off public Wi-Fi networks.Dont send unencrypted files over the internet.But not all travelers are heeding them, and many are unaware of the foreign hackers and state-sponsored spies who are taking advantage of their lax security practices.Theres a difficult intersection between convenience and security, said Samantha Ravich, who studies cyber-enabled economic warfare at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies , a policy institute focusing on national security.It takes more time to work abroad in the most secure way, and she said she would often see executives hanging their head somewhat sheepishly when I ask who in the room follows all the security protocols.The theft of technical product specifications, investment plans, research on mergers and acquisitions, marketing plans and other information can have consequences beyond loss of revenue and market position, Ms. Ravich told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee this year.She described potential large-scale effects of state-sponsored economic warfare, which, she said, could disrupt the delivery of items crucial for manufacturing, malware incidents that could disrupt travel and cyberattacks that could force companies to shut down their websites.The problem of intellectual property theft is not new, but it is now much more widespread.Placing listening devices in conference rooms, hotels and restaurants is traditional Espionage 101, Ms. Ravich said.But with tools like tiny inexpensive cameras and microphones or compromised Wi-Fi networks, corporate or state-sponsored industrial espionage can be done cheaply and at scale, she said.Multiple microphones in a conference center, for instance, can be recording constantly, and those recordings can be fed into natural language processing software trained to flag certain words and report those conversations.Its not just a guy with headphones listening in the next room anymore, Ms. Ravich said.Communicating over the internet while overseas can be especially fraught, said Nicole Miller, an independent consultant in San Francisco who helps companies communicate with employees and customers on cybersecurity issues.Assume any data, any information you transmit can be taken by a hacker, nation-state or another business, she said.These are not pedestrian tools they are using.They are extremely sophisticated.Physical security of phones, tablets and laptops is as important as cyberprotection, Ms. Miller said.Dont leave your laptop or papers in your hotel room when you go out, she said.A hotel room safe should not even be considered secure.Ms. Miller said she advised travelers to create complex passwords for their devices and all of their online accounts, to use two-factor authentication whenever possible and to avoid plugging other peoples USB drives or other external hardware into their computers.Laptops should also be wiped clean of any data and software at the end of the trip, she said.Your device could have been altered, your data could have been altered, without your realizing it, Ms. Miller said.Sometimes circumstances beyond travelers control expose their information, as when customs officers in another country seize a persons device and copy its contents, she said.Thats why any information not absolutely required for a trip should remain at the office, Ms. Miller said.And dont tell your colleague about your great meeting while you are in the back of a taxi or in a restaurant , she said, because you never know who is listening.Some businesspeople at a foreign conference go so far as to wear buttons telling people not to speak out loud about their intellectual property.Stanford University and Microsoft are among educational institutions and companies that supply comprehensive precaution and instruction lists to their employees who travel abroad.Maureen Sharma travels regularly to Asia as part of her work for Mullally International, a small product development company in Seattle.Some unsettling incidents, she said, have made her more cautious when she travels abroad.I often get more spam and strange emails that look like they are from me with attachments, when returning from her business trips.Once, Ms. Sharma said, she received an email that looked as if it were from a Chinese factory she was working with, asking her to send the next payment to a new bank account.Luckily, I called to confirm, because the factory had not sent that email, she said.Ms. Sharma said she makes sure never to bring sensitive information on her laptop and changes all her passwords every time she returns home from any trip abroad.The same risks may apply to businesspeople staying in hotels in the United States.When the Chinese company Anbang purchased the Waldorf Astoria in New York, President Barack Obama stopped having meetings there over cybersecurity concerns.Business, military and government information is being targeted for industrial espionage, said Evan Anderson, chief executive of Invnt/IP, a group dedicated to combating nation-sponsored intellectual property theft, who writes about intellectual property security for the Strategic News Service website.So shouldnt we take the same precautions at home as we would abroad?Mr. Anderson said he created a map of Chinese-owned hotels around the world in 2016 and was surprised by how many they were, including some in Silicon Valley where technology companies hold meetings.Most people dont realize that an individual Four Seasons hotel, Ritz-Carlton, or many other brands can be owned by a Chinese company with close ties to the Chinese government, he said.Of course, listening, spying and hacking can happen no matter who owns a hotel or where a meeting is.The internet has no borders, Ms. Miller said.You could be hacked in another country or the U.S., and you have no idea where that person is.Ms. Ravich agreed.There is a glaring disconnect between how critical this is, and how seriously people take it, she said.One reason is that the theft of information, data or plans may go unnoticed, unlike the theft of a physical laptop.It is also hard to connect a cyberattack on a company to a specific trip taken by a specific employee.Companies need to place better controls on the hardware they issue, like laptops and cellphones, Ms. Ravich said, so the devices automatically send only encrypted data, require strong passwords and use cellular connections rather than the local Wi-Fi.To really improve or harden cybersecurity for business travelers, she said, companies need to take human behavior out of the equation.The All-New DealBook Our columnist Andrew Ross Sorkin and his Times colleagues help you make sense of major business and

Lyft to Begin Operations in Toronto, Its First Market Outside the U.S.:::::Lyft has high hopes for the Toronto market.John Zimmer, the companys president and co-founder, told The Toronto Star that he expected the Canadian city to eventually become one of Lyfts five largest markets.To entice drivers, Lyft is offering a 25 percent bonus for the first 3,000 drivers who are approved and who complete 20 rides a week during the companys first three months of operation in Toronto.In addition to Toronto, Lyft plans to operate in the citys suburbs and in nearby Hamilton, Ontario.The company faces a variety of regulations as it prepares to do business in the area, which has a population of more than seven million people.Mississauga, the largest of Torontos suburbs and home to the areas international airport, has let Uber operate only on a trial basis since March and plans to review its rules in 2019.Uber, which began operating in Toronto five years ago, has encountered resistance in Canada.Taxi drivers have protested against the company for not following the same rules as the taxi industry.At one point, Toronto officials sought to ban Uber, but Ontarios Superior Court refused that request in 2015.Uber has upended the taxi industry in Toronto since its arrival and has achieved a great deal of popularity and commercial success, but it nevertheless remains controversial and contentious, said Shauna Brail, the director of the urban studies program at the University of Torontos Munk School of Global Affairs.Professor Brail said it was unclear what impact Lyfts entry into the local market would have.But she noted that the city was growing in importance as a center for research into artificial intelligence, an important technology in the self-driving cars that Lyft and others are working to develop.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Uber opened a research center in Toronto this year, and Google has established a branch of its A.I.research center in the city.General Motors announced last year that it would add 700 software engineers to offices in the Toronto area whose work would include developing autonomous cars.Lyft made its announcement just hours after Uber completed a deal to sell a stake to the Japanese conglomerate SoftBank, a move that paves the way for sweeping governance changes at the ride-hailing behemoth, as well as for that companys own initial public offering.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Uber has been trying to repair its image, with Dara Khosrowshahi, the new chief executive, pushing a softer tone and a set of cultural values that includes the maxim, We do the right thing.Period.The company suffered a setback in London last week when a British employment tribunal rejected its argument that the companys drivers were self-employed.The ruling, upholding an earlier court judgment, threatens Ubers hiring model in Britain.In September, Londons transport regulator revoked Ubers license to operate in the British capital, its biggest market outside the United States, saying the company was not fit and proper to operate there.Uber is appealing the ruling, and can continue to operate in London until the appeals process is completed.Lyft, by contrast, has so far limited its expansion to the United States.The company has, however, had several meetings with London transport officials, according to documents published by Transport for London, the citys transportation authority.Lyft has given presentations about its business model and discussed the London mayors transport strategy, raising the prospect that it could seek to expand there as well.The company has tried to project a friendlier image to distinguish itself from Uber.Speaking to The Toronto Star, Mr. Zimmer said the company was focused on treating people well.Kristine Hubbard, the operations manager for Beck Taxi in Toronto, said her family-owned firm would make no effort to block Lyft.Bring it on I dont care, Ms. Hubbard said.Weve had to compete before, and well continue to compete.
Qualcomm Rebuffs Broadcom, and Missouri Subpoenas Google: DealBook Briefing:::::Heres more from Qualcomms executive chairman, Paul Jacobs: It is the boards unanimous belief that Broadcoms proposal significantly undervalues Qualcomm relative to the companys leadership position in mobile technology and our future growth prospects.The expected move means that Broadcom will have to convince shareholders of its target to change managements mind or run a proxy fight that replaces at least some of Qualcomms directors.The deadline to nominate directors is next month.From The Timess Tiffany Hsu: Broadcom could also try to assuage Qualcomms fears of government pushback by initiating the regulatory approval process for a potential deal.The company garnered praise from President Trump this month when it said it would move its corporate address to Delaware from Singapore.Shares in Qualcomm ended the day up 3 percent, at $66.49.Thats still below Broadcoms bid of $70 a share, suggesting that investors remain unsure of whether Broadcoms takeover efforts will succeed.Missouris attorney general subpoenas Google.Attorney General Josh Hawley of Missouri said he wanted to know if Google had violated state law on matters ranging from how it obtains user data to the possibility that it has manipulated search results to harm competitors.Heres what Mr. Hawley had to say in his offices announcement of an investigative subpoena examining Googles business practices: There is strong reason to believe that Google has not been acting with the best interest of Missourians in mind.My office will not stand by and let private consumer information be jeopardized by industry giants, especially to pad their profits.A Google spokesman, Patrick Lenihan, gave this statement: We have not yet received the subpoena, however, we have strong privacy protections in place for our users and continue to operate in a highly competitive and dynamic environment.Brookfield offers $14.8 billion for the rest of GGP.Get ready for a potential battle to control one of Americas biggest mall operators.Brookfield Property Partners, a real estate investment firm, confirmed on Monday that it had offered to buy the 34 percent of GGP that it doesnt already own.That would make Brookfield one of the biggest publicly traded real estate companies in the world, with nearly $100 billion worth of assets.GGP, formerly known as General Growth Properties, operates primarily upscale malls like Tysons Galleria in Virginia and Woodbridge Center in New Jersey.Along with other mall operators, it has

Uber Reaches Deal to Sell Stake to SoftBank:::::Photo SAN FRANCISCO Uber completed a deal on Sunday to sell a significant stake of itself to SoftBank, a Japanese conglomerate, paving the way for the ride-hailing company to make sweeping governance changes and to go public by 2019.Under the agreement, a consortium of investors led by SoftBank will buy at least 14 percent of Uber through a combination of new and existing stock, according to three people briefed on the process, who spoke on condition of anonymity because those details are confidential.SoftBank plans to buy about $1 billion of fresh stock at Ubers current valuation of about $68.5 billion, but the bulk of the deal will be purchasing existing Uber shares from investors.SoftBank is to buy the existing Uber shares in a process called a tender offer, which takes at least a month to complete.During that process, a price will be set for the existing Uber shares.If investors are reluctant to sell and SoftBank cannot hit its threshold of 14 percent ownership of Uber, SoftBank can walk away from the deal.Weve entered into an agreement with a consortium led by SoftBank and Dragoneer on a potential investment, Matt Kallman, an Uber spokesman, said.We believe this agreement is a strong vote of confidence in Ubers long-term potential.Upon closing, it will help fuel our investments in technology and our continued expansion at home and abroad, while strengthening our corporate governance.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The agreement follows an Oct. 3 Uber board meeting, in which directors voted to move forward with an investment from SoftBank.As part of the deal, Ubers board agreed to sweeping governance changes, including measures that reduce the influence that Travis Kalanick, Ubers former chief executive, has at the company.He still has a seat on the companys board.The SoftBank investment also sets up Uber to go public by 2019, another provision that was contingent on the deal.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Interested in All Things Tech?The Bits newsletter will keep you updated on the latest from Silicon Valley and the technology industry.Since that meeting, SoftBank, Uber and Ubers early investors have haggled over deal terms.Some of Ubers early investors, like the venture capital firm Benchmark, initially wanted to retain certain shareholder rights that they hold through their Uber stock, according to two of the people briefed on the discussions.Benchmark and others ultimately agreed to waive those rights in exchange for concessions from SoftBank over the tender offer process, the people said.
Trump’s Trade Policy Is Lifting Exports. Of Canadian Lobster.:::::When Americans think about lobster, Maine often comes to mind.But Nova Scotia has emerged as a fierce competitor in exporting lobsters, particularly to Europe.Last year, American lobstermen sold only slightly more to Europe than their Canadian counterparts.That balance could soon shift given the Canadian-European trade pact, which eliminated an 8 percent European tariff on live lobster when it went into effect in September.Tariffs on frozen and processed Canadian lobster will be phased out in the next three to five years as part of the agreement.The elimination of European tariffs is the single most challenging issue for the American lobster industry, said Annie Tselikis, the executive director of the Maine Lobster Dealers Association, which represents companies that buy lobster from Maine fishermen.This trade agreement does give Canada a huge leg up in the European marketplace, she said.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Ms. Tselikis said the pact was encouraging American companies to invest in new facilities in Canada to qualify for the lower European tariff.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.If the argument is youre not going to develop this trade policy because youre worried about outsourcing jobs well, here we are, potentially outsourcing jobs due to an absence of trade policy, she said.Gidney Fisheries, which exports live and frozen lobster, is poised to take advantage of the changing terms of trade.Last year, in anticipation of increased demand, the factory invested in state-of-the-art technology to set itself apart.The company imported a German machine, sometimes used to make cold-pressed juice, that creates pressure of up to 87,000 pounds per square inch.The machine compresses the lobster in its shell, breaking the connective tissue, killing the lobster in seconds and allowing the meat to be extracted entirely raw a selling point for chefs and consumers, as the process is considered relatively humane.Photo Photo On the factory floor in September, a worker in a gray smock covered by a shiny rubber apron loaded lobsters into a plastic tube to feed into the machine.A dozen workers smashed claws, used tiny air hoses to remove entrails and sorted peachy-pink lobster meat into various packages to be flash frozen.A decade or two ago, there would be very few players who would have been shipping internationally, Mr. MacDonald said.We now ship live lobsters all over the world.Once mostly confined to the plates of the rich, lobster has gone mass market.A glut in the global catch roughly five years ago the product of overfishing cod, a natural lobster predator caused the price to plummet.Lobster rolls and lobster mac and cheese suddenly appeared on menus of fast food chains like Pret a Manger, Au Bon Pain, Quiznos and even McDonalds locations in New England.Better packaging and faster freight services allowed American and Canadian exporters to expand into Europe and Asia.Exporters found a promising new market in China, where newly affluent diners were eagerly adopting Western luxury products like wine, caviar and lobster as a marker of taste and distinction.Gidney Fisheries sought to tap into that market, with the help of Duan Zeng, Mr. MacDonalds colleague.Ms. Zeng, who has a masters degree in fish biology, does much of her work on WeChat, a Chinese mobile app, where she sells its wares.Last December, the company teamed up with Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce company, to sell premium lobsters online.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Gidney Fisheries largest market by far is still the United States, where the company supplies restaurants and hotel chains with Nova Scotia lobsters.But given the changing dynamics of trade pacts, Europe could soon be its fastest-growing market, much to the chagrin of American lobstermen, who were hopeful the United States would sign its own agreement with the European Union.Photo The Trump administration has not said whether it will continue trade talks with Europe.But other trade pacts under discussion, including Nafta, have shown little progress.In mid-October, Jyrki Katainen, a high-ranking European Union official, said Europe was negotiating with all Nafta countries, and with all TPP countries, except one a not-so-veiled reference to America.John Weekes, Canadas Nafta negotiator in the 1990s, said he initially believed Canadian companies might have just a narrow window of advantage over their American competitors.Now, that window looks quite a bit larger.It does open up a number of opportunities for Canadians that clearly arent going to be available to Americans in the foreseeable future, Mr. Weekes said.
Men at Work Wonder if They Overstepped With Women, Too:::::In response, some men are forming all-male text groups at companies or in their industries to brainstorm on harassment issues.Some said they planned to be a lot more careful in interacting with women because they felt that the line between friendliness and sexual harassment was too easy to cross.Others are struggling to reconcile how these behaviors could happen even among men who believe in equal rights.Joel Milton, 30, an entrepreneur in Denver with Baker Technologies, a platform for cannabis dispensaries, said he had recently decided to be more careful about corporate offsites after seeing the swell of #MeToo claims.When I hear someone on my team is having a pool party, now Ill say, Hey, maybe no managers should be there, Mr. Milton said, relaying the type of information likely to be covered in many companies employment manuals.He added that harassment was not something he had thought much about before, but that he was considering his own behavior more.Like, did I ever do anything?he said.Many companies have long mandated anti-harassment training to educate men and women about the issue.But in a report last year, the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission found that much of that training was ineffective and that workplace harassment was widely underreported.Jonathan Segal, a lawyer who was on the commissions harassment task force, said he was now fielding odd questions from men about how to behave at work.At a fund-raiser last month in Palm Beach, Fla., some men asked him if it was permissible to hug a woman and where the boundaries should be drawn.Mr. Segal said he had explained to the men that the context mattered and that pretending there was a gray zone between collegial friendliness and sexual assault was absurd.For instance, he told them, hugging an old friend is very different from going up behind a co-worker while she was at a desk typing.Photo If someone cant understand that, then maybe they just shouldnt be hugging, he said.Mr. Segal, who runs anti-harassment training, is now expanding part of the program called Safe Mentoring, which teaches men how to mentor younger women without harassing them.At a recent session, a male supervisor talked about having an extra ticket to a sporting event and feeling he could invite only a male colleague; Mr. Segal went over how to invite a female colleague without sexually harassing her.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The answer to harassment cannot be avoiding women, he said.Still, some workers said they were starting to follow the Pence rule, which was formerly known as the Billy Graham rule, after the evangelical preacher, but is now named for Vice President Mike Pence.Mr. Pence has said he does not eat alone with women who are not his wife or attend an event without her if alcohol will be served.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.A conservative writer, Sean Davis, wrote that a lot of men in media should have effectively been heeding the Pence rule all along.He said he had always followed it and that coastal, liberal America was finally waking up to how useful avoiding private meetings with women could be.The former White House adviser Sebastian Gorka also made this argument.What were seeing now is men are backing away from the role that we try to encourage them to play, which is actively mentoring and sponsoring women in the workplace, said Al Harris, who has been running workplace equality programs and writing on the topic from Chicago with his partner, Andie Kramer, for many years.Theres apprehension on the part of men that theyre going to be falsely accused of sexual harassment.Not everyone is practicing avoidance.Some men said the best route is to ask female co-workers directly if they feel harassed.Pat Lencioni, the founder of the Table Group in Lafayette, Calif., which does executive coaching for companies around issues like diversity, said he was doing just that and had asked the women at his office if they worried about harassment.I came into the office and said, Hey, guys, Ive got a question for you: This sexual harassment stuff, all these things, do you guys ever worry its going to happen here?Mr. Lencioni, 52, recalled.And they were like: No, because we know you.We know who you are.He said he thought this approach could be adopted more broadly.Other men said they had not talked about workplace harassment with anyone because they already knew what they needed to know.This is a liberal town, said Philip Rontell, a real estate agent in Walnut Creek, Calif., who added that he supported the #MeToo campaign.We all already know this stuff.When men do want to talk about workplace harassment, some said, they dont know where to go.I just dont know where those conversations are allowed to be had, said Ryan Ellis, 33, a sales manager for an e-commerce company in Santa Monica, Calif. Austin Gilbert, a recruiter in San Francisco for the company Gametime, said his industry had also had to deal with men talking in online chat rooms at work, which he said could bury and hide toxic comments.His company has closed several high school in-group type of exclusionary work chats over the years, but he worries about more.Advertisement Continue reading the main story We have a policy of telling employees that were free to review all electronic communications, Mr. Gilbert, 31, said.But thats typically not anyones job responsibility in a small company.With women empowered to call out inappropriate behavior, some companies predict that boozy after-work events for the holidays could be combustible this year.While many companies used to have the parties on Thursday or Friday evenings, some are moving them to late Monday or Tuesday afternoons, said Sarah Freedman, the vice president of operations for 23 Layers, an event planner in New York whose clients include Google and West Elm.Open bars are being replaced with game zones.One client recently asked for an extremely watered-down John Daly to be the partys signature drink, which Ms. Freeman found strange but probably wise.After-work events are the front line when it comes to harassment, and companies want more safety precautions now, she said.
Wall Street Ticks Up as Dividend Payers Rise, GE Slashes Payout:::::NEW YORK U.S. stock indexes rose on Monday as a sharp drop in General Electric shares was more than offset by gains in high dividend-paying sectors including consumer staples and utilities.General Electric slashed its dividend by 50 percent and cut its profit forecast while unveiling a plan that narrowed its focus on aviation, power and healthcare.Shares of the industrial conglomerate fell 7.2 percent to $19.02 after touching a more than five-year low of $18.75."People who were in GE for their dividend may be looking for a better place to put their money," said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Utilities and consumer staples rank among the sectors with the highest dividend yield on the S&P 500.They were also the largest percentage winning sectors on Monday.
America’s ‘Renaissance’ to Gains for Renewables: Global Energy Trends:::::Here are some of the most important themes to be found in the report.Energy Renaissance Energy production in the United States will continue to shake up the global oil and natural gas markets, and benefit the countrys economy.Photo By the 2030s, largely because of production from shale-rock formations, the United States is expected to produce more than 30 million barrels of oil and gas a day, the report says.That is 50 percent more than any other country has ever produced in a single year.That is a sharp shift from the countrys position just a decade ago, when it was a major importer of oil.The shale industry has gone through a trial by fire in recent years, the report says, referring to a sharp falloff in the price of oil from more than $100 a barrel to as low as around $30 a barrel.It is now above $60 a barrel.That has transformed the shale sector, and it is leaner and hungrier than it was before the price crash, the report says.As a result, it is better able to quickly react to any sign of higher prices.That is crucial, as the OPEC oil cartel tries to manage its production levels to bolster prices.The Coming Gas Shake-Up Changes in how gas is transported and traded are having a major effect, on the energy industry and the environment.As the United States increases its gas production it is now on track to surpass traditional giants like Qatar and Russia and become the worlds largest exporter of liquefied natural gas, or L.N.G.it is also exporting what the report calls a disruptive mind-set about how gas markets should operate.Gas has historically been sold through long-term contracts pegged to oil prices.That has particularly been the case in Asia, the key market for L.N.G., which is expected to eventually dominate the international gas trade.Advertisement Continue reading the main story But as the United States becomes a bigger force in gas markets, it is also helping to break down the existing system.Over time, the report forecasts that gas will be traded more widely and freely, potentially pushing down prices and making it more attractive to developing countries like India and China.Greater use of gas could bring major environmental benefits.When burned, it produces less of the carbon emissions associated with climate change than coal, and lower levels of other pollutants.Mr. Birol said, for instance, said that the decision by power plants in United States to switch from burning coal to gas was largely responsible for holding global emissions roughly steady in recent years (although they appear poised to rise this year).Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.There is still work to be done, the report says.The gas industry needs to address emissions of methane that undermine that type of fuels environmental claims.Natural gas is a viable exit ramp off of fossil fuels only if it cleans up its methane pollution, which now seriously undercuts its claimed climate advantages, said Fred Krupp, president of the Environmental Defense Fund, an American environmental group.Gains for Renewables One factor that may hamper the growth of gas: rapidly falling costs of renewable sources of energy like wind and solar installations.The average cost of electricity generated over the life of a solar power plant declined by a stunning 70 percent from 2010 to 2016, according to the agencys report.Wind costs declined by 25 percent in that period.Photo The report forecasts that these technologies will only become less expensive over the next 25 years, squeezing fossil fuels, which are widely used to generate electric power.Already, power from new wind installations in India and China is cheaper than new gas-fired power plants.A similar situation is developing with solar power, the report says.Still, fossil fuels will not vanish anytime soon.It is much more difficult to reduce the use of coal, gas and oil in sectors like transportation and industry than it is in power generation, and the share of fossil fuels used to meet overall energy demand will be 75 percent in 2040, compared with 81 percent last year, according to the agencys main scenario.Advertisement Continue reading the main story And, the report adds, greenhouse gas levels still appear to be climbing above the threshold required to meet international goals like those established in the 2015 Paris climate accords.Chinas Outsize Role Because of Chinas scale as a consumer of energy, the choices that the country makes will be felt globally, the report says.China could overtake the United States as the worlds largest consumer of oil as soon as 2030.Of all the new solar and wind power installations to be added through 2040, a third could be in China.In that period, the country could also end up with 320 million electric vehicles, more than a third of the global total.Chinas choices, the report says, will play a huge role in determining global trends, and could spark a faster clean energy transition.
The Dream Chaser Space Plane Takes Flight and Aces Its Landing:::::Photo If you miss NASAs space shuttles, you might like the Dream Chaser.The compact space plane carries no crew, but will transport cargo to the International Space Station in the years ahead and conduct other missions in orbit around the Earth.On Saturday, the vehicle completed an important milestone in its development.A helicopter lifted Dream Chaser more than 2.3 miles off the ground, then dropped it.Over the course of one minute, the craft accelerated to 330 miles per hour, made a couple of turns and glided 10 miles to a runway at Edwards Air Force Base in California.It touched down at a speed of 191 miles per hour, rolling 4,200 feet before coming to a stop.The vehicle is in perfect shape, no issues, Mark N. Sirangelo, the head of Sierra Nevada Space Systems, the maker of the Dream Chaser, said in an interview.Mr. Sirangelo said he thought no more glide tests would be needed.If NASA agrees, the very next flight of the Dream Chaser might be a return from orbit two or three years from now at the end of a mission taking cargo to and from the space station.It is to land on the same runway at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida that the space shuttles once used.Photo Last year, NASA awarded Sierra Nevada a contract for at least six cargo flights.The Dream Chaser is an autonomous, self-flying spacecraft, and this iteration will not carry any people.Saturdays test demonstrated that the software that guides the vehicle worked as designed.Advertisement Continue reading the main story There was no problem with the landing gear, unlike the glide test four years ago when the left wheel never lowered and the Dream Chaser skidded off the runway.That mishap proved beneficial in retrospect.
Protesters Jeer as Trump Team Promotes Coal at U.N. Climate Talks:::::The American presentation came the same day that a new study showed that emissions were rising worldwide after three years on a plateau.Researchers said the emissions growth was driven largely by increased burning of coal in China and India.The question is not if we will continue to use coal, but how, said Holly Krutka, vice president of coal generation and emissions technologies at Peabody Energy.Michael R. Bloomberg, the former New York mayor who has spent tens of millions of dollars on a campaign to shut down coal plants, said, Promoting coal at a climate summit is like promoting tobacco at a cancer summit.Mr. Bloomberg, who is attending part of the Bonn conference, this week donated $50 million to environmental groups to help countries shift away from coal, starting in Europe.Photo While many energy experts agree that technologies like carbon capture for coal plants and nuclear power can play a critical role in reducing emissions, the fact that Trump administration officials have played down concern over global warming has triggered deep suspicion about American intentions.Nuclear and carbon capture are critical to reducing CO 2 emissions, but going to Bonn to promote the technologies without admitting climate change is a crisis is a logical absurdity, said Josh Freed, director of the clean energy program at the centrist think tank Third Way.He said that denying that climate change is a problem while pushing technology to solve it made no sense.Why would anyone trust or work with you?he said.Several American lawmakers who flew to Germany for the climate change talks denounced the coal discussion.Gov.Jay Inslee of Washington, a Democrat, pre-empted the White House event by striding into the packed conference room and calling it a sideshow that the rest of the world would ignore.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Its a total distraction, said Andrew Steer, president of the World Resources Institute, an environmental think tank based in Washington.Still, Mr.Steer acknowledged, countries throughout Asia and Africa are continuing to build coal plants in their quest to provide energy access for millions living without electricity.This is not wickedness on the part of these countries that want to get cheaper energy, he said.Trump administration officials made a similar point.We need to lift one billion plus people out of energy poverty, Mr. Banks said.He argued that while renewable energy has a bright future, only fossil fuels at the moment can deliver enough energy to allow people to rise out of poverty.Yet even as the Trump administration pushes for a revival of the coal industry, other countries say they are phasing it out.France has vowed to eliminate coal from its electricity mix by 2022, and Italy by 2025.The United Kingdom and Canada said this week that they, too, would take steps to phase out coal.Were passed the time that we want to be using coal, said Catherine McKenna, Canadas environment minister.People do not want polluting coal.They do not want it.Some developing countries described a more balanced view, however, conceding a need for fossil fuels in the short term while ultimately calling for stronger global action on climate change and a shift toward cleaner forms of energy, including renewables like wind and solar energy.Officials from Bangladesh, which still gets most of its electricity from natural gas and has plans to build 25 new coal-fired plants by 2022, said they would welcome the use of technology to improve the efficiency of their coal plants as a steppingstone toward renewable energy.Keep in mind that this is a developing country that has a huge need for electricity, said Muhammad Azizul Haque, a deputy secretary in Bangladeshs Environment Ministry.So there has to be balance, its not just saying, O.K., well go for renewables.Its very complicated, because people need energy.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Pakistan, for its part, has begun importing more liquefied natural gas in order to reduce its reliance on burning coal and oil for electricity, said Tariq Banuri, executive director of Pakistans Global Change Impact Study Center.Those imports have helped offset 1 percent of the countrys emissions.Mr. Banuri said that Pakistans emissions were likely to grow in the coming decades as it lifts itself out of poverty, though the country is also making a big push on renewable energy and could do more if wealthier nations provided more aid to help drive down the cost of wind and solar even further.But any nuanced discussions of energy policy were overshadowed by anger at the Trump administration for disengaging from the global community on climate change.During a question-and-answer session, audience members pressed American officials to clarify the White Houses stance on climate change.Climate mitigation is an important goal of the United States, Mr. Banks said, but I dont think its any surprise that economic security and energy security are higher priorities.
Yale Professors Race Google and IBM to the First Quantum Computer:::::Quantum computing systems are difficult to understand because they do not behave like the everyday world we live in.But this counterintuitive behavior is what allows them to perform calculations at rate that would not be possible on a typical computer.Todays computers store information as bits, with each transistor holding either a 1 or a 0.But thanks to something called the superposition principle behavior exhibited by subatomic particles like electrons and photons, the fundamental particles of light a quantum bit, or qubit, can store a 1 and a 0 at the same time.This means two qubits can hold four values at once.As you expand the number of qubits, the machine becomes exponentially more powerful.Todd Holmdahl, who oversees the quantum project at Microsoft, said he envisioned a quantum computer as something that could instantly find its way through a maze.A typical computer will try one path and get blocked and then try another and another and another, he said.A quantum computer can try all paths at the same time.The trouble is that storing information in a quantum system for more than a short amount of time is very difficult, and this short coherence time leads to errors in calculations.But over the past two decades, Mr. Schoelkopf and other physicists have worked to solve this problem using what are called superconducting circuits.They have built qubits from materials that exhibit quantum properties when cooled to extremely low temperatures.With this technique, they have shown that, every three years or so, they can improve coherence times by a factor of 10.This is known as Schoelkopfs Law, a playful ode to Moores Law, the rule that says the number of transistors on computer chips will double every two years.Photo Schoelkopfs Law started as a joke, but now we use it in many of our research papers, said Isaac Chuang, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.No one expected this would be possible, but the improvement has been exponential.These superconducting circuits have become the primary area of quantum computing research across the industry.One of Mr. Schoelkopfs former students now leads the quantum computing program at IBM.The founder of Rigetti Computing studied with Michel Devoret, one of the other Yale professors behind Quantum Circuits.Advertisement Continue reading the main story In recent months, after grabbing a team of top researchers from the University of California, Santa Barbara, Google indicated it is on the verge of using this method to build a machine that can achieve quantum supremacy when a quantum machine performs a task that would be impossible on your laptop or any other machine that obeys the laws of classical physics.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.There are other areas of research that show promise.Microsoft, for example, is betting on particles known as anyons.But superconducting circuits appear likely to be the first systems that will bear real fruit.The belief is that quantum machines will eventually analyze the interactions between physical molecules with a precision that is not possible today, something that could radically accelerate the development of new medications.Google and others also believe that these systems can significantly accelerate machine learning, the field of teaching computers to learn tasks on their own by analyzing data or experiments with certain behavior.A quantum computer could also be able to break the encryption algorithms that guard the worlds most sensitive corporate and government data.With so much at stake, it is no surprise that so many companies are betting on this technology, including start-ups like Quantum Circuits.The deck is stacked against the smaller players, because the big-name companies have so much more money to throw at the problem.But start-ups have their own advantages, even in such a complex and expensive area of research.Small teams of exceptional people can do exceptional things, said Bill Coughran, who helped oversee the creation of Googles vast internet infrastructure and is now investing in Mr. Schoelkopfs company as a partner at Sequoia.I have yet to see large teams inside big companies doing anything tremendously innovative.Though Quantum Circuits is using the same quantum method as its bigger competitors, Mr. Schoelkopf argued that his company has an edge because it is tackling the problem differently.Rather than building one large quantum machine, it is constructing a series of tiny machines that can be networked together.He said this will make it easier to correct errors in quantum calculations one of the main difficulties in building one of these complex machines.But each of the big companies insist that they hold an advantage and each is loudly trumpeting its progress, even if a working machine is still years away.Mr. Coughran said that he and Sequoia envision Quantum Circuits evolving into a company that can deliver quantum computing to any business or researcher that needs it.Another investor, Canaans Brendan Dickinson, said that if a company like this develops a viable quantum machine, it will become a prime acquisition target.The promise of a large quantum computer is incredibly powerful, Mr. Dickinson said.It will solve problems we cant even imagine right now.
Missouri Opens Antitrust Investigation Into Google:::::Photo SAN FRANCISCO Missouris attorney general has opened an investigation into whether Googles business practices violate its consumer protection and antitrust laws amid growing concern over the influence of powerful technology companies.Josh Hawley, Missouris attorney general, said on Monday that his office had issued a subpoena to Google to seek information into the collection and use of users private information, the use of other content providers information on its sites and potential bias in search engine results.Missouris investigation demonstrates how states and Europe have begun to take the lead on examining Google, which has avoided antitrust scrutiny from federal regulators.In June, the European Commission levied the largest-ever antitrust fine against the company for unfairly favoring its own shopping services over others.Mr. Hawley, a Republican who is running for Senate in 2018, said that the Federal Trade Commission had given Google a free pass and that it was critical for consumers to understand what was happening with their personal information.Advertisement Continue reading the main story No entity in the history of the world has collected as much information on individual consumers as Google, he said in a news conference.We should not just accept the word of these corporate giants that they have our best interests at heart.We need to make sure that they are actually following the law, we need to make sure that consumers are protected, and we need to hold them accountable.
Steve Jurvetson Quits Venture Capital Firm Amid Investigation:::::Steve Jurvetson, a founding partner of one of the best-known venture capital firms in Silicon Valley and a board member of Tesla and SpaceX, is leaving the firm after it began an investigation into his behavior with women, the firm told investors on Monday.As of today and by mutual agreement, Steve Jurvetson will be leaving DFJ, said a confidential letter sent to investors in the venture capital firm, Draper Fisher Jurvetson, and obtained by The New York Times.It continued, DFJs culture has been, and will continue to be, built on the values of respect and integrity in all of our interactions.The firms spokeswoman, Carol Wentworth, confirmed his departure, and a Tesla spokeswoman said he is taking a leave of absence from the Tesla and SpaceX boards pending resolution of these allegations.Last month, the firm said it became aware of indirect and secondhand allegations about Mr. Jurvetson and was looking into them.The acknowledgment came after Keri Kukral, a tech entrepreneur, wrote on Facebook: Women approached by a founding partner of Draper Fisher Jurvetson should be careful.Predatory behavior is rampant.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Heidi Roizen, an operating partner at DFJ, defended the firm last month.I dont need an investigation to state with certainty that this is patently wrong, she wrote in a Tumblr post.She added that the firm had never received an official allegation of misconduct.
Asking the Big Questions of General Electric:::::Photo It doesnt take much imagination to grasp the religious undertones in General Electric boss John Flannerys plan for the $178 billion conglomerate.He says he is looking for the soul of the company again.Now, some 100 days into the job, Mr. Flannery has categorically exorcised the ghosts of false expectations past by halving its dividend, reducing earnings guidance and questioning entire swaths of the companys portfolio of industrial assets.Next up is G.E.s board of directors.That Mr. Flannery is asking why do we exist?is not entirely surprising.He is, after all, a man with many years ahead of him to make some hard decisions, fundamentally reshape the company Thomas Edison founded and rebase its share price for the hard restructuring ahead.By contrast, his predecessor, Jeff Immelt (a.k.a.Two Jets), was fighting for time, struggling to justify what was already done and had been previously promised during his 16 years running the company.But the about-face from Mr. Immelt to Mr. Flannery has outdone the usual kitchen-sinking that accompanies the passing from one chief executive to the next.Its certainly a stark contrast from Mr. Immelts own transition from Jack Welch in 2001.And that has raised a key question for G.E.shareholders: How did the board allow Mr. Immelt to continue for so long without intervention?If it was so obvious to Mr. Flannery and many investors that G.E.was overspending on dividends, flubbing on acquisitions and committing to too many second-rate businesses, what were G.E.s 18 directors thinking?Mr. Flannery has already clarified that G.E.s board is oversized, under-engaged and badly in need of a housecleaning.So perhaps the most encouraging development to be found in Mr. Flannerys 57-page slide show on Monday is a plan to put just 12 directors up for a vote next year, including three new ones.That means it is parting company with half the current lineup.G.E.will also create a new finance and capital allocation committee with increased oversight of the companys acquisition and buyback strategy.The composition of the new board will include, among others, a representative of Trian Partners, the activist fund manager led by Nelson Peltz.But that person cant be the only director willing to question the strategy, dig through the numbers and, where needed, prod Mr. Flannery to shift gears.The era of the all-powerful G.E.boss, with two jets at his disposal in case one breaks down, is over.That, beyond any numerical pledges, should be the most important statement to emerge on this investor day.
Qualcomm Rejects Broadcom’s Takeover Bid as Too Low:::::Photo Qualcomm has rebuffed a $105 billion buyout bid from Broadcom, setting up two of the worlds biggest chip makers for a potentially nasty takeover battle.The proposal significantly undervalues the company, overlooking its reputation in mobile technology and potential for growth, Paul Jacobs, Qualcomms board chairman, said in a statement on Monday.Broadcoms offer, which would amount to the largest deal in the history of the tech industry and have significant implications for smartphone production, could also run afoul of antitrust regulators, Qualcomm said.Broadcom, which said on Monday that it remains fully committed to pursuing its acquisition of Qualcomm, now has several options, each involving a degree of hostility.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The company could raise its bid price.Or it could take its case to shareholders, starting a proxy fight to swap out members of the current board of directors, all of whom are up for re-election in the spring.
She Took On Colombia’s Soda Industry. Then She Was Silenced.:::::But public health organizations, including the W.H.O., cite soda taxes as one of the most effective policy tools for cutting consumption of what nutritionists call a liquid candy that has contributed to an epidemic of obesity and related health conditions around the world.Dr. Kathryn Backholer, an expert on the issue at Deakin University in Australia, said taxes on soda were low-hanging fruit in the fight against obesity, diabetes and other weight-related diseases because such drinks are easily categorized to tax and sensible to target because they have little or no nutritional value.Dr. Backholer and other experts said the turning point for soda tax proponents came in 2014, when Mexico Coca-Colas biggest consumer market by per capita consumption approved a 10 percent tax.Mexico also showcased how dirty the fight could get.Last year, numerous advocates of a proposal to double Mexicos tax to 20 percent received strings of upsetting and fraudulent texts from unknown numbers.One man got a message saying his daughter had been seriously injured; another found a text saying his wife was having an affair; a third received a link to a funeral home.Spyware was found on the phones.The proposal failed.Elsewhere in the world, soda companies have assiduously worked their government connections and economic clout.In internal company emails leaked to an American watchdog group last year, Coke executives described strategies for winning over government ministers and other officials in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Ecuador, Portugal, and regions of Spain.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The Australian Beverages Council wrote in its 2016 annual report that fighting a soft drinks tax has been consuming vast amounts of resources, and that our learnings from other markets through our international network tells us that these types of threats must be constantly challenged before they get before a parliament for debate.In Colombia, where soda is often cheaper than bottled water, the soda-tax fight took place in a key market for beverage makers.Sales volume of carbonated drinks here has climbed more than 25 percent over the past 15 years; during that same time in the United States, it fell 12 percent, according to Euromonitor, a market research firm.Coke and Pepsi were far less visible in the Colombia battle, leaving the big national beverage company, Postobn, in the spotlight.Postobn, a drinks maker and distributor for Pepsi, is part of a huge conglomerate that includes sugar cane growers, sugar mills and the countrys biggest media company, RCN Televisin, which helped disseminate the anti-tax message.Postobn and RCN declined interview requests.The stage was set for a clash between a powerful industry and a stubborn public advocate.Showdown Over an Ad In early 2016, Colombia, a nation of 49 million, was facing the unfamiliar prospect of stability and peace.After decades of civil war and narco-terrorism, Colombians were enjoying the fruits of an aggressive United States-backed military campaign that had largely decimated the countrys drug cartels.Unemployment was near historic lows, the poverty rate was dropping and millions were hopeful about the possibility of lasting peace with the countrys main rebel group, the FARC.In March 2016, the countrys health minister, Alejandro Gaviria Uribe, proposed a 20 percent tax on soda and sugar-sweetened beverages the equivalent of about 10 cents on a liter bottle that became part of a larger tax overhaul backed by Colombias president and the Ministry of Finance.For the first time in our lives, we thought we might become a normal country and be able to deal with issues other than violence, said Diana Guarnizo, a lawyer with Dejusticia, a rights group that helped promote the soda tax.Here we were, an organization that had dealt with peace, violence, land reform and gross injustice, and suddenly we had the luxury to talk about what mothers are putting in their childrens lunchboxes.The measure was designed to inject $340 million a year into Colombias chronically underfunded national health care system, but Mr. Gaviria had a larger goal: to dampen soda consumption in a country with an obesity rate that had tripled since 1980 to 19 percent of adults.The fastest growth had occurred among Colombian youth from ages 5 to 17.Each year, 4,000 people age 30 to 70 die from obesity-related illnesses like heart disease and diabetes, the Health Ministry said.
‘Lord of the Rings’ Series Coming to Amazon:::::Middle Earth is coming to TV.Amazon announced on Monday that it has retained the rights to adapt J.R.R.Tolkiens The Lord of the Rings for television for its Prime streaming service.The multi-season adaptation will feature new story lines preceding J.R.R.Tolkiens The Fellowship of the Ring, which is the first Rings book, Amazon said in a statement.The deal also includes the opportunity to pursue spinoff series.But it will cost Amazon dearly: Deadline reported that just the rights to the globally popular franchise cost $200 million.Further details such as what writers, producers or actors would be involved, or when the show might debut have not been announced.With its fantastical setting and characters, The Lord of the Rings bears a superficial resemblance to HBOs Game of Thrones, currently one of the biggest shows in the world.(George R.R.Martin, who wrote the books that series was based on, has said Tolkiens series was an inspiration.)It is also a proven pop culture commodity.Collectively the three Lord of the Rings films directed by Peter Jackson grossed more than $2.9 billion internationally.Photo The TV adaptation will cover different ground, focusing on previously unexplored stories based on J.R.R.Tolkiens original writings, Matt Galsor, a representative for the Tolkien Estate and Trust and HarperCollins, said in a statement.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The move amounts to a much-needed shot in the arm for Amazon, which has lost several top leaders in the wake of a sexual harassment allegation.
The Bonn Climate Conference: What You Need to Know:::::Here are answers to the five biggest questions about Bonn, including: Whats the best-case scenario?And what might set off a fight?Here are five world leaders, or sets of leaders, who are emerging as climate change champions as the United States disengages.Photo Two years after Paris, the world is still off track Under the Paris deal, nearly 200 countries submitted proposals for cutting their greenhouse gas emissions.Yet not one of the major industrialized nations is on course to hit those goals.And even those goals are just a starting point emissions would have to be cut even further to stop global average temperatures from warming more than 2 degrees Celsius over preindustrial levels, the point at which scientists say drastic consequences will be unavoidable.Where do the countries stand now, what have they pledged and what will they eventually need to achieve?These charts lay it out: Separately, a study released on Monday was another indication that the world has not turned the corner on cutting emissions.Industrial emissions had been steady for the past three years, but are projected to rise to record highs this year: The United States is in an awkward position The Trump administration has sent a delegation to Bonn, but the American negotiators will be hashing out the details of a climate deal that President Trump has vowed to abandon like a spouse who demands a divorce but then continues to live at home, as our reporter Lisa Friedman put it.A shadow American delegation is also at the talks, led by former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York and Gov.Jerry Brown of California, who have vowed that states, cities and businesses are still in the Paris agreement, even if the federal government is not.The Trump administration is also sending representatives from energy companies to promote coal, natural gas and nuclear power.Mr. Trump has pledged to support those industries, but the presentation may receive a frosty reception, given that emissions from fossil fuels are a primary driver of global warming and some environmentalists shun nuclear energy.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Syria announced last week that it would join the Paris climate accord, meaning that every country in the world has now signed on to the pact or intends to join and only one, the United States, has signaled its intention to withdraw from it.(Nicaragua, another holdout, said last month that it would join the agreement.)On the Friday before the conference opened, 13 federal agencies released a comprehensive scientific report that affirmed that humans are to blame for most of the global warming that has occurred since the start of the 20th century.That will not surprise anyone at the Bonn conference but it does directly contradict statements from some top Trump administration officials.Photo Heres some of our best climate coverage this year The Bonn conference is a good occasion to catch up on some climate change reading.We answered 17 often-asked questions about climate change.If youre looking for a climate F.A.Q., look no further.You can even send us your questions at the bottom.There is no silver bullet for climate change, but you might be surprised by a particular solution that would be more effective than others.See if you can guess which one it is.We went to Antarctica to see its flowing ice sheets for ourselves, and to learn about what they might portend.Read our Antarctic Dispatches here, and take yourself there in virtual reality.We also went to Alaska, and found out that its permafrost is no longer permanent.And as it thaws, it is dumping carbon into the atmosphere.Arctic sea ice is disappearing, too.Take a look at the trend in this chart.(It will be pretty easy to spot.)Shifting from ice to heat: Summers are getting hotter.You arent imagining it, and it wasnt always this way.Advertisement Continue reading the main story In those hotter summers, the most extreme hot days with highs of 95 degrees Fahrenheit, or 35 degrees Celsius are expected to multiply.And if countries renege on their Paris pledges and take no action, it will be even worse.Could you fix the worlds carbon budget?This feature from The Timess Opinion Pages lets you try.And here are six maps that explain how Americans think about climate change.It turns out that people agree on certain issues more than you might expect.
Covering a Mass Shooting, and Adding to a Town’s Pain:::::Ignoring such shootings, or passively accepting how widespread and devastating they are becoming, cannot be an option.But there may also be something terribly wrong with the spectacle of covering this bloodshed.By now, some of my colleagues are veteran chroniclers of such shootings, grimly bumping into one another with gallows humor over the past few years in Las Vegas; Colorado Springs; San Bernardino, Calif.; Roseburg, Ore.; and Orlando, Fla. Perhaps because of the small size of Sutherland Springs, the ungainliness of the medias rush to cover the latest shooting touched a nerve here.As satellite trucks staked out coveted parking spots and broadcasters from around the world described the towns horrors in German or Russian or Portuguese, tempers flared.Photo Some residents in the town simply slammed doors in journalists faces, a reaction any of us might have had under such circumstances.Others in the town put a price on their cooperation.Reporters from a wide array of organizations scrambled to interview anyone else they could find.Eventually the media pressure began to weigh even on me, Lauren McGaughy, a reporter for the Dallas Morning News, wrote in an eloquent apology to the people of Sutherland Springs.I did a few on-the-ground interviews before rejecting the rest.It was too stressful.I expressed my growing disgust with a few other journalists, and many agreed with me.Journalists were not the only ones who descended on the town.Sidewalk preachers from San Antonio convened at the Valero gas station opposite the church, bellowing their prayers, if not in front of townspeople then for reporters iPhone cameras.Chaplains from the Billy Graham Rapid Response Team meandered through the town.Brad Kessler, an aspirant for mayor of San Antonio, dropped in to shake hands around the yellow crime-scene tape that cordoned off the killing field.The Homicide Survivors Support Group of Corpus Christi set up a table with stuffed animals, where reporters quickly conducted interviews with the volunteers.Advertisement Continue reading the main story I grew up in a rural outpost in northern New Mexico about the size of Sutherland Springs.I know how suspicious, and sometimes awed, residents of small towns can be of privileged, big-city visitors.Still, I have a hard time imagining what its like for the people here to have so many cameras pointed at them and so many tape recorders thrust their way.As some of the network television trucks began to pull out of town, I wondered how big a role I myself had played in amplifying the suffering of Sutherland Springs.After all, I, too, had approached residents who wanted nothing to do with reporters.Id asked Ms. Solis, the factory worker, to talk to me when she could have been tending the shoulder where a bullet had sundered her flesh.When the country endures one mass shooting after another, why they happen certainly ought to be the main focus of the national conversation.But maybe its time we also discuss how theyre covered on the ground.For now, Im left wondering what happens next in Sutherland Springs.Bertha Cardenas-Lomas, 57, the head of the towns cemetery board, seemed to be in shock as I interviewed her, expressing dismay over all the friends and neighbors she now has to bury.She touched on what its like to face a barrage of interview requests when shes struggling to simply mow the grass on the burial ground.No one can ever be prepared to find their way in this situation, she said, holding her head in her hands.Im afraid that the real pain, the reality of this violence, will set in when all of you are gone.
If You’re Sick, Stay Away From Work. If You Can’t, Here Is What Doctors Advise.:::::Nobody tries to convince you to go home because they knew in that situation theyd be doing the same thing, she said.Some people might read her account as a tribute to hard work and selflessness.Others might be aghast that she had risked exposing others to illness.Its clear on which side doctors come down: They say workers with the flu or a cold should use sick days far more often than they do.Though millions of Americans dont get paid time off when theyre sick, those who do have the option often dont take it.If its bad enough that youre wondering if you should stay home, you should probably stay home, said Dr. Pritish K. Tosh, an infectious diseases researcher at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn.When, and how long, should you stay home?Remember: Its not just about you.Even if you can battle the flu by enduring a miserable week, it can be deadly for others, especially pregnant women, young children and older people.And no matter how many precautions you take, theres no way to eliminate risk to people around you.As a general rule, Dr. Tosh suggested people stay home until they are fever-free for 24 hours.He said he stayed out of work for three or four days the last time he had the flu.People can be infectious even before they start to have symptoms, but most of the time that theyre going to be most infectious is going to be when they are sickest, especially if theyre having fevers, he said.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Infectious germs are spread most frequently by airborne respiratory droplets from sneezing and coughing.The flu virus can last for up to 24 hours depending on the surface, Dr. Tosh said.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.By coughing or sneezing into your hands, or wiping a runny nose, your hands can spread the germs to everything you touch including surfaces many other people touch, such as door knobs, elevator buttons or shopping carts.Youre never truly not contagious until all of those symptoms are resolved, said Dr. David Shih, executive vice president of strategy, health and innovation at CityMD, which runs a chain of urgent care centers in New Jersey, New York and Washington.How can you limit the exposure to others?Lets say youre ignoring the doctors and going out into the world anyway.Youre not alone: A CityMD survey in August found that 69 percent of Americans with the flu or flulike symptoms said they went to the drugstore or a pharmacy, 43 percent said they went to the grocery store and 39 percent said they went to work.Millennials (76 percent) were far more likely than those 35 or older (56 percent) to have left the house the last time they were sick.Though you cant eliminate the risk of infecting others, there are steps you can take to minimize it: Get in the habit of coughing and sneezing into your elbow, not your hand.Children are being taught to cough like Dracula.Limit your interaction with other people as much as possible.If youre going to work, consider skipping nonessential meetings.Avoid physical contact with other people, especially shaking hands.Wipe surfaces down after touching them.Use hand sanitizer or wash your hands after coughing or sneezing.Wear a mask to limit the respiratory droplets.Take medication to reduce your symptoms.Oh, by the way, get your flu shot.What about people who dont have sick days?Stay-at-home parents scoff at the idea of sick days, as do millions of other workers whose jobs dont offer paid time off.Advertisement Continue reading the main story For people who are living paycheck to paycheck or have significant debt, the risks of staying home and losing pay or potentially losing their job are far too great, said Vicki Shabo, vice president for workplace policies and strategies at the National Partnership for Women and Families.Low-income earners and part-time workers are especially likely to work while sick, including those at restaurants and hospitals.Ms. Shabo and advocates like her are pushing for laws mandating paid sick days, which are in place or will be soon in eight states, 30 cities and two counties.Its important from a public health perspective, and a workplace morale perspective, that people can take the time they need to recover, she said.
Marc Maron Reckons With Louis C.K.’s Misconduct:::::And I would say, Well, are you going to address it somehow, to handle it, to get out from under it, whenever it shows up?Mr. Maron continued.He goes, No, I cant.I cant do that.Itll give it life.Itll give it air.And that that was the conversation.The other incidents, how would everybody know about that?Mr. Maron said larger institutional problems in comedy made it difficult for women to be heard and believed when they spoke of being mistreated by other performers.He said that he knew Rebecca Corry, one of the women who spoke to The Times, and she couldnt tell me about this.There was no place for them to go with these stories, where they felt safe to tell them, Mr. Maron said.I want to believe women, but in this particular instance, there was no one named in that story, he said.There was no place for women to go tell this story.There was no women attached to it.I didnt know their names until Friday.So I believed my friend.Photo Separately, Abby Schachner, another of the women who spoke to The Times, wrote in a Facebook post that she forgave Louis C.K.and accepted what he had said in his statement.Ms. Schachner wrote: Louis put out a statement, which frankly, made me cry.It touched me.And I do feel some of his insights speak to how I felt.I looked up to the people who recognized my work and made them (sigh), father figures/mentors whether they wanted that role or not.I shot myself in the foot, protected myself when I needed to be bold, was bold when I shouldve been poised, hid behind ex-boyfriends, excuses, and the excuse of my excuses.I felt like I disappointed anyone who ever believed in me.But most of all, I never truly valued myself.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Ms. Schachner said that Louis C.K.did abuse his power.And yes, obviously he has a glitch, she continued.But I do, too.We all do.Were learning a new language here, and we need to be kind, and we need to be open, and we need to be fair, and we need to listen.She concluded by writing: I do forgive Louis.I forgave him.But most of all, I think its time to forgive myself, too.Other women who spoke to The Times had different reactions to Louis C.K.s statement.The comedians Dana Min Goodman and Julia Wolov wrote in a Twitter post, It was a statement not an apology.Dont get it twisted.And a woman who worked at The Chris Rock Show with Louis C.K.when he masturbated in front of her, and who spoke on condition of anonymity, said she also felt his statement fell short.A real apology would be a personal apology, she said.
Trump Again Wades Into Tax Debate, Suggesting Repeal of Obamacare Mandate:::::In recent weeks, Mr. Trump has called for including the repeal of the individual mandate in the tax bill.Doing so would save more than $300 billion over a decade and would allow Republicans to boast that they took a step forward in dismantling a law that continues to haunt them.Representative Kevin Brady, Republican of Texas and the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, said Mr. Trumps opinion remained a factor as the House tried to pass its own tax bill this week.The president has already indicated to me a number of times that hes really interested in including the individual mandate repeal, Mr. Brady said.It remains under consideration.Mr. Brady added that he was very confident that Republicans had the votes to pass the bill and that while he did not expect major changes to the legislation, there were important differences between the House and Senate bills that must eventually be bridged.Mr. Trumps Twitter messages about taxes have at times sowed confusion about the direction he wants to chart for the legislation.The president said previously that he wanted Republican negotiators to allow for a higher individual tax bracket to make sure that the bill was sufficiently progressive.The House plan would keep a top rate of 39.6 percent for millionaires and the Senate plan has a top rate of 38.5 percent for high earners.But Mr. Trump suggested on Monday that lawmakers lower the top rate to 35 percent while also giving deeper cuts to the middle class.Last month, lawmakers were considering making changes to 401(k) retirement accounts as a way to raise revenue before Mr. Trump quashed the idea on Twitter.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Although Mr. Trump must sign the eventual legislation, Republican lawmakers have shown a willingness to break with his wishes.Mr. Trump originally called for a 15 percent corporate tax rate, but Senate Republicans appear to have settled on a 20 percent rate that will be delayed by a year.Senate Republicans also have ignored Mr. Trumps desire to fully eliminate the estate tax and, for now, they have not addressed the special treatment of carried interest that gives hedge fund managers and private equity partners lower tax rates on their income.Advertisement Continue reading the main story At the beginning of the Finance Committees markup, which is expected to last several days, the panels chairman, Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, offered a pre-emptive defense of the bill, both in terms of substance and process.Mr. Hatch dismissed Democrats complaints, based on an analysis from the Joint Committee on Taxation, that the bill would raise taxes on millions of middle-class families, saying critics were missing the forest for the trees.The talking point is that 13 million families in the middle class will see their taxes go up next year if the bill becomes law, Mr. Hatch said.But, he said, critics should focus on the 90 percent of the middle class that would see a tax cut or no change under the bill.He also suggested that the Senate bill would keep the corporate rate cut permanent as Republicans amend the bill in the coming days to comply with special budget rules that will protect it from a Democratic filibuster.Theres no real cause for concern at this point, Mr. Hatch said.But I do want to make clear that were looking at a number of alternatives that will fill the necessary gaps and we have every intention of making the business reforms permanent.Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on the Finance Committee, warned that Republicans had drawn up legislation that would hurt millions of middle-class taxpayers.Because Republicans are planning to pass the bill under the rules that shield it from a filibuster, theyve got to squeeze several trillion dollars of tax handouts and corporate goodies into a $1.5 trillion box, Mr. Wyden said.That means telling the middle class in America to pay up.
Hannity Fans Destroy Keurig Coffee Makers After Company Pulls Advertising:::::Later, on his television show, Mr. Hannity said that the statement was absolutely wrong and that he misspoke.He then brought up the possibility of accusers lying for money, or for political purposes.On Friday, Angelo Carusone, the president of Media Matters for America, the partisan watchdog organization that has campaigned against Mr. Hannity since at least May, began to criticize advertisers for sponsoring his show in light of his comments about Mr. Moore.Keurig responded to Mr. Carusone, and said that it had stopped an ad from airing during Mr. Hannitys show.It was one of five companies to indicate that it would pull advertising, including Realtor.com and the vitamin company Natures Bounty.It was the second time this year that Mr. Hannity has faced the threat of an advertiser exodus of the type that helped cement Bill OReillys exit from Fox News.But this time, Mr. Hannitys online supporters fought back in numbers against the advertisers even, in some cases, destroying their coffee makers.Keurig did not immediately respond to a question about whether it would reconsider advertising on the program.But in an email to employees, the companys chief executive, Bob Gamgort, said that itsacknowledgment that it had pulled the ad was not standard practice and constituted an unacceptable situation.The email, which was obtained by The Washington Post and confirmed as valid by a company spokeswoman, Katie Gilroy, said that the tweet gave the appearance of taking sides in an emotionally charged debate that escalated on Twitter and beyond over the weekend, which was not our intent.Our company and brand reputations are too valuable to be put at risk in this manner, it said.It was difficult to measure the scale of the anti-Keurig counterprotest; even when a topic begins to trend, the tweets are often spread and amplified by bots and other politically motivated accounts.But the calls for a boycott underscored the difficulties American companies face in a hyperpartisan era where any sort of political stance can set off online protests.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Hannity responded to the videos gleefully on Sunday, calling them hilarious.On Sunday evening, he pledged to give away hundreds of coffee makers.(He did not specify the brand.)And while some on the left dutifully took up arms, tweeting in support of Keurig, others just seemed bemused (or amused).Sorry, I was off Twitter for a while, wrote the author Geraldine DeRuiter.It appears that people are destroying coffee machines to show their support of child molesters?
On Spotify, Lipsticks Now Dress Up the Music:::::Photo The makeup artist Pat McGrath, considered by many to be at the top of her profession, is trying a new way to reach potential consumers.On Monday, she will be selling a collection of cosmetics from Pat McGrath Labs via a most unlikely channel: the Spotify shop of the teenage pop star Maggie Lindemann.In the last few years, beauty retail has shifted away from department stores and toward direct-to-consumer models driven by social media (Kylie Cosmetics, Glossier), multibrand stores made for play and engagement (Sephora, Ulta) and highly edited lifestyle selections at fashion chains (Madewell, Urban Outfitters).Ms. McGrath is well versed in selling via social media, through her website and addictive Instagram (1.6 million followers), and she wields brick-and-mortar might through a Sephora partnership.But rather than head to a fashion store to introduce her new makeup, as one might expect, Ms. McGrath chose Spotify because of her love for music.Music permeates everything I do, she said.I love everything from Grace Jones to Nicki Minaj to Underworld to D.J.MikeQ and beyond.Music is integral to my personal inspiration.Photo Additionally, she wants to keep things fresh.I have always believed in finding new ways to disrupt the marketplace and engage with my fellow beauty junkies where they live, she said.And, surprisingly, Ms. McGrath chose a rising star to work with rather than reaching out to her stable of famous muses, among them Kim Kardashian, Naomi Campbell and Charli XCX.Advertisement Continue reading the main story I like a real mix, Ms. McGrath said.Whereas traditional beauty campaigns may bet on household names, she finds it more modern day and interesting to feature girls of all different levels.She points to her affiliations with less familiar names including the model Paloma Elsesser and the musician Maxine Ashley.
Five Technologies That Will Rock Your World:::::Such technology will improve health care in places where doctors are scarce.But eventually, it will streamline care in the developed world as well.Google is already running tests inside two hospitals in India, and the start-up Infervision has deployed similar technology in hospitals across China.In the longer term, similar methods promise to rapidly accelerate drug discovery and so many other aspects of health care.Everything from the nature of the food that we grow and eat to the drugs that we give ourselves to how we monitor the impact of these things is all being transformed by A.I.in deeply profound ways, said Matt Ocko, a managing partner at DCVC, a San Francisco venture capital firm that has invested heavily in this area.Conversational Computing Neural networks are not limited to image recognition.Far from it.These same techniques are rapidly improving coffee-table gadgets like the Amazon Echo, which can recognize spoken commands from across the room, and online services like Skype, which can instantly translate phone calls from one language to another.They may even eventually produce machines that can carry on a conversation.Recently, said Luke Zettlemoyer, a University of Washington professor, there has been a huge phase shift in the area of natural language understanding technology that understands the natural way people talk and write.Companies like Google, Facebook, and Microsoft are at the forefront of this movement, which promises to fundamentally change how we interact with

first, Kitty Hawk will sell its vehicles to hobbyists.But the company hopes it can eventually convince the general public, and regulators, that flying cars make sense.That is no easy task.After all, these cars will require a new kind of air traffic control.Photo The Quantum Computer Even more outlandish?Its the prospect of a quantum computer.Drawing on the seemingly magical properties of quantum physics, such a machine would be exponentially more powerful than computers of today.Think of it this way: A quantum computer could instantly crack the encryption that protects the worlds most private

paradigm for processing information, said Robert Schoelkopf, who helped invent the techniques that are driving so much of quantum computing research.So we think that known applications are just the tip of the iceberg.
The Future of Flying? You Can See It Now:::::In a computer lab in Winston-Salem, N.C., interior systems designers at Rockwell Collins use virtual reality to test the airline cabins they create, inviting customers to sit in seats, open overhead bins and tug rolling suitcases down the aisle.This allows them to discover and fix mistakes before the design is finalized.It would take crazy-man money to actually build a prototype and inspect it this way, said David Balfour, a visualization specialist with the company.Virtual reality allows airlines to put a virtual-reality headset on and stand up and view an entire cabin.In the virtual-reality environment, to err is actually a good thing, said Glenn Johnson, director of the design studio at Rockwell Collins.Designs fail quicker and cheaper, he said, which means improvements can come faster.This ability to create large and complex environments also makes virtual reality promising for training airfield staff members who work in hazardous environments, servicing airliners in all kinds of weather and light conditions.With RampVR, a program developed by the I.A.T.A., students wear goggles and identify problems as they virtually inspect an airplane and the ramp area around it.Experiential training sticks in the mind, according to Frederic Leger, airport passenger cargo and security product director for the association.You are living the training because you are active in the training, Mr. Leger said.Its like a game where you have a score at the end, so it goes to the emotional part of your brain.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Considering that airline pilots do recurrent training in a simulator on a regular basis, bringing a simulated setting to other areas of the industry is not a new concept.It is only recently, however, that the improved quality and lower cost of virtual reality have made its widespread use practical.With all the showy advantages of virtual reality, some airlines are trying to turn the wow into revenue.At a pop-up cafe in London earlier this month, Air Canada invited visitors to watch a Boeing 787 Dreamliner flight in virtual reality.The German airline Lufthansa prepared a 360 video of the interior of its long-haul aircraft, and its employees presented viewing goggles to ticketed passengers waiting at boarding gates in Newark and Frankfurt last year.After watching the show, Lufthansa, asked if they wanted to purchase an upgrade to a premium economy seat.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.How can you communicate a travel product?This is the problem in the industry, said Torsten Wingenter, Lufthansas senior director of digital innovations.Virtual reality gave the company the first chance to show the product in an emotional way.After the test, the emotion at the airline can be described as happy.A number of economy passengers paid $299 more to fly in premium economy after viewing the cabin in virtual reality.Mr. Wingenter would not say how many, but that it was a significant number.Biometric Boarding In December, Lufthansa passengers flying out of Los Angeles will be able to use what JetBlue customers in Boston are already using boarding gates that let passengers onto the airplane with no paper ticket or electronic boarding pass, just a face that matches their passport photo.On two JetBlue routes, from Boston to Aruba and the Dominican Republic, passengers stand in front of a camera that takes their picture and compares it to the travelers image in the passport database of Customs and Border Protection.Were seeing about three seconds for the photograph to be taken, transmitted and a positive response back, said Joanna Geraghty, JetBlues executive vice president of customer experience.Facial recognition will be expanded.Ms. Geraghty said this was the beginning of a new era for travelers.You can go into an airport and you wont need to show a boarding card, you wont need to pull out a passport, she said.There will be no bag tag, no lines, you almost walk right onto an aircraft.Thats the world I look forward to.Photo Intelligent Machines Ms. Geraghty is like many aviation technology specialists who look at developments in other industries and think about how they could improve air travel.Advertisement Continue reading the main story In a workshop in Geneva, SITA has several robots that travel to industry conferences around the world to start conversations about how autonomous vehicles might be used in aviation.One robot, named Kate, is a self-directed check-in kiosk that moves to areas of congestion as needed.The other robot, Leo, takes bags from passengers and deposits them where they need to be to get routed to the proper destination.Whether Kate or Leo end up at your local airport is not the point, said Mr. Peters, SITAs technology chief.The robots are also demonstrators to get people talking about what is the future of autonomous vehicles in the airport, Mr. Peters said.But for all that technology has to offer, one of the most important tests is how well the next new gadget plays with people.Some things can be prototyped and some things cant, he said.Some things you have to have a physical interaction with to figure out what works.
On Airplanes, Considering Fighting Cameras With Cameras:::::Why should it just be that the passenger is the one who is recording everything on their cellphone and editing it the way they see fit?he said.The crew has no way of documenting what they went through to get to the very explosive situation.Mr. McBride envisions a not-too-distant-future in which a flight attendant wearing a camera would notify a passenger and start the recording.Encrypted audio and video would then be uploaded to a secure cloud-based server.The employee cannot view or alter the recording, he said.Still, it is a far cry from the days when airlines competed based on how much they coddled their customers.American Airlines, which was featured in a YouTube video of a mother and flight attendant arguing over a stroller in April, has no plans to use body cameras.There, the message to employees is to de-escalate conflicts.A memo the airlines chief executive sent to employees after the stroller incident told them to take a moment to breathe, and ask for help.A service interruption we can handle, but it is much harder to explain viral video content that is inconsistent with the first-class service you all have made American known for.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Videos of confrontations between airline workers and passengers have occasionally resulted in financial settlements, as when United pulled David Dao, a Louisville, Ky., physician, off an airplane so they could use his seat for an airline employee.(United says it is not considering equipping its crews with body cameras.)But the case has encouraged other air travelers to threaten staff members with their cellphones.People are putting their phone up, saying, You better book me on the next flight.Theyre trained to intimidate our crew members using their phone, said Ross Feinstein, a spokesman for American.At the Association of Professional Flight Attendants, a union that represents nearly 27,000 workers at American Airlines, the national president, Bob Ross, said airlines needed to protect the privacy and security of flight attendants by enforcing policies limiting what passengers can photograph.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Im asking flight attendants to take their full names off their uniforms, Mr. Ross said, adding that the union would ask the airline to provide name tags with just a first name or a name of the flight attendants choosing.Passengers are putting their names on social media and private-messaging them and harassing them over the fact that they lost their luggage or a flight was delayed, he said.These are real threats that have just gone out of proportion over the past year, and how do you stop it?Flight attendants at American and elsewhere are threatening to make their own videos to level the field.We have had the topic come up after the Dr. Dao event, said Taylor Garland of the Association of Flight Attendants, which represents workers at 19 airlines.There is much to consider on the issue, she said in an email statement later.Any change to conditions in the cabin requires careful consideration.While airlines and passengers embrace the opportunities presented in the digital era, the elevation of the camera wars makes it clear that new technology can have unanticipated consequences that will be difficult to address.
Floating Cities, No Longer Science Fiction, Begin to Take Shape:::::Earlier this year, the government of French Polynesia agreed to let the Seasteading Institute begin testing in its waters.Construction could begin soon, and the first floating buildings the nucleus of a city might be inhabitable in just a few years.If you could have a floating city, it would essentially be a start-up country, said Joe Quirk, president of the Seasteading Institute.We can create a huge diversity of governments for a huge diversity of people.The term seasteading has been around since at least 1981, when the avid sailor Ken Neumeyer wrote a book, Sailing the Farm, that discussed living sustainably aboard a sailboat.Two decades later, the idea attracted the attention of Patri Friedman, the grandson of the economist Milton Friedman, who seized on the notion.Mr. Friedman, a freethinker who had founded intentional communities while in college, was living in Silicon Valley at the time and was inspired to think big.So in 2008 he quit his job at Google and co-founded the Seasteading Institute with seed funding from Peter Thiel, the libertarian billionaire.In a 2009 essay, Mr. Thiel described seasteading as a long shot, but one worth taking.Between cyberspace and outer space lies the possibility of settling the oceans, he wrote.The investment from Mr. Thiel generated a flurry of media attention, but for several years after its founding, the Seasteading Institute did not amount to much.A prototype planned for San Francisco Bay in 2010 never materialized, and seasteading became a punch line to jokes about the techno-utopian fantasies gone awry, even becoming a plotline in the HBO series Silicon Valley.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.But over the years, the core idea behind seasteading that a floating city in international waters might give people a chance to redesign society and government steadily attracted more adherents.In 2011, Mr. Quirk, an author, was at Burning Man when he first heard about seasteading.He was intrigued by the idea and spent the next year learning about the concept.For Mr. Quirk, Burning Man, where innovators gather, was not just his introduction to seasteading.It was a model for the kind of society that seasteading might enable.Anyone who goes to Burning Man multiple times become fascinated by the way that rules dont observe their usual parameters, he said.The next year, he was back at Burning Man speaking about seasteading in a geodesic dome.Soon after that, he became involved with the Seasteading Institute, took over as president and, with Mr. Friedman, wrote Seasteading: How Floating Nations Will Restore The Environment, Enrich The Poor, Cure The Sick and Liberate Humanity From Politicians.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Seasteading is more than a fanciful hobby to Mr. Quirk and others involved in the effort.It is, in their minds, an opportunity to rewrite the rules that govern society.Governments just dont get better, Mr. Quirk said.Theyre stuck in previous centuries.Thats because land incentivizes a violent monopoly to control it.No land, no more conflict, the thinking goes.Even if the Seasteading Institute is able to start a handful of sustainable structures, theres no guarantee that a utopian community will flourish.People fight about much more than land, of course, and pirates have emerged as a menace in certain regions.And though maritime law suggests that seasteading may have a sound legal basis, it is impossible to know how real governments might respond to new neighbors floating offshore.Mr. Quirk and his team are focusing on their Floating Island Project in French Polynesia.The government is creating what is effectively a special economic zone for the Seasteading Institute to experiment in and has offered 100 acres of beachfront where the group can operate.Mr. Quirk and his collaborators created a new company, Blue Frontiers, which will build and operate the floating islands in French Polynesia.The goal is to build about a dozen structures by 2020, including homes, hotels, offices and restaurants, at a cost of about $60 million.To fund the construction, the team is working on an initial coin offering.If all goes as planned, the structures will feature living roofs, use local wood, bamboo and coconut fiber, and recycled metal and plastic.I want to see floating cities by 2050, thousands of them hopefully, each of them offering different ways of governance, Mr. Quirk said.The more people moving among them, the more choices well have and the more likely it is we can have peace prosperity and innovation.
The Death Knell for the Bricks-and-Mortar Store? Not Yet:::::There was a time six or seven years ago when there was only talk of pure play e-commerce, said Stephanie Phair, the chief strategy officer of Farfetch, the marketplace and retail platform that helps brands do business online.What weve seen from a millennial consumer behavior point of view is customers really want that joined-up online and offline experience.What that means is a renovation of the old bricks-and-mortar ideal.Instead of the arms race for the biggest location on the most desirable street, a new model focused on multifunctional, integrated stores is gaining currency: less storehouses of product than event spaces, classrooms, community centers, showrooms or studios.In the case of Oscar de la Renta, the two-story Marignan space will serve as not only the brands retail home in Paris, but also the showroom for its four annual wholesale presentations.Jeang Kim, an interior designer and sister of Laura Kim, the brands co-creative director, is designing it as a modular space: Displays can be cleared for customer-entertaining events and dinners, like the brand has begun to hold in New York following its runway shows, and a tailoring studio will allow customers to have fittings and alterations done on site.But while the physical stores continue to drive business, Oscar de la Renta has been finding new customers outside of its usual channels.Since joining Farfetch earlier this year to expand its e-commerce, often by way of the sites personal shoppers, the company has seen sales in the range of $200,000 a month, mostly from new customers.Two hundred thousand dollars, seemingly out of thin air, Mr. Bolen said.The brands stores now are inviting those personal shoppers to visit, to learn more about the collections.And they, in turn, may take their clients to the physical shops.Photo The model for success, as Mr. Bolen sees it, is a combination of on- and off-line.We think bricks and mortar is going to be a critical part of it, but a very different part than its been in the past, Mr. Bolen said.Bricks-and-mortar stores those arent necessarily advantages any more.Especially in second-tier markets, he added, stores might be a real millstone.Where brands affiliated with major luxury groups, like LVMH Mot Hennessy Louis Vuitton and Kering, once had a clear competitive advantage in negotiating for real estate, given their ability to leverage entire portfolios of brands, smaller companies like Oscar de la Renta and the upstart London-based evening wear label Galvan are finding the playing field leveled by the rise of the smaller shop.Advertisement Continue reading the main story I was with these very big brands that sell tens of thousands of units a week and have flagship stores, said Paul ORegan, the chief executive of Galvan, who previously was an executive at the Gucci Group (now Kering) and Burberry.Everyones closing stores around us and the fashion models changing.Galvan just opened its first store, combining its work space and showroom with shopping for walk-in customers and by appointment.And its location in the Notting Hill area of London ensures lower overhead than on a luxury retail strip like Mount Street, a few miles east.Not only will the store have the current seasons options but customers also may order from the next seasons collection and browse past collections to have pieces revived in custom colors, working with personal shoppers or, in some cases, the founders themselves.Appointments also may be made at a clients home or office.We wanted to throw away all of those preconceptions and say: What would be the dream scenario for a woman buying a dress?Mr. ORegan said.Robert Burke, whose New York-based company has consulted on retail strategies for industry players including Ralph Lauren, Chlo and Bulgari, has seen such thinking emerge in recent years.Even the larger retailers, he said, are looking at just how many flagships or large stores they really need.That format worked for decades and decades.With the growth of online, it doesnt seem to be working.Bigger isnt better, necessarily.More focused is better, I think.And more intimate and more personal.Newsletter Sign Up

store.Technically speaking, the store-as-home or hub is nothing new.Harry Gordon Selfridge, the founder of Selfridges in London, once decreed that a store should be a social center, and put an ice rink and a shooting range in his.But after several years of chilly, gallery-like shop design, a homey feeling is again becoming dominant.MatchesFashion.com, the London-based retailer, began as a single bricks-and-mortar store in Wimbledon Village (called simply Matches).But while business from its (now three) stores has been dwarfed by its global e-commerce, as its rechristening as MatchesFashion.com suggests, the company is continuing to invest in new stores.After a year of testing smaller, homier stores as part of a pop-up program called In Residence, it is scheduled to open a new permanent space (the company prefers not to call it a store) at No.5 Carlos Place in Mayfair in the spring.The space will have two floors of retail as well as floors for private shopping, but equally important will be the floor that is to house the companys broadcasting and content hub.Classes, panel discussions and events will be held there, all of which will be streamed on Facebook Live and YouTube, its social channels and its website.And all of it will be digitally shoppable.Photo Thats the beauty of what were doing, said Ulric Jerome, the companys chief executive.You dont have to create an enormous department store to have a reach that is 10 or 100 times bigger than that department store.The reach is way bigger than the physical space.But the physical space enables you to produce amazing content.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The Carlos Place store will have fewer choices than the full MatchesFashion.com range; it will be the curation of the curation, and well change the product quite often, Mr. Jerome said.But iPads will allow browsing in-store, and all products will be available within 90 minutes for delivery within metropolitan London.But at the companys existing stores, 40 percent of the sales already are done via iPad.It reflects the reality that, for Matches, the online dwarfs the physical in every way: 95 percent of Matches business is online, Mr. Jerome said, and 85 percent is done outside of Britain.Mr. Jerome has confidence in the hybrid online/offline model, with smaller physical and larger digital space.We tested it, Mr. Jerome said.Now we are investing in it.We think its part of the future of the way we see retail.And he added that Apax Partners, which in September announced an agreement to take a majority stake in the company one that values it at about $1 billion is fully supportive.Even those brands born online are stepping into the physical world.The RealReal, the online luxury consignment giant it receives 8,000 to 10,000 consignment items per day, according to Julie Wainwright, its founder and chief executive has spent a year testing pop-ups.And this month it is setting up a permanent retail space on Wooster Street in New York City.Ms. Wainwright is envisioning the space as community center as much as shop: RealReals staff of experts, from watch gurus to fashion historians, will offer clinics and classes and offer appraisals, and the store will include a coffee bar and flower shop.It will also, lest one forget, have a curated selection of the websites clothes, shoes, accessories, jewelry and more: a fraction of the online offering, but a selection tailored to New York consumers.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The RealReals pop-up experiment last December in New York revealed a particular synergy between on- and off-line shopping, and a customer base ready and willing to combine the two, Ms. Wainwright said.And, she added, the average purchase at the pop-up was larger than the average one online.If you walk into the store, everything you see will also be online, and anything you see online you can see in-store, she said.What we saw when we ran the pop-up, some people went in, saw the item, thought about it, ordered it online that night and picked it up in the store that next morning.Such synergy is what drives Ms. Wainwright, and others like her, toward their new approach.While the death knell for the bricks-and-mortar store has been premature, the online experience is never far away.There are going to be iPads everywhere, Ms. Wainwright said.

Trump Health Agency Challenges Consensus on Reducing Costs:::::Advertisement Trump Health Agency Challenges Consensus on Reducing Costs Image Dr. R. Michael Meneghini performing a partial knee replacement on a patient at Indiana University Health Methodist Hospital last year.The Trump administration is scaling back a program that changes the way Medicare pays doctors for joint replacements.Credit Ilana Panich-Linsman for The New York Times WASHINGTON For several decades, a consensus has grown that reining in the United States $3.2 trillion annual medical bill begins with changing the way doctors are paid: Instead of compensating them for every appointment, service and procedure, they should be paid based on the quality of their care.The Obama administration used the authority of the Affordable Care Act to aggressively advance this idea, but many doctors chafed at the scope and speed of its experiments to change the way Medicare pays for everything from primary care to cancer treatment.Now, the Trump administration is siding with doctors making a series of regulatory changes that slow or shrink some of these initiatives and let many doctors delay adopting the new system.The efforts to chip away at mandatory payment programs have attracted far less attention than attempts by President Trump and congressional Republicans to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, but they have the potential to affect far more people, because private insurers tend to follow what Medicare does.That in turn affects the countrys ability to deal with soaring health care costs that have pushed up insurance premiums and deductibles.The administration has proposed canceling or shrinking Medicare initiatives that required doctors to accept lump sums for cardiac care and joint replacements, two of Medicares biggest cost drivers.More than 1,100 hospitals were scheduled to take part in the cardiac initiative starting in January, and 800 have been participating in the joint replacement program.And while Congress passed a bipartisan law in 2015 creating a new payment framework that is supposed to reward doctors for value over volume, Mr. Trumps Department of Health and Human Services has exempted more doctors from a provision that created merit pay by giving them bonuses or penalties depending on the quality of their work.In September, the department released an outline of a new direction for the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation, set up by the Affordable Care Act to test models aimed at improving medical care and reducing costs.While the Obama administration had pushed large, mandatory experiments to test new models of pay, the Trump administration wants to encourage smaller, voluntary programs and has asked the doctors to help design them.Clearly a great big foot has been put on the brake, said Donald Crane, the chief executive of CAPG, a group of doctors and hospital administrators that, unlike many in the profession, has pushed to tie physician pay to quality measures rather than the old model of fee for service.Mr. Crane was referring specifically to the scaling back of the cardiac and joint replacement programs by Tom Price, an orthopedic surgeon and Republican former congressman chosen by Mr. Trump as secretary of health and human services.Mr. Price, who resigned in September over his use of expensive private jets , had accused the Obama administration of trying to commandeer clinical decision-making by forcing doctors to participate in experiments that test new ways of paying for care.Mr. Trump is said to be close to appointing a successor possibly Alex Azar, a former pharmaceutical company executive who worked in the Department of Health and Human Services under President George W. Bush and doctors groups will be watching carefully to see if the agency continues in the same direction.Already, other administration officials have signaled support for protecting doctors and giving them more say.The agencys Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, led by Seema Verma, has suggested it will accept more recommendations than it did in the past from a committee of doctors formed by the American Medical Association on how much Medicare should pay for services and procedures essentially letting doctors set their own pay.Ms. Vermas agency also issued the call for changing the direction of the innovation center.The formal request for information proposed, among other potential changes, allowing doctors and hospitals to contract directly with Medicare patients.This would allow doctors and other providers to propose their own prices, moving toward a long-held Republican goal of so-called premium pricing.Research has shown that the traditional model of paying doctors, known as fee for service, often results in unnecessary or inappropriate care.The federal government has been slowly moving away from it since 1983, when Medicare changed some of its payments to hospitals.But the changes now pushed by H.H.S.are a renunciation of the Obama administration in particular.It had sought to shift 30 percent of fee-for-service Medicare payments to alternative payments based on quality or value by 2016 a goal it achieved and 50 percent by 2018.To do so, it required doctors and hospitals in many regions of the country to adopt those new payment models.Canceling mandatory bundled payments for cardiac and orthopedic procedures was a pet project for Mr. Price, who had fought against what he saw as unnecessary government intervention since his days as a surgeon in the suburbs north of Atlanta.Mr. Price defended the old model in front of thousands of doctors and medical administrators gathered in June for the annual meeting of CAPG, the group pushing for new payment models, arguing that the health care system in the United States the finest, he said, in the world had developed around it.So we ought to recognize, he told the group, that fee for service may not be the end of the world.Image Seema Verma, left, the head of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, was a partner in efforts by Tom Price, right, to slow changes in the way doctors are paid.Credit Eric Thayer/Getty Images Many in the health care field criticized some of the rules issued by the Obama administration as overly prescriptive and welcomed the departments effort to review them.Many experiments that the Obama administration launched were overly micromanaged, said Grace-Marie Turner, an opponent of the health law and president of the Galen Institute, a research center that advocates free-market health policies.Innovation has to percolate up from the bottom.The Obama administration tried to drive it from the top.Even with Mr. Prices departure, the department still has numerous people who have advocated strongly for doctors and industry in the past.They include senior staff members who have worked representing medical device makers, pharmaceutical and hospital supply companies, the nursing home industry and physician specialty groups.The acting secretary of health and human services, Eric Hargan, is a former lawyer for the law and lobbying firm Greenberg Traurig who served as a deputy secretary at the agency during Mr. Bushs tenure.Miranda Franco, senior policy adviser at the law firm Holland & Knight, has closely tracked the changes.She said it appeared the administration was using the innovation center to further its priorities of more provider-friendly approaches, more voluntary models.Ms. Verma, the administrator of the centers, seemed to confirm that when she wrote in a Wall Street Journal op-ed: Providers need the freedom to design and offer new approaches to delivering care.Our goal is to increase flexibility by providing more waivers from current requirements.Last month, Ms. Verma also announced a plan to re-examine and streamline all the ways the federal government has been measuring the quality of the care doctors provide, saying in a speech , We want to move to a system that pays for value and quality but how we define value and quality today is a problem.The goal, she said, was to relieve doctors of excessive regulatory burdens and make sure payment policies are guided by those on the front lines serving patients.Gail Wilensky, the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid in the first Bush administration, said she heard many complaints from doctors who felt that during the Obama presidency the agency was not listening to any of their ideas for how to move toward payment based on quality rather than quantity.Its hard for me to believe that physicians will do any better than they would have done, having Tom Price there, Ms. Wilensky said.From their point of view, this was about as good as it was going to get.But Tim Gronniger, a deputy chief of staff at the centers during the Obama administration, argued that there was little demand from hospitals or physicians to cancel the bundled payments, or to delay the merit-based payments.In fact, many doctors are still subject to the rules of the merit-based system, which passed with bipartisan support in Congress in 2015.And other value-based programs are continuing.Theyve confused people, said Mr. Gronniger, now a senior vice president at Caravan Health, which helps health care providers shift to value-based payment models.The risk that H.H.S.and Tom Price created is that some physicians incorrectly read the press release or hear from their colleagues that Medicare is canceling value-based purchasing and think all of thats over.Physicians and hospitals need to be engaged in this work, he added, and exempting them doesnt do them any favors.Although little has changed since Mr. Prices departure, there are signs that the agency is still trying to figure out the best way to proceed, said Michael Chernew, an economist at Harvard Medical School who supports moving away from fee for service.Mr. Chernew said he was cautiously hopeful about H.H.S.continuing to promote alternative payment models, pointing out that Medicare rates under fee for service will remain flat over the next decade anyway under the payment law that Congress passed in 2015.My general sense, and Ive met with them, is that they genuinely want to try to have a better set of payment models, Mr. Chernew said of Ms. Verma and those working for her at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.They dont just want to try to blow everything up.He added, If you take all the politics out of it, the right thing for them to do is move ahead.Robert Pear contributed reporting.Order Reprints | Todays Paper | Subscribe A version of this article appears in print on , on Page A 1 of the New York edition with the

Can You Draw the Starbucks Logo Without Cheating? Probably Not.:::::Logos are what companies use to help customers identify the brand, and choices like design, color and font are critical, Mr. James said.Having these logos where you cant correctly recall details means something.In an age of digital saturation, perhaps many of these carefully constructed logos are not as memorable as we think.A study conducted in 2014 by psychologists at the University of California, Los Angeles similarly asked 85 participants if they could draw the familiar Apple logo from memory.More than half the subjects even identified themselves as strictly Apple users.Yet only one could draw the icon perfectly, as scored by a 14-point rubric.Should Apple be worried?Not necessarily.Dr. Alan Castel, a psychology professor who was one of the authors of the study, said that the inability to accurately recall such daily ephemera as a brand logo really might be a beneficial quirk of our memory system.We dont burden our memory with things we dont need to know, Dr. Castel said.He referred to a famous study in 1979 by the psychologists Raymond Nickerson and Marilyn Jager Adams, in which participants were asked to draw the face of a penny.Most struggled.Its rare that you really need to recall something from memory, Dr. Castel said.You simply recognize it, you see it on an item or a computer.You like it, you buy it.Still, in recent years, brands like Uber, YouTube, and Dropbox have redesigned their logos, trying to make them more simple, more intuitive or more easily recognizable.In 2014, Airbnb announced its new logo, which it calls the Blo, in a video that noted that the design was easy for customers to draw.Photo Paul Stafford, co-founder of DesignStudio, the agency that led the rebranding effort, said that Airbnb envisioned people renting out their homes and putting their own spin on the Blo on everything from magazines to bathrobes and shampoo bottles, like a hotel.Advertisement Continue reading the main story We had to create something that was so simple that everybody could draw it and interpret it themselves, Mr. Stafford said.They also wanted people to be sharing it.Right down to the people tattooing the mark on their arms.Mr. Stafford, however, said that he did not think that being able to draw a logo necessarily indicates how well it resonates.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.People often see logos so much that they feel like they know it.But they rarely critique it or study it enough to reproduce fine details a phenomenon that psychologists like Dr. Castel call inattentional amnesia.When something is seen frequently, the information ends up being more easily ignored or forgotten.For instance, Dr. Castel said he would be curious how accurately people could recall the fine details of a stop sign.We know its red, but the more subtle features the exact shape of it, whether theres a white border around it these are things we often miss, even though weve seen it millions of times, he said.Perhaps the most surprising result of the Signs.com study was the company that fared best: Ikea.The Swedish furniture maker with the distinctive blue-and-yellow logo plastered across its giant retail stores was redrawn near-perfectly by 30 percent of the participants.Asa Nordin, who is a senior coordinator of Ikea trademarks at Inter Ikea Systems, said the unique shape, colors, and longevity of the logo it has been around since 1983 most likely contributed to its memorability.The logo is merely the symbol for what the Ikea brand promises and delivers, Ms. Nordin said in an email.The logo shall mirror that promise as near as possible, as well as stand out from its surroundings.To be consistent and unique is clearly a strength of a logo.The hardest logo to draw was Starbucks, which was redesigned in 2011.It is also arguably the most complex.Simplicity is key, Mr. James said.Thats not necessarily a new concept.But this definitely corroborates that idea.But is any logo overwhelmingly memorable?Mr. James is now curious.Initially, he resisted putting an overly straightforward and ubiquitous symbol in his study, like those of McDonalds or Nike.Advertisement Continue reading the main story We thought it was too simple, Mr. James said.But, I wonder.
‘Daddy’s Home 2’ and ‘Orient Express’ Turn Out Older Crowds:::::Photo LOS ANGELES Score two for old-fashioned star power.A pair of new wide-release movies, Daddys Home 2 and Murder on the Orient Express, both of which rely on starry ensembles, arrived to stronger-than-expected ticket sales in North American theaters over the weekend.Although neither could topple Thor: Ragnarok, which remained No.1 for a second week, the sturdy results for Daddys Home 2 and Murder on the Orient Express gave Hollywood hope that its formulas may not be as broken as many had started to believe.Thor: Ragnarok (Walt Disney Studios) collected an estimated $56.6 million, for a two-week domestic total of $211.6 million, according to comScore, which compiles box office data.Disney said the Marvel-branded superhero movie has now taken in $650.1 million worldwide.Second place went to Daddys Home 2, which took in about $30 million, or roughly 20 percent more than analysts had expected before release.On the downside, the PG-13 comedy was expensive, costing about $70 million to produce.Daddys Home 2, starring Mark Wahlberg, Mel Gibson, Will Ferrell and John Lithgow, received poor reviews but clicked with audiences, who gave it an A-minus grade in CinemaScore exit polls.More than 50 percent of the audience was over age 35.Photo Even so, it will take much more than one box office win to stabilize Paramount, which has suffered a string of misfires, including Suburbicon, Mother!, Monster Trucks and Baywatch.Last week, the studio, which ranks last among Hollywoods major studios in domestic market share, parted ways with its marketing and distribution chief.Advertisement Continue reading the main story A glossy remake of Murder on the Orient Express (20th Century Fox) was third, with ticket sales of about $28.2 million, or 30 percent more than analysts had expected.Murder on the Orient Express, starring and directed by Kenneth Branagh, who was joined on screen by Judi Dench, Johnny Depp, Penlope Cruz, Daisy Ridley and others, received mixed reviews and a B grade in CinemaScore exit polls.Fox said that 35 percent of the audience was over 35.
Fashion’s Interest in Alternative Fabrics Keeps Growing:::::And that is before the work of private and public scientific research institutions are taken into account.Silk produced in a laboratory, for example, would not exist without the breakthroughs of the last 30 years that have enabled scientists to perfect ways to edit and replicate the DNA of living organisms.Photo After studying spiders DNA and their webs, Bolt Threads engineers developed similar proteins that are injected into yeast and sugar and then subjected to a proprietary fermentation process.The resulting liquid silk is turned into a fiber through a wet-spinning process that creates strands that then can be knitted into fabric.Rivals, which are using similar technology but different production methods, have not produced marketable products yet either.The Japanese company Spiber has an agreement with the North Face, the American activewear company (in 2016, they developed a Moon Parka prototype).And AMSilk, a German company, has partnered with Adidas on products that they will not identify but say are expected to go on sale next year.Adidas, however, s producing sneakers made with plastics recovered from beaches and oceanfront communities, part of a product line developed through its partnership with the activist anti-plastic group Parley for the Oceans.(Ms. McCartney, an Adidas collaborator, provided some of the designs.)Recycled fruit waste is another promising substance for the creation of alternative fabrics.The Italian company Orange Fiber provided the material for Ferragamos capsule scarf collection.Ananas Anam, based at the Royal College of Art in London, uses pineapple leaf fibers to create a nonwoven leatherlike material called Piatex and brands like Edun, the sustainable fashion label owned by LVMH Mot Hennessy Louis Vuitton, are creating items from it.And mycelium, the rootlike fiber of mushrooms, is being processed as a leather substitute by MycoWorks, a San Francisco start-up.But some specialists say the material, which looks like suede, needs to be tested for durability.Advertisement Continue reading the main story In addition to bio-fabricated materials, the Stella McCartney brand and its founding partner, the luxury group Kering, are investing in ways to recycle fashion items and use fewer resources, such as water.Ms. McCartneys Falabella Go bags are made of recycled polyester and Econyl, a nylon produced from recycled fishing nets, carpets and other such waste, manufactured by the Italian company Aquafil.In recent years, several venture capital firms have supported the development of alternative fabrics, especially when biofuels, including corn and algae, failed to live up to their initial promise.One of the latest and most high-profile investors is the Russian entrepreneur Miroslava Duma, founder of the fashion and lifestyle website Buro 24/7.Photo In May, Ms. Duma introduced Fashion Tech Lab, a venture that funds and develops new technologies in sustainable fashion and wearable technologies.It has $50 million in funding and the advisory services of Carmen Busquets, the e-commerce investor, and Diane von Furstenberg.Orange Fiber and Vitro Labs, a company that is developing lab-grown variations of fur and leather from stem cells, were among the organizations initial beneficiaries.Suzanne Lee, who has almost 20 years of experience in fashion technology, said, It feels like there has not been as much innovation in terms of new materials as in the past five years, with sustainability being the main driver.She is now chief creative officer at Modern Meadow, a New Jersey-based company that specializes in laboratory-grown bio-fabricated leather materials.Ms. Lee said that, just as shortages after World War II drove the development of fossil fuel-based materials like Lycra and polyester, the prospect of limits on natural fibers and leather are pushing the fashion industry to find alternatives.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Modern Meadow has developed a yeast that, when mixed with sugar, produces a collagen that then is purified, processed and tanned to create material with a look and feel similar to that of leather.The company said that it was planning to unveil its first commercial product next year and that it had partnered with one major luxury player, which it declined to reveal now.But, reflecting its luxury ambitions, the company has retained the advisory services of three fashion veterans: Mimma Viglezio, formerly the executive vice president of global communications at Gucci Group;

As U.S. Sheds Role as Climate Change Leader, Who Will Fill the Void?:::::Many political analysts say China has indeed moved dramatically on climate change, both to meet its own pledge under the Paris accord to cap carbon emissions by 2030, and to start the worlds largest carbon market and swiftly expand the use of electric cars.In recent months, China has hosted ministerial-level meetings on clean energy and joined Canada and the European Union to lead discussions on climate.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Interested in Climate Change?Sign up to receive our in-depth journalism about climate change around the world.Robert N. Stavins, the director of the environmental economics program at Harvard University who was in China recently to discuss climate change, said he had seen a dramatic shift in tenor among Chinese officials.Having been engaged very, very closely on climate change with the Obama administration as a co-leader, China appears quite content to move from co-leadership to sole leadership, he said.Yet skepticism abounds.While the country is ahead of its Paris target, China still burns more coal than any other country.It also remains to be seen how eager the country will be to allow greater transparency of its own carbon reduction efforts, and many fear it will revert to old demands that it and other developing countries be treated with softer rules.Photo 2.Justin Trudeau For many years Canada was considered a laggard on climate change, leaving the Kyoto Protocol and rarely making an impression at United Nations negotiations.That all changed with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who cozied up to panda bears and declared Canada is back at the Paris global warming talks in 2015.Mr. Trudeau said he was deeply disappointed in the United States decision to withdraw from the Paris deal, declaring Canada is unwavering in our commitment to fight climate change.Since then, he has made good on much of that goal doubling his countrys contribution to the United Nations science body and sliding into Americas place in some international arenas.In September, for example, Canada hosted a meeting of the worlds largest economies to discuss climate change.American officials in the George W. Bush administration had created that gathering, originally known as the Major Economies Forum, and it continued under Mr. Obama.The Trump administration essentially abandoned it this year.Advertisement Continue reading the main story If the U.S. is going to step back, were going to step up, Canadas environment minister, Catherine McKenna, said.But the country is still struggling to deliver meaningful climate change policy at home, and Mr. Trudeau in recent months has approved bitumen pipelines and liquid natural gas projects.Activists in Canada say if Mr. Trudeau wants to be a true leader, hell have to reject new fossil fuel infrastructure something that will be a steep and perhaps unmeetable challenge.Photo 3.State and local U.S. leaders Perhaps no group has made a bigger splash on the world stage this year than the coalition of United States governors, mayors and businesses who call themselves the We Are Still In coalition.Informally led by Gov.Jerry Brown of California; Michael Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York, and Gov.Jay Inslee of Washington, the group has vowed to uphold the Paris agreement and move ahead with policies to fight climate change.When the Trump administration opted not to have a United States pavilion at the Bonn climate talks to highlight American efforts on climate change, Mr. Bloomberg and others agreed to pay for it.Now the American pavilion is hosting a sort of shadow delegation of local leaders who say they are representing a different face of government.I feel very strongly America should be represented there, Mr. Bloomberg said.Yet without participation from more states, particularly those that are fossil-fuel heavy, the United States as a whole will still fall short of the Paris pledge, several analyses have found.Photo 4.Angela Merkel & Emmanuel Macron The Obama administration gets a lot of credit for helping to forge the Paris Agreement, but in reality it was Europe that insisted on the accord in the first place.Since Mr. Trumps withdrawal announcement, European leaders have lost no chance to reassert themselves as the guardians of global climate change ambition.Mr. Macron in particular has continued to champion the agreement hammered out in his nations capital.He has invited American scientists who work on climate change to move to France, and pressed Mr. Trump several times to remain in the deal.In December, France will host a celebration of the Paris Agreement, to which the United States has not yet been invited.Ms. Merkel put climate change at the center of a Group of 20 summit of the worlds largest economies in Hamburg, Germany, this year.Its not clear how much those leaders efforts will shift United States policy.As Frank V. Maisano, a partner at the law firm Bracewell who represents energy clients, said recently, Trumps supporters dont care that Macron is yelling at him.They like that.Photo 5.Antnio Gutteres, U.N. secretary general Mr. Gutteres stepped into his new role in January, and those who work with him say the former prime minister of Portugal jumped in with both feet.Mr. Guterres made sure climate change was highlighted during the United Nations General Assembly, meeting with former Vice President Al Gore and Governor Brown of California to discuss ways the United Nations can promote solutions.He also opened a special session to discuss climate change and its impact on small islands after several devastating hurricanes battered the Caribbean.Robert C. Orr, the dean of the University of Marylands School of Public Policy and a special adviser to Mr. Guterres on climate change, said the United Nations leader was putting his own stamp on climate change by hosting a major summit at United Nations headquarters in New York in 2018.
Radhika Jones, a Times Books Editor, Said to Be Next Vanity Fair Editor:::::Photo In a dramatic changing of the guard, Radhika Jones, the editorial director of the books department at The New York Times and a former top editor at Time magazine, is expected to be named the next editor of Vanity Fair, according to two people with knowledge of the decision.Cond Nast, which publishes Vanity Fair, plans to make the announcement as soon as Monday.Ms. Jones, 44, will succeed the 68-year-old Graydon Carter, who said in September that he was stepping down from the glossy general-interest magazine after a 25-year run at its helm.A spokeswoman for Cond Nast declined to comment.The Times also declined to comment.In anointing Ms. Jones, who holds degrees from Harvard College and Columbia University, Vanity Fair has placed its future in the hands of a woman the first since Tina Brown served as the magazines editor from 1984 until 1992 who has cultivated the kind of sophistication and prestige that Cond Nast has long valued.Mr. Carters announcement two months ago set off a race to inherit his throne and ignited speculation across the media industry.In a magazine business that has lost much of its luster in recent years, Vanity Fair has largely retained its glow, and its editorship remains one of the most coveted in the business.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Robert Sauerberg, the chief executive of Cond Nast, and Anna Wintour, the editor-in-chief of Vogue and Cond Nasts artistic director, oversaw the search.David Remnick, the editor of The New Yorker, also played a significant role in selecting Mr. Carters successor.Mr. Carter was not involved in the decision-making process.Photo With the selection of Ms. Jones, Cond Nast has made clear that it still respects print, even as it looks to a digital future less tied to its magazines.Before joining the books desk at The Times last year, Ms. Jones was deputy managing editor at Time magazine, where she oversaw the Time 100 issue.At the Paris Review, the literary magazine known for its Writers at Work interviews, she was a managing editor.She has also worked at Grand Street, Artforum and The Moscow Times.
First operational MQ-4C Triton drone delivered to U.S. Navy:::::Nov. 13 (UPI) -- Northrop Grumman delivered the first operational MQ-4C Trition aircraft to the U.S. Navy facility at Point Mugu, the company said in a press statement on Friday.Northrop Grumman in April received $19.9 million for engineering and analysis of obsolescence issues with the MQ-4C Triton unmanned aerial vehicle.In May, the company received an additional $49.4 million contract for parts, material and labor required for the maintenance of the MQ-4C unmanned aircraft system in accordance with planned production."This aircraft represents the beginning of a new era for Naval aviation," said Doug Shaffer, vice president, Triton programs, Northrop Grumman."Triton is a high-altitude, long-endurance unmanned system that delivers a critical autonomous capability to the Navy, expanding the service's maritime patrol mission.We are proud to be a part of this historic program."The MQ-4C Triton is a derivative of the RQ-4 Global Hawk surveillance UAV and is designed as a sensor platform for long-range and high-endurance surveillance missions over ocean and coastal areas.It has a range of over 9,000 miles and can stay aloft for over 24 hours before refueling.The Triton mounts maritime radar, electro-optical and infrared cameras, communications relays and electronic support measures systems.Once operational, it will serve alongside the P-8 Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft as the Navy's primary long-range aerial intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance platform.The Navy plans to purchase 68 Tritons as part of its UAV fleet.Northrop Grumman said they will deliver the second operational Triton aircraft later this year.
Leonardo tapped by British Royal Air Force for radar testing equipment:::::Nov. 13 (UPI) -- Leonardo over the weekend announced a contract with the British Ministry of Defense for equipment that will simulate radar threats to the Royal Air Force's Airbus A400M Atlas military transport aircraft.The deal, announced Saturday, calls for the company to simulate radar threats to the A400M prior to take off.The Royal Air Force plans to use the system to test radar the defense aids suite on the A400M, making sure it will operate properly during flight and help determine whether to engage in missions to hostile territory.The equipment uses radio-frequency hoods to cover the aircraft's sensors, allowing simulations to stimulate them and test their operation.The RAF will receive one of the systems, with future orders expected as the size of the air force's fleet grows.The Ministry of Defense will also purchase Leonardo's handheld threat simulator, which will allow crews to conduct more thorough pre-flight checks before taking off in a hostile environment.
Oil price response to OPEC report on demand muted:::::Nov. 13 (UPI) -- Crude oil prices were trading flat to slightly lower early Monday as traders looked to OPEC for signs of emerging trends, but held out for U.S. oil projections.The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries said Monday it expected demand for its oil will accelerate next year on the back of stronger global economic momentum.Demand next year will outpace OPEC production from the third quarter, suggesting a multilateral effort to balance the market is working.OPEC in its monthly market report for November said its "landmark" decision to trim the surplus on the five-year average for crude oil inventories was a necessary move to counter the glut that last year pushed oil prices below $30 per barrel."These distinguished efforts focused on accelerating the drawdown of the global stock overhang in order to hasten the return of sustainable oil market stability," it said.OPEC economists said production from its member states declined by about 151,000 barrels per day last month, while oil inventories in the world's major economies shrank.Next year, production from non-member states is also expected to decline, adding support to the balancing effort.Oil prices were, however, mixed at the open.The price for Brent crude oil was more or less flat at $63.49 per barrel by the opening bell in New York.West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark for the price of oil, was up 0.3 percent to $56.94 per barrel.Ole Hanson, the head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank, said OPEC expects the world will need more of its oil next year, but that's largely because of what it expects from producers outside the group."Basically OPEC's bullish outlook is based on a too pessimistic outlook for non-OPEC supply growth, in my honest opinion," he said.Markets may react later in the day when the U.S. Energy Information Administration releases its monthly drilling productivity report, which gives indications on the future potential from the largest shale oil basins in the United States.Strong gains could spoil any rally that emerges once traders comb through OPEC's 100-page market report.Prices turned lower last week when drilling services company Baker Hughes reported gains in the U.S. rig count, which points to future potential in the exploration and production side of the industry.
Fitch Ratings: Oil, gas tanker market to see modest gains:::::Nov. 13 (UPI) -- Global demand acceleration and more oil shipments could mean a pick up next year for the tanker industry, though headwinds remain, Fitch Ratings said.Fitch Ratings said Monday new deliveries of oil tankers, and the dismantling of older ones, meant the tanker market, just like the broader oil market, will be over-supplied for the time being.The capacity of new vessels by the end of the year will be about 6 percent higher than in 2016."We expect rising global oil consumption, higher U.S. exports and gradually moderating oil inventories to drive a moderate increase in tanker demand in 2018," the report read."Demand could therefore rise by about 4 percent, potentially matching supply growth."The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is working to drain the surplus on the five-year average of global crude oil inventories through coordinated production declines.The effort to balance the market is offset somewhat by record-setting U.S. crude oil exports, backed in part by a shale sector that's been more resilient to lower crude oil prices than initially anticipated.Peter Norfolk, the editorial director for global shipping and freight at S&P Global Platts, told UPI in response to email questions the tanker market could move more or less in parallel with the broader energy market."Similar rates of tanker fleet growth and projected demand growth in 2018 would suggest that any substantial rise in vessel earnings is unlikely," he said."However, any significant changes to trade flows will remain key to market balances."Teekay Corp., with a portfolio of around 200 tanker units, is one of the largest companies of its kind in the world.The vessel company posted third quarter revenue of around $500 million this year, about 3 percent lower than the same period last year.Driven in part by emerging demand for vessels for liquefied natural gas, Teekay President and CEO Kenneth Hvid said the bottom line was improving."We are starting to see green shoots of an energy recovery in our LNG, offshore and crude oil tanker businesses," he said in a statement last week.Nevertheless, Fitch said the vessel market was still facing headwinds, with contract rates at or below the current norm.That said, metrics won't repeat the slump from the last two years, when oil prices were at historic lows.Fitch said that those companies placing big bets with long-term contracts will be the ones turning in bigger profits, "while those with few long-term contracts are likely to break even at best."
Norway receives first three F-35s from Lockheed Martin:::::Nov. 13 (UPI) -- Lockheed Martin announced Friday that the Norwegian government has received its first three F-35A Lightning II aircrafts.In a ceremony at rland Air Base in Central Norway, military and industry leaders celebrated the arrival of the three 5th generation joint strike fighters."We mark the start of a new era for the Norwegian Armed Forces," said Norway's Minister of Defense Frank Bakke-Jensen."The new combat aircraft will be a key factor in deterring any attack on Norway, as well as ensuring that we meet our obligations to the NATO alliance.""The F-35 remains crucial to the continued modernization of our Armed Forces and our ability to preserve Norwegian and allied security and interests," he added.Lockheed officials said that Norway's three F-35A aircraft departed from it's facility in Fort Worth, Texas, Nov. 3, 2017, for rland Air Base.To date, Norway has taken delivery of 10 F-35s, seven of which are stationed at Luke Air Force Base in Arizona where pilots are training with the aircraft."Receiving the first F-35s at rland is a major milestone for Norway: it's visible proof of Norway's commitment to the F-35 Program and Norway continues to be one of the strongest partners of the F-35 enterprise," said Vice Admiral Mat Winter, F-35 Program Executive Officer.Norwegian companies have been instrumental in developing parts of the F-35.In April, the Norwegian government started testing a drogue parachute braking system for use on F-35 Lightning II aircraft ordered from the United States.The testing is currently being conducted at Eielson Air Force Base in Alaska.Testing of the system consists of two stages, with the first evaluating how an F-35 behaves in the air with a fitted drogue parachute, and the second focused on how the drogue parachute would function on dry and wet runways."The cutting-edge technologies and teamwork of our industry partners here in Norway and around the world have made the F-35 an unequaled technological force," said Marillyn Hewson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Lockheed Martin Corporation."With its range, speed, flexibility, and integrated-defense capabilities, the arrival of the F-35 in Norway will strengthen all of the Norwegian armed forces."
Some Gulf of Mexico operations shut in after fire:::::Nov. 13 (UPI) -- Operations in the Gulf of Mexico are shut down as a result of a recent fire on a platform and there's no immediate indication of a restart, Hess Corp. said.Hess is working alongside the Dutch supermajor, which said last week that two people were injured during a fire on board the Enchilada platform on the Garden Banks reservoir in the Gulf of Mexico.There were no signs that oil was on the water at the time of the incident.A spill-response vessel was mobilized to the area as a precaution.The fields in question are about 100 miles away from the nearest shoreline.Shell said two of its platforms were closed down, as was a 30-inch natural gas pipeline.Hess said Monday it was told that a repair plan was being developed, but closed down production from three of its fields as a result."Though the structure is visibly sound, crews will continue to determine the integrity of the platform and formulate a plan for damage repair," Shell said.Hess said its share of production was 30,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, adding it was working with Shell to get a better sense of when operations could resume.Shell said Sunday it was winding down emergency response operations, but was working closely with the U.S. Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement to figure out what caused the incident.The BSEE was set up in response to failures with the former federal Minerals Management Service in the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010.A measure under consideration in the U.S. House of Representatives to expand offshore drilling opportunities would recombine the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management with the BSEE.Former BOEM Director Michael Bromwich told lawmakers that proposal was "a profoundly bad idea."The U.S. waters of the Gulf of Mexico account for about 17 percent of total national oil production and 5 percent of the dry natural gas production per day.
Russian oil company eying Gulf of Mexico opportunities:::::Nov. 13 (UPI) -- Russian oil producer Lukoil said Monday it was vetting the possibility of teaming up with a Mexican company for work in the Gulf of Mexico.Vagit Alekperov, the chief executive officer at Lukoil, said he was meeting with authorities at Petrleos Mexicanos, known also as Pemex, to discuss a potential partnership for offshore oil in North America.His announcement came after Washington enacted more sanctions on Russia, though the CEO said that was irrelevant."No, [sanctions] do not affect [this]," he was quoted as saying by Russian news agency Tass.The U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control in early November amended Russian sanctions with respect to the energy sector, blocking U.S. entities from helping with companies with "the potential" to produce oil in Russian territory or shale projects anywhere in the world.The amended list makes reference to projects "initiated on or after Jan.29."Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said the sanctions are nothing new, relate mostly to foreign projects where Russian companies have more than a 35 percent interest and deal only with new projects slated for a January start date.The Kremlin said the sanctions are part of U.S. efforts to push deeper into the European energy sector.Lukoil already has a stake in licenses in the Gulf of Mexico and plans to take on more holdings with a minority share.Talos Energy, working alongside joint venture partners Sierra Oil and Gas and Premier Oil, early this year confirmed a discovery at the Zama-1 exploration well off the coast of Mexico.Initial estimates put the reserve potential at between 1.4 billion and 2 billion barrels of oil, which exceeded early expectations.The discovery followed similar claims made by Italian energy company Eni in March, which confirmed the potential for oil offshore Mexico in the first drilling campaign by a foreign company since 2013.Mexican President Enrique Pea Nieto moved through reforms to draw private investors to the state energy sector after more than 70 years of a monopoly controlled by state-run Petroleos Mexicanos, or Pemex.The reforms could bring in up to $415 billion in investments over the next 20 years as the country establishes links to the rest of the world.Mexico aims to produce around 3.5 million barrels per day by 2025.Russia's move comes as the U.S. government aims to reconfigure the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada.
Norwegian oil production halted on safety violation:::::Nov. 13 (UPI) -- Oil production from the Goliat floating platform in the Barents Sea is closed down because of regulatory violations, a safety authority in Norway said.Authorities with the Petroleum Safety Authority in Norway carried out an audit of Eni operations at the Goliat floating production storage and offloading unit in the Norwegian waters of the Barents Sea.The audit was a follow-up of a survey of requirements related to the electricity facilities, particularly the person in charge."The audit report identified further breaches of the regulations," the regulator said in a statement Production is idled until Eni satisfies concerns related to ignition-control services and other measures the PSA said could reduce the threat of ignition.There have been no reports of injury.Norway is important for the European energy sector as one of its main oil and gas exporters.The country itself is party to the broader effort to address climate change.Goliat draws its electricity from a power cable tied to the mainland, which Eni said would reduce emissions of carbon dioxide, a potent greenhouse gas, by as much as 50 percent.Eni started producing oil at the Goliat field located about 50 miles northwest of Hammerfest in northern Norway in the ice-free waters of the Barents Sea early last year.The company said development comes from the unique application of a floating cylindrical production and storage vessel, which Eni said is the largest in the world.Production from Goliat comes from 12 oil-producing wells.A peak rate of 100,000 barrels of oil per day is expected from a field estimated to hold around 180 million barrels of oil.Eni needs to present a plan of remediation by Dec. 11 and comply with the order by March 1.The company had no public statement on the PSA order.The Norwegian government has called on energy companies working in Arctic waters to observe requirements related to distance from ice sheets "so the environmental assets along the ice edge are safeguarded."
U.S. committed to Paris deal even if Trump isn't, parties say:::::Nov. 13 (UPI) -- Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg said non-federal funds were displacing the U.S. government's with the effort to address climate change."The American government may have pulled out of the Paris agreement, but the American people are committed to its goals," the former mayor said at a climate conference in Bonn, Germany, during the weekend."And there is nothing Washington can do to stop us."Bloomberg took the podium during the weekend to say it was private funds and non-federal efforts that would reflect U.S. interests in addressing the threats from climate change.Through the so-called America's Pledge, Bloomberg, Calif. Gov.Jerry Brown and U.N. delegates reported that 20 U.S. states, 110 cities and more than 1,400 businesses with U.S. operations committed trillions of dollars in market capital toward emission reductions.If they were a federal entity, the group said they would be the third largest economy in the world represented at the Bonn conference.European Union President Jean-Claude Junker this year said the bloc was setting its sights on becoming a global leader in renewable energy development as the United States signals its intention to leave the international Paris climate agreement.With Nicaragua and Syria joining recently, the United States is the only country in the world standing on the sidelines of the climate agreement.Through the pledge, the U.S. representatives at Bonn said the private and non-federal efforts could eventually do enough to meet the federal commitments under the Paris climate deal to cut emissions by as much as 28 percent of their 2005 levels by 2025."When President Trump announced his intention to withdraw from the Paris agreement, which he can't do until 2020, some people worried that it meant the end of America's climate leadership," Bloomberg said."That couldn't be farther from the truth."Donald Trump's administration started the process of withdrawing from the agreement earlier this year.A pro-oil former real estate tycoon, Trump has put fossil fuels at the center of his energy policy, advocating for solutions like so-called clean coal.Advocacy group Friends of the Earth, meanwhile, noted that the federal U.S. presence at the Bonn conference was there to promote fossil fuels over clean energy."U.S. government representatives are extolling the virtues of fossil fuels at the year's most important international climate talks," FOE policy director Karen Orenstein said in an emailed statement."This is a slap in the face to countries that are party to the Paris agreement."An October report from Fitch Ratings said gains in renewable energy had been supported by government subsidies and other incentives, though renewables are gaining parity in terms of price when weighed against traditional power sources."This suggests that renewables growth is becoming self-sustaining and that the U.S. plan to withdraw from the Paris climate accord will not affect sector growth," the report read.
Shell's divestment streak continues, shedding Woodside shares:::::Nov. 13 (UPI) -- Picking up from where it left off before stating it earnings, Royal Dutch Shell said it was taking $1.7 billion for the sale of a stake in Australia's Woodside.Shell said early Monday it sold off 64 percent of its shares in Woodside Petroleum, leaving its Australian subsidiary with a 4.8 percent interest in the liquefied natural gas player."This sale is another step towards the completion of our three-year $30 billion divestment program, which is an important part of our strategy to reshape Shell, to deliver a world class investment case, and to strengthen our financial framework," Shell's Chief Financial Officer Jessica Uhl said in a statement.For $628 million, Shell on Nov. 1 completed the sale of its entire Gabonese oil and gas interests to a company controlled by The Carlyle Group.The transaction includes the sale of all of Shell's onshore oil and gas interests, which includes nine total fields, and the associated infrastructure, including pipelines and export terminals.On the same day, the Dutch supermajor sold North Sea holdings to Chrysaor for a total of up to $3.8 billion.The sale includes Shell's 21.7 percent interest in the legacy Buzzard field and the 10 percent stake in the Schiehallion field.Shell continues to scale down and reconfigure its portfolio after merging with British energy company BG Group in 2015.BG Group had about 15 percent of the market for liquefied natural gas controlled and, though leaving Woodside, the Dutch company continues to hold a significant LNG market share in Australia, including both in the mega Gorgon LNG project and the Prelude floating LNG facility, in which it holds an operating interest.In an annual report this year, Shell said LNG demand is on pace to grow at twice the rate of conventional gas.The super-cooled LNG offers diverse options for delivery compared with piped gas, which is vulnerable to geopolitical risk.Shell reported net profit of $4.1 billion came from all of its business segments during the third quarter, though earnings came mainly from refining, higher production from new fields and improved market conditions.Uhl said Monday the sale of its stake in Woodside would go to reduce the company's debt load.Woodside had no public comment on the divestment.It reported total operating revenue to Sept. 30 was $2.8 billion, down 4 percent from the same period last year.
'Humbling' mission: Agency toils to ID 82,000 soldiers still MIA:::::Nov. 10 (UPI) -- It was the cornerstone of the Warrior Ethos in the U.S. Army -- "I will never leave a fallen comrade" -- that led U.S. Army serial number 16055052 home after 73 years.It's the "humbling mission" of the Defense Prisoner of War, Missing in Action Accounting Agency, based at Hickam Air Force Base in Hawaii.On Oct. 25, the DPAA brought home the remains of 16055052, whom the agency had identified as U.S. Army Staff Sgt.Michael Aiello, missing since World War II."You know, I tell people all the time that this is the most rewarding job I have ever had," Lee Tucker, a DPAA public affairs officer, told UPI on Friday, a day ahead of Veterans Day."It's a humbling job to be able to tell the stories of men who gave their life for our country, who paid the ultimate sacrifice."There is just story after story of what these guys did, and if you talk to the family members...who don't know what happened to their father or grandfather, their husband, cousin or brother...I don't want to say provide closure because that's a very personal thing, but to give somebody their name back, to provide a widow with the answer of what happened to their husband 50 years ago is just amazingly powerful."Aiello's mission Aiello served in the D-Day invasion of Normandy, France and the failed joint mission of British and American troops to end the war by Christmas 1944: Operation Market Garden.Aiello grew up in Sherman, Ill., and became a coal miner at age 13 after finishing the eighth grade, according to records.By the time Japan attacked Pearl Harbor in December 1941, Aiello owned a restaurant in downtown Springfield.He entered the U.S. Army in 1942.Defense Department records show Aiello was 35 when he went missing on Sept. 30, 1944, as a member of Company G, 401st Glider Infantry Regiment.That was just five days after Market Garden failed to capture strategic positions around the city of Arnhem, Netherlands, where a key bridge crossing could have led allies over Rhine river and into Germany.Aiello's unit had been assigned to the campaign that called for glider and airborne troops to seize the bridges in the Netherlands to allow British tank units to cross into Germany.Aiello went missing during an intense four-day battle in the Kiekberg Woods near the Waal River bridge at Nijmegen.The War Department issued a presumptive finding that Aiello was killed in action.More than 70 years later, his remains were exhumed from the Ardennes American Cemetery and sent to the DPAA laboratory for identification in May 2016.The DPAA laboratory conducted analysis, comparing the remains to DNA samples taken from Aiello's relatives and found a match.Expert team for delicate work The DPAA's mission is to recover personnel listed as prisoners of war or missing in action from all past wars and conflicts all over the world.The agency has an annual budget of $112 million.Tucker said the agency, made up of civilian and military experts from all branches, successfully identifies about 200 service members each year."We have intelligence analysts that help us research our cases, to explosive ordnance disposal technicians that deploy out to the field with our research team to make sure these ancient battlefields are safe for our personnel," he said.Tucker recalls a mission to Tarawa in the Gilbert Islands, where the U.S. Marines fought the Japanese Army during World War II."We were doing an excavation and one of the villagers next to where we were digging comes to us and says, 'Hey, I found a bomb, years ago, and it's been sitting in my house ever since.'And it was this huge unexploded ordnance just sitting in his living room... We're putting shovels into the ground, we need to make sure it's safe for the team," Tucker said.Anthropologists, counterintelligence experts, human intelligence collectors, researchers and forensic specialists and linguists assemble into a 10-14 member research and investigation team.They research archives in the host nation, investigate leads in "last known alive" cases and obtain oral histories about particular battles.Over 82,000 unaccounted for As of October, the agency is working to recover 82,429 soldiers, with many others pending administrative review.Most of them, 72,978, are from World War II.Another 7,717 are from the Korean War, with 5,000 believed to be in North Korea."North Korea is a tricky one for us," Tucker said, adding that they haven't been able to send teams there since around 2005."In 2011, we were about to send a team ... and two weeks before we were set to deploy, that's when they started firing rockets into the ocean and so the president said 'no go.'"During the Korean War, a North Korean Army major took command of over 700 American prisoners of war in October 1950.Only 262 of those men returned alive.One survivor of the camp, U.S. Army Pfc.Wayne A."Johnnie" Johnson, secretly recorded the names of 496 fellow prisoners who died during captivity and later published them.DPAA still uses that information.Since the early 2000s, DPAA has received 208 boxes of remains from North Korea and the agency has been able to identify more than 400 individuals.Soldiers missing from the Vietnam War number 1,602; the Cold War has 126 missing and six are listed from Iraq and other conflicts.Will DPAA ever complete its mission?"We estimate that 33,000, give or take, can actually be recovered.The other remaining portion of that is like deep-water losses related to World War II and just situations we will never be able to recover the remains from with today's current technology," Tucker said."But are we going to get to a point where we have done all we can?Not in my lifetime, it is painstaking work.But eventually, I hope we don't have any more cases to resolve, that would be a pretty good thing, if we have done everything we can and accounted for every individual we can is a good thing."Aiello was posthumously awarded the nation's fourth-highest award, the Bronze Star, along with the Purple Heart.His name is recorded at the Tablets of the Missing at the Netherlands American Cemetery in Margraten, Netherlands, along with others listed as missing in action from WWII.A rosette will be placed next to his name to indicate he has been accounted and returned home.
Air Force pilot shortage has grown, is 'stretching the force to the limit':::::Nov. 10 (UPI) -- The Pilot shortage that has dogged the U.S. Air Force has gotten worse as the service's top officials say the shortage has surged to about 2,000 airmen.In September, U.S. Air Force Chief of Staff Goldfein told attendees at the annual Air Crew Summit at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland that the service is "in a crisis" that could compromise its ability to defend the nation.According to Goldfein and Air Force Secretary Heather Wilson, it's gotten worse."Last summer, we were reporting to people that we were about 1,500 pilots short in the Air Force -- and we expected it to get worse," Air Force Secretary Heather Wilson told reporters on Thursday."Almost 2,000 pilots short of a force that has 20,000 pilots, so that's one in 10 that we're short."At the Air Crew Summit, Goldfein challenged presenters and leaders in September to develop new and creative solutions for problems such as pilot training limitations, filling staff positions and retaining personnel.Adoption of a new federal budget will help the Air Force start correcting the issue, Wilson said."The fiscal 2018 continuing resolution is actually delaying our efforts to increase the readiness of the force, and risk accumulates over time," Wilson said."We are stretching the force to the limit, and we need to start turning the corner on readiness."Thursday's announcement comes just a month after President Donald J. Trump amended an existing executive order issued under President George W. Bush in the days following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.Executive Order 13223, citing emergency powers and giving broader authority to the Air Force to recall for active duty retired aviators.However, U.S. Air Force officials have indicated they had no plans at the time to act on the authority granted to them by the president.During Thursday's briefing at the Pentagon, Goldfein said that while airmen are meeting requirements to complete missions, the stretch is taking a toll on the Air Force and they are looking for ways to "reduce tension on the force."Goldfein and Wilson both said adoption of a new budget by Congress would help push forward some ideas to ease the strain and help allow the Air Force to maintain its mission."Surge has become the new normal," Wilson said."Less than one percent of Americans serve in uniform and protect the rest of us, and they're carrying a heavy burden.We are burning out our people because we are too small for what the nation is asking of us."
Lockheed awarded contract for integration of F-35, SDB-II:::::Nov. 10 (UPI) -- Pentagon officials announced Thursday that Lockheed Martin Aeronautics has been awarded a contract for weapons technology and development support on the F-35 Lightning II joint strike fighter and small-diameter bomb II for the U.S. Marine Corps and Air Force.The deal is estimated to be worth more than $34.6 million and is classified as a cost-plus-fixed-fee contract -- where Lockheed Martin will be reimbursed by the U.S. government on a negotiated fee that is fixed before the contract is set in stone.Defense Department officials are enabling Lockheed to develop "weapons capabilities technology maturation and risk reduction pre-engineering, manufacturing and development activities," according to a Pentagon statement.In July, Lockheed Martin was awarded a $5.6 billion contract modification to an existing contract for Lot 11 low-rate acquisition of the F-35 Lightning II fighter.That contract called for the procurement needs of the the Air Force, Marine Corps, Navy, allied nations and customers under the foreign military sales program, which provides for 74 Fiscal 2017 aircraft, including 48 F-35As for the Air Force, 19 F-35Bs for the Marine Corps, and eight F-35Cs for the Navy and Marine Corps.Raytheon announced last month that it has already started integrating the SDB-II system on the F-35, F/A-18E/F and F-15E aircraft.Work on Thursday's contract announcement will be performed in Fort Worth, Texas, and is expected to be completed in July 2018, according to Pentagon officials.Fiscal 2017 research, development, test and evaluation funds for the U.S. Marine Corps and U.S. Air Force in the amount of $6 million are being obligated at the time of award, all of which, the Pentagon said, will expire at the end of the current fiscal year.
Oil prices flat, but still seeing a geopolitical risk premium:::::Nov. 10 (UPI) -- Simmering tensions in the Middle East continued to support a risk premium for crude oil prices Friday, with U.S. oil starting to test the $60 per barrel range.Crude oil prices jumped more than 3 percent in Monday trading after a crackdown on corruption in Saudi Arabia was interpreted as a grip on power by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and tacit support for an OPEC-led drive to stimulate oil prices with coordinated production cuts.Those cuts would support the value of Saudi Aramco, which on Thursday signed a handful of deals valued at more than $4 billion.More risk was added, meanwhile, when Riyadh called its citizens out of Lebanon following the abrupt resignation of Prime Minister Saad Hariri."The call to get out of Lebanon is being a possible signal that Saudi Arabia may be about to attack," Phil Flynn, a senior market analyst for the PRICE Futures Group in Chicago, said in an emailed market report.Elsewhere, global markets could be tightening because of developments in Venezuela, a member of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.The country may have failed to met its $1.1 billion in obligations to its creditors last week, and the U.S. government this week hit a dozen Venezuelans with sanctions because of allegations of ties to a fraudulent elections.A market report emailed by RBC Capital on Friday said that geopolitical risk, improved demand and lower global oil volumes meant the bullish sentiments were firmly entrenched."Despite countless head fakes in the oil market over recent years, the drastically improved fundamental backdrop makes the recent rally more sustainable than the previous myriad of stutter steps," the report read.The price for Brent crude oil was up just 0.1 percent to $64 per barrel as of 9:20 a.m. EST.West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark for the price of oil, was flat at $57.17 per barrel.Markets since Monday's surge have been volatile, though gains this year have been substantial.The price for Brent crude oil is up 15 percent since the beginning of October and continues to test multi-year highs.The market may move later in the trading day once oilfield services company Baker Hughes releases its weekly rig count, which offers a reflection of activity in exploration and production.Gains in the United States, where production is testing the OPEC-led balancing effort, could indicate future production growth and drag oil prices lower.Flynn said demand is soaring, however, and the fundamental signs of a stronger market are becoming clear."Oil and product demand is soaring," he said."Oil products like gas and diesel are tightening and we are in a major tightening cycle."
Vehicle emissions per driver on the rise, study finds:::::Nov. 10 (UPI) -- The average emissions emitted per individual driver in the United States is getting worse, a report Friday from the University of Michigan found.The Transportation Resource Institute at the university said its eco-driving index, which measures the amount of greenhouse gas emissions per individual driver, is getting worse."The EDI indicates that the average new-vehicle driver produced 18 percent lower emissions in August 2017 than in October 2007, but 4 percent higher emissions than the record low reached in November 2013," the emailed report read.According to the International Energy Agency, about a quarter of the total global greenhouse gas emissions come from the transportation sector.U.S. refineries switch late in the year to a winter-blend of gasoline, which is less expensive to make because more steps are needed with the summer-blend to prevent excessive evaporation.As a result, summer blends improve gas mileage.The Michigan study, meanwhile, said average fuel economy is lower, but it was basing its metrics on the window-sticker value of new vehicles sold in the United States last month.From September to October, the average mile-per-gallon was lower by 0.1."The value for October is up 5.1 mpg since October 2007, but down 0.3 mpg from the peak of 25.5 mpg reached in August 2014," the report read.Meanwhile, a separate report from the institute, co-authored by Brandon Schoettle and Michael Sivak, found both battery-powered and plug-in hybrids are at the point where they're capable of meeting the daily travel needs of most U.S. drivers.Recent improvements in range and charging times, their report read, has led to wider acceptance and reduced "range anxiety" already.
Commitment questions surface over Keystone XL:::::Nov. 10 (UPI) -- Though market momentum is moving in favor of the project, progress on Keystone XL depends on overcoming some level of reluctance, an analyst said.Pipeline company TransCanada secured a long-awaited permit from the U.S. government this year to advance its cross-border Keystone XL project to the U.S. Gulf Coast.In addressing third quarter performance, the company said it had about 500,000 barrels of oil per day committed to the pipeline, which is about 60 percent of the total design capacity.A decision drafted in 2015 by the State Department under U.S. President Barack Obama said there were questions about the necessity for additional North American pipeline capacity given uncertainties about the future growth of Canadian oil sands production."Long-term trends that drive the investment decisions of oil-sands producers are difficult to predict," the State Department's decision read."Since production remains uncertain post 2018, the corresponding amount of transportation infrastructure required also remains uncertain."In its quarterly statement, TransCanada said it was updating shipping contracts and anticipated modifications because new clients could come on board, while others reduced commitments."We anticipate commercial support for the project to be substantially similar to that which existed when we first applied for a Keystone XL pipeline permit," the company stated.Lower crude oil prices in 2015 crimped spending in the energy sector and starved economies like Canada's that depend heavily on oil for revenue.In terms of cost, the State Department's analysis from 2015 said most Canadian pipeline projects would break even with oil holding steady at between $65 and $75 per barrel.Brent crude oil was $64 per barrel in early Friday trading.Sandy Fielden, the director of research, commodities and energy at Morningstar, told UPI that TransCanada will commit to the project if shippers commit to the project, adding the company might be cautious about upsetting its client base after cancelling its Energy East oil pipeline project meant to feed eastern Canadian markets.Fielden said the overall market outline is improving for Canada, but producers are also nervous about making any sort of commitment."The whole thing is kind of a chicken and egg saga, with producers reluctant to pull the trigger and TransCanada scared to invest without their support," he said.The State Department under President Donald Trump said in its permitting decision the break-evens for Canadian oil projects remained the same, but the sector in general has proven itself to be resilient in the low-price cycle.The ability of Canadian producers to sustain production during a period of lower oil prices led the U.S. government to "have confidence" that more oil pipeline infrastructure was needed.Dan McTeague, an analyst with GasBuddy who monitors pipeline developments in Canada, said the Keystone XL commitments will likely come through."There's a market for heavy Canadian crude oil, which is making its way to the Gulf Coast by hook or by crook," he said.
McDermott contract to help boost oil offshore Saudi Arabia:::::Nov. 10 (UPI) -- Vague on specifics, a contract for oilfield services company McDermott International is tied to boosting oil production for offshore Saudi Arabia.McDermott in its release to the press said work would begin immediately for an unspecified Middle East customer for engineering, procurement, construction and installation services offshore in the Arabian Gulf."This award signifies our long-standing position and strong relationships with our Middle East customers," Linh Austin, a regional vice president, said in a statement.The company offered few specifics other than to say it was a "major contract," which meant the value was somewhere between $750 million and $1.5 billion.Construction is slated at McDermott's facilities in Saudi Arabia and in Dubai, where it has its headquarters.The announcement followed the $4.5 billion in agreements signed between the Saudi Arabian Oil Company, known informally as Saudi Aramco, and a handful of service contractors for "megaprojects" envisioned in the energy-rich kingdom.Saudi Aramco acknowledged Thursday that McDermott was awarded a three-year contract to help enhance crude oil production at the offshore Safaniyah field, though terms weren't disclosed.While McDermott's contract was specific to crude oil production offshore, Aramco CEO Amin Nasser said the entire package of deals was part of an effort to push out more "clean-burning natural gas."The investment, he added, is part of the broader Vision 2030, which aims to bring more non-oil revenue to the Saudi economy.The Safaniyah oil field is the largest offshore field in the world, producing more than 1.2 million barrels of oil per day.Bloomberg news this week reported that Saudi Arabia aims to cut exports by 120,000 barrels per day by December.Saudi Arabia is leading efforts to stimulate crude oil prices with managed production cuts alongside other members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.OPEC economists said Saudi production was around 9.9 million barrels per day last month, adding domestic oil demand in August "dipped steeply."Rising crude oil prices have led to improved financials for companies like McDermott who cater to the exploration and production side of the industry.The company reported operating income for the third quarter at $127.1 million, compared with $43.1 million during the same period last year.
Statoil makes headway with Barents Sea field development:::::Nov. 10 (UPI) -- A construction contract for parts of a facility used to tap the Johan Castberg oil field in the Barents Sea will be signed by Christmas, Norway's Statoil said.Statoil said it signed a letter of intent with Sembcorp Marine Rigs & Floaters in Singapore for contracts related to the construction of the hull and living quarters for the floating production, storage and offloading vessel that will be deployed at Johan Castberg.Statoil estimates Johan Castberg holds between 450 million and 650 million barrels of oil equivalent.As many as 30 wells are planned for the field in the five years ending in 2024.The Norwegian company put the value of the contract at around $490 million and said signing and a final investment decision are expected by Christmas at the latest."Johan Castberg is the next major field development on the Norwegian continental shelf and important to future infrastructure in the Barents Sea," Torger Rd, Statoil's senior vice president for project development, said in a statement.The company said the northern port city of Hammerfest, located in Finnmark county, would serve as supply and helicopter base for the development of the Johan Castberg field.Statoil aims to invest around $135 million per year on the field.Norway posted an unemployment rate of 4.1 percent in August, the last full month for which the government published data.Statoil said Johan Castberg development will have ripple effects across the economy in northern counties, though no Norwegian bidders surfaced for the construction contract.Norway, one of the largest oil and gas producers in the world, said the output from petroleum-related manufacturing turned lower in the third quarter.Total manufacturing output declined 0.7 percent from the second quarter, bogged down mostly by petroleum-related activity.
EV corridor will stretch from Norway to Italy:::::Nov. 10 (UPI) -- German utility company E.ON and a mobility service provider said Friday they would work to establish an electric-vehicle corridor linking Norway to Italy.With $11.6 million in funding from the European Commission, the German company and service provider CLEVER said they'd link the countries connecting Norway to Italy with a network of 180 charging stations for electric vehicles."Although, it is still early days, both companies are seeing a global shift towards electric vehicles," the companies said in a joint statement."Countries as well as the European Union are beginning to make pledges to phase out petrol- and diesel-fueled cars and consumers and car manufactures are switching to electric vehicles."Each station will be equipped with as many as six charging points with enough electricity to charge a 250-mile range battery in about a half hour.Charging stations will be spaced every 90 miles or so across Italy, France, Germany, Denmark, the United Kingdom, Sweden and Norway during the next three years.In Germany, which has one of the greener economies in the world, E.ON already has plans to place an ultra-fast charging station at a motorway between Frankfurt and Nuremberg.Dorothee Br, the federal transport minister, said the government set aside $355 million to help build tens of thousands of charging points on the German highway network.Two million electric vehicles were on the road globally last year, though nearly all of those were in China, the European Union and the United States.A report from the International Energy Agency found that dense metropolitan areas were taking leadership roles in encouraging electric vehicles because of pollution concerns.Beijing is expanding the number of electric vehicles in the public transportation sector.In the United States last month, a handful of governors from western U.S. states rolled out plans to expand access for electric vehicles along more than 5,000 miles of highway.Economists at the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries said the share of alternative-fuel vehicles will increase to about 16 percent by 2040.They lowered a long-term forecast for oil demand in part because of an expected decline in the global economy, structural shifts and "fuel switching, particularly in the road transportation sector."
Kurdish oil export payments in line with average:::::Nov. 10 (UPI) -- Energy companies working inside Kurdish territory in northern Iraq reported payments received by the government for exports that appeared within historic norms.Gulf Keystone Petroleum, which operates the Shaikan oil field in the Kurdish north, reported payments for crude oil exports for July at a gross $15 million.The sales total, of which $12 million is net to Gulf Keystone Petroleum, is consistent with the export payment received by the Kurdistan Regional Government in June.Separately, Norwegian oil and gas company DNO, which operates the Tawke license area in Kurdish territory, reported Friday it received $46.53 million for exports from August.DNO also received another $4.27 million from the KRG, which represents its 3 percent of the Tawke license revenues.DNO shares the export revenue with its operating partner, Genel Energy.Neither company offered an explicit volume designated for exports, though DNO's production estimates would put the total at more than 100,000 barrels of oil per day.DNO said this week that third quarter production averaged 115,200 barrels of oil equivalent per day.Kurdish assets represented the clear majority of the company's portfolio, with output at 110,500 bpd during the quarter.Iraqi forces in early October wrestled for control over oil fields in Kirkuk, a territory of dispute between the federal government and the semiautonomous KRG.Crude oil from northern Iraq flows primarily by truck and through a pipeline from Kurdish territory to a Turkish sea port.A second pipeline from Iraqi territory in the north could be used once it's rehabilitated, and British energy BP suggested it was in broader talks with efforts in Kirkuk.Data supplied by commodity pricing group S&P Global Platts to UPI show total Kurdish exports at around 250,000 barrels per day from Oct. 17.That's less than half the total from before Iraqi forces seized control over the oil fields in Kirkuk, severing an economic lifeline for the Kurdish north.A spokesperson for Genel said operations at the Tawke and the separate Taq Taq areas have continued uninterrupted.
Raytheon, Saab to develop improved shoulder-launched weapon systems:::::Nov. 9 (UPI) -- Raytheon and the Swedish aerospace and defense firm Saab will partner to develop new weapons for infantry forces, the companies said in a joint statement on Thursday.The companies said that they will first look to upgrading the Carl-Gustaf reloadable shoulder-launched weapon, an 84mm anti-tank recoilless rifle used by the United States, Britain and 38 other countries.Additionally, the companies are looking to enhance Saab's AT-4 disposable weapon system to meet near-term U.S. and international requirements.The AT-4 also fires 84mm rockets, however they are unguided."Putting the best equipment in the hands of soldiers is our main mission," Kim Ernzen, Raytheon Land Warfare Systems vice president, said in a press release."Saab and Raytheon bring the power of the world's latest technologies to make this happen."Saab has worked to modernize the multi-role weapon as soldiers' needs on the battlefield change.The company made it more portable by reducing the weight of the newest version, the M4/M3E1, from 22 to 15 pounds."Collaborating with Raytheon, utilizing their technical and product excellence in combination with our technology, will enhance the already world-leading Carl-Gustaf and AT4 weapon systems with additional capabilities that will further increase the operational benefit for the end user," said Grgen Johansson, who leads Saab's Dynamics business.
Navy contracts with Bell Helicopter for two AH-1Z Vipers:::::Nov. 9 (UPI) -- Bell Helicopter Textron has been awarded a contract modification for the manufacture and delivery of two Bell AH-1Z Viper twin-engine attack helicopter to the U.S. Navy, the Department of Defense announced on Wednesday.The deal is estimated to be worth more than $38.3 million and is classified as a fixed-price-incentive-firm contract, meaning that once performance on the contract is complete, Bell Helicopter Textron and the U.S. government will renegotiate the final cost of the deal.The Bell AH-1Z Viper is built to meet the requirements for the United States Marine Corps, and frequently is deployed as a part of a Marine Air Ground Task Force.The AH-1Z Viper is the only attack helicopter in the world with a fully-integrated air-to-air missile capability, Bell says.The Bell AH-1Z's Target Sight System also provides the longest range and highest accuracy of any helicopter currently in existence.About 60 percent of the contract work will be performed in Fort Worth, Texas, the other 40 percent will be completed in Amarillo, Texas.The project is expected to be completed in November 2019.U.S. Navy fiscal 2017 aircraft procurement funds in the amount of $38.3 million will be obligated at time of award, none of which will expire at the end of the current fiscal year.
BAE completes full scale test of F-35A airframe:::::Nov. 9 (UPI) -- BAE Systems announced Thursday that the contractor successfully completed its full scale durability test airframe of the F-35A aircraft.The completion is the culmination of the F-35A's third life testing at BAE Systems' testing facility in East Yorkshire in England, which is equivalent to 24,000 hours of "flying."The airframe, known officially as the AJ-1,is designed to operate from conventional runways, and is the only F-35 variant to carry an internal cannon, according to Lockheed Martin, who also works on the F-35 Lightning II aircraft fleet.The U.S. Air Force, as well as the majority of allied air forces and Foreign Military Sales nations, will operate the F-35A, eventually replacing their 3rd and 4th generation aircraft."The F-35 program requires a service life of 8,000 flight hours," Kathy Nesmith, F-35 joint program office airframe team lead, said in a press release."This is verified through durability testing to two lifetimes or 16,000 hours.Completing third life testing on the F-35A durability article will provide us the data to enable the warfighter to maintain and sustain this aircraft beyond 2050."The F-35B and F-35C durability test airframes already have completed 16,000 hour second life testing, with additional tests being conducted to maximize the life of the aircraft.The good news from BAE Systems comes after years of the F-35 being dogged with controversies that range from overbudgeting to numerous delays and design flaws.In recent years, there have been growing concerns over the F-35's onboard computer systems and, according to the FBI, Chinese hackers may have stolen classified data related to the F-35 project."The 5th generation F-35, with advanced speed and agility, pushes the boundaries of engineering and physics," said Matt Edghill, F-35 structures development director at Lockheed Martin."This durability testing confirms the airframe will perform in and withstand the demanding environments it will experience throughout its operational lifetime.Completion of the F-35A's third lifetime test gives our program great confidence in the aircraft's strength and durability for decades to come."
Raytheon contracted for development, integration of G550 systems:::::Nov. 9 (UPI) -- Pentagon officials announced Wednesday a contract with Raytheon for the development and integration of the Commercial Aircraft Based Instrumentation Telemetry System and the Airborne Command Transmitter System on the G550 airborne early warning aircraft.The deal is estimated to be worth more than $79.6 million and is classified as a fixed-price-incentive-firm contract, meaning, that once performance on the contract is complete, Raytheon and the U.S. government will renegotiate the final cost of the deal.The U.S. Navy purchased the CAEW-based Gulfstream 550 for range support in March 2016 in order to replace the Lockheed NP-3D "Billboard" aircraft brought out of retirement in 2010 by the Air and Test and Evaluation Squadron VX-30, which is based at Point Mugu, California.Work on the contract will be performed in Albuquerque, N.M., and is expected to be completed in February 2022.Fiscal 2017 research, development, test and evaluation funds from the U.S. Navy in the amount of $6.5 million will be obligated at time of award, all of which will expire at the end of the current fiscal year.
Risk premium resurfaces for oil, but economic trends offer balance:::::Nov. 9 (UPI) -- Crackdowns in Saudi Arabia were balanced by signs that European economic growth was stronger, but facing pressures ahead, to send oil prices higher Thursday.The Saudi Center for International Communication said more than 200 individuals have been called in for questioning so far by the nation's attorney general.Arrests during the weekend, ostensibly part of a crackdown on corruption, sent oil prices soaring more than 3 percent early this week.The Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority sought to allay investor concerns, however, by saying Wednesday it was "business as usual" for banks and corporations in the oil-rich kingdom, though what seems to be a grab on power solidifies Riyahd's position of pushing for higher oil prices ahead of plans to offer public shares in state-owned oil company Saudi Aramco.Meanwhile, European data offered mixed signals in early morning trading.Real growth in gross domestic product for the European nations that use the euro currency is on pace to expand at 2.2 percent for its fastest pace in a decade."The EU economy is performing well overall.Economic growth and job creation are robust, investment is picking up and government deficit and debt are gradually decreasing," Valdis Dombrovskis, the commissioner in charge of financial stability, said in a statement."There are however significant differences across member states, with some of them still experiencing considerable slack in the labor market."Momentum slows with growth for the euro area and broader European Union easing to 2.1 percent next year and 1.9 percent in 2019.The price for Brent crude oil was relatively even moments before the opening bell in New York to trade at $63.47 per barrel, a gain of less than 1 percent from the previous close.West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark for the price of oil, was up 0.18 percent to $56.92 per barrel.In other economies, The Conference Board said its leading economic index for Japan declined 0.1 percent in September.In Quebec, Bank of Canada Gov.Stephen Poloz said inflation in advanced economies was soft, but fundamentals were strong, adding "the laws of supply and demand have not been repealed."Crude oil prices continue to test new highs, after breaking two-year records in recent sessions.A commentary sent by email from commodity pricing group S&P Global Platts said the bulls still have it."Bullish sentiment has returned to the market as of late, with contributors including conflict in the Middle East, expectations OPEC will extend production cuts at their upcoming meeting, the U.S. oil rig count continuing to trend downward, and the belief that the global market is approaching balance," the statement read.
Senate, unlike House, would keep mortgage deduction intact:::::Senate Republicans have a message for their House counterparts: leave the mortgage interest deduction alone.On Thursday, Senate Republicans unveiled their version of a tax reform bill, and it retains the current tax break that allows homeowners to deduct interest on mortgages up to $1 million, according to initial materials from the Senate Finance Committee.That's in contrast to the House bill proposed last week, that would limit the deduction to home loans over $500,000.That lower cap would have only applied to new mortgages.As lawmakers work to merge their two plans, a new limit could emerge on how much mortgage interest homeowners can deduct.So far this year, 5.4% of all loans originated were more than $500,000, according to data from ATTOM Data Solutions, or about 325,000 loans.The proposed reduction in the House bill became a major point of contention last week.The housing industry quickly came out against the limit.But the response to the Senate plan was cautiously optimistic."While the Senate plan to keep the mortgage interest deduction at the $1 million mortgage cap is a positive development, we will have to carefully examine the full package once it's released to assess if it is good for housing, middle-class families and the small business community," said Jerry Howard, CEO of the National Association of Home Builders in a statement Thursday evening.Related: What's in the Senate Republican's tax bill The deduction helps make home buying more affordable.While mortgage rates are currently sitting below 4%, home prices have been rising thanks to tight housing supply in many markets.The median home price across the United States is currently $254,000, according to the National Association of Realtors.But even if the $1 million amount is protected, fewer Americans could end up claiming the deduction.Both tax proposals also nearly double the standard deduction, which likely means fewer people will itemize their deductions.In order to claim the mortgage interest rate deduction, homeowners need to itemize.The Tax Policy Center estimated that the percent of filers who claim the deduction would fall to 4% from 21%.
What's in the Senate Republicans' tax bill:::::Senate Republicans on Thursday unveiled the substance of their tax reform bill, one week after their House colleagues released their own legislation.Some of the Senate GOP proposals will be welcomed by critics of the House bill.For instance, Senate tax writers will not propose curbing the mortgage interest deduction.But others will raise hackles.The Senate GOP plan would fully repeal the state and local tax deduction.Below are some key provisions of the Senate bill that would affect taxes on personal income and business income.FOR INDIVIDUALS Change individual income tax brackets: There are seven brackets in today's individual tax code: 10%, 15%, 25%, 28%, 33%, 35%, and 39.6%.The Senate bill also calls for seven brackets but changes the rates on taxable income to: 10% (income up to $9,525 for individuals; $19,050 for married couples filing jointly) 12% (over $9,525 to $38,700; over $19,050 to $77,400 for couples) 22.5% (over $38,700 to $60,000; over $77,400 to $120,000 for couples) 25% (over $60,000 to $170,000; over $120,000 to $290,000 for couples) 32.5% (over $170,000 to $200,000; over $290,000 to $390,000 for couples) 35% (over $200,000 to $500,000; over $390,000 to $1 million for couples) 38.5% (over $500,000; over $1 million for couples) The House bill, by contrast, only calls for four brackets: 12%, 25%, 35% and 39.6%.Nearly double the standard deduction: Like the House bill, Senate Republicans would significantly raise today's standard deduction.In the Senate bill, the deduction for singles increases to $12,000 from $6,350 currently; and it raises it for married couples filing jointly to $24,000 from $12,700.That would drastically reduce the number of people who opt to itemize their deductions, since the only reason to do so is if your individual deductions combined exceed the standard deduction amount.Eliminate personal exemptions: Today you're allowed to claim a $4,050 personal exemption for yourself, your spouse and each of your dependents.Both the Senate and House bills eliminate that option.For families with three or more kids, that could mute if not negate any tax relief they might enjoy as a result of other provisions in the bill.Fully repeal state and local tax deduction: The Senate bill would no longer let individual filers deduct their property taxes or their state and local income or sales taxes.Eliminating the state and local tax deduction was met with strong opposition from House lawmakers in high-tax states and cities.So a concession was made in the House Republicans bill to restore an itemized deduction for property taxes up to $10,000.Related: There's a loophole in House GOP's plan to kill state and local income tax deduction If the House and Senate each pass their own bills and have to reconcile the differences between them, the SALT deduction could be a huge sticking point.Both bills, however, make one big exception: Business owners and partners who pay tax on their company's profits through their individual returns would still get to deduct their state and local taxes as a business expense.Expand the child tax credit: The Senate GOP bill increases the child tax credit to $1,650 per child, up from $1,000 today, and slightly above the $1,600 proposed in the House bill.Senate GOP tax writers would make the credit available for any children under 18, up from today's under-17 age limit.But the $650 increase won't be available to the lowest income families if they don't end up owing federal income taxes.That's because unlike the first $1,000, the extra $650 wouldn't be refundable.When a credit is refundable, it means you still can get money from the government because of the credit, even when your federal income tax bill is zero.The Senate bill also greatly expands who is eligible for the credit by raising the roof on the income thresholds where the credit starts to phase out: To $500,000 for single parents, up from $75,000 today; and to $1 million from $110,000 for married couples.Meanwhile, filers with dependents who are not qualified children may be able to claim a new $500 nonrefundable credit per dependent.Keep mortgage interest deduction as is: The Senate bill would still let you claim a deduction for the interest you pay on mortgage debt up to $1 million.House tax writers proposed capping the loan limit at $500,000.But since the House and Senate bills nearly double the standard deduction, the percent of filers who claim the mortgage interest deduction would drop sharply.The Senate bill does make two changes on home-related financing.It disallows interest deductions for home equity loans.And it lengthens the time you must live in a home to get the full tax-free exclusion on your gains when you sell it.Repeal the Alternative Minimum Tax: The AMT, originally intended to ensure the richest tax filers pay at least some tax by disallowing many tax breaks, most typically hits filers making between $200,000 and $1 million today.Those who make more than that usually find they owe more tax under the regular income tax code, so must pay that tab instead.Tax experts often note the AMT no longer meets its original purpose and further complicates an already complex tax code.But it's been kept on the books because it raises a lot of revenue.Preserve the estate tax, but exempt almost everybody: Unlike the House GOP bill, Senate Republicans have not proposed repealing the estate tax.But they are proposing to double the exemption levels -- which are currently set at $5.49 million for individuals, and $10.98 million for married couples.Even at today's levels, only 0.2% of all estates ever end up being subject to the estate tax.FOR BUSINESSES Cut the corporate rate ... in a year: Like the House bill, the Senate bill would cut the corporate tax rate to 20% from 35% today.But the 20% rate would not take effect until 2019 under the Senate proposal.The delay would reduce the cost of the measure in the first 10 years.Make expensing rules more generous: Senate Republicans want to make it possible for businesses to immediately and fully expense new equipment, for at least five years, similar to a provision in the House bill.Lower taxes on pass-through business income: Most U.S. businesses are set up as pass-throughs, not corporations.That means their profits are passed through to the owners, shareholders and partners, who pay tax on them on their personal returns under ordinary income tax rates.The House bill simply dropped the top income tax rate on pass-through income to 25% from 39.6%, and prohibited anyone providing professional services (e.g., lawyers and accountants) from taking advantage of the lower pass-through rate.But the Senate bill would lower pass-through taxes by letting those in partnerships, S corps or sole proprietorships deduct 17.4% of their income.And it would disallow the 17.4% deduction for anyone in a service business except those whose taxable incomes don't exceed $150,000 if married ($75,000 if single).Prevent abuse of pass-through tax break: If the owner or partner in a pass-through also draws a salary from the business, that money would be subject to ordinary income tax rates.But to prevent people from recharacterizing their wage income as business profits to get the benefit of the pass-through deduction, the Senate bill would automatically limit the deduction to half of the W-2 wages of the filer.Change how U.S. multinationals are taxed: Today U.S. companies owe Uncle Sam tax on all their profits, regardless of where the income is earned.They're allowed to defer paying U.S. tax on their foreign profits until they bring the money home.Many argue that this "worldwide" tax system puts American businesses at a disadvantage.That's because most foreign competitors come from countries with territorial tax systems, meaning they don't owe tax to their own governments on income they make offshore.The Senate bill proposes changes to move the U.S. to a territorial system.It also includes a number of anti-abuse provisions to prevent corporations with foreign profits from gaming the system.And it would require companies to pay a one-time low tax rate on their existing overseas profits -- 10% on cash assets and 5% on non-cash assets (e.g., equipment abroad in which profits were invested).Those are below the 14% and 7% repatriation rates called for in the amended House bill.-- CNN's Ted Barrett, Lauren Fox, and Phil Mattingly contributed to this report.
U.S. hits 10 more Venezuelan leaders with sanctions:::::The Trump administration hit 10 more officials in crisis-ridden Venezuela with sanctions on Thursday, after recent elections there were deemed a fraud.The officials are part of President Nicolas Maduro's regime.The United States and other governments have labeled him a dictator.Under the sanctions, the officials will have their U.S. assets frozen, and Americans are barred from doing business with them."We will maintain our vigorous efforts to sanction Venezuelan government officials ... unless they break from Maduro's dictatorial regime," Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said.Mnuchin has now sanctioned more than 30 Venezuelan leaders this year, including Maduro and Vice President Tareck El Aissami.The Trump administration has also barred banks from trading or buying newly issued Venezuelan debt.The latest round of sanctions covers Ernesto Villegas, the culture minister, and Carlos Osorio, the former food minister.They were imposed after Maduro's party won regional elections in a landslide in October.Related: Venezuela: We can't pay our debts anymore The sanctions hit at a critical time for Venezuela, which is on the verge of default after it missed a major payment to bond investors this week.A default would have grim consequences for Venezuela's 30 million citizens, who are already suffering through severe shortages of basic food and medicine.Children are dying in hospitals, and people are starving.Investors would have the right to seize Venezuela's assets, such as oil, outside the country.Because the government relies almost entirely on exporting oil to make money, it could quickly run out of cash to buy food and medicine.Maduro announced last week that Venezuela plans to restructure or refinance more than $60 billion in debt.Many investors and experts took that to mean that he will stop paying bondholders and default soon.The debt crisis could move quickly in the coming days.A regulatory committee will meet in New York on Friday and could determine whether Venezuela has in fact defaulted.It's unclear whether the state-run oil company, PDVSA, made a payment due on November 2.The grace period ended this week.Related: The chaos in Venezuela could get much worse Another key date is Monday.El Aissami, the vice president, has invited investors to Venezuela to discuss future debt payments.But because he's sanctioned -- the United States accuses him of drug trafficking -- investors can't negotiate with him.Bondholders can't speak with Venezuela's finance minister, Simon Zerpa, either.He was sanctioned in July."You can't sign anything with the president, the finance minister, the vice president and essentially anyone who would be at the meeting," says Fernando Freijedo, a Latin America analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit research firm."Logistically, [the meeting] seems impossible."Although American investors are allowed to go to Venezuela for the meeting, it's unclear whether any will, given the conditions.Related: Venezuela is blaming Trump for missed debt payments Some experts say the meeting is a political maneuver: Venezuelan leaders can say they tried to negotiate with investors.Maduro has long said his country's problems are the result of an "economic war" waged by the United States."The invitation could either be a political tactic to blame bondholders or political propaganda to give the impression that they are resolving the debt problem," says Siobhan Morden, head of Latin America fixed income at Nomura.Morden wouldn't say whether Nomura holds Venezuelan debt.Another investor who requested anonymity because he holds Venezuelan debt said he has no plans to go to Caracas because El Aissami is sanctioned.Venezuelan bonds have tanked this week after Maduro called for a restructuring.The oil company PDVSA's bond maturing in 2019 tanked to 27 cents on the dollar from 48 cents last week, according to MarketAxess BondTicker.
Starbucks' Howard Schultz slams GOP tax plan as 'fool's gold':::::Many business leaders are cheering the corporate tax cuts proposed by President Trump and the GOP.And then there's Howard Schultz.The Starbucks (SBUX) executive chairman slammed the House Republican tax proposal for being too heavily skewed toward tax cuts, instead of giving the outdated system much-needed reform."This is not tax reform.This is a tax cut.This is fool's gold," Schultz said on Thursday at the New York Times DealBook Conference in Manhattan.Schultz, who stepped down as Starbucks CEO this year, said corporate America "does not need" the proposed corporate tax cut from 35% to 20%."The tax cut proposal is not going to create a more leveled playing field and a more compassionate society," he said.Of course, Schultz, a Democrat who backed Hillary Clinton in 2016, could merely be positioning himself for a long-rumored run for president.Asked about a bid for the White House, Schultz said he's "deeply concerned about the country," but "not thinking today about running for president."The Starbucks exec isn't the only one expressing skepticism about the tax plan.Barclays published a report Wednesday saying the GOP tax plan "is skewed in the direction of tax cuts over reform."Barclays noted that "tax cuts tend to produce temporary effects, rather than permanent ones."Related: These powerful business groups hate the GOP tax plan The critical comments from Schultz come just hours after Gary Cohn, President Trump's top economic adviser, talked up the tax plan's support from big business."The most excited group out there are big CEOs," Cohn told CNBC.Pushing back against claims that the tax overhaul would only help business and the wealthy, Cohn predicted companies will return to the United States and workers will get a much-needed raise."We see the whole trickle-down through the economy, and that's good for the economy," he said.The GOP tax plan has received strong support from the Business Roundtable, an influential group of CEOs that champions pro-business policy.On Tuesday, the organization released a national cable TV ad featuring an Illinois manufacturing company to press for tax reform.Related: What's in the House GOP tax bill for businesses But other powerful lobbying groups are trying to kill the GOP tax bill because it would close or limit deductions they covet.For instance, the real estate industry is warning that the housing market could be hurt by proposed limits on deductions for mortgage interest and state and local property taxes.Yet Starbucks itself would seemingly benefit from tax cuts.The coffee giant's effective tax rate last year was 33%, according to Howard Silverblatt at S&P Dow Jones Indices.Asked what Starbucks would do with savings created by the proposed tax cuts, Schultz said at the DealBook conference that the company would not just add it to its profits."We will find other ways to create a contribution back to either the communities we serve, the many initiatives we have about veterans and obviously our people for benefits," Schultz said.
Rising Obamacare costs frighten some early retirees:::::Don and Debra Clark of Springfield, Missouri, are glad they have health insurance.Don is 56 and Debra is 58.The Clarks say they know the risk of an unexpected illness or medical event is rising as they age and they must have coverage.Don is retired and Debra works part time a couple of days a week.As a result, along with about 20 million other Americans, they buy health insurance in the individual market.But the Clarks are not happy at all with what they pay for their coverage $1,400 a month for a plan with a $4,500 deductible.Nor are they looking forward to the Affordable Care Act's fifth open enrollment period, which runs from Nov. 1 through Dec. 15 in most states.Many insurers are raising premiums by double digits, in part because of the Trump administration's decision to stop payments to insurers that cover the discounts they are required to give to some low-income customers to cover out-of-pocket costs."This has become a nightmare," said Don Clark."We are now spending about 30% of our income on health insurance and health care.We did not plan for that."The Clarks' experience points to an emerging shortfall in the ACA's promise of easier access to affordable health insurance for early retirees and the self-employed.Rising premiums and deductibles, recent actions by the Trump administration and unceasing political fights over the law threaten those benefits for millions of older Americans.Related: Obama wants you to know Obamacare open enrollment has begun "These folks are rightly the most worried and confused right now," said Kevin Lucia, a health insurance specialist and research professor at Georgetown University's Health Policy Institute in Washington, D.C. "Decisions about which health plan is best for them is more complicated for 2018, and many people feel more uncertain about the future of the law itself."At highest risk are couples like the Clarks who don't qualify for federal assistance.Their income is just above the amount that would have qualified them for a subsidy, or about $65,000 for 2017.Premiums vary widely by state.Generally, a couple in their late 50s or early 60s with an annual income of $65,000 would pay from $1,200 to $3,000 a month for health insurance.In an analysis released this week based on insurers' rate submissions for 2018, the Kaiser Family Foundation found that individuals and families that don't qualify for a subsidy but are choosing plans on the federal marketplace, face premiums 17% to 35% higher next year, depending on the type of plan they choose.A similar increase would be expected for people who also buy on the marketplaces run by some states or buy directly from a broker or insurance company.The hikes come after a 22% rise in premiums, on average, in 2017.The substantial premium increases two years in a row could lead fewer people to buy coverage."I'm really worried about this," said Peter Lee, CEO of the Covered California exchange."We could see a lot fewer people who don't get subsidies enroll."California has taken steps to mitigate the impact for people who don't get subsidies but "consumers are very confused about what is happening and could just opt not to buy," he said.Related: These states are doing Obamacare open enrollment their own way The ACA has been a boon to people age 50 to 64 whether they get a subsidy or not.It barred insurers from excluding people with preexisting conditions which occur more commonly in older people.And the law restricted insurers from charging older Americans more than three times that of younger people, instead of five times more, as was common.The law also provided much better access to health insurance for early retirees and the self-employed reducing so-called "job lock" and offering coverage amid a precipitous decline in employer-sponsored retiree coverage that began in the late 1990s.Only 1 in 4 companies with 200 or more workers offered any kind of coverage to early (pre-65) retirees in 2017, compared with 66% of firms in 1988, reported the Kaiser Family Foundation.And the vast majority of small firms never did offer such coverage.Overall, before the ACA became law, 1 in 4 Americans age 55 to 64 who wanted to buy their own coverage either couldn't get it because of a preexisting condition or couldn't afford it, according to AARP."The aging but pre-Medicare population was our major reason to support the ACA then and it still is now," said David Certner, director of legislative policy at AARP."This group benefited enormously from the law, and we think society and the economy benefited, too."Just how many 55- to 64-years-olds have been liberated from job lock by the ACA has yet to be fully assessed.But recent data show that 18% of people ages 55 to 64 who were still working in 2015 got coverage through the ACA marketplaces, up from 11.6% in 2013, according to an analysis for this article by the Employee Benefit Research Institute.Related: Most Obamacare enrollees could pay less for policies next year Also, a report released in January 2017 by the outgoing Obama administration found that 1 in 5 ACA marketplace enrollees of any age was a small business owner or self-employed person.A bipartisan effort is underway in Congress to provide dedicated funds to woo enrollees to healthcare.gov and help state agencies explain changes in the law for 2018 triggered by the Trump administration.But the fate of the proposed legislation is uncertain.The Clarks said they'll look carefully at options to keep their premiums affordable in 2018.Said Don Clark, "If we get to a point where we have a $10,000 deductible and pay 40% or more of our income for health insurance, I'm not sure what we'll do.We can't afford that."Kaiser Health News, a nonprofit health newsroom whose stories appear in news outlets nationwide, is an editorially independent part of the Kaiser Family Foundation.
Saudi Arabia says corruption has claimed $100 billion over decades:::::Corrupt practices by Saudi royals and officials have cost the kingdom at least $100 billion over decades.Saudi Arabia's attorney general, Sheikh Saud Al Mojeb, gave the estimate of the losses in a statement Thursday.He also said that 208 individuals have been questioned as part of an extensive investigation.Seven of them have been released without charge."Based on our investigations over the past three years, we estimate that at least $100 billion has been misused through systematic corruption and embezzlement over several decades," the kingdom's top legal official said."The evidence for this wrongdoing is very strong, and confirms the original suspicions which led the Saudi Arabian authorities to begin the investigation in the first place."Saudi authorities arrested dozens of royals, businessmen and senior government officials on Saturday in a surprise anti-corruption sweep.Those arrested included billionaire businessman Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, the former head of the royal court Khaled Al-Tuwaijri and Saudi media mogul Waleed Al-Ibrahim.The Saudi central bank has frozen the personal accounts of people under investigation.And authorities in the United Arab Emirates have reportedly asked banks there for information about assets held by 19 Saudi royals and officials.Related: Arrested Saudi prince built empire from Riyadh to Silicon Valley It looks like the Saudi authorities may be gearing up for a lengthy probe.Some those arrested are reportedly being held in Riyadh's 5-star Ritz Carlton, which has been out of bounds to other guests since the weekend.Now it appears to be "fully booked" until February 1, 2018.Marriott (MAR), which owns the hotel, declined to comment on the situation at the Ritz citing "guest privacy.""We do not discuss the guests or groups with whom we do business or who may be visitors of the hotel," a spokesperson said.The arrests followed the establishment of a new anti-corruption committee headed by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.It has the power to investigate, arrest, issue travel bans and freeze the assets of those it finds corrupt.Saudi officials say the arrests are part of an effort to clean house in support of the crown prince's push to overhaul the country's economy and end what he once called its "addiction" to oil.Sweeping changes are already happening, including subsidy cuts, new taxes and the end of a controversial ban on women driving.Related: Women driving could rev up Saudi economy "The strengthening of [bin Salman's] position should benefit near-term reform momentum given that the crown prince has been the dominant driving force behind Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030 reform agenda," said Fitch ratings agency in a report on Thursday, but it also warned of an increased risk of a political backlash.--Tamara Qiblawi contributed to this report.
Dubai gets sucked into Saudi corruption turmoil:::::Saudi Arabia's campaign against corruption is hurting companies and markets beyond its borders.Some of the biggest names in Dubai real estate saw their shares slump this week as regional markets were hit by fallout from the Saudi anti-corruption purge at the weekend.The sell-off was triggered by concerns about the exposure of companies in Dubai to Saudi business, the risk of Saudis pulling their money out of the United Arab Emirates, and broader fears about regional stability.In a surprise move on Saturday, at least 49 Saudi princes, businessmen and officials were rounded up and accused of corruption.The list includes Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, the billionaire businessman who owns a global network of major investments.He has been charged with money laundering, bribery and extortion, a Saudi official told CNN.His company, Kingdom Holding, has not responded to requests for comment."The market is driven by the recent geopolitical tension in the region and that's causing investors to panic," said Tariq Qaqish, managing director of asset management at Menacorp in Dubai."We expect the market to continue to be volatile due to the uncertainty."The Dubai stock market -- the most active the Gulf region after Saudi Arabia -- posted losses for four straight days following news of the purge.It ended the week down 5%.Emaar, the developer behind the Burj Khalifa -- the world's tallest tower -- saw its shares fall 6% this week.And Damac, which built a Trump branded golf course in Dubai, plunged 8%.Both developers are heavily exposed to the fortunes of Dubai's real estate market, and also have several projects in Saudi Arabia.Related: Riyadh's Ritz-Carlton: Luxury hotel or detention center for Saudi royals?There are deep political and commercial ties between Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates: more than a million Saudis visit Dubai every year.They're also close allies, leading a boycott against neighboring Qatar, accusing it of funding terrorism (a charge Qatar denies), and fighting Houthi rebels in Yemen.The potential for the UAE to be drawn even deeper into the Saudi turmoil was underscored by reports that it had asked banks for information on the accounts of 19 Saudi royals and officials.According to a central bank notice widely shared on social media, UAE authorities want banks to "immediately" search and report on activity on any financial instrument held in the UAE by Alwaleed and others.CNN could not independently verify the document.The central bank did not respond to a request for comment.Saudi Arabia said Thursday that corruption had cost the kingdom $100 billion over decades.Also unnerving investors in the region is the prospect of an escalation in the proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran in Yemen.Iran-backed Houthi rebels targeted an airport in Saudi Arabia's capital with a ballistic missile earlier this week.Saudi officials said the missile was intercepted.In comments reported by the state-run Saudi Press Agency, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman told British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson that Iran's actions "may be considered an act of war against the kingdom.""I believe... [this] could be the start of more upheaval in the Gulf," said Meshal Al Faras, regional head at Janus Capital."The normal reaction is to reduce risk" by selling shares, he added.Related: Saudi Arabia tries to 'clean house' with stunning purge Saudi Arabia's anti-corruption committee is headed by the crown prince.It has the authority to investigate, arrest, issue travel bans and freeze the assets of those it finds corrupt.Prince Mohammed is also leading the country's economic overhaul to reduce its dependency on oil.Fitch rating agency on Thursday said the recent arrests could concentrate power in the hands of the crown prince, bolstering his economic and social reforms, but also raises the risk of a backlash.

Trump's $250 billion China deals: These are the companies behind them:::::The U.S. dealmaker-in-chief appeared to strike a rich vein in China.President Trump and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, on Thursday announced more than $250 billion in deals between the two countries across industries like energy, technology and aviation.But as is common for agreements unveiled on big state visits, there wasn't much in the way of detail.And a significant number of the deals were non-binding, meaning they could change or fall apart before the final version is signed.Here are some of the major ones: Related: Trump: 'I don't blame China' for taking advantage of US on trade U.S. energy China could pour more than $100 billion into U.S. energy projects in the coming years under two of the deals.One is an $84 billion plan from state-owned China Energy Investment Corp. to invest in shale gas and chemical manufacturing projects in West Virginia.That comes with a couple of caveats, though.It's spread out over 20 years and the deal is only a memorandum of understanding rather than a finalized contract.Another plan aims to invest as much as $43 billion in Alaska's energy sector.China Petroleum & Chemical Corp., better known as Sinopec (SHI), and the Alaskan government will jointly develop the state's liquified natural gas industry.Alaska says the agreement will create up to 12,000 jobs.Related: China is crushing the U.S. in renewable energy Both agreements are part of China's strategy to cut its dependency on polluting coal and pivot to relatively cleaner forms of energy.It already imports natural gas from countries including Qatar."U.S. imports could help ensure that Beijing does not become too dependent on any one (country)," said Hugo Brennan, an analyst at consultant Verisk Maplecroft.But he added the deals are structured so Beijing can "quietly back away" later on if it needs to.Commercial jets Boeing (BA) announced it's selling $37 billion worth of airliners to China.It's unclear how many of the orders are new."We're treating these numbers with caution," said Greg Waldron, Asia managing editor at research provider FlightGlobal.Related: China to overtake U.S. as largest air travel market The agreement for 300 planes is with a government holding company that buys jets for state-owned carriers such as Air China (AIRYY) and China Southern Airlines (ZNH).That makes it difficult to track which airlines are buying what, and how many of the orders might already be included in Boeing's backlog.The company didn't immediately respond to a request for more information.A similar $38 billion deal was announced in 2015 when Xi visited Boeing's largest factory in Washington state.What's certain is that China has a huge appetite for new planes.The country is set to overtake the U.S. to become the world's biggest air travel market within five years and needs the aircraft to meet that rapidly growing demand.Over the summer, European rival Airbus (EADSF) won a $22 billion deal to supply China with 140 new airplanes.U.S. chips for Chinese phones American chipmaker Qualcomm (QCOM, Tech30) inked $12 billion in non-binding deals to supply components to Chinese smartphone brands Xiaomi, Oppo and Vivo.China is already a massive market for Qualcomm, accounting for more than half its sales.The company has also run into trouble there: Chinese regulators fined it $975 million in 2015 for breaking antitrust laws.Related: How China plans to beat the U.S. at technology Qualcomm is the subject of a $130 billion takeover bid from rival Broadcom (AVGO) that could create a U.S. behemoth.Some experts have suggested that Chinese regulators could hold up the deal because of Beijing's plans to aggressively expand its own semiconductor industry.-- Jon Ostrower contributed to this report.

Americans see jobs aplenty. Good wages? Not so much.:::::If you ask most Americans, finding work isn't that difficult these days.But getting paid enough to get by still remains a problem.The percentage of residents who think jobs in their area are plentiful spiked to 50% last month, the highest reading since the Pew Research Center began asking the question 16 years ago.Those perceptions match reality.In October, the unemployment rate also reached its lowest rate since 2001, and the number of people working part-time because they can't find full-time jobs is back to its pre-recession level.However, landing a job doesn't necessarily mean paying all the bills.Nearly half (49%) of Americans still feel their wages haven't kept up with the cost of living, Pew's survey found.That percentage has declined in recent years, but still reflects lingering insecurity.Many families say they have little cushion against income shocks, like a job loss or a health scare, and retirement savings are getting thinner from generation to generation.That sentiment tracks with official statistics.Although median wages have risen faster than inflation over the past year, people in especially high-cost cities, like Denver or Seattle, or those living where there are sluggish job markets are still unable to keep up.For these folks, paychecks still haven't grown enough to make up for decades of stagnation.Despite their correlation with real-world conditions, however, the respondents' opinions may also be impacted by political factors.The eight-point jump in positivity towards the job market since February was driven mostly by Republicans.Over the course of that time, President Trump has gone from lamenting the weaknesses of the economy to trumpeting its strengths.Related: People who switch jobs get paid more Opinions are also stratified by income.Those who make more than $75,000 a year believe that jobs are plentiful by a 20-point margin over those making between $30,000 and $75,000.High-income people are also significantly more likely to think that Trump has made the economy better -- 37% of this group believe that, compared to 19% of respondents making less than $30,000.At approximately the same point in President Obama's first term, slightly more people believed his policies had made economic conditions worse 20% to Trump's 18%.But that was also in the depths of a recession, rather than during a years' long streak of job growth and stock market gains that the current White House inherited.
Notre Dame reverses decision to end birth control coverage:::::Reversing an earlier decision, the University of Notre Dame will continue providing students and employees with access to birth control free of charge.The Catholic institution was one of the first major employers to take advantage of the Trump administration's weakening of Obamacare's contraceptive mandate.Notre Dame, which had long battled the Obama administration over the provision, said in late October that it would end coverage for employees after Dec. 31 and for students after Aug. 14.The university said it objects to the mandate based on its religious beliefs.Students and employees quickly protested the decision, holding a demonstration and creating an online petition.Under Obamacare, insurance plans had to cover contraception for women without charging a co-pay.A fairly limited number of employers -- mainly churches and some other religious entities -- could get an exemption to the mandate.Some other employers, such as religious-based universities or hospitals, could seek accommodations so that they didn't have to provide coverage, but their workers could still obtain contraceptives paid for by the insurer or the employer's plan administrator.Notre Dame's students and workers received coverage this way.Related: Notre Dame will stop covering birth control for students and employees The Trump administration, however, issued new rules last month that would let a broad range of employers stop offering contraceptive coverage through their health insurance plans if they have a "sincerely held religious or moral objection."In his annual faculty address Tuesday, Notre Dame's president, the Rev.John Jenkins, said the university had decided to keep the accommodation for employees in place."As I have said from the start, the university's interest has never been in preventing access to those who make conscientious decisions to use contraceptives," he said."Our interest, rather, has been to avoid being compelled by the federal government to be the agent in their provision."A university spokesman confirmed that students would continue to have access to no-cost birth control, as well.Notre Dame's initial response was based on its belief that it could no longer utilize the accommodation because the new rule would prompt insurers to discontinue providing no-cost contraceptives.It then learned that carriers would maintain the coverage anyway.Related: Trump administration deals major blow to Obamacare birth control mandate "We have made the decision not to interfere with the provision of contraceptives administered by insurance administrators and funded independently," said Paul Browne, Notre Dame's vice president for public affairs.Graduate students cheered the reversal."We are grateful and relieved that we were able to help push the administration to respect the Notre Dame community members' right to reproductive healthcare," said the Graduate Workers Collective, an independent group of graduate students.
In a small Kentucky coal town, joblessness leads to a health crisis:::::In the small Appalachian town of Hazard, Kentucky, doctors at the local medical center have identified a high-stakes epidemic that has them scrambling in a race against time.It all began in January, when the Hazard ARH Medical Center started offering free voluntary HIV/Hepatitis C testing to anyone who came into the emergency room.The results stunned doctors: 22% of the 1,631 patients (to date) tested positive for active Hepatitis C virus.(Only two patient tested positive for HIV.)"This is an extremely high rate of Hep C infections," said Dr. Maria Braman, chief medical officer with Appalachian Regional Healthcare (ARH), the non-profit health system operating the hospital in Hazard, as well as 10 others in Kentucky and West Virginia.Located in eastern Kentucky's Perry County, Hazard has been hit by a perfect storm of events.Related: How this Kentucky coal town is trying to bring its economy back to life The collapse of the coal industry forced many of the town's residents into joblessness and also exacerbated the burgeoning opioid crisis in the region.Now the doctors at Hazard's medical center have found one more toxic side effect of the town's economic demise: A sharp increase in residents with Hepatitis C -- a virus that kills more Americans than any other infectious disease and is extremely costly to treat.'A sense of hopelessness' In the last nine years, eastern Kentucky (which includes Hazard) has lost over 11,000 coal mining jobs, according to the Kentucky Department of Energy.When the mining industry plummeted, other businesses started going along with it.High unemployment in and around Hazard has triggered a "sense of hopelessness," said Jennifer Lindon, president and CEO of Hazard Community and Technical College.That has made the ongoing opioid problem even worse."Addiction's reach here has no barriers, from grandparents to parents to their children," said Tonita Goodwin, executive director of the Hazard-Perry County Economic Development Alliance.Related: Opioid epidemic in America It's especially widespread among the growing ranks of out-of-work miners, who are often prescribed opioid medications to deal with the rigors of the job, said Braman."Miners contort their bodies, spending long periods of time in small cavernous holes.It puts them in significant pain," said Braman.Abuse of the prescription pain med OxyContin, or "hillbilly cocaine" as it's commonly known in the area, is especially prevalent."We have a generation that was lost to it," said Minor Allen, Hazard's chief of police.Now things are getting worse."Meth and cocaine have made it here," said Allen, noting that intravenous drug use has become more of an issue than pills."In the last four to five years, we're also dealing with prostitution.We didn't really see that before."Of the 251 babies born at the Hazard Medical Center so far this year, 13% were exposed to opiate drugs in the womb, said Dan Stone, Community CEO of Hazard ARH Regional Medical Center.The drugs.The prostitution.All of this means there's a higher likelihood for blood borne illnesses like Hep C, said Braman.Hepatitis C is transmitted via shared needle use, sexual contact or from an infected mother to her baby.The vast majority of people -- 75% to 85% -- who get infected later develop chronic liver infection.The virus can lay dormant for years.As a result, people often don't get tested for it.Symptoms only appear when the virus becomes active and attacks the liver.Patients experience weight loss, fatigue and a loss of appetite.It is the leading cause of cirrhosis and liver cancer and the most common reason for liver transplants in the U.S. More than 19,000 people die every year from Hep C-related liver disease, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.A Costly Cure There's no vaccine to prevent Hepatitis C, but there is a cure.It's just prohibitively expensive.Gilead Sciences (GILD)is the leading maker of key Hep C medications Sovaldi, Harvoni, Epclusa and Vosevi.But these drugs can cost $74,000 to $95,000 for a typical 12-week treatment."It's why there's tremendous effort now to help people in this area get tested and prevent more deaths," said Braman.Related: Opioid crisis fast facts Last December, Gilead gave Hazard's medical center a $385,000 grant to launch an HIV/Hep C testing program.The grant was part of the drug company's FOCUS (Frontlines of Communities in the United States) program, which gives funding to non-profit hospitals and community health centers for HIV, Hep B and Hep C testing.Most of the medical facilities that receive the grants are located in towns caught in the grip of the opioid and heroin epidemic.Kentucky, for example, has an estimated 60,000 people living with chronic Hep C, one of the highest rates in the country, according to the Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Services.Nearly one-third of Kentucky's population is enrolled in Medicaid, which will cover the pricey treatments under certain circumstances.The state's Medicaid program spent $69.8 million on Hep C medications alone last year, according to the Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Services (CHFS).To qualify for coverage, patients previously had to go through a preauthorization process, which included regular screenings for alcohol and drug use during the first six months of a patient's Hep C treatment.Doug Hogan, a spokesman for Kentucky's Cabinet for Health and Family Services said the state's Medicaid program recently eliminated the screening requirement.Still, the concern among health providers is that many of those who have Hep C won't pursue treatment.That's because many of the individuals battling Hep C are homeless.They haven't signed up for health insurance and can't afford treatment, said Francis Feltner, director of the Center of Excellence in Rural Health at the University of Kentucky's College of Medicine.Nearly 10% of the patients who are Hep C positive are incarcerated and many others aren't ready to treat their underlying drug addiction, said Diana Parker, executive director of Hazard medical center's psychiatric center.Libby Turner, nursing administrator with the Kentucky River District Health Department, reported similar struggles getting individuals diagnosed with Hep C through screening programs in its own clinics."Very few," she said, pursue treatment.Another issue is that there aren't many infectious disease specialists in the area."So people have to travel some distance to find a physician," said Turner.At Hazard's medical center, doctors have put a protocol in place for those who test positive."When patients come to us, we diagnose them, stabilize them and then try to get them to a primary care physician, specialist or a substance abuse program," said Braman.Using the Gilead grant, the hospital hired a patient navigator to assist patients through the process.The navigator has been instrumental.So far, 30% of the patients have made appointments with primary care providers, specialists, or drug abuse programs to seek treatment, Parker said.But the navigator is just a start.The real fix in tackling this epidemic is creating jobs, said Goodwin of the Economic Development Alliance."We have to bring jobs back.People here have a good work ethic.If they have a job, they will show up," she said."We just can't let the situation here get any worse.We have to fix it."
India's small businesses reel from 'terrible year' after cash ban:::::A year ago, Naraina was a bustling industrial suburb of India's capital New Delhi.Now much of it is deserted.The transformation can be traced back to Nov. 8.2016, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi stunned the country by banning 86% of the money in circulation.India's tens of millions of small firms, which analysts say account for 40% of the economy and provide 80% of its jobs, were particularly hard hit because they usually do business only in cash."It's been a terrible year," said Vinod Gupta, who owns a factory in Naraina producing plastic goods such as bottle caps and fobs for car keys."90% of our business has been wiped out."Gupta said he had to lay off more than half his workers, as have other business owners in the area, which produces everything from steel to electronics."Where there were fifteen workers before, now there are three," he added."Soon we might have to ask even them to go home."Modi's ban on 500 rupee ($7.70) and 1,000 rupee ($15.40) notes -- the two largest denominations at the time -- was followed by another huge change this year that also hurt small businesses.Related: What happened when India trashed its cash The government implemented an overhaul of India's tax system in July to replace a complex web of state tariffs with a single national tax.Small firms have struggled to adapt.India's economic growth has slumped to a three-year low of 5.7% as a result.Two million people lost their jobs in the first six months of 2017."It is clear that [the cash ban] severely damaged output and incomes over the past year," analysts at Capital Economics wrote in a research note this week.India has 100 million small firms Praveen Chakravarty, an economic commentator and analyst at the IDFC Institute in Mumbai, estimates that India has 100 million small and medium-sized firms that play a vital role in the economy.They're also vulnerable to sudden policy change."They are predominantly cash based, employ less than ten employees on average and are outside the tax net," he told CNNMoney."They are informal because they can't afford the costs of formality."Modi's predecessor Manmohan Singh, an economist and former finance minister, said on Tuesday that the cash ban and tax reform had "broken the back" of small businesses.The government says its policies will benefit India in the long run by bringing more people under the country's notoriously small tax net and promoting digital payments.Finance minister Arun Jaitley on Tuesday called the cash ban "a watershed moment" that Indians would later look back on "with a great sense of pride."Gupta, the Delhi plastics manufacturer, is not convinced."The note ban, taxation -- they must have had some strategy behind doing it, I'm not saying that they didn't," he said."But they should have shown a little leniency to small business owners like us."Related: India's economy in 'downward spiral.'What did Modi get wrong?The warehouse opposite Gupta's, meanwhile, was devoid of activity except for two carpenters contracted to build an office for the owner.Workers like them, who depend on daily wages, are now struggling to make ends meet.The duo said they used to be busy all month, but now work less than 10 days on an average."The expenses are piling up for laborers like us, while the rich aren't feeling anything," said one of them, Mohammad Sagir."There's no point of a government that lets poor workers starve to death."
How this Kentucky coal town is trying to bring its economy back to life:::::It's a bittersweet celebration.For the past 40 years, Hazard, Kentucky, has thrown its annual Black Gold Festival to commemorate its decades-long history as a coal mining town.This year's festival, held in September, featured a parade, musicians, a shooting gallery and even a display of toy coal trucks built by local elementary school students.But the festivities couldn't hide the starker reality: The area's coal mines have been shutting one-by-one for years, forcing many of the town's residents into joblessness or to look for work elsewhere.Since 2010, the number of residents in Hazard has shrunk 3.6% to roughly 5,300 in 2016.At the same time, the town has been gripped by the growing opioid crisis."One of the pastors in a church here said he kept seeing pews empty out because people stopped coming or moved away," said Tonita Goodwin, director of Hazard-Perry County Economic Development Alliance.Unemployment in Perry County, where Hazard is located, now stands at 7.3%.That's slightly improved from last year, but still nearly twice the national rate.At its peak in January 2013, the county's unemployment rate soared to 15%.Related: In a small Kentucky coal town, joblessness leads to a health crisis "While Perry County's unemployment rate [has] decreased, it is not because the employment situation improved," said Mike Clark, the associate director of the Center for Business and Economics at the University of Kentucky."While there are fewer people unemployed, there are also fewer people working.Overall, Perry County's labor force has decreased."Retraining former miners and attracting new employers are essential to revitalizing Hazard's economy -- and time is of the essence, said Jennifer Lindon, president and CEO of Hazard Community and Technical College."We're fighting the addiction battle and at the same time trying very hard to bring hope to people here and get them employed again," she said.'Sitting on a labor gold mine' Hazard's community is 90% white, with an average annual per capita income of $24,657 -- roughly half the national median.More than a quarter of Hazard's population lives in poverty.In the last presidential election, 77.2% of Perry County voted for Donald Trump, who campaigned on a promise of bringing coal jobs back, among other things.But while some coal mining still goes on here, there's little hope for its resurgence.Related: The first coal bankruptcy of the Trump era "We must diversify Hazard's economy so the whole area isn't devastated when one industry dies," said Lindon."In Appalachian communities, families resist leaving their towns, no matter how difficult things get," said Goodwin."They would much rather jobs come to them."Economic development groups in Perry County recently conducted a study and discovered that the former coal miners' skills in areas like hydraulics, mechanics and electrical engineering -- would be well-suited for other industries."Their skills can easily be transferred to aerospace and other manufacturing, for instance," said Kathy Walker, director of the HAAS eKentucky Advanced Manufacturing Institute in Paintsville, Kentucky."We're potentially sitting on a labor gold mine here."Last year, more than a third of Kentucky's total exports were aerospace products and parts, like civilian aircraft, engines and aircraft landing and braking systems.The state now has 80 aerospace facilities, employing close to 17,000 people, according to a report by the Kentucky Cabinet for Economic Development.Among the top employers in the field are Lockheed Martin (LMT), Safran Landing Systems and Meggitt Aircraft Braking Systems.Related: These high schoolers are manufacturing airplane parts In 2008, the state introduced the Kentucky Business Incentives program, which offers a tax incentive to companies that meet targets for job creation and hourly wages, said Jack Mazurak, communications director with the Kentucky Cabinet for Economic Development.Recently, metal companies in steel, brass and other finished products that require advanced manufacturing skills have started setting up shop in the state, he said."Advanced manufacturing is another big area to boost in the state and we're finding ways to retrain coal miners with tech skills, like coding, to prepare them for high-tech software development jobs," Mazurak said.In November, the institute in Paintsville, an hour away from Hazard, launched a 16-week program to retrain up to 300 displaced workers in eastern Kentucky over the next year.The course trains students for positions such as a CNC (computer numerical control) machinist and as machine building and tool maintenance technicians in the aerospace and advanced manufacturing industries.Hoping the drone industry takes flight The town of Hazard is also embarking on its own efforts to attract a new wave of employers.It is turning the site of a former surface mine into USA Drone Port -- a research and testing facility for drone companies to use.The facility, which is set to open in 12 to 18 months, is expected to be 20,000 square-feet and five stories high.There's also a plan to open an indoor drone testing facility in Hazard in a few months.To provide a local workforce for the drone port, the Hazard Community and Technical College introduced a course in unmanned technology.The course debuted in June and has already graduated 200 students in areas such as drone flight, photography and videography.Several of the students are former coal miners.That's just one of 17 programs geared toward retraining former coal workers offered at the college.Others include welding and construction.One of the most successful programs is the 12-week electrical lineman course, which has a 90% job placement rate.Starting pay for lineman jobs in Hazard range from $18 to $22 an hour.So far, 168 former miners have completed the course, said Lindon.Kentucky Power Co., based in Ashland, Kentucky, serves 168,000 customers in eastern Kentucky and employs 220 workers throughout the state.Matthew Satterwhite, the utility's president and chief operating officer, said he is keenly aware of how much unemployed talent there is in the area.His firm has provided economic development grants to both Hazard Community and Technical College and the HAAS eKentucky Advanced Manufacturing Institute to support programs that teach coal miners new skills.Kentucky Power has already hired two former coal miners as linemen so far."You may say the accent is funny.But people here can tear apart a car and put it together perfectly in 30 minutes," said Satterwhite."The biggest cash crop here is the people."
Trump administration opens door for states to impose Medicaid work requirements:::::States will soon be allowed to impose work requirements on some Medicaid recipients, a major change in how the government health insurance program operates.The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services will start approving state proposals that "promote community engagement activities," Seema Verma, the agency's head, said Tuesday.This includes requiring able-bodied enrollees to work, volunteer, go to school or enter a job training program in order to qualify for benefits."One of the things that states have told us time and time again is that they want more flexibility to engage their working-age, able-bodied citizens on Medicaid," Verma told a conference of state Medicaid directors."They want to develop programs that will help them break the chains of poverty and live up to their fullest potential.We support this."Republicans have long wanted to add work requirements to the Medicaid program, which covers nearly 75 million low-income children, adults, elderly and disabled Americans.The broadening of Medicaid to able-bodied, working age adults under Obamacare -- roughly 11 million have gained coverage under the health reform law's Medicaid expansion provision -- further spurred GOP efforts.Related: Most Republicans in the U.S. like Medicaid.Who knew?States can currently seek waivers to make some changes to the Medicaid program.However, the Obama administration did not approve any state requests to impose work mandates.That will change under the Trump administration, said Verma, who penned a letter to state officials in March encouraging them to submit waiver applications that include work requirements."Believing that community engagement requirements do not support or promote the objectives of Medicaid is a tragic example of the bigotry of low expectations consistently espoused by the prior administration," Verma said Tuesday."Those days are over."Eight states -- Arkansas, Arizona, Indiana, Kentucky, Maine, New Hampshire, Utah and Wisconsin -- have submitted waivers to CMS that include work-related provisions, according to Manatt Health, a consulting firm.Verma served as a Medicaid consultant for Indiana and Kentucky before joining the Trump administration.Related: Medicaid covers a lot more people than you might think While Republicans believe adding work requirements will help Medicaid recipients become independent, critics fear that it will strip away benefits from people in need.Having access to health care can help low-income adults get and keep jobs, said Jocelyn Guyer, managing director at Manatt.Taking away their access to coverage "is too high a price to pay," she said.Many Medicaid recipients already work.Nearly 60% of non-disabled, working-age adults have jobs, while nearly 80% live in families with at least one worker, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation analysis.
There's a loophole in GOP's plan to kill the state and local tax deduction:::::House Republicans want to kill the state and local income tax deduction.But apparently not for everyone.Their tax reform bill, being debated this week by the Ways and Means Committee, would repeal the federal tax deduction that people get for paying state and local income taxes, and it would curb how much they can deduct in property taxes.The tax break known as the SALT deduction is one of the most controversial revenue raisers because it is near and dear to taxpayers -- and lawmakers -- from highly taxed areas across the country.Today, just under 30% of filers claim the state and local tax deduction on their federal returns, according to the Government Finance Officers Association.But tax experts have spotted what appears to be a big exception to the repeal: The owners, shareholders and investors in so-called pass-through businesses would still be allowed to deduct their state and local taxes in full.The provision allows the deduction if the state and local taxes are "paid or accrued in carrying on a trade or a business ... [or on expenses related to] production of income."As for everyone else who currently takes the SALT deduction?Sorry, Charlie, no can do.Related: What's in the House Republican tax bill for businesses Pass-throughs make up the majority of U.S. businesses.They take the form of sole proprietorships, LLCs or S corps.And those with an ownership stake in them pay taxes on the entity's profits on their individual returns.So for them, under the House bill, state and local taxes could be treated as a business expense on their personal return.That would include President Trump, who typically structures his businesses as pass-throughs.But ordinary employees of such businesses would still be barred from taking the deduction against their wages.A spokesperson for the House Ways and Means Committee confirmed to CNNMoney that "all" pass-through owners and investors "will continue to be able to deduct state and local taxes incurred in the conduct of a trade or business."But the provision as written raises big questions for tax policy watchers.A key one is whether professional service firms, which are often set up as pass-throughs, would qualify for the SALT deduction.Professional services include firms providing financial services, legal services and consulting.The SALT provision in the House bill doesn't explicitly say they're not eligible and the word from Ways and Means is that "all" pass-throughs could take the deduction.But -- and this is where it gets tricky -- another provision in the House bill flatly precludes professional service pass-throughs from taking advantage of the proposed new 25% rate on pass-through profits.Related from CNN: Some Republicans say fight isn't over for popular deduction When asked about this at a House Ways and Means hearing Monday, Thomas Barthold, chief of staff at the Joint Committee on Taxation, seemed to indicate professional service providers -- such as partners in a big law firm -- likely would not be allowed to deduct their state and local taxes because all their income would be taxed as ordinary income, and would not receive the special 25% pass-through profits rate.But other experts disagreed."There's nothing in the legislation providing that.[A professional services firm] is still a trade or business that's a pass-through," said New York University Tax Law Professor David Kamin, who formerly served as a special assistant to President Obama for economic policy.When asked to settle the issue, a spokesperson for Ways and Means wasn't immediately available for comment.Kamin believes the exception to the repeal -- if that's what the tax writers truly intended -- would result "in deep unfairness and plenty of gaming."-- CNN's Ashley Killough contributed to this report
People who switch jobs get paid more:::::Jumping ship at your job pays off.Teachers, nurses, construction workers and even hotel employees who switched jobs recently saw bigger wage increases than their former colleagues who stayed put, according to new research from ADP, the payment processor.The findings come as employers are scrambling to hold onto their workers because there's an abundance of job openings.There were 6.09 million job openings in September, according to Labor Department figures released Tuesday.That's a hair under the record high of 6.14 million in July.The government began counting job openings in 2000.Such a high number of job openings are a mix of good and bad news.The good: Employers are hiring and America's job market is strong.Unemployment is at 4.1%, the lowest in 17 years.Related: Can't find good workers?Pay up!The bad: Companies either can't find enough workers at a certain wage or candidates with the right job skills.Employers often say a lack of job skills is holding back the economy, and that America as a whole needs to invest more in job training that focuses on skills that are in demand.Another school of thought argues that companies should just pay more if they can't find anyone.In fact, despite the shortage of workers, U.S. wages overall aren't going up much.Wage growth in October was a sluggish 2.4%.Wages are going up significantly for workers leaving their jobs though.In construction, builders who moved onto new sites saw wages go up 5.8% compared to a year ago.Construction workers who stayed at their current gig saw wages rise less: 4.9%.The same is true in education and health services.Those who left for other jobs got a pay raise around 6.2% at their new gig.Those who stayed saw wages go up 3.9%.Related: Job training saved her life It makes sense that there's such a disparity in wage increases between teachers and nurses who stay versus those who move to other schools or hospitals.Of the total 6.09 million job openings in September, 1.17 million -- or about 20% -- were in education and health services.In other words, schools and hospitals are having a hard time filling openings so some feel forced to pay more to attract new talent.For all U.S. workers, those who switched jobs saw wages go up 4.9% on the year while workers who stayed at their jobs got a 4.3% pay bump.ADP's figures come from the third quarter -- July to September.The trend isn't true in all industries.Manufacturing, mining and transportation firms tend to pay workers more if they stay put than if they're applying from elsewhere, according to ADP.
These state exchanges are doing Obamacare open enrollment their own way:::::The Trump administration may be downplaying the start of Obamacare open enrollment, but the states that run their own exchanges are making sure residents know to sign up.More than a dozen states have their own marketplaces, which gives them more control over advertising, outreach and even enrollment in some cases.Many are taking advantage of this power to spread the word that the Affordable Care Act remains the law of the land and federal assistance is still available.Open enrollment for 2018 began Wednesday and runs through December 15 in the more than three dozen states that use the federal exchange, healthcare.gov.In prior years, there was a bigger ad push and the enrollment period lasted at least until the end of January.The Trump administration has taken other steps that critics say undermine the health reform law.It is doing only one-tenth of the advertising for open enrollment that the Obama administration did last year.It's also cut the federal support for the non-profit agencies that help people sign up.Also, Trump has repeatedly pronounced that Obamacare is dead and has yanked the funding for a key Obamacare subsidy.All this has Obamacare advocates worried that fewer people will sign up.State-based exchanges are trying to counteract that messaging."They understand that the federal chaos will have a negative impact on enrollment," said Emily Curran, research fellow at Georgetown University's Health Policy Institute."State marketplaces are really well-positioned to step up and do more for their consumers."Related: Obama wants you to know Obamacare open enrollment has begun Covered California, which has roughly 1.3 million enrollees, plans to increase its marketing and outreach budget by $12 million this enrollment season.It is spending a total of $111 million, with more than half going towards television, radio, print, digital and other advertising -- including a spot during the World Series Game 7 in Los Angeles.Also, it has allocated $33.5 million for enrollment assistance.Exchange officials are also hitting the road to promote enrollment, traveling 1,300 miles over seven days in a bus wrapped in the Covered California logo.Local artists will paint murals to attract attention to sign up locations across the state.Enrollment in the Golden State will last until Jan. 31.The #1 goal: Encourage people to check out the exchange's website, coveredca.com, and shop."If people shop and see the price, they'll sign up," said Peter Lee, Covered California's executive director, noting that 85% of consumers who get subsidies can find plans with lower premiums for 2018.In Connecticut, exchange officials ran public service announcements on local television stations and social media in October to make sure residents understood that the Affordable Care Act still exists, financial help is still available and the uninsured will still be penalized."It's never been this confusing for consumers," said Andrea Ravitz, director of marketing and sales for Access Health CT, which extended enrollment by a week to Dec. 22.Related: 5 changes for Obamacare open enrollment for 2018 Access Health CT is making it easier for people to sign up by staffing 10 enrollment locations -- up from two last year -- as well as holding five enrollment fairs, which it is promoting heavily.The exchange also debuted a mobile-friendly website to make it easier to shop on cell phones and tablets.And it is mining the data on its 95,000 enrollees to send them tailored messages by email, text, phone and mail.For instance, residents enrolled in unsubsidized silver plans this year will receive messages asking them to update their income on their applications to see whether they now qualify for help and letting them know that bronze and gold plans may be cheaper on the exchange than off it.Also, officials are advising them that if they buy an off-exchange policy, they won't be able to receive a subsidy even if their income drops during the year.Advertising is key to getting people to sign up for Obamacare, experts said.In Kentucky, for instance, each TV ad sparked nearly 8,000 page views of kynect, the state-based exchange, over the first four enrollment periods, according to researchers from the University of North Carolina, University of Michigan and the Wesleyan Media Project.Then, Republican Governor Matt Bevin took office in December 2015 and canceled television advertising for the final four weeks of the 2016 open enrollment period.Kentucky's enrollment dropped 19% between 2015 and 2016."Reductions in public outreach efforts could have negative effects on the individual market if consumers are uncertain about the continued availability of coverage and so-called 'healthy procrastinators' fail to enroll as a result, contributing to lower enrollment and potentially a worse risk pool for insurers," the researchers wrote.Related: Most Obamacare enrollees could pay less for policies next year Conscious of the importance of outreach, the Maryland state-exchange is tripling the number of emails, texts and mailings it is sending this year.Plus, it is pushing notifications through its mobile app.The top priorities are letting consumers know that they must enroll by Dec. 15 and that most can escape the big rate increases since they qualify for financial assistance."We realize it's a shorter period so we have to get people in the door quicker," said Andrew Ratner, chief marketing officer for Maryland Health Benefit Exchange, which runs the marketplace.Sign-ups have been brisk so far, with more than 5,000 people picking plans in the first two days, nearly twice as many as last year.The Maryland Health Connection website, which usually closes at 11 p.m., had to stay open an hour later on Wednesday because 300 people were still online.Maryland currently has about 120,000 Obamacare enrollees.While a lot of consumers are confused about the status of the Affordable Care Act, the news coverage has raised awareness of open enrollment, Ratner said."In some ways, all the attention to the reduction in advertising gets the message out in a different way," he said.
Here's the other small firm that won a big power contract in Puerto Rico:::::Whitefish Energy isn't the only young company to land a multimillion dollar deal to help restore power in Puerto Rico.Cobra Acquisitions, a subsidiary of Oklahoma City-based Mammoth Energy (TUSK) that's less than a year old, won a $200 million contract last month from the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA) to help repair and reconstruct the crippled island's utility infrastructure over the next 120 days.The deal is one of two major contracts greenlighted by PREPA that have come under scrutiny on Capitol Hill since recovery efforts began on the island over a month ago.Public outrage and a series of government reviews forced Puerto Rico's state-owned utility to cancel a $300 million deal with Whitefish, a small Montana-based firm with only two employees at the time Hurricane Maria hit.That deal is currently in the process of being unwound.PREPA, the embattled state-owned utility led by executive director Ricardo Ramos, has faced scrutiny over how these fledgling companies won such lucrative deals over larger, more established utilities.Many question whether PREPA followed the appropriate steps in awarding the contracts.Related: Puerto Rico is killing its $300 million Whitefish contract.Now what?And now PREPA's deal with Cobra is raising eyebrows."Did you or anyone at FEMA approve the Whitefish contract and or the Cobra contract?"Rep. Peter DeFazio, a Democrat from Oregon, asked Brock Long, the head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, at a House hearing last week."There's not a lawyer within FEMA that would have ever approved that contract," responded Long."The bottom line is, it was not our contract.And the other thing to be clear here is we don't approve contracts."To be sure, approval by FEMA on such deals isn't mandatory.The agency only requires a detailed audit of Puerto Rico's emergency spending.Mammoth CEO Arty Straehla told analysts on an Oct. 20 conference call that FEMA was "in the room" and involved in "every step of the way" when PREPA was crafting the deal with its Cobra division.FEMA declined to address whether it participated in the discussions.Instead, a FEMA spokeswoman told CNN that Cobra's contract was "solely between PREPA and the other party."Mammoth, an oilfield services company that provides hydraulic fracturing services, is just three years old itself.It bought Cobra for $8 million earlier this year to expand into the utility infrastructure business.As of Oct. 1, Cobra had 58 fleets and roughly 275 employees.It has also been involved in repairs in Texas and Florida following hurricanes Harvey and Irma.Currently, the company has 69 workers in Puerto Rico -- with plans to bring in over 500 more in the coming days, Cobra spokesman Matt Wagner told CNN.Barges with equipment and supplies, including accommodations, are also on their way to the island, he said.Related: Devastating hurricanes dealt corporate America a major blow As part of its deal with PREPA, Straehla said Cobra agreed to provide accommodations, freshwater generation and medical facilities for its workers.PREPA agreed to pay Cobra $15 million upfront to cover the costs of mobilizing forces to the island, he said.It's unclear how PREPA could afford that upfront payment.Only a few weeks earlier, the bankrupt utility, which is $9 billion in debt, said it picked Whitefish over another contender: PowerSecure, a subsidiary of Southern Co. (SO), because it couldn't afford to pay the $25 million down payment the firm required.Ramos said Whitefish's CEO Andrew Techmanski had agreed to take care of logistics, including lodging and food for the hundreds of journey linemen needed to restore power.Straehla reassured Mammoth's investors that the terms of the deal complied with FEMA's reimbursement requirements, signaling Cobra would be paid for its work."We will be paid, we will bill twice weekly," Straehla told analysts a day after announcing the contract."Quite honestly, we wouldn't have entered this contract if we didn't think we'd get paid, and we feel very, very strongly about that."Typically, agencies like PREPA will pay a contractor first as part of a disaster relief deal.Then it would submit a request for reimbursement to FEMA, which would then audit the expense and determine if it is eligible for repayment, an agency spokesperson told CNN.It's unclear how the disaster relief agency makes its assessment.But lawmakers have raised questions about whether the Cobra and Whitefish contracts would meet the agency's requirements."As I understand these contracts, there's a big question about whether you could find them eligible for reimbursement," DeFazio said to Long at the House hearing last week.Long assured a Senate panel earlier in the week that "not one dollar has gone toward that contract from FEMA" referring to the Whitefish contract.He did not say whether any FEMA money had gone to the Cobra contract.Cobra's spokesman told CNN the company received its full $15 million upfront payment on Oct. 20 from PREPA, the day after the deal was publicly announced.A PREPA spokesman did not respond to a request for comment on FEMA's or its own involvement in the Cobra deal.To help restore power to millions on the island, PREPA has also been working with six other local companies, including Pro Energy, Electrical Mechanical Construction and Aireko Services Installation, a spokesman told CNN.The value of those contracts are unknown.Other contracts have also been awarded by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, including a six-month $240 million contract to Fluor Corp. (FLR), a $40 million deal to PowerSecure to help repair the power grid and a $35.1 million contract to Weston Solutions to provide two generators for temporary power to the city of San Juan.PREPA also plans to tap the mutual aid network, which provides help to other utilities during widespread power outages.Puerto Rico's governor Ricardo Rossello turned to governors in New York and Florida for help following the cancellation of the Whitefish deal.Related: How Whitefish landed Puerto RIco's $300 million power deal On Tuesday, PREPA's Ramos, along with the mayor of San Juan, Carmen Yulin Cruz, and Natalie Jaresko, the head of financial oversight and management board for Puerto Rico, are set to appear before a House panel to discuss the ongoing recovery efforts on the island.A focus of Tuesday's hearing will be cooperation going forward to repair the island's electrical grid.Last week, Rep. Scott Perry, a Republican from Pennsylvania, asked FEMA's Long whether the U.S. government should be "on the hook indefinitely" when it comes to repairing Puerto Rico's electrical grid, especially given decades of lapsed repair of the island's utility infrastructure."I don't think we should be on the hook," Long responded."We've been put in a terribly complex situation as a result of deferred maintenance and a system that was allowed to decay.And unfortunately, everybody wants the power back on."--CNN's Khushbu Shah contributed to this report.
GE cuts dividend for second time since Great Depression:::::General Electric is slashing its coveted stock dividend in half and getting even smaller by selling storied businesses such as its railroad and light bulb units.The dividend cut, only GE's second since the Great Depression, shows the depths of the iconic company's financial problems.GE (GE) is one of America's most widely held stocks, and countless shareholders, including retirees, rely on the dividend payments.But the company is under enormous pressure to restore investor confidence shaken by a serious cash crunch.The stock has lost 40% of its value this year.GE plunged 8% on Monday, to the lowest level in five and a half years, after the company announced the restructuring and diminished financial targets.The new dividend will be 12 cents a share, down from 24 cents.GE had been one of the biggest dividend payers in the United States, behind giants like ExxonMobil (XOM), Apple (AAPL, Tech30) and Microsoft (MSFT, Tech30).By cutting the dividend in half, GE will save more than $4 billion per year.That makes it one of the largest dividend cuts in the history of the S&P 500 and the biggest since 2009, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices.GE made an even bigger dividend cut in 2009, during the Great Recession.But dividend cuts are rare these days.Many companies are increasing them because the U.S. economy is healthy and the stock market is booming.Related: The incredible shrinking GE is about to get even smaller The problem for GE is that it's not making enough money to cover its dividend payments.Free cash flow, which measures how much cash is being generated after investing in the business, has deteriorated for six straight years.Even after the painful dividend cut, about 85% of GE's estimated free cash flow will go toward dividend payments, according to JPMorgan.That's well above rivals like Honeywell (HON) and United Technologies (UTX) and speaks to the seriousness of the cash crunch.The dividend isn't the only thing getting smaller at GE.The company also unveiled plans to shrink its board of directors from 18 members to a dozen next year.The new board will also include a committee focused on how GE spends its money.GE has also cut its workforce, which totaled about 295,000 at the end of 2016.GE told investors on Monday that its corporate headcount will be 25% smaller in 2018.A person familiar with the matter told CNNMoney that about 1,500 jobs were eliminated and the cuts are almost complete.The person said the job cuts focused mostly on corporate functions like GE's global research center and its global growth organization, which promotes international sales.GE also plans to get rid of $20 billion worth of businesses in the next year or two, including the transportation division, which houses the century-old railroad business that makes locomotives and rail equipment.Among other units on the chopping block, GE reiterated a desire to sell the light bulb business that has symbolized the company for 125 years.John Flannery, GE's new CEO, said during a presentation that the company is considering "exit options" for Baker Hughes.(BHGE) Baker Hughes is majority-owned by GE and was only formed last year by combining the two companies' oil and gas businesses.While Flannery said the merger is "going well," he expressed concern over how much the business depends on volatile energy prices.GE has already gotten rid of its real estate portfolio, its dishwasher and appliance business, and media properties NBC and Universal Studios.More recently, it unloaded its water business and a unit that makes electrical equipment for utilities.Related: GE is breaking up with the light bulb All this is part of GE's mission to focus on being a modern industrial company that sells things like jet engines, power plants and MRI machines.Yet some of GE's core businesses are struggling, especially the power division, which has been hurt as utilities switch to renewable energy like solar.GE warned it now expects to make just $1 to $1.07 per share next year.That's roughly half of the goal GE had less than a year ago.Flannery wants to bring more accountability to GE, in part by revamping its pay structure.Under the new plan, about half of senior execs' compensation will come from stock rewards, compared with only 20% now."This is our time to reinvent the company," Flannery told employees."This is our time to show our passion, our fury and our resolve.It's game on."
Iran: Total may have to rethink Iran deal due to Trump:::::President Trump's get-tough approach to Iran could kill a huge energy investment signed just four months ago.Under the deal, Total (TOT) and China's CNPC agreed to invest billions of dollars in Iran to develop the giant South Pars gas field in partnership with Iran's Petropars.It was the first investment of its kind since sanctions on Iran were relaxed in 2016 after Tehran promised to roll back its nuclear program.Trump has threatened to quit the nuclear deal if the U.S. Congress and America's allies fail to strengthen it."Either we can do the deal legally if there is a legal framework," Total CEO Patrick Pouyann told CNNMoney Emerging Markets Editor John Defterios."If we cannot do that for legal reasons, because of [a] change of [the] regime of sanctions, then we have to revisit it."Trump unveiled a tough and comprehensive new policy towards Iran last month.He accused Tehran of violating the nuclear accord, and announced that he would no longer certify that the lifting of sanctions was in U.S. interests.The agreement is now effectively in limbo while Congress decides how to respond, but Trump's strategy risks setting off a chain of events that ends up derailing the nuclear deal.Total is expanding in the U.S. "If there is a sanctions regime [on Iran], we have to look at it carefully," said Pouyann."We work in the U.S., we have assets in the U.S., we just acquired more assets in the U.S." Total last week increased its U.S. presence with the purchase of a portfolio of liquified natural gas assets from Engie (ENGIY), including the company's stake in the Cameron LNG project in Louisiana, one of the first new gas export terminals in North America.That deal ups the stakes for the French firm.For now, though, it's business as usual in Iran."We are working on the project.We launched the tenders, we should award... contracts by January," Pouyann said."I hope by that time, Congress will have an answer for the president and the president will have to renew, or not [renew], the certification."Losing Total would be a huge blow for Iran.Tehran needs foreign investment to develop its vast energy potential and it was recently touting projects worth $200 billion in the hope of attracting companies such as BP (BP), Russia's Gazprom (GZPFY) and Petronas of Malaysia.
Oil prices won't spike much higher, says BP CEO:::::Oil prices have been on a tear since June, gaining about 33%.BP boss Bob Dudley says that may be all for now."I don't expect there to be a real spike in the markets barring some geopolitical event," Dudley told CNNMoney Emerging Markets Editor John Defterios on Monday."I've always said we're in the $50-$60 range until the end of the decade."U.S. crude futures are currently trading at around $56 a barrel, and Brent crude is trading even higher at $63.Oil crashed in late 2014 and 2015 before hitting a low of around $26 in February 2016.It has since recovered thanks to supply curbs agreed by OPEC members and some other major producers, such as Russia, a year ago.In May, the group extended the deal to the end of March 2018."OPEC has done something unprecedented by not only working with their own countries, but 24 countries," said the BP (BP) CEO."It does seem there is cohesion around this... a healthy price above $50 is good for the world."A recovery in the global economy has also helped."There's higher demand than we projected for oil and gasoline globally," Dudley said at an oil conference in Abu Dhabi."Economic growth around the world is also strong."Related: India, not China, will lead future demand for energy Rising tensions in the Middle East have probably added about $5 a barrel to the price of oil, he said.Rivals Saudi Arabia and Iran are fighting several proxy wars including in Lebanon, Syria and Yemen.Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen fired a ballistic missile earlier this month aimed at Riyadh's international airport.The missile was intercepted but Saudi Arabia described the attack as an "act of war" by Iran and said it would take "appropriate measures."
Russia may build its new jetliners in the Middle East:::::Russia isn't just trying to sell its new airliner abroad.It might build it there, too.State-owned military-industrial giant Rostec, which is responsible for exporting Russian technology, said Sunday that it has started talks to jointly produce a commercial plane overseas -- potentially in the United Arab Emirates.The short statement, which coincided with the start of the Dubai air show, didn't provide much detail.But Russia is trying to increase exports of its new large single-aisle airliner, the Irkut MC-21, which competes directly with Boeing (BA) and Airbus (EADSF) planes.One strategy that plane makers employ to boost sales is using overseas manufacturing to gain market access with local airlines.Europe's Airbus, for example, opened final assembly lines for its A320 jets in China and the U.S. to produce planes specifically to attract airlines in both countries.The UAE is home to two of the world's biggest carriers, Emirates and Etihad, as well as several smaller ones.Related: China and Russia are coming for Boeing and Airbus The MC-21, the first Russian-made airliner of its size since the fall of the Soviet Union, is backed at the highest levels of the Russian government.President Vladimir Putin has pushed for Rostec and state-owned United Aircraft Corporation (UAC) to increase sales of the plane to both Russian and foreign airlines.Rostec said it held talks about the potential joint production of the plane with Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan, the powerful crown prince of Abu Dhabi.The UAE has been eager to expand its aerospace industry into manufacturing.Companies based in the country already produce some parts for Boeing and Airbus jets.A Rostec spokesperson said it was too early to say what joint production would mean in practice.It could entail anything from assembly of completed MC-21 jetliners in the UAE to manufacturing components for jets that will be produced in Russia."Specific parameters will be determined during [the] negotiation process," the spokesperson said.Russia is increasingly open to cross-border partnerships to expand its aerospace industry.UAC has teamed up with China's Comac to design and produce a new long range twin-aisle airliner, but that plane's not expected to be ready for at least another eight to 10 years.Related: The world's new planes in 2017 The aircraft Rostec and UAC may build in the UAE would be based on the largest version, the MC-21-400, that seats up to 250 passengers and competes directly with the biggest single-aisle jets from Boeing and Airbus.A smaller version, the MC-21-300, has been carrying out early flight trials since May.Many MC-21 parts comes from Western suppliers: Its engines, for example, are made by Connecticut-based Pratt & Whitney.But final assembly of the aircraft is completed in the Siberian city of Irkutsk.Russian aircraft company Sukhoi, which is also a unit of UAC, partnered for a time with Italy's biggest aerospace company to install interiors of its new Superjet regional airliner in Venice for European customers.
New TPP Pacific trade deal could leave U.S. playing catchup:::::Is America still the indispensable nation?Not when it comes to free trade talks in Asia-Pacific.President Trump yanked the U.S. out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership in January, apparently sinking the world's biggest proposed free trade deal.But the countries he left in the lurch are moving closer to a new version of the agreement -- minus the U.S. Trade ministers from the 11 remaining nations -- which include Japan, Canada, Mexico, and Australia -- agreed on the "core elements" of a new deal over the weekend but said more work needs to be done to reach a full agreement.Related: Trump delivers 'America first' speech at Asia-Pacific economic summit Brokered on the sidelines of a summit of Pacific nations in Vietnam, the initial accord is "a huge, huge step forward," said Alexander Capri, a senior fellow at National University of Singapore's Business School.It shows the willingness of countries across Asia and the Americas to move on with broad free trade deals in the face of Trump's "America first" rhetoric, -- of which he delivered a strong dose at the Vietnam summit.The pursuit of a new-look TPP also highlights the desire of countries like Japan to try to curb China's increasing influence in the region and beyond.'A large vacuum' in U.S. policy Trump's withdrawal from TPP left the U.S. with "a large vacuum in its economic diplomacy" in the region, according to Sanchita Basu-Das, a fellow at the ASEAN Studies Centre in Singapore.Trump has expressed preference for negotiating one-on-one trade agreements with other countries, saying he can ensure a better deal for American workers.But remaining TPP members like Japan and Vietnam, whom Trump visited on his Asia tour, will be less inclined to do one-on-one trade deals with the U.S. if the new TPP is finalized soon, according to Capri."The Trump team basically just wants to pound these guys into submission," he said."No trade partner of the U.S. wants to do a bilateral with them."Related: These are the companies behind Trump's $250 billion of China deals Capri predicts Trump could face pressure at home if U.S. companies start losing business in TPP countries to competitors from places like Canada and Australia.U.S. could rejoin down the road The U.S. president made his feelings clear about multilateral trade deals in Vietnam on Friday, saying they "tie our hands, surrender our sovereignty and make meaningful enforcement practically impossible."But some experts think the U.S. absence from the TPP may only be a temporary one."I anticipate that there will be mechanisms available for the U.S. to join at a later stage," said David Rothwell, a professor of international law at Australia National University's College of Law.Related: Trump's trade flashpoints in Asia It's still not clear, though, when a final deal will be reached on the revised TPP, which is now being called the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership.Some reports suggested it could happen fast -- in early 2018."I'm confident that we will be able to reach an agreement in the not too distant future," Australian Trade Minister Steven Ciobo said Sunday.The new deal would cut barriers on trade in goods and services between the 11 markets, which make up about 15% of the global economy.It also includes rules on environmental and labor standards.Importantly, key provisions on e-commerce and cross-border data flows have survived the U.S. pullout and the remaining sticking points appear to be fairly small, according to Capri.Countering China Countries like Japan are eager to use the salvaged TPP to counter China's growing sway.Beijing is increasingly seeking to influence the region, notably through its Belt and Road Initiative that aims to foster greater trade across Asia and Europe through huge investments in things like roads, railways and ports."Major Asian powers will continue to seek opportunities to balance against China -- with or without the U.S." tweeted Abraham Denmark, director of the Asia program at the Woodrow Wilson International Center.And despite Trump's withdrawal from TPP, China won't necessarily find it easy to draw countries fully into its orbit.Related: China opens up its finance industry to the world Basu-Das says governments in Southeast Asia are wary, pointing out that Chinese investment often comes with strings attached, like bringing in Chinese workers and materials.Recent signals from China that it wants to take the lead in globalization "ring hollow," Capri said.Chinese President Xi Jinping talked up his country as a defender of global trade at Davos in January.But Capri says Beijing's subsidizing of state-owned enterprises and dumping of excess goods in global markets suggest it isn't ready yet to lead by example.
GE faces 2nd dividend cut since Great Depression:::::1.GE's cash crunch: General Electric in such financial stress that it may soon do the unthinkable: cut its beloved dividend.John Flannery, GE's new chief executive, is under enormous pressure to restore confidence in a company facing a serious cash crunch and a nosediving stock price.One-third of GE's market value has vanished this year, making it the biggest Dow loser by a long shot.GE (GE) is holding an investor update on Monday to detail a strategy to stabilize the company by slashing costs and selling off more businesses.Wall Street analysts are bracing for Flannery to announce layoffs and just the second cut to GE's coveted dividend since the Great Depression.GE confirmed in a statement on Friday that "employee reductions," some of which have already begun, are part of a previously-announced plan to cut costs by $3 billion.After GE reported awful results last month, Flannery said the dividend remains a "priority," but he didn't rule out a reduction.The problem is GE isn't generating enough cash to cover dividend payouts promised to shareholders.It's a stunning development given GE's iconic status and a sprawling business that makes everything from jet engines and light bulbs to MRI machines.GE is one of America's most widely-held stocks, making a decision to cut the dividend even tougher.Countless shareholders, including retirees, have come to rely on the quarterly dividend payments."Retail investors have stuck with GE through many, many years of underperformance simply because they've counted on that dividend," said John Inch, a Deutsche Bank analyst with a "sell" rating on GE."If you cut that dividend, all of a sudden that confidence is shaken," Inch said.GE says it's been paying its dividend for more than a century, "proving its strength and reliability."The first dividend cut occurred in 1938 in the midst of the Great Depression.The company also cut its dividend in 2009 during the Great Recession.But unlike those times, such moves are rare right now.Many companies are ramping up their dividends because the U.S. economy is healthy and the stock market is booming.2.Movement on tax reform: The GOP tax plan is marching along.Senate Republicans unveiled the contents of their tax reform bill on Thursday, a week after their House colleagues released their own legislation.The House legislation also cleared the Ways & Means Committee.Compass Point Research, an investment and research firm, predicts that the House will consider and may pass the GOP tax plan next week.It's no surprise that things are moving quickly.Republicans in the House and Senate have vowed to present President Trump with a plan before the end of the year.For businesses, there are a few key differences between the House and the Senate's version of the bill, including when a corporate tax cut would take effect and how pass-through business income is taxed.The National Federation of Independent Business, which came out against the House's plan, said it was "very encouraged" by the Senate's revisions.Of course, much work remains: The House and Senate bills' differences have to be reconciled and Republicans hold only a razor-thin lead in the Senate.3.U.K. unemployment remains low: The U.K. Office for National Statistics will reveal its latest employment figures on Wednesday.Despite Brexit fears, unemployment in Britain is very low.In the spring, British unemployment hit its lowest point in 42 years.Since then, it has moved even lower, holding steady at around 4.3% in recent months.But low unemployment doesn't necessarily mean all is well in the U.K.According to the latest data, average weekly earnings fell by 0.4% without bonuses, when adjusting for inflation, compared to the same period last year.And at the start of the year, banks began planning an exit strategy from their London offices -- suggesting that the city's days as a financial hub may be numbered.4.Retail's bright spots: Retailers will continue revealing their financial results next week.On deck are some of the industry's strongest performers.Shares of Home Depot (HD), which is set to report on Tuesday, have spiked by more than 20% this year.Best Buy (BBY) and Walmart (WMT), both set to report on Wednesday, have each soared by more than 30% this year.Their success marks a bright spot in the dismal retail landscape.Some struggling retailers are also set to report next week.Target (TGT), L Brands (LB), Gap (GPS), Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF) and TJX (TJX) are more representative of the retail industry -- they have painted a much more pessimistic picture.5.Will oil continue to rally?Oil prices have been rising for five weeks straight, and they recently hit a two-year high.A few events next week could determine whether that rally continues.Oil ministers will meet at the Abu Dhabi International Petroleum Exhibition and Conference on Monday through Thursday, and OPEC will release its next monthly oil report on Monday.On Tuesday, the International Energy Agency will reveal its World Energy Outlook.Taken together, these reports will offer clues into projections for both supply and demand for oil.6.Coming this week: Monday -- GE hosts key meeting Tuesday -- Home Depot, TJX earnings Wednesday -- Target, Cisco (CSCO, Tech30), L Brands earnings; U.S. retail sales for October; U.K. unemployment Thursday -- Best Buy, Walmart, Gap, Viacom (VIA) earnings Friday -- Abercrombie & Fitch earnings
Alibaba: Singles Day sales hit record $25 billion in 24 hours:::::The biggest shopping day on the planet raked in an eye-popping $25.4 billion.Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba (BABA, Tech30) said Saturday that sales soared past $18 billion after just 13 hours of the retail blitz known as Singles Day, eclipsing the $17.8 billion it managed in the full 24 hours last year.Singles Day, a bonanza of online spending in China, has for years racked up more sales than Black Friday and Cyber Monday combined.Earlier in the day, Alibaba said eager shoppers had managed to spend $1 billion in just 2 minutes.As the clock struck midnight in Shanghai, the final sales tally rang in at $25,386,927,848, marking about a 40% increase over last year's record-setting sales total.Singles Day started out as an informal holiday in China celebrating single people on a day that epitomizes not being paired off: 11/11.Alibaba turned it into a festival of discount deals in 2009.Related: Black Friday 2017: When will the stores open?Alibaba has used the now-massive event to lure international companies onto its platforms.More than 40% of the brands taking part this year came from outside China, according to research firm eMarketer Retail.And while Singles Day still mostly targets Chinese consumers, it's also increasingly spreading to other countries, experts say.Local players in Southeast Asia like Lazada (an Alibaba subsidiary), Zalora and Shopee launched their own Singles Day promotions this year, said Xiaofeng Wang, an analyst with research firm Forrester.Related: It's not just Amazon: Chinese tech giants are selling groceries too The event is also evolving beyond its original conception as an online shopping spree.Alibaba and its main Chinese rival, JD.com, have both made significant investments in brick-and-mortar businesses.And they're using the popularity of Singles Day to drive shoppers to offline stores, too.Cosmetics giant L'Oreal (LRLCF), for example, set up an interactive mirror at its Shanghai store where shoppers could try on virtual makeup using augmented reality and then order products on a touch screen linked to an Alibaba platform.But beyond the blockbuster sales, Singles Day also creates an enormous amount of waste.Greenpeace said the manufacturing, packaging and shipping linked to the event produced 258,000 tons of carbon dioxide emissions last year.It would take about 2.6 billion trees to absorb it all.The environmental activist group estimates this year's shopping blitz is on track to leave an even bigger carbon footprint."More over-consumption means more CO2 emissions and waste," said Greenpeace campaigner Nie Li.
Alan Greenspan: Big tax cuts a 'mistake.' Fix the debt first:::::Alan Greenspan has a message for President Trump and Congress: Now is not the time for big tax cuts.Greenspan, the former Federal Reserve chief and Republican economic adviser, is worried about how tax cuts will worsen America's mountain of debt."Economically, it's a mistake to deal with sharp reductions in taxes now," Greenspan told Fox Business on Thursday."We are premature on fiscal stimulus, whether it's tax cuts or expenditure increases.We've got to get the debt stabilized before we can even think of those terms," Greenspan said.That stands in stark contrast to the urgent pleas for lower taxes by Trump, who during the campaign dubbed himself the "king of debt."Trump argues the American economy "desperately" needs "massive" tax cuts.That's despite accelerating economic growth and the lowest unemployment rate in 17 years.The White House has said tax cuts are needed to keep the momentum going and improve wage growth, which remains disappointing.Related: What's in the Senate Republicans' tax bill Greenspan, who was appointed Fed chair by both Republican and Democratic presidents, argues the United States is already at "full employment."He predicted supply and demand for labor will cause wages to "accelerate" on their own.Rather than adding to the national debt, Greenspan says Congress needs to put the country on a sustainable fiscal path."What we ought to be concerned about is the fact that the federal debt is rising at a very rapid pace.There is nothing in this bill that will essentially stop that from happening," Greenspan told Fox Business.When he led the Fed, Greenspan's words were treated like gospel by economists and investors alike, and the press dubbed him the Maestro.But critics have since argued Greenspan's support for light regulation and low interest rates contributed to the 2008 financial crisis.Still, neutral observers agree that the House GOP tax bill would make the national debt worse.The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates the federal deficit would increase by $1.7 trillion over 10 years under the plan, including the impact of higher borrowing costs.Under the tax bill, the CBO expects debt held by the public would rise to 97.1% of gross domestic product by 2027, compared with 91.2% under the existing tax structure.Debt-to-GDP currently stands at about 75%.The House GOP bill would permanently cut the corporate tax rate to 20% from 35%, consolidate income tax brackets for individuals from seven to four and repeal or limit many deductions.The Senate tax bill would change the rate on taxable income for some of the seven individual tax brackets.It would also slash the corporate rate to 20%, but the cut wouldn't take effect until 2019.Related: Is now really the time for massive tax cuts?The White House argues that these changes will speed up the economy enough that they'll pay for themselves in the long run."We see the whole trickle-down through the economy, and that's good for the economy," Gary Cohn, Trump's top economic adviser, told CNBC.Greenspan generally supports the idea of a 20% corporate tax rate to make the United States more competitive with lower-tax countries."It's probably wise to bring down the corporate rate," Greenspan said."But don't look to that as a major factor in expanding the economy."--CNN's Jeanne Sahadi and Phil Mattingly contributed to this report.
Canadian marijuana investors cheer dollar-per-gram tax proposal:::::Investors are loving the Canadian government's proposal to tax legal weed at a dollar per gram.On Friday, the country's Department of Finance reiterated the government's commitment to legalizing the drug for recreational use.It also laid out a plan to levy an excise tax on cannabis products at 1 Canadian dollar per gram (USD $0.79) or 10% of the sale price, whichever is higher.The proposal sent shares of Canadian marijuana companies soaring.The government says the new tax framework will apply to medical marijuana, which is already legal in the country, and recreational products, which the administration has promised to make lawful "no later than July 2018.""The proposed level of taxation is intended to keep prices low to eliminate the black market," according to a notice from Canada's finance department.Related: New Jersey could become the next legal pot state Investors in Aurora Cannabis (ACBFF), a medical marijuana grower that trades on the Toronto Stock Exchange, saw its stock price shoot up nearly 15%.Shares of three other medicinal weed producers trading on the TSE -- MedReleaf (MEDFF), Canopy (TWMJF), Aphria (APHQF), -- each saw their shares climb 3% to 5%.An excise tax is paid in additional to general sales taxes.General sales tax rates across Canada's provinces range from 5% to 15% of the sale price.Even with the excise and sales tax, Canadians may be able to snag their weed for a lower price than some areas of the U.S. Because marijuana is still outlawed on the federal level in the United States, lawmakers on Capitol Hill have yet to tax the drug.But states that have legalized weed have slapped on some hefty taxes.Related: It pays to be a scientist in the marijuana industry In California, where recreational weed sales will be legal beginning January 1, the state is planning to pin a 15% excise tax on weed sales, and consumers will also be on the hook for sales taxes ranging from 22.25% to 24.25%.Between taxes paid by producers, retailers and customers, weed taxes may reach as high as 45% in parts of the state, according to a recent Fitch Ratings report.The tax rates could be enough to keep the black market healthy, one group of Fitch Ratings analysts suggested.In Colorado, where weed has been legal since 2014, the state charges a 2.9% sales tax plus a 15% excise tax and a special 20% sales tax for recreational marijuana.Canada's tax proposal is not set in stone.The government is giving residents until December 7, 2017 to submit feedback.The government says money collected from the marijuana excise tax will be "divided equally between the province or territory and the federal government.""Revenues raised from the taxation regime will help support investments in public education, enforcement, research and other activities integral to an effective system of legalization and regulation of cannabis," according to the Department of Finance.--CNNMoney's Aaron Smith contributed to this report.
China opens up its finance industry to the world:::::Wall Street could soon find it easier to do business in China.Beijing says it will allow foreign companies to own Chinese banks and investment firms in the latest sign the world's second-biggest economy is opening up its vast financial industry.China's vice minister for finance Zhu Guangyao revealed the changes during a press briefing Friday.A cap on foreign investment in Chinese banks will be removed.And foreign investors will be allowed to own 51% in securities firms, investment managers and life insurance providers.Zhu said the new rules would come into play "soon."He gave no further details on timing.Big Western banks are largely absent in China -- only HSBC (HSBC) has a significant presence through its 19% stake in Bank of Communications -- but they are keen to take advantage of the country's growing wealth.The restrictive ownership rules in China's sector have been a big bone of contention for U.S. firms in the recent past.As foreign banks were only allowed minority shareholdings, they had limited influence over big decisions.That's why JPMorgan (JPM) sold a minority stake in its investment banking joint venture in the country last year.But CEO Jamie Dimon has since said he would be up for a second crack at China if the bank could control its business there, and a spokesman for America's biggest bank welcomed the rule change.JPMorgan would "evaluate viable options to strengthen its position in China," the spokesperson added.A top European bank voiced similar approval."The Chinese government's decision to allow foreign companies to take up to 51% in securities joint venture represents an important step in further opening up China's financial sector," said Eugene Qian, chairman of UBS's (UBS) China Strategy Board.The news came at the end of President Trump's visit to China this week.Trump frequently points out China's huge trade surplus with the U.S., which stood at almost $350 billion last year.Making it easier for American firms to sell financial services in China could help to achieve a better trade balance.Experts said the changes had been in the works for a while.Related: These are the companies behind Trump's $250 billion in trade deals A $33 trillion market "These reforms were already in Xi Jinping's playbook," said Aidan Yao, an economist at AXA Investment Managers, referring to the Chinese president.Still, they could prove tantalizing for foreign investors.China's financial sector is the world's second-biggest, with $33 trillion in assets."China's size and growth potential are irresistible attractions," Yao added.China has good reasons for making it easier for foreign financial firms to do business.Many of the big banks and financial services companies in China are owned by the government and lend a lot of cash to inefficient state-owned enterprises.People's Bank of China governor Zhou Xiaochuan recently said that a lack of outside competition could lead to "laziness" in the financial sector.Zhou has called for the market to play a bigger role in who banks lend to.Inefficient allocation of capital has left China with huge levels corporate debt relative to the size of its economy.That's led to an increase in the number of so-called zombie companies, unproductive businesses kept alive only via a drip feed of credit.Opening up the sector to more foreign competition and expertise could force Chinese banks to become more efficient in how and where they lend money, said Larry Hu, chief China economist at Macquarie.But some China experts cautioned against getting too excited about the planned changes."The devil is in the detail," said James McGregor, former CEO of Dow Jones in China and now Greater China chairman of public relations firm APCO Worldwide.China could still fudge regulations so local companies have a competitive advantage over foreign ones, he added.Related: How China plans to beat the U.S. at technology The American Chamber of Commerce in China gave a cautious welcome.Investment restrictions "have been hindering economic activity in China for far too long," Chairman William Zarit said.China has been taking baby steps to open up its financial system in recent years, including making it easier for foreigners to invest in its stock market.-- Steven Jiang in Beijing contributed to this report.

Market stumbles over concerns about GOP tax reform:::::The Dow snapped a 5-day streak of records, as the fate of tax reform hangs in the balance.The index fell as much as 250 points Thursday, before recovering to a decline of roughly 100 points.Analysts said that investors were worried about whether the Republican legislation can pass, citing dissent on key provisions and reports that the Senate's GOP plan would delay corporate tax cuts until 2019."There's two competing bills, and one's more horrible than the next," said Michael Block, chief market strategist at Rhino Trading Partners.The markets have soared under President Trump, at least in part on hopes that his administration would pass tax reform and cut regulations."There's a certain amount of optimism baked into the market, particularly [with regard to] corporate taxes being cut," said Andres Garcia-Amaya, global market strategist at Zoe Financial, an independent wealth management firm.Related: Trump rally: 3rd best since World War II The Dow had closed higher seven days in a row and was at a record for the past five days.Luckily, Garcia-Amaya said, the health of the markets isn't solely dependent on whether or not tax reform gets done."Earnings have done really well -- not just here but globally," he said."The global economy is basically experiencing a synchronized expansion, which we haven't seen in decades."But as tax negotiations shake out, things are expected to be a bit bumpy.Corporate earnings season is coming to a close, which means the focus will shift to Washington, said Jeff Carbone, managing partner for Cornerstone Financial Partners."There will be more time to concentrate on the items of the day," he said."Certainly tax reform is the big one."-- CNNMoney's Matt Egan contributed reporting.
Roku dazzles thanks to its booming ad business:::::Most people think of Roku as a hardware company that makes streaming boxes, dongles and TVs.But it turns out that Roku's most exciting business is advertising.In its first-ever earnings report after going public in September, Roku was propelled by booming ad sales.Roku sells ads that show up on its customers' TV screens.Roku (ROKU)surged 48% on Thursday.Roku's sales from ads and licensing agreements with content providers more than doubled from last year to $57.5 million.That part of the business now makes up nearly half of Roku's total sales after accounting for just 27% of revenue last year.CEO Anthony Wood noted that the company was "becoming a large ad platform" on a call with investors Wednesday.Hardware remains important to the company -- it needs new users to bolster ad revenue.Roku reported a 48% increase in active users from last year.16.7 million people now have Roku accounts, making it the most popular streaming device in the country.Roku TVs, which are made by TCL, were the company's fastest source of those new accounts.But revenue from its hardware business slowed to less than 4%.That's because Roku slashed prices on products as a way to attract new customers and fend off streaming rivals Google Chromecast, Apple TV and Amazon Fire.It makes sense that Roku wants to expand beyond hardware sales.Ad and content agreements are a far cheaper source of revenue than making set-tops and dongles and selling them for low prices (Roku slings start at under $40 and TVs are under $140).And content providers and advertisers are more than happy to accommodate Roku's strategy shift thanks to more and more consumers cutting the cord.More than 60% of 18-to 29-year-olds say they watch TV primarily through online streaming, according to a September Pew survey."It's a great time to be in the streaming business," said Wood.
U.S. hits 10 more Venezuelan leaders with sanctions:::::The Trump administration hit 10 more officials in crisis-ridden Venezuela with sanctions on Thursday, after recent elections there were deemed a fraud.The officials are part of President Nicolas Maduro's regime.The United States and other governments have labeled him a dictator.Under the sanctions, the officials will have their U.S. assets frozen, and Americans are barred from doing business with them."We will maintain our vigorous efforts to sanction Venezuelan government officials ... unless they break from Maduro's dictatorial regime," Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said.Mnuchin has now sanctioned more than 30 Venezuelan leaders this year, including Maduro and Vice President Tareck El Aissami.The Trump administration has also barred banks from trading or buying newly issued Venezuelan debt.The latest round of sanctions covers Ernesto Villegas, the culture minister, and Carlos Osorio, the former food minister.They were imposed after Maduro's party won regional elections in a landslide in October.Related: Venezuela: We can't pay our debts anymore The sanctions hit at a critical time for Venezuela, which is on the verge of default after it missed a major payment to bond investors this week.A default would have grim consequences for Venezuela's 30 million citizens, who are already suffering through severe shortages of basic food and medicine.Children are dying in hospitals, and people are starving.Investors would have the right to seize Venezuela's assets, such as oil, outside the country.Because the government relies almost entirely on exporting oil to make money, it could quickly run out of cash to buy food and medicine.Maduro announced last week that Venezuela plans to restructure or refinance more than $60 billion in debt.Many investors and experts took that to mean that he will stop paying bondholders and default soon.The debt crisis could move quickly in the coming days.A regulatory committee will meet in New York on Friday and could determine whether Venezuela has in fact defaulted.It's unclear whether the state-run oil company, PDVSA, made a payment due on November 2.The grace period ended this week.Related: The chaos in Venezuela could get much worse Another key date is Monday.El Aissami, the vice president, has invited investors to Venezuela to discuss future debt payments.But because he's sanctioned -- the United States accuses him of drug trafficking -- investors can't negotiate with him.Bondholders can't speak with Venezuela's finance minister, Simon Zerpa, either.He was sanctioned in July."You can't sign anything with the president, the finance minister, the vice president and essentially anyone who would be at the meeting," says Fernando Freijedo, a Latin America analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit research firm."Logistically, [the meeting] seems impossible."Although American investors are allowed to go to Venezuela for the meeting, it's unclear whether any will, given the conditions.Related: Venezuela is blaming Trump for missed debt payments Some experts say the meeting is a political maneuver: Venezuelan leaders can say they tried to negotiate with investors.Maduro has long said his country's problems are the result of an "economic war" waged by the United States."The invitation could either be a political tactic to blame bondholders or political propaganda to give the impression that they are resolving the debt problem," says Siobhan Morden, head of Latin America fixed income at Nomura.Morden wouldn't say whether Nomura holds Venezuelan debt.Another investor who requested anonymity because he holds Venezuelan debt said he has no plans to go to Caracas because El Aissami is sanctioned.Venezuelan bonds have tanked this week after Maduro called for a restructuring.The oil company PDVSA's bond maturing in 2019 tanked to 27 cents on the dollar from 48 cents last week, according to MarketAxess BondTicker.
Starbucks' Howard Schultz slams GOP tax plan as 'fool's gold':::::Many business leaders are cheering the corporate tax cuts proposed by President Trump and the GOP.And then there's Howard Schultz.The Starbucks (SBUX) executive chairman slammed the House Republican tax proposal for being too heavily skewed toward tax cuts, instead of giving the outdated system much-needed reform."This is not tax reform.This is a tax cut.This is fool's gold," Schultz said on Thursday at the New York Times DealBook Conference in Manhattan.Schultz, who stepped down as Starbucks CEO this year, said corporate America "does not need" the proposed corporate tax cut from 35% to 20%."The tax cut proposal is not going to create a more leveled playing field and a more compassionate society," he said.Of course, Schultz, a Democrat who backed Hillary Clinton in 2016, could merely be positioning himself for a long-rumored run for president.Asked about a bid for the White House, Schultz said he's "deeply concerned about the country," but "not thinking today about running for president."The Starbucks exec isn't the only one expressing skepticism about the tax plan.Barclays published a report Wednesday saying the GOP tax plan "is skewed in the direction of tax cuts over reform."Barclays noted that "tax cuts tend to produce temporary effects, rather than permanent ones."Related: These powerful business groups hate the GOP tax plan The critical comments from Schultz come just hours after Gary Cohn, President Trump's top economic adviser, talked up the tax plan's support from big business."The most excited group out there are big CEOs," Cohn told CNBC.Pushing back against claims that the tax overhaul would only help business and the wealthy, Cohn predicted companies will return to the United States and workers will get a much-needed raise."We see the whole trickle-down through the economy, and that's good for the economy," he said.The GOP tax plan has received strong support from the Business Roundtable, an influential group of CEOs that champions pro-business policy.On Tuesday, the organization released a national cable TV ad featuring an Illinois manufacturing company to press for tax reform.Related: What's in the House GOP tax bill for businesses But other powerful lobbying groups are trying to kill the GOP tax bill because it would close or limit deductions they covet.For instance, the real estate industry is warning that the housing market could be hurt by proposed limits on deductions for mortgage interest and state and local property taxes.Yet Starbucks itself would seemingly benefit from tax cuts.The coffee giant's effective tax rate last year was 33%, according to Howard Silverblatt at S&P Dow Jones Indices.Asked what Starbucks would do with savings created by the proposed tax cuts, Schultz said at the DealBook conference that the company would not just add it to its profits."We will find other ways to create a contribution back to either the communities we serve, the many initiatives we have about veterans and obviously our people for benefits," Schultz said.
Dubai gets sucked into Saudi corruption turmoil:::::Saudi Arabia's campaign against corruption is hurting companies and markets beyond its borders.Some of the biggest names in Dubai real estate saw their shares slump this week as regional markets were hit by fallout from the Saudi anti-corruption purge at the weekend.The sell-off was triggered by concerns about the exposure of companies in Dubai to Saudi business, the risk of Saudis pulling their money out of the United Arab Emirates, and broader fears about regional stability.In a surprise move on Saturday, at least 49 Saudi princes, businessmen and officials were rounded up and accused of corruption.The list includes Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, the billionaire businessman who owns a global network of major investments.He has been charged with money laundering, bribery and extortion, a Saudi official told CNN.His company, Kingdom Holding, has not responded to requests for comment."The market is driven by the recent geopolitical tension in the region and that's causing investors to panic," said Tariq Qaqish, managing director of asset management at Menacorp in Dubai."We expect the market to continue to be volatile due to the uncertainty."The Dubai stock market -- the most active the Gulf region after Saudi Arabia -- posted losses for four straight days following news of the purge.It ended the week down 5%.Emaar, the developer behind the Burj Khalifa -- the world's tallest tower -- saw its shares fall 6% this week.And Damac, which built a Trump branded golf course in Dubai, plunged 8%.Both developers are heavily exposed to the fortunes of Dubai's real estate market, and also have several projects in Saudi Arabia.Related: Riyadh's Ritz-Carlton: Luxury hotel or detention center for Saudi royals?There are deep political and commercial ties between Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates: more than a million Saudis visit Dubai every year.They're also close allies, leading a boycott against neighboring Qatar, accusing it of funding terrorism (a charge Qatar denies), and fighting Houthi rebels in Yemen.The potential for the UAE to be drawn even deeper into the Saudi turmoil was underscored by reports that it had asked banks for information on the accounts of 19 Saudi royals and officials.According to a central bank notice widely shared on social media, UAE authorities want banks to "immediately" search and report on activity on any financial instrument held in the UAE by Alwaleed and others.CNN could not independently verify the document.The central bank did not respond to a request for comment.Saudi Arabia said Thursday that corruption had cost the kingdom $100 billion over decades.Also unnerving investors in the region is the prospect of an escalation in the proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran in Yemen.Iran-backed Houthi rebels targeted an airport in Saudi Arabia's capital with a ballistic missile earlier this week.Saudi officials said the missile was intercepted.In comments reported by the state-run Saudi Press Agency, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman told British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson that Iran's actions "may be considered an act of war against the kingdom.""I believe... [this] could be the start of more upheaval in the Gulf," said Meshal Al Faras, regional head at Janus Capital."The normal reaction is to reduce risk" by selling shares, he added.Related: Saudi Arabia tries to 'clean house' with stunning purge Saudi Arabia's anti-corruption committee is headed by the crown prince.It has the authority to investigate, arrest, issue travel bans and freeze the assets of those it finds corrupt.Prince Mohammed is also leading the country's economic overhaul to reduce its dependency on oil.Fitch rating agency on Thursday said the recent arrests could concentrate power in the hands of the crown prince, bolstering his economic and social reforms, but also raises the risk of a backlash.
Macy's is stuck in an epic losing streak: Sales drop for 11th quarter in a row:::::Macy's sales keep shrinking as Americans stay away from the mall.Revenue tumbled 6.1% last quarter, the 11th straight quarterly decline.It was a deeper slide than Wall Street had feared.The good news is that Macy's made more money than expected.And although Macy's already expects sales to be down this year, the outlook didn't get any worse.The mixed bag from Macy's didn't do much to help its beat-up stock.It was slightly higher before the market opened.The stock has lost half its value this year.CEO Jeff Gennette struck a hopeful tone, saying he's "pleased with the results," especially a double-digit jump in online sales.Gennette predicted "continued improvements in our trends in the fourth quarter, including a solid lift from loyalty and digital."Macy's launched its Star Rewards loyalty program during the third quarter and said customers are already "responding positively."Related: Sears and Kmart had a bleak three months Yet Macy's, like other brick-and-mortar retailers, still faces a big challenge as shoppers flock to Amazon and other online sites.Walmart (WMT), through its acquisitions of the e-commerce platform Jet.com and the online retailer Bonobos, is also making strides online.These obstacles explain why Macy's still expects full-year sales at stores it owns to drop 2.2% to 3.3%.Kohl's (KSS), another traditional retailer, is also in trouble.The chain said on Thursday that profit plunged 20% last quarter, missing the Street's targets.Sales grew unexpectedly, but Kohl's stock still got punished, dropping 9% in premarket trading.Traditional stores have cut back on pre-holiday hiring.Retail employment rose by 136,700 in October, the lowest for the month since 2011, according to the job-placement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas.
Trump's $250 billion China deals: These are the companies behind them:::::The U.S. dealmaker-in-chief appeared to strike a rich vein in China.President Trump and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, on Thursday announced more than $250 billion in deals between the two countries across industries like energy, technology and aviation.But as is common for agreements unveiled on big state visits, there wasn't much in the way of detail.And a significant number of the deals were non-binding, meaning they could change or fall apart before the final version is signed.Here are some of the major ones: Related: Trump: 'I don't blame China' for taking advantage of US on trade U.S. energy China could pour more than $100 billion into U.S. energy projects in the coming years under two of the deals.One is an $84 billion plan from state-owned China Energy Investment Corp. to invest in shale gas and chemical manufacturing projects in West Virginia.That comes with a couple of caveats, though.It's spread out over 20 years and the deal is only a memorandum of understanding rather than a finalized contract.Another plan aims to invest as much as $43 billion in Alaska's energy sector.China Petroleum & Chemical Corp., better known as Sinopec (SHI), and the Alaskan government will jointly develop the state's liquified natural gas industry.Alaska says the agreement will create up to 12,000 jobs.Related: China is crushing the U.S. in renewable energy Both agreements are part of China's strategy to cut its dependency on polluting coal and pivot to relatively cleaner forms of energy.It already imports natural gas from countries including Qatar."U.S. imports could help ensure that Beijing does not become too dependent on any one (country)," said Hugo Brennan, an analyst at consultant Verisk Maplecroft.But he added the deals are structured so Beijing can "quietly back away" later on if it needs to.Commercial jets Boeing (BA) announced it's selling $37 billion worth of airliners to China.It's unclear how many of the orders are new."We're treating these numbers with caution," said Greg Waldron, Asia managing editor at research provider FlightGlobal.Related: China to overtake U.S. as largest air travel market The agreement for 300 planes is with a government holding company that buys jets for state-owned carriers such as Air China (AIRYY) and China Southern Airlines (ZNH).That makes it difficult to track which airlines are buying what, and how many of the orders might already be included in Boeing's backlog.The company didn't immediately respond to a request for more information.A similar $38 billion deal was announced in 2015 when Xi visited Boeing's largest factory in Washington state.What's certain is that China has a huge appetite for new planes.The country is set to overtake the U.S. to become the world's biggest air travel market within five years and needs the aircraft to meet that rapidly growing demand.Over the summer, European rival Airbus (EADSF) won a $22 billion deal to supply China with 140 new airplanes.U.S. chips for Chinese phones American chipmaker Qualcomm (QCOM, Tech30) inked $12 billion in non-binding deals to supply components to Chinese smartphone brands Xiaomi, Oppo and Vivo.China is already a massive market for Qualcomm, accounting for more than half its sales.The company has also run into trouble there: Chinese regulators fined it $975 million in 2015 for breaking antitrust laws.Related: How China plans to beat the U.S. at technology Qualcomm is the subject of a $130 billion takeover bid from rival Broadcom (AVGO) that could create a U.S. behemoth.Some experts have suggested that Chinese regulators could hold up the deal because of Beijing's plans to aggressively expand its own semiconductor industry.-- Jon Ostrower contributed to this report.
Saudi Arabia says corruption has claimed $100 billion over decades:::::Corrupt practices by Saudi royals and officials have cost the kingdom at least $100 billion over decades.Saudi Arabia's attorney general, Sheikh Saud Al Mojeb, gave the estimate of the losses in a statement Thursday.He also said that 208 individuals have been questioned as part of an extensive investigation.Seven of them have been released without charge."Based on our investigations over the past three years, we estimate that at least $100 billion has been misused through systematic corruption and embezzlement over several decades," the kingdom's top legal official said."The evidence for this wrongdoing is very strong, and confirms the original suspicions which led the Saudi Arabian authorities to begin the investigation in the first place."Saudi authorities arrested dozens of royals, businessmen and senior government officials on Saturday in a surprise anti-corruption sweep.Those arrested included billionaire businessman Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, the former head of the royal court Khaled Al-Tuwaijri and Saudi media mogul Waleed Al-Ibrahim.The Saudi central bank has frozen the personal accounts of people under investigation.And authorities in the United Arab Emirates have reportedly asked banks there for information about assets held by 19 Saudi royals and officials.Related: Arrested Saudi prince built empire from Riyadh to Silicon Valley It looks like the Saudi authorities may be gearing up for a lengthy probe.Some those arrested are reportedly being held in Riyadh's 5-star Ritz Carlton, which has been out of bounds to other guests since the weekend.Now it appears to be "fully booked" until February 1, 2018.Marriott (MAR), which owns the hotel, declined to comment on the situation at the Ritz citing "guest privacy.""We do not discuss the guests or groups with whom we do business or who may be visitors of the hotel," a spokesperson said.The arrests followed the establishment of a new anti-corruption committee headed by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.It has the power to investigate, arrest, issue travel bans and freeze the assets of those it finds corrupt.Saudi officials say the arrests are part of an effort to clean house in support of the crown prince's push to overhaul the country's economy and end what he once called its "addiction" to oil.Sweeping changes are already happening, including subsidy cuts, new taxes and the end of a controversial ban on women driving.Related: Women driving could rev up Saudi economy "The strengthening of [bin Salman's] position should benefit near-term reform momentum given that the crown prince has been the dominant driving force behind Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030 reform agenda," said Fitch ratings agency in a report on Thursday, but it also warned of an increased risk of a political backlash.--Tamara Qiblawi contributed to this report.
New TripAdvisor feature aims to flag sexual assault concerns:::::TripAdvisor is making it easier for users to see if any safety concerns have been flagged about hotels they're researching.The travel site has added a new warning message for businesses where sexual assault and other significant safety incidents have been reported.It has so far put the message, which it calls a "badge," on the pages for three resorts in Mexico.The badges are meant to flag all health, safety and discrimination issues, including theft, sexual assault and rape, TripAdvisor spokesman Brian Hoyt told CNNMoney.Businesses will be "badged for a minimum period of three months, and we hope it will be a catalyst ... to change their ways," Hoyt said.The new policy was first reported by The New York Times.The three resorts flagged by TripAdvisor are the Grand Velas Riviera Maya, the Iberostar Paraiso Maya and the Iberostar Paraiso Lindo.They are some of the most popular resorts in the Playa del Carmen area of Mexico, with thousands of reviews on TripAdvisor.TripAdvisor said they are the first -- but unlikely the last -- properties to receive the new warning."There's potentially going to be more as we continue to vet properties that come up in the news," Hoyt said.The company did an inventory of reviews posted in the last year and found "thousand of issues come up about health and safety and discrimination," he said.Grand Velas Riviera Maya and Iberostar did not immediately respond to requests for comment outside of business hours.Related: Uber pledges $5 million to sexual assault prevention The new approach to warning guests about safety concerns comes after The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported last week that TripAdvisor had removed forum posts and reviews warning about rape and injuries at several resorts in Mexico.Following the report, TripAdvisor apologized to Kristie Love, a 35-year-old mother from Dallas.The Journal Sentinel reported the company had repeatedly removed a post by Love from 2010 in which she said she had been raped by a security guard at Iberostar Paraiso Maya.TripAdvisor has since republished her forum post.The company maintains that it does not take down reviews or forum posts because they mention sexual assault or rape.In 2010, however, forum posts were subjected to a family friendly policy, meant to prohibit sexually explicit language, curse words and the posting of nude photos, according to Hoyt.He said the level of moderation was a "bit of an overreach in 2010."The policy was changed a few years later to enable consumers to post about issues including sexual assault and rape, he said.Related: How companies can stop sexual harassment before it starts TripAdvisor's new badge appears as a warning in a red box at the top of the page that users see after they click to view a resort's details.It says: "TripAdvisor has been made aware of recent media reports or events concerning this property which may not be reflected in reviews found on this listing.Accordingly, you may wish to perform additional research for information about this property when making your travel plans."The message does not explicitly say a business is being flagged for sexual assault or safety incidents.That language may change in the future, but for now the badge is meant to be a warning sign to customers to encourage them to do additional research, Hoyt said.A TripAdvisor committee will be reviewing badges to determine if they need to be kept attached to a business beyond the initial three months.Related: Facebook's imperfect fight against revenge porn TripAdvisor is also rolling out a new policy on communicating with users about why reviews or forum posts are rejected.Reviews are supposed to contain first-hand accounts only, so including a medical diagnosis or relaying a story from another person would lead to the post being taken down and a user receiving a generic rejection notice citing hearsay.Now, users will be told exactly which part of their review violates guidelines."Often it's a sentence that can be edited out and that review can be posted," Hoyt said."We've personally reached out to a lot of folks brought up in the press lately.Several of them have chosen to rewrite their reviews and edit out that second-hand information."Forum posts are regulated differently from reviews in that they do allow hearsay.
Asia stocks shaky before China data, ponder yield curve:::::SYDNEY (Reuters) - Asian stocks wobbled on Tuesday as investors awaited developments in U.S. tax reform efforts, while contemplating if a marked flattening in the U.S. yield curve might ultimately be a harbinger of an economic slowdown there.A man walks past an electronic stock quotation board outside a brokerage in Tokyo, Japan, September 22, 2017.REUTERS/Toru Hanai MSCIs broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS dipped 0.25 percent after two sessions of declines, while Australia fell 0.9 percent.Japan's Nikkei .N225 was choppy, down 0.1 percent to add to four sessions of losses.Investors were waiting for any signs of compromise on U.S. tax policy after U.S. Senate Republicans on Thursday unveiled a plan that would cut corporate taxes a year later than a rival House of Representatives bill.In Asia, the highlight will be Chinese data on industrial output, retail sales and urban investment, while the United States releases its own retail sales figures later in the day.Also on the menu are no fewer than 13 central bank speakers, including the heads of the U.S., European, British and Japanese central banks.On Wall Street, a sharp drop in General Electric shares was offset by gains in high dividend-paying sectors including consumer staples and utilities.The Dow .DJI rose 0.07 percent, while the S&P 500 .SPX added 0.10 percent and the Nasdaq .IXIC 0.1 percent.General Electric (GE.N) slashed its dividend by 50 percent and cut its profit forecast while unveiling a plan that narrowed its focus on aviation, power and healthcare.Currency markets were mostly quiet, with the dollar barely changed against a basket of counterparts at 94.495 .DXY.The euro EUR= was up 0.03 percent at $1.1668.Sterling hovered at $1.3113 GBP=, having fallen as far as $1.3063 on Monday amid concerns British Prime Minister Theresa May was losing her grip on power.Mays blueprint for Britains departure from the EU faces a crucial test starting on Tuesday, when lawmakers try to win concessions on legislation to sever ties.The dollar was steady at 113.66 yen JPY= after bouncing from 113.25 support overnight.EYING THE YIELD CURVE A rise in U.S. bond yields has generally made it more attractive to buy dollars with money borrowed in low-rate currencies like the yen and Swiss franc.Figures out on Monday from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission showed the speculative net short position in the Japanese yen had blown out to the largest since January 2014 and in the Swiss franc to the biggest since December 2016.Yields on Treasury two-year notes US2YT=RR hit a fresh nine-year high on Monday, shrinking the spread to 10-year paper to near its smallest since 2007.The trend in part reflects market wagers the U.S. Federal Reserves plans to hike rates in December and two or three times next year will prove all too successful in restraining inflation by ultimately slowing the economy.Tom Porcelli, chief U.S. economist at RBC Capital Markets, noted that a glance at history suggested a flatter, and particularly an inverted, yield curve was compelling as an early warning sign of recession.However, history also showed that the average amount of time it took the curve to go from flat to inverted was 18 months and the average time to go from inverted to recession was 18 months.So even if we take the inverted curve as gospel, it suggests the expansion still has multiple years in it, said Porcelli.In commodity markets, gold XAU= was steady at $1,277.55 an ounce.The metal has stayed broadly within $15 an ounce of its 100-day moving average, currently at $1,277 an ounce, for most of the last month.Oil prices held in a tight range as support from Middle East tensions and record long bets by fund managers balanced rising U.S. production.U.S. crude CLc1 was off 4 cents at $56.76, while Brent crude futures LCOc1 were yet to trade at $63.16 a barrel.
Shrinking GE rattles investors, shares hit 5-year low:::::(Reuters) - General Electric Cos (GE.N) new Chief Executive John Flannery on Monday outlined steps that will turn the biggest U.S. industrial conglomerate into a smaller, more focused company, surprising some investors who sold the companys shares to a five-year low.Flannerys plan to shrink GEs multi-industry array of businesses was a reversal of the deal-driven empire building of his predecessors, Jeff Immelt and Jack Welch, and potentially a milestone in the decline of the conglomerate as a business strategy.Other companies that once emulated the GE model of spreading bets among diverse industries are now unwinding their portfolios as well, something Immelt also did throughout his 16 years as CEO, even as he made acquisitions.Flannery said he will pare GE down to three core businesses: power, aviation and healthcare.He will keep Immelts strategy of building software to complement GEs machinery, albeit with a narrower focus and reduced budget.For investors, Flannerys decision to cut both the dividend and the 2018 earnings forecast by half added up to a whole that was less than they judged GE be worth last week.GE shares fell to their lowest level in more than five years as investors worried the years-long overhaul would not pare down enough expenses or generate as much cash as they hoped.They closed off the days lows, down 7.2 percent to $19.02.They need to cut more cost, said Scott Davis, an analyst at Melius Research.GE is still a bloated company with duplicate costs up and down the organization.GE stock has effectively been dead money since September 2001, when Immelt took over, posting a negative total return even after reinvesting its juicy dividends.Once the most valuable U.S. publicly traded company, GE now has a market value of $168 billion, less than a fifth of Apple Inc (AAPL.O).You have pessimism around its portfolio of businesses mixed with a pretty harsh cut in the dividend, said John Augustine, chief investment officer at Huntington Private Bank.It took them years to get into this mess and it will take them several years to right the ship and get back into a stronger position.SOUL OF THE COMPANY Flannery, who took over as CEO on Aug. 1, said he was looking for the soul of the company again and would focus on restoring the oxygen of cash and earnings to the company.He will cut its board to 12 from 18 members, and bring on three new directors early next year.GE said it already has shed 25 percent of its corporate staff, meaning 1,500 jobs around the world, including some at its Boston headquarters.It is aiming to reduce overhead cost by $2 billion next year, half of that at its troubled power unit that sells electrical generation equipment.The transition includes GE getting rid of at least $20 billion of assets through sales, spin-offs or other means.GE will jettison businesses with a very dispassionate eye, Flannery said, keeping only units that offer growth, a leading market position and a large installed base.GE said it would exit its lighting, transportation, industrial solutions and electrical grid businesses, all of which were widely expected, closing factories around the globe.But it was vague about other disposals.General Electric Chief Executive Officer John Flannery presents the company's new strategy and financial targets to investors at a meeting in New York, U.S., November 13, 2017.REUTERS/Alwyn Scott It plans to get rid of its 62.5-percent stake in oilfield services company Baker Hughes (BHGE.N), only months after making the multi-billion dollar investment.Baker Hughes shares lost 3.2 percent.Flannery offered no quick fixes for investors.He said power, one of the businesses GE would focus on, was challenged, but could be turned around in one to two years.GEs Digital unit, on which Immelt bet billions of dollars, would focus on selling apps to customers in its core businesses, Flannery said.He confirmed that the shift meant sales staff were being let go, as Reuters reported last week.GE also will cut spending on the digital unit to $1.1 billion in 2018 from $1.5 billion in 2017.GE had previously said it would invest $2.1 billion in its digital unit in 2017, but that tally included money not tied to Predix, GEs industrial-internet platform, GE said.Flannery said there is no retreat on the idea of GE providing both applications and the Predix platform to connect industrial equipment to computers that can make machines run better.However, getting one of its key applications to run on Predix could take two more years.Slideshow (2 Images) Flannery added that some of its healthcare IT business, such as software for imaging and hospital staff scheduling, were still critical to the company and not likely to be divested.DIVIDEND CUT The dividend cut, to 48 cents from 96 cents next year, is only the third in the companys 125-year history and the first not during a broader financial crisis.It is expected to save about $4 billion in cash annually.This dividend cut will be a major disappointment to GEs (roughly 40 percent) retail shareholder base, said RBC Capital Markets analyst Deane Dray.The cut will be the eighth-biggest dividend cut in history among S&P 500 companies, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst of S&P Dow Jones Indices.GE also had the biggest cut when it slashed its dividend by $8.87 billion in 2009, Silverblatt said.GE forecast 2018 adjusted earnings of $1 to $1.07 a share, compared with its earlier estimate of $2 per share.Wall Street was expecting $1.16, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Industrial free cash flow will total just $6 billion to $7 billion next year, up from an estimated $3 billion in 2017, but far below earlier targets of $12 billion for 2017.GE said the weak power business had largely prompted the dividend cut and lowered earnings forecast.Demand for new power plants will remain slow through 2019, Flannery predicted.But GE also was to blame, he said.We did not manage the (power) business well, he said.Thats a fundamental change we need to make and thats going to take some time.This is not a magic wand.(For a graphic on 'Top five dividend yields in the Dow 30' click reut.rs/2zx3aoR)
Roku hits record high on Philips licensing deal:::::(Reuters) - Roku Incs shares surged nearly 43 percent to a record high on Monday after the streaming device maker said it signed a licensing deal that would put its technology on Philips-branded televisions in the United States this year.A video sign displays the logo for Roku Inc, a Fox-backed video streaming firm, in Times Square after the company's IPO at the Nasdaq Market in New York, U.S., September 28, 2017.REUTERS/Brendan McDermid The company said the licensing partnership with Japans Funai Electric Co Ltd, which manufactures Philips N.V. televisions for North American, would place its operating system on Philips smart TVs.Roku also said that it would give a $20 discount on its $69.99-priced streaming stick for the Black Friday weekend, and separately said its customer would get a free one-month trial of AT&T Incs streaming service DirecTV Now.The barrage of news was well received by investors, who sent Rokus shares jumping 28.5 percent to close at $42.71 on Monday.The stock hit a high of $47.49 earlier in the session.The stock has gained 127 percent in heavy volumes over the past three days in a rally that was spurred by the companys strong third-quarter report late on Wednesday.The price move was solely due to long shareholders bidding up ROKUs stock price and not due to investors covering their short positions in the stock, financial analytics firm S3 Partners said in a note.S3 Partners said while the short interest in Roku has risen since its initial public offering (IPO) in late September, it has stayed relatively flat in November and isnt likely to go up further due to the limited number of shares available to borrow.Investors who sell securities short first borrow shares and then sell them, expecting the price to fall so they can then buy the shares back at the lower price, return them to the lender and pocket the difference.Roku, one of the first to make a device to stream content such as from Netflix Inc onto TVs, is now combating deeper-pocketed entrants such as Apple Inc, Alphabet Incs Google and Amazon.com Inc among others.Still, up to Mondays close, Rokus stock has now more than tripled from its IPO price of $14 on Sept. 27.The stock debuted at $15.78 on the Nasdaq on Sept. 28.Los Gatos, California-based Rokus success in the stock market is in stark contrast to the fortunes of other technology companies to make their market debuts this year.Snap Incs shares have fallen 26 percent since its February IPO, while Blue Apron Holdings Inc has lost about 70 percent since its IPO in June.(For a graphic on 'Shares of Roku Inc vs.Snap Inc and Blue Apron Holdings Inc' click reut.rs/2zUozZI)
Goldman Sachs marks stake in Weinstein Co down to zero: source:::::(Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc has written down to zero the value of its stake in the Weinstein Company, the movie studio whose co-chairman Harvey Weinstein stepped down last month following sexual assault allegations, a person familiar with the matter said on Monday.FILE PHOTO: A sign is displayed in the reception of the Sydney offices of Goldman Sachs in Australia, May 18, 2016.REUTERS/David Gray/File Photo Goldman Sachs move comes as the Weinstein Company looks for fresh financing after more than 50 women claimed that Weinstein sexually harassed or assaulted them over the past three decades.Weinstein has denied having non-consensual sex with anyone.Reuters has been unable to independently confirm any of the allegations.Last month, Goldman Sachs said it was trying to find a buyer for its stake in the Weinstein Company.A Goldman Sachs spokesman had said at the time that the bank valued the stake at less than $1 million.The source did not disclose how much of the Weinstein Company Goldman Sachs owns, but described the stake as small.He asked not to be identified because the bank has not publicly released its latest valuation.A Weinstein Company spokeswoman did not immediately respond to multiple requests for comment.One of the Weinstein Companys lenders, AI International Holdings Limited, an affiliate of billionaire Len Blavatniks industrial group Access Industries, filed a lawsuit last Friday in New York State Supreme Court demanding immediate repayment of its approximately $44 million loan.Referring to the allegations against Harvey Weinstein, AI International stated in court papers that his actions and his departure from the company have left [the business] in shambles, and exposed to potentially massive liabilities [that] have severely, if not fatally, damaged its standing in the marketplace.A spokeswoman for Harvey Weinstein declined to comment.The Weinstein Companys other lenders include Bank of America and MUFG Union Bank N.A., according to the lawsuit.They did not immediately respond to requests for comment.The Weinstein Companys board of directors has been receiving advice from investment bank Moelis & Co on its efforts to raise cash, including by potentially selling assets and finding a rescue loan, sources have previously told Reuters.A Moelis spokeswoman declined to comment.Investment firm Fortress Investment Group LLC was considering lending to the film and TV studio, but those talks ended without a deal last week, according to another person familiar with the matter.Fortress would consider providing Weinstein Co with funding to help it through a bankruptcy process, if it came to that, the person said.A Fortress spokesman declined to comment.The Weinstein Companys lenders have hired investment bank Houlihan Lokey Inc for financial advice in a potential restructuring, a source close to that situation said.The Weinstein Co has been one of Hollywoods most influential forces since its launch in October 2005 and has produced and distributed films including The Kings Speech and Silver Linings Playbook.
Tesla hit by class-action lawsuit claiming racial discrimination:::::(Reuters) - U.S. automaker Tesla Inc on Monday was hit with a class-action lawsuit claiming its California production plant is a hotbed for racist behavior.The logo of Tesla is seen in Taipei, Taiwan August 11, 2017.REUTERS/Tyrone Siu The lawsuit filed in California state court in Oakland is at least the third filed this year by black workers who say they were addressed using racial slurs and that the company ignored their complaints.But Mondays lawsuit, filed by former Tesla employee Marcus Vaughn, is the first to bring those claims on behalf of a large class of black workers at the automakers Fremont, California factory.Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.The company is also facing lawsuits accusing it of discrimination against gay and older workers.It has denied those claims.Vaughn in the lawsuit says he was routinely called the n-word by supervisors and coworkers after he began working at the factory in April.He says he complained in writing to human resources officials, but the company never investigated his claims.Vaughn says he was fired in October for not having a positive attitude.He is seeking unspecified damages under a California anti-discrimination law.The growing number of discrimination lawsuits against Tesla come as the company is also facing a unionization campaign from the United Auto Workers.In February, Tesla chief executive Elon Musk told the website Gizmodo that an employee who wrote a blog post criticizing the company was paid by the UAW to join Tesla and agitate for a union.The union and the worker denied that he had been paid by UAW.Last month, the union filed a complaint with a federal labor board on behalf of scores of workers who it says were laid off because they support the union.The company denied the claims and said the decision was based on employee performance reviews.
Wal-Mart partners with Lord & Taylor to expand online fashion presence:::::CHICAGO (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) said on Monday it will offer Hudsons Bay Co- (HBC.TO) owned department store chain Lord & Taylor dedicated space on its website, as it looks to make deeper inroads into the fast-growing online fashion business.Shopping carts are seen outside a new Wal-Mart Express store in Chicago July 26, 2011.REUTERS/John Gress/Files The worlds largest retailer will start offering higher-end clothing and accessories from Lord & Taylor to its customers in spring 2018.The partnership will allow Lord & Taylor to open a virtual storefront on Walmart.com and boost customer traffic to its website by reaching a wider audience.It will boost Wal-Marts online assortment with premium products and advance the retailers effort to access millennial customers who usually do not shop on Walmart.com.Our goal is to create a premium fashion destination within Walmart.com, Denise Incandela, Head of Fashion, Walmart U.S. eCommerce told Reuters in an interview on Monday.She said Wal-Mart shoppers search the retailers website for premium items and the company aims to expand its online business with a focus on such products.This is a part of a larger business strategy where we are working to create a new Walmart.com, Incandela said.She did not comment on the financial terms of the partnership.In the past year, Wal-Mart has been acquiring small online fashion brands like Shoebuy, Modcloth and Bonobos in an attempt to recover lost ground against Amazon and others in the online fashion world.Wal-Mart is the worlds largest brick-and-mortar clothing retailer, with 2016 sales for that category exceeding $23 billion, according to retail think tank Fung Global Retail & Technology.But despite its store muscle, Wal-Mart has failed to replicate that success online.It has not only struggled to attract the type of affluent young consumers who tend to shop for clothes online but due to its low-income customer base and brand perception, has also faced challenges in persuading well-known apparel brands to sell on its website.Amazon leads the U.S. online clothing and footwear market with sales of $13 billion in 2016, up $9 billion from five years ago.It is expected to triple its share of the U.S. apparel market over the next four years, according to data from Euromonitor and Forrester.Virtual storefronts have become a strong e-commerce tool with retailers including Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA.N) routinely offering dedicated space to brands on their website.Virtual stores are also a preferred route for U.S. retailers to enter new countries where they dont have operations.For example, Macys in 2015 said it would enter China with a virtual store on Alibaba and test demand in that market.
Qualcomm rejects Broadcom's $103-billion takeover bid:::::(Reuters) - Mobile chipmaker Qualcomm Inc on Monday rejected rival Broadcom Ltds $103-billion takeover bid, saying the offer undervalued the company and would face regulatory hurdles.Shares of Qualcomm were up 1.8 percent at $65.74 in early afternoon trading, while those of Broadcom were down 0.4 percent at $263.95.Broadcom said it would seek to engage with Qualcomms board and management, adding that it had received positive feedback from key customers and stockholders.We continue to believe our proposal represents the most attractive, value-enhancing alternative available to Qualcomm stockholders and we are encouraged by their reaction, the company said.Both companies count Apple among their top customers.Analysts have said a deal between the two would help Qualcomm settle its legal battle with the iPhone maker as Broadcom has a closer relationship with Apple.Broadcom made an unsolicited bid last week to buy Qualcomm in an effort to become the dominant supplier of chips used in the 1.5 billion or so smartphones expected to be sold around the world this year.Analysts said Broadcom can now raise its bid, go for a proxy fight or launch a hostile exchange offer.Qualcomms thanks, but no thanks response to the unsolicited bid by Broadcom isnt surprising and we would be surprised if at this point, Broadcom didnt move forward with a proxy fight, Loop Capital analyst Betsy Van Hees told Reuters.A sign on the Qualcomm campus is seen in San Diego, California, U.S. November 6, 2017.REUTERS/Mike Blake If Broadcom makes a hostile bid, Qualcomms governance rules would allow the rival to submit its own slate for the entire 11-member board by the Dec. 8 nomination deadline.The easiest option, however, would be to talk to Qualcomms board and agree on a higher price.A sign to the campus offices of chip maker Broadcom Ltd, is shown in Irvine, California, U.S., November 6, 2017.REUTERS/Mike Blake We are well-advised and know what our options are, and we have not eliminated any of those options, Broadcom Chief Executive Hock Tan told Reuters last week.The right price for Qualcomm could be between $80 and $85 per share, and Broadcom could go up to $90, Susquehanna analyst Christopher Rolland told Reuters.Any deal would face scrutiny from the antitrust regulators as the combined company would own the high-end WiFi business globally, analysts said.Regulators are already scrutinizing Qualcomms $38-billion acquisition of automotive chipmaker NXP Semiconductors NV.Broadcom has indicated it is willing to buy Qualcomm irrespective of whether it closes the NXP deal.Qualcomm now needs to convince investors that they can create more shareholder value independently, Raymond James analyst Chris Caso said.
Bombardier in talks with EgyptAir for $1.1 billion CSeries deal: Bloomberg:::::(Reuters) - Canadian plane-and-train-maker Bombardier Inc (BBDb.TO) is in advanced talks with EgyptAir over a potential $1.1 billion order for CSeries jets, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the matter.FILE PHOTO: A Bombardier CSeries aircraft is pictured during a news conference to announce a partnership between Airbus and Bombardier on the C Series aircraft programme, in Colomiers near Toulouse, France, October 17, 2017.REUTERS/Regis Duvignau/File Photo The deal is likely to include a firm order for 12 CS300 jets, and could be announced as early as Tuesday at the Dubai Air Show, according to the report.(bloom.bg/2iSDNU1) European planemaker Airbus SE (AIR.PA) recently agreed to take a majority stake in the CSeries program, in exchange for Airbuss purchasing and marketing power and support for the aircraft that had few orders due to doubts over its future.Bombardier said, earlier this month, that it received a letter of intent from an unnamed European customer for 31 firm CSeries orders.Bombardier spokeswoman, Nathalie Siphengphet said there was clearly a strong momentum for the CSeries, and there was growing interest from airlines around the world.
Tyson weighs sites for $320 million chicken plant after Kansas town objects:::::CHICAGO (Reuters) - Tyson Foods Inc (TSN.N) is weighing new sites for a $320 million chicken slaughterhouse after opposition from residents of a small Kansas town picked for the project, the chief executive said on Monday.The Tyson logo in a file photo.REUTERS/Ross Courtney The project planned for Tonganoxie, Kansas, would have been Tysons first new plant since the 1990s and included a chicken hatchery and feed mill, according to the company.Tyson said it would increase its overall production capacity by processing up to 1.25 million birds per week.However, residents were concerned about its impact on the environment and other issues.Well be delayed slightly here, Tyson CEO Tom Hayes told reporters about the plant, after the company reported better-than-expected earnings.U.S. per capita consumption of chicken is expected to hit a record high this year, according to the National Chicken Council, a trade group that said about 170 million chickens are slaughtered each week for meat.Chicken sales have increased as consumers seek more protein in their diets.Some view it as a healthier alternative to beef and pork.Tyson decided to build a new slaughterhouse because it was buying more chicken than it wanted from other producers to meet demand, Hayes said.He declined to say when Tyson would pick a new site.The company had expected to break ground in Tonganoxie this autumn.Prestage Farms, the nations seventh-largest hog producer, faced resistance from Mason City, Iowa residents over a pork processing plant last year.The company now plans to finish building its $240 million plant in Wright County, Iowa, next year.States are contacting Tyson to be considered for its project, Hayes said.The company wants to gain a better understanding of how local residents feel about the plant when picking the site, he said.Kansas has helped Tyson narrow its search in the state, according to the company.Tyson previously won support from state and local elected officials to locate the plant in Tonganoxie.I dont know how in touch all of the officials were with what the direct local sentiment was for all of those in the local community of Tonganoxie and the surrounding area, Hayes said.
AT&T, Verizon strike tower agreement in effort to diversify vendors:::::NEW YORK (Reuters) - AT&T Inc and Verizon Communications Inc said on Monday they have agreed to lease hundreds of new cell towers from owner and operator Tillman Infrastructure, a move they hope will give them more leverage in negotiations with major U.S. tower vendors.FILE PHOTO: The Verizon logo is seen on the side of a truck in New York City, U.S., October 13, 2016.REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo The U.S. cell tower market is currently dominated by three companies: American Tower Corp, SBA Communications Corp, and Crown Castle International Corp.The agreement announced on Monday shows that Verizon and AT&T, the No.1 and No.2 biggest U.S. wireless carriers, are willing to strike deals with other vendors to secure better prices for the towers they use to transmit wireless signals, analysts and company officials said.Both carriers are seeking to add to their network capacity at a time when consumers are using increasing amounts of cellular data.Carriers are always looking for alternative partners to lessen their dependence on the big three guys, said Jonathan Chaplin, analyst at New Street Research.As part of the agreement, Tillman will construct the towers and AT&T and Verizon will serve as anchor tenants.Construction will begin in the first quarter of 2018.This is Verizon and AT&T working together with a new provider to put some competition into the mix, said Susan Johnson, AT&Ts senior vice president of supply chain, in an interview, adding, we do really hope this will be a future model.Shares of American Tower were flat in afternoon trading, while shares of SBA Communications were down 1.9 percent and Crown Castle was down 0.3 percent.
Russia's RT America registers with DOJ as a foreign agent:::::The production company behind the American version of the Russian state-funded network RT has officially filed as a foreign agent with the Department of Justice.T&R Productions LLC formally registered on November 10 as an agent of ANO TV-Novosti, described in the forms as a non-governmental organization "under Russian Federation law," which has principal "responsibility for creating a TV network that will be competitive with other TV networks operating around the world."The DOJ identified ANO TV-Novosti as the "Russian government entity responsible for the worldwide broadcasts of the RT Network" In its announcement, the DOJ said T&R Productions LLC "has operated studios for RT, hired and paid all U.S.-based RT employees, and produced English-language programming for RT, which is both shown on cable networks across the United States and available on RT's website."The DOJ announced the registration and published the forms on Monday.The National Security Division's FARA Registration Unit is reviewing T&R's filings for sufficiency, the DOJ said."Americans have a right to know who is acting in the United States to influence the U.S. government or public on behalf of foreign principals," Acting Assistant Attorney General for National Security Dana J. Boente said in a statement on Monday."The Department of Justice is committed to enforcing FARA and expects compliance with the law by all entities engaged in specified activities on behalf of any foreign principal, regardless of its nationality."The filing comes after weeks of public pronouncements and increasing tension between Russia and the U.S. over media outlets in the two countries.RT said after initially skipping its October deadline to register under FARA, they were forced to file or their employees could face imprisonment and have their assets seized.While this is technically true under the law, harsh enforcements under Foreign Agents Registration Act are rare, experts say.The DOJ's registration request has prompted Russian officials to retaliate by threatening to enforce harsher restrictions against American news organizations operating in Russia, especially government-funded outlets such as Radio Free Europe and its television sister network Current Time.The filing was made under news director Mikhail Solodovnikov, a former reporter for a Russian TV outlet who said in the forms that he is a U.S. citizen by marriage.He listed his salary as $670,000 a year.He is the sole member and owner over the LLC and produces the various shows for ANO TV-Novosti, according to the filing.Solodovnikov disputed the need for the FARA registration in the filing."The production of shows remains under the independent editorial control of registrant," he wrote."Registrant respectfully disagrees that FARA should apply."T&R confirms in the paperwork that ANO TV-Novosti is financed by a foreign entity, but the production company also said on the forms that it was not "sufficiently aware" of who controls or funds the NGO.In the filing, Solodovnikov wrote that he does not see RT as political actors, saying that the "primary purpose of T&R Productions LLC is to produce news, talk show, and entertainment programs that are designed merely to inform, not influence.Programs produced cover a broad range of news and talk show topics, reflect balance regarding commentary, and are not aimed to primarily benefit any foreign government or political party."RT was singled out in a January intelligence community report for the impact it may have had on the 2016 U.S. election.The report said RT "conducts strategic messaging for [the] Russian government" and "seeks to influence politics, [and] fuel discontent in the U.S." The report also mentioned a separate Russian-government-controlled website Sputnik as "another government-funded outlet producing pro-Kremlin radio and online content."Federal investigators are also reportedly looking into whether Russian government-funded outlets such as RT and Sputnik were part of Russia's influence campaign aimed at the 2016 presidential election.Yahoo News has separately reported that the FBI interviewed a former Sputnik correspondent about his work at the website.Russian government officials, including President Vladimir Putin said they'd take a "tit for tat" measure against American outlets in Russia in retaliation for the pressure on RT.Last week Russian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said that new action against American outlets would come this week.
Tesla, SpaceX put board member on leave amid misconduct investigation:::::Silicon Valley investor Steve Jurvetson has left the firm he co-founded amid allegations of misconduct.Jurvetson, a partner at prominent VC firm Draper Fisher Jurvetson, is a board member and investor at Tesla and SpaceX.Jurvetson, 50, tweeted about his departure citing "personal matters, including taking legal action against those whose false statements have defamed me."Three weeks ago, DFJ confirmed that it was investigating Jurvetson on October 25."Earlier this summer we became aware of indirect and second-hand allegations about one partner, Steve Jurvetson," read a statement from the company at the time."We immediately opened an independent investigation, which is ongoing at this time."The company didn't provide details on the accusations of misconduct.On Monday, DFJ said in a statement that Jurvetson is leaving the firm "as of today and by mutual agreement.""DFJ's culture has been, and will continue to be, built on the values of respect and integrity in all of our interactions," the statement read."We are focused on the success of our portfolio companies, as well as the long-term vision for the firm and will continue to operate with the highest professional standards."SpaceX and Tesla issued a joint statement saying "Steve Jurvetson is on a leave of absence from the SpaceX and Tesla boards pending resolution of these allegations."Jurvetson isn't the only high profile investor who has resigned from the firm he cofounded over allegations of misconduct.500 Startups cofounder Dave McClure and Binary Capital cofounder Justin Caldbeck left their respective firms this summer after multiple women came forward with allegations of workplace sexual harassment.Both men have issued broad apologies for their behavior.Jurvetson did not respond to attempts to reach him on Facebook and email.-- CNN Tech's Seth Fiegerman contributed reporting
Lord & Taylor is coming to Walmart.com:::::Walmart is about to up its fashion game -- with a little help from Lord & Taylor.The two retailers announced Monday that they're teaming up to launch a "flagship" Lord & Taylor shop on Walmart.com."We see customers on our site searching for higher-end items, and we are expanding our business online to focus on adding specialized and premium shopping experiences, starting with fashion," Denise Incandela, head of fashion for Walmart's U.S. e-commerce division, said in a statement.The shop will go live in spring 2018.Lord & Taylor plans to keep running its own website after the launch.A spokeswoman for the company said it's too early to provide additional information about what particular items will be available through Walmart.com.The partnership is a sign of the times.Walmart (WMT) is making heavy investments in its online operation in order to stay competitive with Amazon (AMZN, Tech30).Meanwhile, department stores like Lord & Taylor, which is owned by Hudson's Bay Company, are trying to shore up online sales amid flagging foot traffic.Related: Macy's is stuck in an epic losing streak In a statement, Lord & Taylor President Liz Rodbell said the deal will allow the brand to reach "a wide base" of new customers."As retail continues to change, this flagship store creates enormous growth opportunities for Lord & Taylor and our brand partners," Rodbell said.Overall, Lord & Taylor's parent company -- which also owns Saks Fifth Avenue -- has been struggling.Last summer, the company said it would cut about 2,000 jobs across North America, part of a plan to save $350 million by the end of the 2018 fiscal year.In October, HBC announced that CEO Jerry Storch would step down Nov. 1.An executive search firm has been retained to find his replacement.
Emirates looks past turmoil with huge Boeing deal:::::Dubai's Emirates airline - the world's largest international carrier - is eager to show it's still top dog.The carrier on Sunday kicked off the biennial Dubai Air Show with a commitment to buy 40 787-10 airplanes from Boeing.The order came as a surprise to many as a fresh commitment for dozens more superjumbo Airbus A380s was widely expected.The jets won't start arriving in Emirates' fleet until 2022, but the carrier, which has more than 200 jets on order from Boeing now, has been battered by rising oil prices, increased competition, falling fares and a Gulf region beset by political chaos."We're kind of getting used to trauma, whatever that may be, geopolitical, economic, terrorists, call it whatever it is.We're getting better at it.This is what we do and we have to be able to take the business on, grow the business," said Emirates President Tim Clark in an interview with CNN.In addition to the deal with Boeing, Emirates unveiled a new first class for its long-range 777 jets.The opulent suites feature some technology firsts for commercial aviation, including video chat to contact a flight attendant and virtual windows that pipe in fiber optic video for the suite in the middle of the jet's cabin.But traffic growth is at the lowest level in the region since the global financial crisis in 2009, according to Bernstein Research.Rivals Etihad Airways, based in the nearby United Arab Emirates capital of Abu Dhabi, is in the midst of a management and strategy overhaul after its bets on ailing European carriers Air Berlin and Alitalia turned sour.And Qatar Airways remains in the midst of a regional embargo after the UAE and many of its neighbors cut off diplomatic ties to the Gulf state."We've faced a flat-lining of demand for all the reasons out of our control.We have adjusted our capacity...it's only 2% growth, but does that mean to say Emirates is going to be stuck at 2% growth?I don't think so," said Clark.The phase of slow growth for Emirates comes after a blistering expansion that has added 100 A380s and 109 777s to its fleet over the last decade.That rapid expansion has drawn howls of protest from U.S. and European carriers who allege Emirates, Qatar and Etihad are unfairly reshaping the aviation market with subsidized state support.Middle East consolidation But the tumultuous landscape has forced Emirates to adapt, retiring older planes and aligning itself with its low-cost sibling FlyDubai.The carrier began its operations mimicking Southwest Airlines and flying shorter flights around the region with fewer frills.FlyDubai at the show unveiled new lie-flat seats to attract business fliers accustomed to the opulent perks found on Emirates.The UAE may still undergo a broader airline consolidation and Clark said a similar alignment or collaboration with Etihad may materialize over time."I take guidance from my bosses, basically, if they want to take it on, we can do a lot of things," said Clark."There are things we can do immediately without conflicting with competition rules in the overseas markets and getting better value for both [Emirates and Etihad]."Rethinking growth Sunday's Boeing deal comes after Emirates in 2014 canceled an agreement with Airbus for 70 long-range A350 jets after the plane maker decided to redesign parts of the airplane.The Boeing deal is worth $15.1 billion at list prices, but airlines regularly receive discounts of 40% to 60%.While a significant win for Boeing, "this is the weakest Dubai Air Show in terms of orders in many years, with only 60 orders after the first two days (2015 had 126 orders and 2013 had 552 orders)," wrote Bernstein analyst Doug Harned.Related: Superjumbo airline Emirates thinking smaller again The twin-aisle 787-10, which seats about 320 passengers, doesn't have the globespanning endurance of the larger jets in Emirates' fleet.Instead, the aircraft will likely be deployed on new and existing shorter regional flights that don't need the range or enormous capacity of the Boeing 777 and double-deck A380, for which Emirates is the largest operator of both planes."It gives us far more in our arsenal to deal with the type segmentation of demand that we're looking at in the next decade," said Clark.Over the long term, Emirates plans to move its operations to the new Dubai World Central Airport from Dubai International Airport.The new gateway will eventually be able to accommodate 220 million passengers flying through every year.That's more than double the 104.2 million passengers that used Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport in 2016, the world's busiest airport.
Barbie's first hijab: Meet the new Ibtihaj Muhammad doll:::::For the first time ever, Barbie will wear a hijab.Mattel (MAT), which makes Barbie, announced Monday that the latest doll in its "Shero" collection will be modeled after Olympic fencer Ibtihaj Muhammad.In 2016, Muhammad became the first American to compete in the games while wearing a hijab."I'm proud to know that little girls everywhere can now play with a Barbie who chooses to wear hijab!This is a childhood dream come true," Muhammad said in a tweet.The news was announced at Glamour's Women of the Year summit.The doll will go on sale in 2018.Barbie has been working hard to make its collection of dolls more diverse in an effort to broaden the brand's appeal.Thank you @Mattel for announcing me as the newest member of the @Barbie #Shero family!I'm proud to know that little girls everywhere can now play with a Barbie who chooses to wear hijab!This is a childhood dream come true #shero pic.twitter.com/py7nbtb2KD Ibtihaj Muhammad (@IbtihajMuhammad) November 13, 2017 In its most recent quarter, Mattel said Barbie sales were down 6% compared to last year.Related: Mattel suspends dividend after dismal sales The Shero line, which launched in 2015, includes dolls based on prominent women such as Olympic gymnast Gabby Douglas, model Ashley Graham, ballerina Misty Copeland, director Ava DuVernay and actress Zendaya.In 2016, Barbie rolled out tall, petite and curvy versions of the dolls.The company followed suit with Ken dolls earlier this year.Barbie's boyfriend is now available in three body types and seven skin tones."Ibtihaj is an inspiration to countless girls who never saw themselves represented, and by honoring her story, we hope this doll reminds them that they can be and do anything," Sejal Shah Miller, Barbie's vice president of global marketing, said in a statement.
Right-wing media aims to cast doubt on Roy Moore allegations:::::A large swath of right-wing media has sought to discredit or cast doubt on allegations of sexual misconduct facing Republican Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore.Breitbart, the far-right website headed by former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon, has been the most aggressive in its coverage.The website has deployed two staffers to Alabama who have attempted to damage the Washington Post's explosive story, which included allegations from four women who went on the record to say Moore initiated inappropriate sexual advances toward them when they were teenagers and he was in his 30s.The Post story was based on interviews with more than 30 people who said they knew Moore.In one story, Breitbart spoke with Nancy Wells -- the mother of Leigh Corfman, who accused Moore of initiating a sexual encounter with her when she was 14 years old -- and claimed she contradicted a "key detail" of her daughter's story.The Post said in its original story that Corfman spoke with Moore "on her phone in her bedroom."Breitbart asked Wells if Corfman had a phone in her bedroom to which she said no.Wells, however, then added, "But the phone in the house could get through to her easy."In another story, Breitbart noted that Wells said her daughter had to be convinced by the Post to speak out about her allegations against Moore."She did not go to them.They called her," Wells told Breitbart.But the Post had already disclosed this in its story, stressing that "neither Corfman nor any of the woman sought out the Post" and "were initially reluctant to speak publicly."As Breitbart's critics pointed out on social media, convincing sources to speak on the record is a fundamental part of journalism.But it hasn't been just Breitbart, whose spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment, that has aimed to cast doubt on the allegations Moore faces.Sean Hannity, like other conservative media giants, has not taken a hardline position on Moore.He has said that if the allegations are true, they are "beyond disgusting" and that Moore should step aside, while simultaneously suggesting to his TV and radio audience that the allegations could be a politically motivated hit job.Case in point: Last Thursday, Hannity invited Fox News legal analyst Mercedes Colwin on his prime time program to discuss the sexual misconduct allegations and asked her a number of leading questions."Do people do it for money?Do they do it for political reasons?"Hannity asked Colwin."Is that more common than people think?""Oh definitely," Colwin replied.Rush Limbaugh, the king of talk radio, called one of the accusers a "wacky woman" on his program, according to a transcript on his website, and read part of a story from a far-right blog -- one he admitted he was "not familiar with" -- which sought to discredit one of the Post's reporters.Limbaugh said he has "no idea" if the allegations against Moore are true, but focused on arguing a double standard exists when a Republican instead of a Democrat is accused of misconduct.Mark Levin, a top conservative talk show host, took a similar approach when reacting to the Post's story, saying, it "is impossible to judge the facts" before the election.He then chose to zero in on the Post's credibility and question the "timing of such a report.""Are we to believe these Washington Post reporters just happened to hear about this -- they went to Alabama from some of his supporters and now they were just able to draw the truth out of these women -- particularly the former 14 year old who is now 53 years old?Is that what we are to believe?"Levin asked on his radio program last week."The newspaper that endorsed the Democrat already.That's what's going on."Levin was referring to the Post editorial board's endorsement of Moore's Democratic rival.He, however, failed to note that the newspaper's newsroom functions independently of the editorial board.Fox News hosts Tucker Carlson and Laura Ingraham have employed more tepid tactics to question the Post's story.Ingraham said on her Friday radio show that if the allegations are true, they would be "completely unacceptable," but added that she found it "a little curious why [Post owner Jeff Bezos] sends a band of reporters" to Alabama to "find out what happened in 1979."Carlson said on his Friday television program that the allegations "sound true" to him, but said the Post and media at large has become so untrustworthy that "even when maybe what they're reporting is correct, it's hard to know exactly."
The future of getting dressed: AI, VR and smart fabrics:::::Cher Horowitz's closet from the film "Clueless" had a futuristic computer system that helped her put together outfits.Back in 1995, the concept teased what it might be like to get dressed in the future.Technology has evolved a lot since then, but closets have been largely untouched by innovation.Now, that's starting to change."If algorithms do their job well, people will spend less time thinking about what to wear," said Ranjitha Kumar, an assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.From artificial intelligence and gadgets to smart fabrics and virtual reality, technology is poised to breathe innovation into not only how we dress but how we shop.The most recognizable example is Amazon's Echo Look, which received significant buzz when it was announced earlier this year.The gadget ($200) serves as a style assistant to help you decide what to wear.Like Amazon's other smart speakers, the Echo Look will tell you the weather or play music.But the oval-shaped product also has a voice-controlled camera for taking photos of you in various outfits.It works alongside an app.Related: Amazon's $200 Echo Look will judge your outfits After snapping photos of you in two outfits in front of the device, its built-in Style Check tool decides which one is best.It leans on a combination of machine learning technology and human opinion.Amazon's "fashion specialists" train the software to be a judge of style.The automated results consider "fit, color, styling, seasons and current trends."It'll also suggest similar styles to buy from various brands.Through testing, we found that the suggestions can be hit or miss."The brand selection is pretty limited, and while the Echo Look may help you decide between two looks, it can't take into account the total context of where you're going," said personal stylist and creative director Taylor Okata.Okata, whose clients include E!and SELF Magazine, doesn't consider the technology a threat to his work: "There's just that interpersonal communication that it just doesn't have."Meanwhile, retail experts say the Echo Look's success will depend on if it adds more value than just asking a friend for fashion advice.Sucharita Mulpuru, an analyst at research firm Forrester, said those buying the device are early adopters -- and it lacks widespread appeal."It's such a foreign concept to rely on a device to tell you what to wear," she told CNN Tech.Related: New app backed by Kim Kardashian wants to be fashion's Shazam Other companies are embracing augmented and virtual reality to help people decide what to wear.For example, Obsess VR builds augmented and virtual reality shopping platforms so customers can shop without having to go to a store.In July, the company partnered with Vera Bradley to roll out VR experiences at 10 of its stores.While wearing a Google Daydream VR headset, shoppers can move a bed around in VR, and see Vera Bradley comforters, quilts and pillows up close in a virtual store."If you think about e-commerce, every brand and every product essentially looks the same online," said Obsess CEO and founder Neha Singh."It's identical looking, white background product shots, and that doesn't encapsulate what the brand is about.We are building the technology that will enable any brand and retailer to create discovery-based shopping experiences."Apple's new augmented reality platform builds on a similar concept, allowing developers to create augmented reality apps.For example, the new IKEA Place app lets users preview furniture virtually within their home.The tool has more widespread appeal because it doesn't require a headset.Fabrics are getting smarter, too.Earlier this year, JanSport unveiled a prototype for a high-tech backpack with programmable fabric.The backpack lets users share a song, music video, Facebook page or website link with anyone nearby by holding up their smartphone and using a corresponding app.The backpack could give teens a new way to express themselves.The concept comes from MIT professor Yoel Fink, the CEO of Advanced Functional Fabrics of America, a nonprofit that aims to reinvent fabrics as programmable devices."Fabrics are among the earliest forms of human expression and they've been around for thousands of years," Fink said."But they really haven't changed much from a functional perspective.Our goal is to change what fabrics [do]."The team's latest prototype is a sports jersey that would let spectators at a game scan an app over players to see their stats, such as rebounds, assists and points.The group will soon test the new jerseys with the MIT basketball team.Related: JanSport's high-tech backpack shares your social media Artificial intelligence could also have a big impact on style, especially as a tool to help retailers predict trends and keep fashion houses ahead of the curve.Researchers are already working on such solutions using AI and machine learning.For example, Kumar from the University of Illinois and her team are looking at algorithmically identifying fashion "influencers" and emerging trends.Using machine learning techniques that analyze the content of tweets, the group has identified more than 27,000 fashion-related accounts on Twitter as the top trendsetters."We're now tracking these influencers and the content they post to model micro-trends and predict their lifetime," she said.However, the challenge is the speed at which fashion trends change.They can go in weeks or sometimes even a few days, according to Kumar.Kavita Bala, a professor in the Computer Science Department at Cornell University, is also analyzing social media platforms to look for fashion trends.For example, her team can plot how often people are wearing a certain clothing item over time for a particular city in the world.But Bala said style recommendation presents another challenge: "People have very distinctive, subtle and individualist style and they're very picky about it."While some AI approaches are already in the works, other tech, like shopping with a VR headset in your home, is still years away.It's also unclear how quickly consumers would adopt this."All of that is becoming possible, but we're not quite there yet," said Obsess' Singh.
NFL owners weigh contract extension for Roger Goodell:::::The NFL expects that a contract extension for Commissioner Roger Goodell will be "done shortly," a league source says.Goodell, whose existing contract runs through next season, has offered to give up "the majority of his contract guarantees" for a deal that would peg more of his pay to performance incentives, the source told CNNMoney.A second source close to the league told CNNMoney that Goodell's extension is "more likely than not, but still not nearly a sure thing."This source also said owners are wary of replacing Goodell so soon before the league's collective bargaining agreement with the players expires, in 2020.The contract discussion comes at a difficult moment for the league, which faces declining TV ratings, growing concerns about brain damage and domestic violence, and player protests over racial injustice.The terms of Goodell's deal are being considered by a compensation committee comprising six owners: Arthur Blank of the Falcons, Clark Hunt of the Chiefs, Robert K. Kraft of the Patriots, John Mara of the Giants, Bob McNair of the Texans and Art Rooney of the Steelers.Those six are expected to talk by phone on Monday.ESPN reported on Sunday that Goodell had asked for a salary of $49.5 million a year, the use of a private jet for life and lifetime health insurance for his family.Goodell was paid $31.7 million in 2015, the most recent figure publicly available.Two NFL sources disputed the ESPN report.One NFL source told CNNMoney that Goodell already has use of a private jet and health care for his family.Goodell's leadership has been tested most recently by the protests.They started during a 2016 preseason game when then-49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick took a knee during the singing of the National Anthem.The movement grew this year, particularly after President Trump said owners should fire anyone who takes a knee.Goodell says everyone should stand for the Anthem and the league needs to "move past this controversy."But he also says players have the freedom to express themselves.League rules say only that players "should" stand.Related: NFL commissioner: 'We need to move past this controversy' Some fans have said protests are disrespectful to the American flag and to the military, and have boycotted the NFL.Papa John's founder and CEO John Schnatter said the protests have hurt sales and blamed Goodell.He's not the only person questioning Goodell's leadership and handling of the protests.Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones has even threatened to sue the NFL to block Goodell's contract renewal.On Sunday, when the Cowboys played the Atlanta Falcons, Jones and Blank, the chairman of the compensation committee, didn't greet each other, as is customary for owners to do at a game.Jones is also upset over Goodell's treatment of his star running back, Ezekiel Elliott, who was suspended six games earlier this season for domestic violence allegations.A spokesman for the NFL said all 32 owners agreed previously to give the committee the authority to decide whether Goodell should get an extension.Related: NFL owners gather to discuss National Anthem protests It's not clear how much Goodell was paid in 2016 and 2017.His salary was cut continually between 2012, when he made $44.2 million, and 2015.That is when the NFL dropped its federal tax exemption.As a result, Goodell's salary is no longer public.Goodell took the job in 2006.Between 2008 and 2015, he was paid more than $205 million.
Why asking about salary history can hurt women's careers:::::The dreaded question: "Well, what do you make now?"Maybe you've heard that in a job interview before.But if you live in New York, California or Massachusetts, you may never hear it again.Recent legislation in several states and cities has made it illegal for potential employers to ask interviewees about their past salaries.The intent behind the laws: to redress the balance for women and minorities who are already fighting a wage gap (one that gets even steeper for black and Latina women).According to a wage gap report released by New York City's public advocate Letita James, women earn $5.8 billion less in wages than men."By banning questions about salary history, we are putting a stop to an employment practice that perpetuates gender wage discrimination and hurts all New Yorkers," she said.Because women are less likely to earn as much as their male colleagues or to negotiate a job offer, the legislation banning questions about salary history could, in theory, help to even the playing field.Related: What happens when women know how much other women make The "What were you making at your last job?"question can haunt women far into the future, says Laura Kray, the Warren E. and Carol Spieker Chair in Leadership at the University of California-Berkeley One low salary can set a woman's career back, because it comes up again and again with every negotiation she pursues.Potential new employers could offer her less than they would a male candidate with the same qualifications -- simply because she earned less at a previous job."It's a question that can lead to ongoing discrimination," Kray says."You can see how discrimination at one point in time can have trailing effects that would be damaging."If they're not automatically restricted to the confines of their past salary, advocates hope, these applicants stand a better chance in the negotiation process, to catch up to their higher-earning white male counterparts.Related: How to research company culture before you take the job Even though more states and cities are banning the question, women still might face it in a job interview.Kray says some may worry that asking for more will lower their chances of actually getting the job, or others may think that dodging the salary history question could take them out of the running entirely."Any time you're in a negotiation over a job, even if the potential employee has a lot of leverage -- let's say he or she has other job offers as well -- most of the time when they're in the position of seeking the job, we psychologically feel like we're in a low power position," she says.She has a tip for sidestepping the self-sabotage: flip that power dynamic."You want to think about how you can throw it back to the employer -- 'Well, my previous salary isn't relevant.'"
Bill Gates invests $80 million to build Arizona smart city:::::Bill Gates wants to build a futuristic community in Arizona.A group associated with a Gates investment company has invested $80 million in a high-tech planned development outside Phoenix.The community in Belmont will be designed around high-speed networks, autonomous vehicles, high-speed digital networks, data centers, new manufacturing technologies and autonomous logistics hubs.It's unclear how much former Microsoft CEO Gates, who owns Belmont's parent company Cascade Investment, will be involved in the effort.Belmont Partners, the Arizona-based real investment group that's leading the project, said it will be similar in size to nearby Tempe, Arizona, which has a population of 182,000."Envisioning future infrastructure from scratch is far easier and more cost efficient than retrofitting an existing urban fabric," Grady Gammage, a spokesman for the venture said in the statement.Arizona has a reputation as being a technology-friendly state.Several major players in the autonomous vehicle industry -- Waymo, Uber and Intel -- are testing their innovations in the state.The investment is the latest example of excitement surrounding rebuilding cities from the ground up with a digital mind-set.Related: Saudia Arabia wants to build a $500 billion mega-city spanning three countries But developing a new city or even a neighborhood isn't cheap.This October Sidewalk Labs, the urban innovation arm of Google's parent company Alphabet, committed $50 million for the initial phase of planning and pilot testing a Toronto neighborhood development.It's designed as a model neighborhood for the 21st century, with reduced pollution, shortened commutes, safer streets and better weather.Transportation will be designed around shared electric vehicles, walking and biking.More flexible zoning will blend commercial, industrial and residential areas.Only a week later after the Toronto announcement, Saudia Arabia announced plans to invest $500 billion in a new global hub meant to push the boundaries of innovation and exemplify the future of civilization.The smart cities trend has gained momentum as Silicon Valley's disruptors shift their focus to transportation innovations such as autonomous vehicles and ridesharing services.Belmont's developers are counting on the expected development of Interstate 11, which will serve the area, to boost development.But right now, the company is not rushing to move forward."This is a very long term, very patient investment," Gammage told CNN Tech.
Uber agrees to move forward with massive SoftBank investment: Why it matters:::::Uber has raised billions in capital since its founding, but a new investment deal could be its most crucial yet -- and also its most complicated.The ride-hailing startup said Sunday that it has reached an agreement for what could be a massive investment from SoftBank (SFTBF), the Japanese conglomerate, after months of speculation about a possible deal."We've entered into an agreement with a consortium led by SoftBank and Dragoneer on a potential investment," Uber said in a statement Sunday."We believe this agreement is a strong vote of confidence in Uber's long-term potential."Uber did not provide an update on the size and structure of the agreement, but a source familiar with the matter said it was essentially unchanged from earlier reports.CNNMoney reported last month that SoftBank was looking to invest around $1 billion in Uber at its current $69 billion valuation.SoftBank is also expected to invest billions more buying up shares from existing shareholders at a discounted rate, depending on demand from sellers.SoftBank, however, struck a sharper tone in a statement released Monday.Rajeev Misra, CEO of SoftBank Investment Advisors, said Uber had agreed to move forward with the investment "after a long and arduous process," but stressed that a final deal is contingent on getting enough Uber insiders to sell their stakes at the right price."By no means is our investment decided," Rajeev Misra, CEO of SoftBank Investment Advisors and a Board Director of SoftBank Group Corp, said in a statement provided to CNNMoney."We are interested in Uber but the final deal will depend on the tender price and a minimum percentage shareholding for SoftBank."SoftBank is said to want at least a 14% ownership stake in Uber.Otherwise, it could walk away from the deal.The dueling statements are just the latest example of SoftBank publicly needling Uber over a multi-billion dollar deal months in the making.SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son has repeatedly teased the possibility -- some might say threat -- of investing in Lyft instead, including as recently as this month.The stakes are high for Uber.If the deal falls apart, SoftBank's money could make its way to its chief U.S. rival, just weeks after Lyft announced a $1 billion investment led by Google (GOOGL, Tech30)'s parent company.If the SoftBank deal goes through, it would function like a mini-IPO that helps tide Uber over until it actually goes public in 2019 as planned.Employees and investors would have an opportunity to cash out some of their stakes in the company, potentially boosting morale after a punishing year full of executive shuffles and PR crises.Uber would also get a cash infusion as it fights a resurgent Lyft in its backyard and increasingly well-funded competitors abroad, not to mention the looming financial risk posed by lawsuits and disputes over driver benefits.Uber had $6.6 billion in cash at the end of the second quarter, but continues to bleed hundreds of millions of dollars every quarter.Related: SoftBank: The new kingmaker in tech The SoftBank investment isn't just about the money, however.It's also key to reforming Uber's dysfunctional board and bringing a detente between warring factions: former Uber CEO Travis Kalanick and early Uber investor Benchmark.As part of the agreement, Kalanick has agreed that he cannot fill the three board seats he controls in the future without majority approval by the board, according to two people familiar with the matter.Kalanick blindsided Uber in September by appointing two new members without notice.Benchmark, in return, has agreed to put on hold its lawsuit against Kalanick over his control of the three board seats, with plans to drop the case if and when the SoftBank deal closes, according to the sources.The case had been set to go to arbitration.To pave the way for the deal, Uber previously agreed to add six new seats to its board, two of which will go to SoftBank.Uber's board also adopted a new voting system that will further lessen Kalanick's influence."Upon closing, it will help fuel our investments in technology and our continued expansion at home and abroad, while strengthening our corporate governance," Uber said of the deal in its statement.SoftBank publicly expressed interest about investing in Uber over the summer, while the startup was still looking for a CEO to replace Kalanick after months of operating with a mostly empty C-suite.Related: Ousted Uber CEO Travis Kalanick shakes up board of directors At an event last week, Uber's new CEO, Dara Khosrowshahi, admitted it had taken a long time to get Uber's board on the same page for the SoftBank deal, but expressed confidence in getting it done."There's negotiations going on," he said."They've probably taken longer than they should have, but we're gonna get there.Because all the parties, in the end, they know this is a good direction."SoftBank has previously pumped billions into several ride-hailing companies abroad, including Didi in China, Grab in Southeast Asia and 99 in Brazil.-- CNNMoney's Sara O'Brien contributed

America is falling out of love with Budweiser:::::Budweiser is in danger of losing its "King of Beers" crown in the United States.Americans' beer tastes are changing.They are opting for fancier craft beers, microbrews and wines and spirits instead of old classics.That trend is taking a particular toll on Bud Light and Budweiser, whose share of the American beer market keeps shrinking.Parent company Anheuser-Busch InBev reported in October that its beer sales in the U.S. dropped more than 5% in the last quarter."Budweiser has been declining for a long time," said Eric Shepard, an industry tracker at Beer Marketer's Insights."Premium light [beer] doesn't have the popularity it once did."That's particularly true for younger drinkers, Shepard added.The drop-off in domestic beers isn't confined to just Budweiser and Bud Light: Molson Coors Brewing Co. (TAP), the maker of Coors Light and Miller Lite, announced last month that U.S. sales dipped nearly 3% last quarter.Related: Not America's beer?Bud sales fall in U.S. Budweiser is betting on a management shakeup to help turn sales around.AB-InBev's announced on Monday that Michel Doukeris, A-B InBev's current chief sales officer, will replace Joo Castro Neves on January 1 as head of the company's North America division.The U.S. is AB-InBev's "most important market," CEO Carlos Brito said in a news release.Aside from the sales slump, Budweiser missed its last attempt to rebrand itself.A-B InBev's highly-marketed campaign to brand Budweiser as "America" on bottles and cans during the summer failed to catch on with beer lovers.Budweiser is now turning to its old Prohibition-era lager to return the brew to past glory.A-B InBev announced last month that it was releasing a limited-edition "1933 Repeal and Reserve Amber Lager" with a higher alcohol content than the regular beer for the holidays.Doukeris and the Prohibition-style bud will also have to compete with rising popularity of Corona and Modelo.Constellation Brands (STZ), the owner of the two Mexican imported beers, reported that sales increased 13% last quarter.Constellation is up 43% this year compared to A-B InBev's (BUDFF) 11% gain.-- CNNMoney's Paul R.

Local journalists wrestle with Roy Moore coverage following sexual misconduct allegations:::::Some editors and reporters in Alabama are frustrated, and they're not hiding it.As national Republicans disavow Senate nominee Roy Moore amid allegations of sexual misconduct, Moore and many of his supporters are blaming the media.Local journalists are receiving complaints and dodging insults while trying to cover the deepening scandal."Journalism is often a hard sell in a place where some people defend Moore over four named women and 30 sources," said Bob Davis, the editor of the Anniston Star in the northeast part of the state.Some readers simply don't want to hear the disturbing charges, which were originally published by the Washington Post last Thursday.Distrust of the media is a major factor.Republican voters are "not going to believe this Washington Post story because it's the liberal media lying about their beloved leader here," Alabama political columnist Josh Moon said on CNN's "Reliable Sources."He said that if the story had originally been published in a local paper, voters would "probably" be more inclined to believe it, "but I don't know that even then," Moon said."They believe him first and last," he said.Many of Moore's defenders have cast suspicion on the story because it came out just a month before the December 12 election.Over the weekend, Moore claimed, without any evidence, that the story was an "intentional act to stop the campaign."The Post has been clear about what happened.According to the paper, reporter Stephanie McCrummen, an Alabama native, stumbled upon the subject "while reporting a story in Alabama about supporters of Moore's Senate campaign."When McCrummen was told about Moore's alleged behavior, the paper followed up and contacted other women who used to know him."All were initially reluctant to speak publicly but chose to do so after multiple interviews, saying they thought it was important for people to know about their interactions with Moore," according to the Post."The women say they don't know one another."Other reporters have confirmed that they had heard rumors about Moore."There had been rumors through the years.And, you know, for a lot of Alabama political reporters, this is going to be the one that got away," Kyle Whitmire, a state political columnist for Alabama Media Group, said on CNN last week.Still, Moore and his defenders have rallied around the idea that the Post is part of a conspiracy to imperil Moore's candidacy.Reporters from Atlanta, Washington and New York have flown in to cover the aftermath of the allegations.Staffers from the right-wing Breitbart News, which supports Moore, have also arrived in the state, reportedly to investigate the accusers named in the story."Breitbart aims to discredit Roy Moore's accusers" was the headline on Axios.com on Sunday night.One of Breitbart's stories, labeled "exclusive," was titled "Mother of Roy Moore Accuser: Washington Post Reporters Convinced My Daughter to Go Public."The Post, of course, said that the accusers were reluctant to speak, so this story just had the effect of confirming the original account.But Breitbart's narrative appealed to Moore's ardent supporters.Tim Lockette, one of Davis's reporters at the Anniston Star, responded via Twitter: "Seeking sources and asking them for comment is not a crime.It's not misconduct.Journalism is not shameful.It keeps this nation free."The ongoing controversy inspired Davis to publish a column in Sunday's Star: "In defense of journalism."Several of the state's biggest newspapers and news web sites are owned by the same company, Advance Publications.Given the ongoing scandal, the umbrella home page on AL.com has a special top section called "Latest on Roy Moore," with half a dozen links to the latest developments.But to put the coverage in perspective, four of the five most-read stories on AL.com on Monday were about college football.A version of this column appeared in the "Reliable Sources" newsletter.Sign up for the newsletter here.
Chipotle says it's not to blame for Jeremy Jordan getting sick:::::Chipotle insists that it is not to blame for getting "Supergirl" actor Jeremy Jordan sick, but its stock price dipped anyway.Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG)'s shares were down Monday morning, partly recovering from its initial 4% drop.It was the first day of trading since Jordan blamed Chipotle, via Instagram, for getting him sick last week, according to a report from People.com.But a Chipotle spokesman told CNNMoney that the company has investigated the situation and concluded that it did not cause his illness, which put the actor in the hospital."We were sorry to hear Jeremy was sick and were able to get in touch with him directly regarding where and when he ate," said Chipotle spokesman Chris Arnold, in an email to CNNMoney."There have been no other reported claims of illness at the restaurant where he dined.We take all claims seriously, but we can't confirm any link to Chipotle given the details he shared with us."Representatives for Jordan, a Broadway actor and star of Warner Bros. television show "Supergirl" did not immediately respond to messages from CNNMoney.(Warner Bros. and CNNMoney share the parent company Time Warner.)Nick Setyan, analyst for Wedbush Securities, said that Jordan's Instagram post was definitely the cause tor the drop in stock price, even if the company wasn't actually to blame."It is 100% the reason why it is down today," said Setyan, senior vice president of equity research, in an email to CNNMoney."Unfortunately, Chipotle is exposed to these types of unsubstantiated claims for the foreseeable future."Related: Chipotle earnings prevail, despite host of troubles Since 2015, Chipotle restaurants in various locations around the country have been plagued by outbreaks of E. coli and norovirus, sickening hundreds of people.The most recent reports of illness happened in July at a restaurant in Sterling, Virginia.Rodents were also sighted at one of its Dallas restaurants earlier this year, and a video of the vermin went viral..But the Mexican-style fast food chain said that sales and profits rose significantly its latest quarter, despite costly Hurricanes Irma and Harvey and April malware attack.
GE is breaking up with the light bulb, its most iconic accomplishment:::::General Electric is getting rid of the light bulb, the most iconic product of GE's 125-year existence.Unveiling GE's roadmap, new CEO John Flannery said that the company would focus on its health, power and aviation businesses.Lighting didn't make the cut to be part of GE's future.The news itself isn't a shock: The company said in July that it was looking to sell its lighting business.Lighting is by far GE's smallest division, making up just under 2% of the company's overall revenue.And light bulb sales have fallen 66% so far this year.Still, a GE (GE) without light bulbs feels like an AT&T without telephone service, Campbell's without tomato soup or GM without Chevrolet.Light bulbs' and GE: An intertwined history Thomas Edison invented the first commercially viable incandescent light bulb in 1879.A year later, he founded the Edison Lamp Company and began manufacturing light bulbs for sale.By 1890, Edison had consolidated Edison Lamp with most of his other businesses under Edison General Electric, and in 1892 merged with the Thomson-Houston Electric Company to form the GE we all know.Light bulbs quickly took off after that, as did innovation that improved the invention.In 1892, GE began machine-molding bulbs instead of hand-blowing them.In 1906, GE engineer William Coolidge developed the modern light bulb with a long-lasting and super-bright tungsten filament -- an improvement that GE commercialized in 1911.Related: GE cuts its dividend for just second time since the Depression By 1935, GE's light bulbs were bright enough to light the first ever Major League Baseball night game, played in Cincinnati.GE invented the fluorescent bulb in 1938, the halogen lamp in 1959 and the LED in 1962.GE made more recent advances too.In 2001, it introduced GE Reveal light bulbs that filter out yellow light to produce more natural illumination.And in 2010, it produced its first ever smart LED bulb that connects to the internet.When GE ditches its lighting division, a move scheduled for next year or 2019, it will be the first time the light bulb hasn't been part of GE since the darn thing was invented.What's wrong with light bulbs So why ditch light bulbs now?The market is dimming, so to speak.Business was booming between 2007 and 2014, when customers bought up expensive LED light bulbs to replace their inefficient incandescents.But there's a problem for light bulb makers like GE: LEDs last for decades.With no need to replace them, the bottom fell out of the market.Prices -- and revenue -- began to tumble.Related: GE wants to unload its iconic light bulb business The dust finally appears to be settling, and IHS lighting analyst Jamie Fox said in a recent report that he expects growth to return to the light bulb market this year.GE agrees and actually has high near-term hopes for its lighting business.The company said Monday it expects light bulb sales to grow a modest 5% and profit to rise 15% next year.But that growth will largely be fueled by Current, a billion-dollar GE business that sells LED lighting systems to businesses.GE plans on keeping Current after it sells its consumer lighting division (a buyer has yet to emerge).In its presentation to investors Monday, GE said its future would focus on businesses with strong growth, predictability and cash generation.None of those apply to light bulbs.
New York Times books editor to head Vanity Fair:::::For the first time in more than 20 years, Vanity Fair has a new editor in chief.Radhika Jones, the editorial director of The New York Times books department and former editor in chief of Time magazine, will take over as top editor of Vanity Fair, replacing Graydon Carter.Vanity Fair confirmed the news Monday, after multiple reports over the weekend indicated that Jones was taking over.Jones, 44, will be the first woman to run Vanity Fair since Tina Brown, a British journalist who edited the magazine from 1984 to 1992.She will also be the first woman of color to hold the top editing spot at Vanity Fair, which is owned by Cond Nast."There is nothing else out there quite like Vanity Fair," Jones said in a statement."It doesn't just reflect our culture -- it drives our understanding of it."Jones will become only Vanity Fair's fifth editor in chief, a job that still carries glitz and prestige even in an era of harsh newsroom cutbacks.Cond Nast has not been insulated from that climate, with layoffs arriving last week at another one of its iconic magazines, GQ.Vanity Fair said Jones' appointment begins December 11, marking a dramatic newsroom shift for the magazine.After 25 years as editor in chief, Carter, 68, said earlier this year that he plans to resign in December, ending a storied run for one of the last remaining giants of New York media.Carter's announcement prompted immediate speculation over his replacement, with names such as New York magazine's Adam Moss and Janice Min, who stepped down earlier this year as The Hollywood Reporter's lead editor, floated as possible successors.On Monday, Jones' most recent employer, the New York Times, described her hire at Vanity Fair as a "surprise choice."Cond Nast brass hailed her credentials.Anna Wintour, the longtime editor in chief of Vogue and artist director at Cond Nast, called Jones "a fearless and brilliant editor whose intelligence and curiosity will define the future of Vanity Fair in the years to come."
How to switch jobs and land a bigger salary:::::If you're gunning for more pay at work, new data says switching jobs could be the key.Here's how to ask for more money during an interview, and some of CNNMoney's other tips for making and saving the big bucks this week.JUMPING SHIP PAYS OFF Switching jobs could lead to more money.Teachers, nurses, construction workers and even hotel employees who switched jobs recently saw bigger wage increases than their former colleagues who stayed put, according to new research from ADP, the payment processor.Now might be the time to switch.There's nearly a record number of open jobs in the U.S. economy.TALKING SALARY IN AN INTERVIEW Salary talk during the hiring process is a delicate dance.Some experts suggest tackling salary requirements at the start of the interview process, while others recommended waiting until later.Read this if you're not sure how much to ask for, or if you're not even ready to talk money.BAD CREDIT COULD TRIP YOU UP You know that bad credit is, well, bad.But did you know it could hurt your chances of getting a new job?By federal law, an employer can look at your credit history, which shows debt, loans, credit accounts, and much more.Here are other ways bad credit can hurt you, and how to raise your score.ONE WAY TO CHECK YOUR CREDIT SCORE Using a budgeting app can help you keep track of your bills.Intuit's Mint also updates you on your credit score.But user beware.CNNMoney's Laura Sanicola says she feels like the app's alerts got a little too judgmental.WHEN IT'S OK TO BUY A BOAT People often don't treat the money received through some kind of windfall the same way they do their regular income.If you've recently come into some new money and buying a boat or throwing a lavish party is your first inclination, you're not alone.But if you're scared of wasting something like an inheritance, here are the best ways to invest the money.
Yankees star Aaron Judge signs deal with Pepsi:::::Aaron Judge represents the new generation -- for the New York Yankees, and now, for Pepsi.The Yankees outfielder and finalist for the Rookie of the Year will serve as the new spokesperson for Pepsi, the soda giant announced Monday."Having grown up with Pepsi in my home, it makes this partnership even more special," Judge said in a statement.Judge will represent Pepsi beverages, including regular, Diet Pepsi and Pepsi Zero Sugar.The company said it would work with Judge in 2018 and into the future, but did not immediately disclose further terms of the deal."We are thrilled to welcome Aaron to the Pepsi family," said Justin Toman, the senior director of sports marketing for PepsiCo (PEP)."He's one of the biggest rising stars in baseball and we're looking forward to working together to engage baseball enthusiasts in new and unique ways next season and beyond."Related: MLB drops Pepsi for Coca-Cola Judge's baseball career has seen nothing short of a meteoric rise this year.He scored the most home runs by a rookie and has won over baseball fans everywhere.He's considered a shoo-in to be named American League Rookie of the Year.The superstar's stately last name has also brought about a slew of punny souvenirs and fan rituals.A section in the right-field bleachers at Yankee Stadium has been christened the "Judge's Chambers," where fans often don judge's robes, barristers' wigs and hold signs reading "All Rise."Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor is even known to be a fan.The relationship is also a major get for Pepsi.Major League Baseball hasn't been a big fan of the company as of late -- in April, the league announced that it was dropping Pepsi in favor of a new deal with rival Coca-Cola.Even though Coke became the MLB's official sponsor, Pepsi held onto existing partnerships with 11 teams, including the New York Yankees.
Bitcoin surges $900 in 14 hours. What's going on?:::::Bitcoin is on an exceptionally wild ride.The digital currency gained as much as $920 on Monday, before losing some ground to trade near $6,500.Over the past week it has bounced as high as $7,720 and as low as $5,620 -- a swing of nearly 30%.Analysts said that volatility has spiked after plans to split Bitcoin (XBT) into two were dropped last week amid a backlash from owners and fans of the currency.The proposed split, or "fork," would have allowed for faster transaction processing speeds."One of the main problems with Bitcoin is that it does not scale up properly as more and more users adopt it," said Daniele Bianchi, assistant professor of finance at Warwick Business School.But not everyone was on board with the plan.Bianchi said that opponents preferred the status quo because they see Bitcoin as an investment rather than a method of payment.John Spallanzani, chief macro strategist at the broker GFI, said that calling off the split caused Bitcoin prices to collapse and rival digital currencies to surge.But he expected Monday's rebound and says it could continue."Bitcoin has been prone to sizable corrections and we had two such large corrections just this year," he said."However, [in each case Bitcoin] subsequently made a new high."Related: What is Bitcoin?Bitcoin owners don't have too much to complain about.The currency has gained nearly 600% this year, and its price has doubled from as recently as mid-September.The momentum has been helped by several major endorsements.Japan recognized Bitcoin as legal tender in April.And CME Group (CME), which owns the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, announced plans last month to start listing Bitcoin futures contracts during the fourth quarter.But analysts are divided on the future of the alternative currency."Bitcoin prices will be volatile -- it has been like that the last few years and it will be like that the next few years," said Ronnie Moas, an analyst at Standpoint Research.He thinks Bitcoin could reach $50,000 in just a few years.Researchers at UBS, however, say that recent price rises are the result of speculative trading.They wrote in a research note that following a twenty-fold increase in Bitcoin prices over two years, "cryptocurrency prices are almost certainly a bubble."
Iran: Total may have to rethink Iran deal due to Trump:::::President Trump's get-tough approach to Iran could kill a huge energy investment signed just four months ago.Under the deal, Total (TOT) and China's CNPC agreed to invest billions of dollars in Iran to develop the giant South Pars gas field in partnership with Iran's Petropars.It was the first investment of its kind since sanctions on Iran were relaxed in 2016 after Tehran promised to roll back its nuclear program.Trump has threatened to quit the nuclear deal if the U.S. Congress and America's allies fail to strengthen it."Either we can do the deal legally if there is a legal framework," Total CEO Patrick Pouyann told CNNMoney Emerging Markets Editor John Defterios."If we cannot do that for legal reasons, because of [a] change of [the] regime of sanctions, then we have to revisit it."Trump unveiled a tough and comprehensive new policy towards Iran last month.He accused Tehran of violating the nuclear accord, and announced that he would no longer certify that the lifting of sanctions was in U.S. interests.The agreement is now effectively in limbo while Congress decides how to respond, but Trump's strategy risks setting off a chain of events that ends up derailing the nuclear deal.Total is expanding in the U.S. "If there is a sanctions regime [on Iran], we have to look at it carefully," said Pouyann."We work in the U.S., we have assets in the U.S., we just acquired more assets in the U.S." Total last week increased its U.S. presence with the purchase of a portfolio of liquified natural gas assets from Engie (ENGIY), including the company's stake in the Cameron LNG project in Louisiana, one of the first new gas export terminals in North America.That deal ups the stakes for the French firm.For now, though, it's business as usual in Iran."We are working on the project.We launched the tenders, we should award... contracts by January," Pouyann said."I hope by that time, Congress will have an answer for the president and the president will have to renew, or not [renew], the certification."Losing Total would be a huge blow for Iran.Tehran needs foreign investment to develop its vast energy potential and it was recently touting projects worth $200 billion in the hope of attracting companies such as BP (BP), Russia's Gazprom (GZPFY) and Petronas of Malaysia.
Light at the end of GE's tunnel? Lighting, more, may be gone:::::General Electric slashed its dividend in half and will attempt to vastly narrow its focus to three key sectors aviation, health care and energy as the conglomerate with early ties to Thomas Edison considers shedding even its historic lighting business.The company also pulled back on profit expectations Monday and shares slumped 7.2 percent, their biggest one-day loss since the financial crisis was roiling the stock market in early 2009.New Chairman and CEO John Flannery said the company is weighing the future of its transportation, industrial, and lighting businesses so that it can focus more intently on its most profitable divisions.GE's quarterly dividend is being cut to 12 cents to bring payouts to shareholders closer in line with the amount of money that the company is bringing in.According to S&P Global, GE will save $4 billion a year.Flannery, speaking at GE's investor meeting in New York, said 2018 will be a "reset" year, and projected a profit of between $1 and $1.07 a share.That's well below the $1.15 a share analysts expected, according to FactSet.GE also forecast weaker cash flows than analysts had projected.Last month Flannery said that GE would shed business units worth more than $20 billion over the next year or two.It has been paring businesses for well over a decade now.He has been tasked with reviving growth and says the cost-cutting moves are intended to make GE simpler and stronger.GE lost $1.47, or 7.2 percent, to $19.02.The stock hadn't fallen that much in one day since March 30, 2009.It's down 40 percent this year and trading at five-year lows.General Electric also said it may distance itself from Baker Hughes, the oil and gas giant of which it bought a majority stake earlier this year.Flannery said the integration of Baker Hughes into GE's business is going well, but the company seeks to lessen its exposure to volatile energy prices."The first 100 days maybe didn't go exactly as I was expecting," said Flannery, who became CEO in August.Baker Hughes fell $1.07, or 3.2 percent, to $31.88.After a weak third quarter, Flannery said last month that GE was planning major cost cuts across the board and that it would exit some businesses.The company has already surpassed its goal of cutting $1 billion in industrial costs this year, and plans more than $2 billion in cuts next year.That is double the original target, to go with at least $20 billion in divestments over the next year or two, Flannery said.The company's board is shrinking as well, Flannery said, from 18 members, to 12.There will be three new directors with relevant industry experience, annual elections for board members, and a term limit of 15 years.Board changes will be in effect by April.Last month GE said two of its vice chairs will leave at the end of the year as the company continued to announce changes at the top after the end of Jeffrey Immelt's 16-year run.The company also replaced its chief financial officer.In terms of the amount paid to investors, the dividend cut is one of the largest in U.S. corporate history.S&P Global said the largest ever was also made by GE: the company axed $8.9 billion in annual spending in early 2009 when it cut its dividend in response to the global financial crisis.That reduced GE's quarterly payments to 10 cents from 31 cents.
Amazon or Walmart? Some retailers are choosing alliances:::::Store chains feeling the upheaval in retail are making strategic alliances and that can mean picking sides.Kohl's shoppers can find Amazon devices at some stores, and return items they bought from the online retailer.Nike has made some of its sneakers available through Amazon.The owner of Sears is selling Kenmore-branded appliances on Amazon in some markets.And Best Buy is teaming up with Amazon for voice shopping.Meanwhile, Walmart, which has the most store locations, is assembling a coalition of its own: buying smaller online brands and becoming the highest-profile partner to Google in voice shopping.And the discount chain that touts low prices announced a web partnership Monday with high-end department store Lord & Taylor."When you are in an historic uncharted chaotic situation, you often see these strange bedfellows," said Joel Bines, co-head of AlixPartners' retail practice and a managing director at the firm.Since the beginning of the year, several retailers have filed for bankruptcy protection, including well-known names like Toys R Us.And retailers have announced thousands of store closings, with more expected.Analysts say some brands realize they might not succeed alone."You have to be challenging accepted norms.So you might find partners that you normally wouldn't have considered," said Wendy Liebmann, CEO of WSL Strategic Retail."This has exploded because of the urgency to change.You look at retailers who are closing or struggling."So as Amazon moves even further into fashion, home electronics and grocery stores, and cements shopper loyalty with its $99-a-year Prime membership, stores are developing partnerships with the online retailer to increase customer traffic or expand their offerings online.At the participating Kohl's stores, shoppers will find 1,000-square-foot Amazon areas that sell Echos, Fire tablets and other gadgets.People can also arrange to have an Amazon employee visit their home and install a device or recommend smart home products to buy.And some stores pack and ship eligible Amazon return items for free.Kohl's hopes the arrangement brings in shoppers who might pick up clothes or home items.Analysts say other department stores, facing the same kind of issues, could follow.From its base with 4,700 U.S. stores, Walmart is lining up other partners.In voice shopping, it hooked up with Google, which has signed up other chains such as Target and Home Depot to fight the dominance of Amazon's Alexa-powered Echo devices.Lord & Taylor's president Liz Rodbell told The Associated Press the arrangement with Walmart allows the chain to attract new customers who already are buying higher-end products on Walmart.com.She called the partnership "a pivotal moment" for the retailer.It comes after the chain's parent company announced last month it was selling its New York flagship building to WeWork and leasing back a portion of the space.Neither company would say the financial details of the arrangement.Denise Incandela, head of fashion at Walmart's U.S. e-commerce division, says it's focusing on specialized shopping experiences, starting with fashion.Since the $3 billion-plus acquisition of Jet.com last year, Walmart has bought several online brands like Bonobos and ModCloth.Analysts say Walmart is developing its own higher-end online mall as a way to counter Amazon's dominance.Bines said it's a good strategy, since Walmart.com could attract "an entirely different demographic" from the chain's physical stores.Walmart store customers have a median household income of about $48,000, below the $56,000 for walmart.com customers, according to Craig Johnson, president of the retail consulting group Customer Growth Partners.Amazon.com shoppers have a median income of $85,000, Johnson estimates.Liebmann says the bigger question is whether there would be any resistance from Lord & Taylor shoppers.Bonobos and ModCloth fans complained vociferously on social media when reports were swirling about Walmart's move to buy the brands."It has to be presented well," Liebmann said.Overall, Bines expects Amazon and Walmart to announce more partnerships."In the next two or three years, companies will chose sides," he said."But after that, the lines will be blurred."Follow Anne D'Innocenzio: http://twitter.com/ADInnocenzio
US budget deficit up sharply to $63.2 billion in October:::::The federal government began its new budget year with an October deficit of $63.2 billion, up sharply from a year ago.The Treasury Department reported Monday that the October deficit was 37.9 percent higher than the $45.8 billion deficit recorded in October 2016.Both government receipts and spending were up for the month, with receipts climbing 14.3 percent to $235.3 billion, a record for the month of October.The larger spending figure was up a sizable 11.6 percent to $298.6 billion.The deficit for the 2017 budget year, which ended on Sept. 30, totaled $666 billion, up 13.7 percent from a 2016 deficit of $586 billion.Many forecasters believe the deficit will rise higher in the current budget year, reflecting the impact of proposed tax cuts Congress is considering and hurricane relief.The Congressional Budget Office estimated in June that the deficit for the current budget year, which runs from Oct. 1 to Sept. 30, would fall to $563 billion.However, that estimate did not include money for a tax cut being pushed by the Trump administration and GOP lawmakers.It also did not include increased spending to deal with three devastating hurricanes that have hit the U.S. mainland and territories.Taking those developments into account, economists at JPMorgan Chase estimate that the deficit in the current budget year could climb to $675 billion, with the deficit in 2019 rising even higher to $909 billion.Lawmakers passed a budget resolution that would provide for $1.5 trillion in additional deficits over the next decade to reflect the lost revenue from the pending tax cuts.The Trump administration contends the tax cuts will end up generating increased economic activity and will not be that expensive.For October, the 11.2 percent rise in spending reflected an increase of $4 billion in spending by the Department of Homeland Security, with outlays rising from $4 billion in October 2016 to $8 billion last month, a jump that was attributed to higher spending for hurricane relief.The 14.3 percent increase in revenues included a $12 billion increase in individual taxes, including payroll taxes for Social Security, compared to October 2016.The government has run deficits in October for each of the past 64 years.
How one man says he grosses millions by reselling clearance items online:::::Buy low, sell high.Its a simple idea that a bored accountant used to create a multi-million dollar business, and one that he says you can replicate as a side-hustle.Ryan Grant, a 28 year-old former accountant from Minneapolis, Minnesota, started shopping for sales in popular retail stores.He would beeline for the clearance rack and buy items in bulk.But instead of purchasing what he liked, Grant came armed with a secret weapon: an Amazon seller account and his phone.Grant would find sale items in Walmart, Target and Toys R Us, then used the Amazon seller app to compare them to online prices.ABC Soon, Grant learned the basics of business by buying low, listing on Amazon, selling high and repeating.Using this plan, he left his accountant job and started a part-time gig that he says now generates almost $4 million dollars in revenue.I was able to get that to about $1,000 a month in profit working about 10 hours a week," said Grant, who documents his shopping endeavors on his website, Onlinesellingexperiment.com.Amazon has its own marketplace, not unlike eBay, where businesses and individuals can sell almost anything.The seller app lets users scan a barcode and see the going rate on Amazon.Grant realized that if the price online was 50 percent higher than the price in store, he could net a profit.Since this started as a side-hustle for Grant, I wanted to see what the learning curve was and try it myself.ABC A how-to on buying low, selling high on Amazon.It takes me a total of five minutes to create an Amazon seller account.It ties into your existing Amazon account, so all you really need to add is your Social Security number and bank information.The seller account I signed up for costs $39 a month.I download the seller app to my phone and head to a local superstore.I go straight to the clearance rack and fire up the app.I use the built-in barcode scanner to quickly check prices on all the items.I find a set of Sharpie pens marked down to $10.On Amazon, they are selling for $17.89.I also find a ninja toy marked down to $4 thats $9.49 online, and a set of snow tire chains on clearance for $25 but selling on Amazon for $59.99.Calculating my profit is not exactly simple, so let me try to explain: the app does a good job showing you what you will make after Amazon takes a percentage in fees.My tire chains had a $9 Amazon fee, $1.42 fee on the toy and $2.68 on the pens.ABC The issue of shipping.Since I have a short time-frame for this experiment, I choose mail to sellers directly.It's not terribly cost effective and it takes my total profit down to about $35.Grant, on the other hand, is working at a larger scale--but he says even a part-timer can do this.Grant buys as many of an item as he can and sends it all to an Amazon warehouse.They do the shipping to individual customers.Its what that phrase fulfillment by Amazon means next to an item.It saves him the hassle of shipping, but he factors 50 cents per pound in cost on every item he has to bulk-mail to the Amazon warehouse.Individual sellers like me can mail directly to customers, but theres a lot of postage costs that Amazon can even out at its scale.Its this fulfillment by Amazon that Grant says makes the business viable in ways it wasnt in the past by using eBay or Craigslist.ABC Grant's advice for profiting big.Grant says hes on track to gross nearly $4 million in total sales this year.He pays 11 employees including himself, and his salary is $60,000 a year.He says the company nets a profit of about 10 to 15 percent, but he is reinvesting that back into the business to grow it.ABCNews.com When asked if he thinks this is a viable side-hustle, he says, "Yes, but give yourself a few months to learn."Grant also noted that it takes one to two months to figure out a system, understand what sells and find good sale items.As for his two worst purchases along the learning curve: a Dremel-like dog nail trimmer and life-size Elsa dolls.But for a man whos figured out how to get paid to bargain hunt, it seems like they are lessons well learned.
Dunkin' Donuts doubles down on cookie-inspired flavors for the holidays:::::Dunkin' Donuts is betting dollars on cookie-flavored doughnuts this holiday season, taking a cue from the huge popularity of its cookie-dough-flavored coffee.For the 2017 holidays, the ubiquitous doughnut chain is trying out two specialty cookie flavors: a frosted sugar cookie doughnut with cookie dough filling and topped with cookie crumbles and a gingerbread cookie doughnut decorated with caramel frosting and gingerbread cookie sprinkles.Dunkin Donuts The cookie flavors follow high demand for the cookie dough coffee flavor, which has been a longtime fan favorite, according to a recent poll that Dunkin' Donuts conducted.The coffee flavor could make a summer 2018 return, since it fared so well in the poll.This isn't the first holiday season that Dunkin' Donuts has paid homage to holiday cookies.Its 2015 holiday menu had a sugar-cookie-flavored coffee, which is not being offered this season.Dunkin Donuts Last Valentine's Day, the doughnutmaker's holiday menu featured its first cookie-dough-filled varieties, in heart shapes and with pink frosting.The company, headquartered in Massachusetts, will be serving holiday-decorated doughnuts and Munchkins its name for doughnut holes with snowflake sprinkles.This year's seasonal cookie-flavored doughnuts will be available by Nov. 20, the company said.
Idea at the heart of GOP tax plan: 'trickle-down' economics:::::The House Republicans' tax-cut plan springs from a core argument: What's good for big business and the moneyed elite is inevitably good for the economy and everyone else.Their plan would slash corporate tax rates, end inheritance taxes for the ultra-rich and create new tax advantages for business owners.To help pay for some of those breaks, the plan would end tax deductions for college loans, high medical bills, moving costs and state and local income taxes.It would also add $1.4 trillion to the national debt over 10 years.Taken as a whole, the tax plan would drastically lighten the burden on the powerful groups that Republican leaders say would strengthen the economy while eliminating some benefits for the middle class they've called their top priority.Some new benefits for ordinary households like a family credit would expire in five years.And some existing benefits would erode with inflation.But the Trump administration and Republican lawmakers argue that the goodies they would bestow on corporations and the wealthy would, in the political parlance of the 1980s, inevitably "trickle down" to everyone else.Analyses from the White House contend that cutting the tax rates that corporations pay would ultimately result in $4,000 in additional income annually for the average U.S. household.It's a claim that many mainstream economists have disputed as improbable.And it's provided Democratic lawmakers with a rhetorical line of attack against the tax cuts: They're fundamentally unfair.On Monday, as the House Ways and Means Committee worked its way through the bill, Rep. Suzan DelBene stressed what she described as the inequality at the heart of the bill."If a worker in my district had to move because his employer is forcing him to relocate his family or potentially lose his job, can he deduct his moving expenses under this plan?"asked DelBene, a Washington state Democrat.No, she was told by Thomas Barthold, chief of staff for Congress' Joint Committee on Taxation."But if a company, a corporation, decides to close its facilities in my district, fire its workers and move its operation to China, say, can it deduct associated moving expenses under this plan?"Yes, Barthold said.That company could shrink its tax bill by deducting moving costs something families could no longer do.By cutting the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 20 percent, the bill would reduce the tax liability of corporations by $846.5 billion over the next decade, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation.What's more, businesses could deduct the expense of state and local income taxes.Families no longer could.Companies could deduct the price of equipment bought for employees.Yet teachers could no longer deduct some of the costs of school supplies that they bought for students.Nearly the entire net tax cut for individuals would come from two changes that would do nothing for most of the middle class: The government would repeal the alternative minimum tax, a provision that has long prevented many wealthy taxpayers from using loopholes to avoid paying taxes.The loss of the AMT would cause a revenue shortfall of nearly $700 billion over 10 years.Also gone under the Republican bill: The inheritance tax on estates worth at least $5.5 million.That would let wealthy heirs keep an extra $172 billion over the next decade.The plan would also allow business owners whose profits double as their personal income to pay, in part, at a discounted rate of 25 percent.This would cause the loss of an additional $448 billion over 10 years.Given how these business owners are classified, the plan would let them deduct their state and local taxes from the equivalent of their personal income.By contrast, the employees of those business owners could not do so.Taken together, that's $2.17 trillion worth of benefits that would help mainly companies and the wealthiest segment of the U.S. population.By getting rid of itemized deductions such as for medical costs and state and local taxes that now help many middle class and affluent taxpayers, the plan would raise an additional $1.26 trillion during the next decade.Every tax overhaul tends to create some layer of inequality.The best chance for faster growth often comes from lowering corporate rates and clearing the underbrush of loopholes where companies can hide cash.What makes this tax plan unusual is that many of the tax breaks that Republican lawmakers and President Donald Trump would like to preserve for companies would be taken away from families and individuals.The solution isn't simple.Lowering corporate tax rates can help make the United States more globally competitive.It can also help increase investment by domestic and foreign companies, which could spur job growth.Yet critics note that the stock market is booming and the unemployment rate is an exceedingly low 4.1 percent.So the benefits for the job market could be minimal.Still, advocates of the Republican plan argue that companies are ideally positioned to immediately invest savings from tax cuts."Business investment is likely more responsive to changes in tax policy than households," said Scott Greenberg, a senior analyst at the conservative Tax Foundation, whose own analysis suggests that cutting the corporate rate to 20 percent among other changes would help generate roughly 1 million jobs.Multinational companies already go out of their way to avoid U.S. taxes by shifting profits overseas or exploiting accounting rules.Research by Gabriel Zucman, an economist at the University of California at Berkeley, found that 63 percent of U.S. companies' foreign profits come from known tax havens.Republicans are betting that companies would shift more of those profits back to the United States under their plan.Relatively high U.S. corporate rates can also encourage domestic companies to be acquired by rivals based in countries with lower rates mergers that can lead to job losses if headquarters, offices and factories derive a tax advantage from being overseas.By making the tax code more favorable for businesses, the bill could theoretically increase investment in factories, businesses and workers.But the details of the Republican plan suggest that companies could find it harder to land the skilled workers they say they need.Over 10 years, for example, the plan would repeal roughly $64 billion in tax breaks that promote higher education.College graduates could no longer deduct interest payments on student debt.Ph.D. students who teach and conduct research would be taxed on their waived tuition bill an expense that could force some to drop out.There are about 145,000 graduate students who receive this tuition waiver.Most are concentrated in science, technology, engineering and math."The tax bill as proposed goes completely in the wrong direction," said Steven Bloom, director of government relations at the American Council on Education, which represents many university presidents."It's undercutting our ability to produce the kind of educated workforce that we need to produce."

Man says he's grossing millions reselling clearance items from Walmart on Amazon Video:::::Transcript for Man says he's grossing millions reselling clearance items from Walmart on Amazon We have a surprising story about a man who turned what he called his side hustle reselling items from clearance racks into a successful company.Becky Worley has his secrets.She's going to tell them now.Reporter: Buy sale items and sell them at a profit but one savvy shopper turned that straightforward idea into big business and he says, you can too.This is Ryan grant.Former job accountant.I would say about six months into that job I realized this wasn't the path for me.Reporter: But he learned the basics of business, buy low, sell high.And with that idea started a part-time job that he says now generates almost $4 million in revenue.The 28-year-old who lives in Minneapolis found sale items in Walmart, target, toys "R" us then used the Amazon seller app to compare them to online prices.He'd buy low, list on Amazon, sell high and repeat.I was able to get that to about a thousand dollars a month in profit working about ten hours a week.Reporter: That made him confident enough to quit his accounting job.Now he says he has a warehouse full of boxes, a staff of 11 people and he says you can do it too.Okay.Let's try it.I've already installed the Amazon seller app.It took me like five minutes online.So now all I have to do is go into the store, find some clearance items and then take them home and sell them online hopefully at a profit.Sure enough, I fire up the Amazon seller app and then it has this camera.Using that I scan the bar code for this toy that cost 4 dis here in the store.Online it's selling for $9.49.That's a profit.These pens, buy it for $10, sell it online and make over $5 profit.Finally tire chains.$25 in store, but listed online for $59.Even after I take into account Amazon fees and shipping costs, I profit about $15.After a few months of learning what sells and how to factor in those shipping costs, Ryan thinks you could make $1,000 to $2,000 doing this part time.I do think it's something anyone can do if you're willing to put in the work.Ryan says he's making about 15% profit on sales of roughly $4 million.He only pays himself 60,000 in salary but I see how you could make money in this.I listed my items right from my phone.It took me 60 seconds per thing I'm selling.I tan to make 35 bucks in profit in my little small-scale test.It's not 4 million but it's a start.No, but it's something.Now, I guess it's this app must make all the difference.We've had craigslist and Ebay and people didn't seem to do it.It's all about that phrase you've read before fulfillment by Amazon.He buys in bulk and males everything to an Amazon warehouse.They deal with all the shipping to customers.Ebay and craigslist doesn't do that.This transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.

are known as the most thoughtless gift.Horrible and have you ever tasted one.No, I have not.Just once.I have not.They're horrible.No, no.The reason I'm talking about this, target is actually trying to

or choose an entirely different gift.What do you think about that?Before they ship it you can say, no, thanks, I don't want to fruitcake I'll take socks.I think it's brilliant.I'm tired of my kid, adult, 27 and 25.I know it's a cliche when they say what do you want.I say, this rancwrench.Then they buy me sog I don't want and don't get the socks or wrench.So now you can change it.I do like it.I think it's good.Is it already up and running for the holidays?But Dr. Denis Leary, this is his new book out right now and, you know what, we have been -- Can we say the title.You can say it.We can't say all of it.So I'll say it.So you won't get in trouble.Look, we blocked it out, the last word.It's called "Why we don't suck."Hang on and how all of us need to stop being such partisan little -- rhymes with stitches.What are you doing here?I can see it's on the book.Are you blurring it out.Blurring it out right there.You did start with a warning.I start the book with a warning.Listen, here's how I wrote the book because I -- I voted for Hillary Clinton but I didn't want to, okay.I thought she was a terrible candidate.They don't know what to clap for.[ Laughter That's like, Donald Trump, I didn't vote for Donald Trump obviously.I knew Donald Trump.He did a cameo on an ABC sitcom I did years ago called "The job."He also did a tinge on "The apprentice" for my foundation.He was a nice guy.He was generous.He was on time.He knew his lines when he had them memorized but he was a different color.He was white.He was actually -- he made me look like I was a dark skinned person.He was so white so it was a different guy.But he -- whatever you want to say about trump, he has changed the game.So after the election I did -- I do this concert every year for the cancer foundation at T.D.Garden.This year it's November 18th.Yeah.So four days after the election, I did a concert and what I basically did was go up and stage and vent against Hillary and against trump and the audience was explosive so people -- I could tell they had -- half voted for Hillary and half voted for trump so to me I thought I got to write ray book about it because it got more and more divisive and nothing is getting done.So in trump's world which he's changed the game, celebrities can now become president so I think we have to look at it that's why I said George 2020.Weed to to stop -- yeah, let's change the process.I want to have -- talk about so you think you can dance or "Dancing with the stars" we should have a reality show to elect the next president.Someone said we already did that.Right.I mean, because the debates suck.We don't learn anything at the debates so I say you have a 13-week reality show called "President idol" as Howard Stern was calling it or I call it "America's got leaders."Four celebrity judge answer have all these people that want to run for 1 week, give them tanks, make them dance, sing, whatever you want to do and on November 2nd or 7th we vote by phone.That's it.No electric tort college.That's it.The winner is the winner.I mean I think that's the future, you know.Something to think about.It's so scary.Nick lachey would be a great presidential candidate on that show.I'm telling you.Justin Timberlake could be president.I think we need a woman.I want Oprah.Yay.There we go.I want Oprah.There you go.Because --S if.Oprah would be so great because you know every three weeks she'd give us free stuff.You know what I mean.That wouldn't suck.That would be great.That would be awesome.So anyway the book is about -- it starts with the election and just want to remind I'm out to make people laugh their asses off but I want to talk about racism.All the stuff that was so divisive that's still happening, racism and sexism and all that stuff and make people laugh about how twisted we have been in the last couple of years.And that we don't suck.And we don't suck?That is nice and remind ourselves how great of a country we are and like my democratic friends have lost their sense of humor.My Republican friends have lost their sense of humor and nothing is getting done.Look at the carvilles.No, no, no.You don't want me to be president.I'd be impeached within four months.All I would do can just a free beer for everybody.No fruitcake.No fruitcake.No fruitcake.But you can doesn't "Why we don't suck," it's out today.Out today.Are we done?This transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.

Amazon or Walmart? Some retailers are choosing alliances:::::Store chains feeling the upheaval in retail are making strategic alliances and that can mean picking sides.Kohl's shoppers can find Amazon devices at some stores, and return items they bought from the online retailer.Nike has made some of its sneakers available through Amazon.The owner of Sears is selling Kenmore-branded appliances on Amazon in some markets.And Best Buy is teaming up with Amazon for voice shopping.Meanwhile, Walmart, which has the most store locations, is assembling a coalition of its own: buying smaller online brands and becoming the highest-profile partner to Google in voice shopping.And the discount chain that touts low prices announced a web partnership Monday with high-end department store Lord & Taylor."When you are in an historic uncharted chaotic situation, you often see these strange bedfellows," said Joel Bines, co-head of AlixPartners' retail practice and a managing director at the firm.Since the beginning of the year, several retailers have filed for bankruptcy protection, including well-known names like Toys R Us.And retailers have announced thousands of store closings, with more expected.Analysts say some brands realize they might not succeed alone."You have to be challenging accepted norms.So you might find partners that you normally wouldn't have considered," said Wendy Liebmann, CEO of WSL Strategic Retail."This has exploded because of the urgency to change.You look at retailers who are closing or struggling."So as Amazon moves even further into fashion, home electronics and grocery stores, and cements shopper loyalty with its $99-a-year Prime membership, stores are developing partnerships with the online retailer to increase customer traffic or expand their offerings online.At the participating Kohl's stores, shoppers will find 1,000-square-foot Amazon areas that sell Echos, Fire tablets and other gadgets.People can also arrange to have an Amazon employee visit their home and install a device or recommend smart home products to buy.And some stores pack and ship eligible Amazon return items for free.Kohl's hopes the arrangement brings in shoppers who might pick up clothes or home items.Analysts say other department stores, facing the same kind of issues, could follow.From its base with 4,700 U.S. stores, Walmart is lining up other partners.In voice shopping, it hooked up with Google, which has signed up other chains such as Target and Home Depot to fight the dominance of Amazon's Alexa-powered Echo devices.Lord & Taylor's president Liz Rodbell told The Associated Press the arrangement with Walmart allows the chain to attract new customers who already are buying higher-end products on Walmart.com.She called the partnership "a pivotal moment" for the retailer.It comes after the chain's parent company announced last month it was selling its New York flagship building to WeWork and leasing back a portion of the space.Neither company would say the financial details of the arrangement.Denise Incandela, head of fashion at Walmart's U.S. e-commerce division, says it's focusing on specialized shopping experiences, starting with fashion.Since the $3 billion-plus acquisition of Jet.com last year, Walmart has bought several online brands like Bonobos and ModCloth.Analysts say Walmart is developing its own higher-end online mall as a way to counter Amazon's dominance.Bines said it's a good strategy, since Walmart.com could attract "an entirely different demographic" from the chain's physical stores.Walmart store customers have a median household income of about $48,000, below the $56,000 for walmart.com customers, according to Craig Johnson, president of the retail consulting group Customer Growth Partners.Amazon.com shoppers have a median income of $85,000, Johnson estimates.Liebmann says the bigger question is whether there would be any resistance from Lord & Taylor shoppers.Bonobos and ModCloth fans complained vociferously on social media when reports were swirling about Walmart's move to buy the brands."It has to be presented well," Liebmann said.Overall, Bines expects Amazon and Walmart to announce more partnerships."In the next two or three years, companies will chose sides," he said."But after that, the lines will be blurred."Follow Anne D'Innocenzio: http://twitter.com/ADInnocenzio

WASHINGTON (AP) President Donald Trump has picked a former top pharmaceutical and government executive to be his health and human services secretary.If confirmed by the Senate, Alex Azar will oversee

is launching into a discussion Monday with foreign investors about rescuing itself from crushing debt incurred during better times for the oil-rich country.Investors eager to be paid back, however,

heading the talks have been sanctioned by the Trump administration.Puerto Rico seeks $94 billion in federal aid after hurricane WASHINGTON (AP) Puerto Rico's governor is asking the federal government for $94.4 billion as the island struggles to recover from the damage inflicted by Hurricane Maria, with much of the island without power and thousands of U.S. citizens still homeless.Ricardo Rosello

domestic product.Brand diplomacy: in Louvre, France hones soft power strategy PARIS (AP) The French are using brand diplomacy to exert cultural influence in a rapidly-changing, globalized world.The opening of the Louvre Abu Dhabi this weekend is the latest example of how traditional French cultural diplomacy is being supplanted by brand politics.This can be seen in the exporting of Sorbonne's academic reputation, the proliferation of Christian Dior boutiques in Asia and the cuisine of master chef Alain Ducasse.Tax jump for households earning under $200K WASHINGTON (AP) Congressional analysts say the Republican Senate tax bill would increase taxes in 2019 for some 13.8 million U.S households earning less than $200,000 a year.The nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation provided the

recorded in October 2016.Consumer goods firms lead US stocks slightly higher NEW YORK (AP) The major U.S. stock indexes capped a day of mostly subdued trading with slight gains Monday.Consumer and household goods companies posted some of the biggest gains, offsetting losses by industrial and energy stocks.A batch of corporate deal news also helped put investors in a buying mood.Mattel soared

& Poor's 500 index rose 2.54 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,584.84.The Dow Jones industrial average gained 17.49 points, or 0.1 percent, to 23,439.70.The Nasdaq composite added 6.66 points, or 0.1 percent, to 6,757.60.The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks dipped 0.21 o a point, or 0.01 percent, to 1,475.07.Benchmark U.S. crude rose 2 cents to settle at $56.76 per barrel on the New

Rates rise at weekly US Treasury auction:::::Interest rates on short-term Treasury bills rose in Monday's auction to their highest levels in nine years.The Treasury Department auctioned $42 billion in three-month bills at a discount rate of 1.240 percent, up from 1.185 percent last week.Another $36 billion in six-month bills was auctioned at a discount rate of 1.360 percent, up from 1.300 percent last week.The three-month rate was the highest since those bills averaged 1.250 percent on Oct. 20, 2008.The six-month rate was the highest since those bills averaged 1.400 percent on Oct. 27, 2008.The discount rates reflect that the bills sell for less than face value.For a $10,000 bill, the three-month price was $9,968.66 while a six-month bill sold for $9,931.24.That would equal an annualized rate of 1.261 percent for the three-month bills and 1.388 percent for the six-month bills.Separately, the Federal Reserve said Monday that the average yield for one-year Treasury bills, a popular index for making changes in adjustable rate mortgages, rose to 1.54 percent last Friday, up from 1.50 percent at the beginning of the week on Nov. 6.

Council tax debt: Concern over use of bailiffs:::::Image copyright Getty Images Bailiffs were called in to collect debts by councils in England and Wales on more than two million occasions last year, a charity has discovered.Council tax arrears accounted for 60% of cases sent to bailiffs by local authorities in 2016-17, the Money Advice Trust said.The Trust, which runs National Debtline, said more could be done for the vulnerable in debt.The association representing councils said they had a duty to collect taxes.Enforcement agents, commonly known as bailiffs, were used to chase council tax arrears on 1.38 million occasions out of 2.3 million cases, the "Stop the Knock" report by the Money Advice Trust found.They were also used on 810,000 occasions for unpaid parking fines, 86,000 times for unpaid business rates, and on 50,000 occasions to recover overpaid housing benefit, the report found.The use of bailiffs has risen by 14% compared with two years ago when similar research was carried out by the charity.However, it said that there had been widespread improvement in the way councils used this last resort.Its concern was, primarily, in the use of bailiffs by smaller councils.'Last resort' Joanna Elson, chief executive of the Money Advice Trust, said: "The growing use of bailiffs to collect debts by many local authorities is deeply troubling."Councils are under enormous financial pressure, and they of course need to recover what they are owed in order to fund vital services.However, many councils are far too quick to turn to bailiff action."Image copyright Getty Images She said that, in doing so, people could be pushed even further into debt."Bailiff action should only ever be used as a last resort, and can be avoided by early intervention," she added.Some 50 councils had signed up to a protocol aimed at preventing those at risk from getting behind on key payments.The Trust wanted more councils to sign up to an official policy on how to treat vulnerable residents, and to exempt the most vulnerable from bailiff action completely.The Local Government Association, which represents councils, said people facing difficulties should contact their local authority to discuss options such as repayment plans.Claire Kober, who chairs the LGA's resources board, said: "No council wants to ask people on the lowest incomes to pay more, but councils have a duty to their residents to collect taxes - these fund crucial services, such as caring for the elderly, protecting vulnerable children, keeping roads maintained and collecting bins."With councils facing a 5.8bn funding shortfall by 2020, it is essential that these funds are collected so these vital services can be protected."She said that councils took steps, where possible, to ensure people in financial difficulty were supported.
Ikea sees annual UK sales top £1.8bn:::::Image copyright Getty Images Swedish flatpack furniture retailer Ikea says it achieved total UK sales of 1.814bn in the UK for the financial year ending 31 August 2017.That was 5.8% more than in the previous year, and was its sixth consecutive year of UK growth.Market share was up 0.5%, bringing the retailer one step closer to its ambition of increasing overall market share to 15% by 2027.The firm is celebrating its 30th anniversary in the UK this year.The company recently opened stories in Reading and Sheffield, and plans to open two more stores in Exeter and Greenwich, south-east London, during the coming year.A new website has also been launched during the recent financial year, with online now accounting for 15% of total sales."In addition to our global acquisition of TaskRabbit, we also launched click-and-collect in all order and collection points," added Gillian Drakeford, Ikea's UK retail manager.The firm added 1,000 new jobs during the year, bringing worker numbers to 10,900.Some 850 jobs will be added when the two new stores open this year.
Old £10 note to disappear next year:::::Image copyright Nick Ansell/PA Image caption The old 10 mote is soon to go the way of the old pound coin If you still have any old 10 notes, make sure you spend them before 1 March next year.The Bank of England has announced that the old paper notes, featuring naturalist Charles Darwin, will no longer be legal tender after that date.Its days have been numbered since the new polymer tenner, depicting author Jane Austen, entered circulation in September.But the old note can still be exchanged by the Bank after the cut-off date.Threadneedle Street says polymer, also now used for the 5 note featuring Winston Churchill, is more durable and cleaner than paper notes.Security features of Jane Austen 10 note: A see-through window featuring the Queen's portrait Winchester Cathedral shown in gold foil on the front of the note and silver on the back A quill at the side of the window which changes from purple to orange A hologram which contains the word "Ten" and changes to "Pounds" when the note is tilted A hologram of the coronation crown which appears 3D and multi-coloured when the note is tilted Micro-lettering beneath the Queen's portrait with tiny letters and numbers that are visible under a microscope A book-shaped copper foil patch which contains the letters JA The words "Bank of England" printed in intaglio (raised ink) along the top of the note It has persevered with the material despite complaints from religious and vegan groups that the animal fat tallow is used in the production process.Following consultation, the Bank said in August that it would continue with the use of tallow in future banknotes - saying it "has not taken this decision lightly".The Bank assessed whether palm oil or coconut oil should be used instead, but concluded that this might not be able to be sourced sustainably.Changing production would also involve considerable extra costs to taxpayers.The old 10 notes have been in circulation since November 2000, but lost out to the new ones on grounds of security as well as durability.The Jane Austen notes have a number of features built in that make them particularly hard to forge.They also have an inscription in raised dots that helps blind and partially-sighted users to identify them.The end of the old paper tenner follows the official withdrawal last month of the old round 1 coin, which has now been wholly replaced by the new 12-sided version.
Mattel shares soar on Hasbro takeover rumours:::::Image copyright Getty Images Shares in Barbie toymaker Mattel have jumped by 20% on reports rival toy giant Hasbro is considering a takeover.Shares in Hasbro, whose brands include Play Doh and My Little Pony, are also 6% higher in New York.Last month shares in both companies fell after a warning that the bankruptcy of retailer Toys R Us could limit sales.The two companies are among the world's biggest toy makers.Mattel tried to take over Hasbro in 1996.But over the past year the fortunes of the two have diverged markedly, as Mattel grapples with falling sales.Mattel, which is valued at $6bn, is now the smaller firm by many measures.Its shares have lost almost half their value over the past year and were trading at $17.68 on Monday.Hasbro's shares were $97 - $10 higher than a year ago and giving it a market value double that of Mattel.Mattel's depressed share price may make it an attractive takeover target, but it could also make its leaders reluctant to do a deal now, said Jaime Katz, senior equity analyst for Morningstar.Company comparison Mattel, which owns brands such as Fisher-Price, American Girl and Hot Wheels, sells its products in 150 countries and employs 32,000 people globally, including in manufacturing.In its third quarter results released last month, sales fell 13% to $1.56bn and the firm reported a loss.It suspended its dividend payout to shareholders and accelerated a cost-cutting drive.At Hasbro, sales increased 7% to almost $1.8bn in the most recent quarter.The firm, which has shed manufacturing operations, employs about 5,400 people.Hasbro's new chief executive has used story-telling to boost sales - a strategy that would work well with Mattel's products, said analyst Linda Bolton Weiser, who tracks both companies for financial services firm DA Davidson.Image copyright AFP Image caption Hasbro and Mattel were hit by the problems at Toys R Us In a research note, Ms Bolton Weiser said the benefits of a combination "would be immense" and would likely result in hundreds of millions in savings.The proposed takeover in the 1990s faltered amid US competition concerns.It is not clear how US regulators would respond to a deal today.Analysts estimate the two firms together would account for less than 33% of the US toy market.But the industry is changing rapidly, as Amazon becomes more dominant and stalwarts such as Toys R Us struggle.A potential merger could also run into clashes of corporate culture and other processes, Ms Katz wrote in a research note."We caution investors that such speculation [about a combination] has fizzled in the past, and a similar fate could occur this go-round," she said.

Credit Suisse to pay $135m to settle NY investigation:::::Image copyright AFP/Getty Credit Suisse has agreed to pay $135m (103m) after New York regulators found its foreign exchange unit engaged in "unlawful, unsafe and unsound conduct".The probe found traders at the bank improperly co-ordinated with other banks and traded on confidential customer information.The agreement is the latest settlement to arise from a global investigation of foreign currency markets.Credit Suisse said it was pleased "to put this matter behind it".It did not admit or deny the findings of the investigation, but pledged to overhaul its policies to improve oversight and submit progress reports to New York regulators for review.The New York Department of Financial Services investigation found the Credit Suisse misconduct occurred from at least 2008 to 2015.The activities included using software programmed to trade in anticipation of client orders, in a practice called "front-running".It also sometimes rejected client orders, delaying them to benefit the firm's profits, but attributing it to an "error".Traders at the firm also participated in chat rooms, manipulating prices by co-ordinating activities with other banks."Smlls unethical haha" and "if custy ever found out we both dead."wrote a trader at another bank, after working with someone at Credit Suisse.Seven people that investigators found were involved have resigned or been fired, according to the consent order.Global investigation Authorities around the world have levied some $10bn in fines against major banks for co-ordinating their foreign exchange activities, according to Reuters.Credit Suisse also continues to face investigation by other regulators, including in Switzerland, Brazil and Europe, according to its most recent quarterly disclosure.In announcing Monday's settlement, New York Financial Services Superintendent Maria Vullo said executives "deliberately fostered a corrupt culture" that led to the violations.The department reached a $350m settlement with BNP Paribas over similar allegations in May.The department also reached a $635m settlement with Barclays in 2015.
Nisa shareholders back Co-op takeover:::::Image copyright Nisa Shareholders in the Nisa convenience store group have approved the chain's 137m takeover by the Co-operative Group.The deal was backed by 75.79% of shareholders' votes at an emergency meeting, narrowly exceeding the 75% threshold required to approve the deal.Nisa is a member-owned business that has more than 3,000 stores and operates a wholesale business.The deal still needs to be approved by the Competition and Markets Authority.The Nisa board said the deal was in the "best interests" of members.Nisa chairman Peter Hartley said: "The convenience store environment is changing rapidly, and is unrecognisable from that which existed when Nisa was founded more than 40 years ago."Co-op will add buying power and product range to our offering, while respecting our culture of independence."'Discontent' Under the deal, Nisa members will still have the option of choosing not to buy goods through the Co-op.Nisa shareholders will receive an equal initial payment of 20,000, plus deferred payments depending on how many shares they hold.However, there was opposition from some Nisa members who were unhappy about, among other things, the size of the initial payout."The threshold was only surpassed by a fraction, showing that there is still a large amount of discontent around the deal," said Molly Johnson-Jones, senior retail analyst at GlobalData."Many independent retailers are fearful of what the market consolidation will do to their autonomy, and there was dissidence around the idea of being owned by a large corporation."Image copyright Co-operative Group The retail industry is undergoing a period of consolidation.A shift in shopping habits, fierce competition from the likes of Aldi and Lidl, and the arrival of Amazon has prompted retailers such as the Co-op to look to bolster their businesses by buying food wholesalers.Earlier this year Sainsbury's began talks with Nisa about a takeover, before pulling out.Tesco is awaiting the results of an in-depth competition inquiry into its proposed 3.7bn takeover of wholesale giant Booker, which supplies goods to convenience stores, pubs and restaurants.Nisa has nearly 1,200 members, who operate more than 3,200 stores among them, some under the Nisa brand and others under their own names.In the year to 2 April, Nisa reported revenues of 1.25bn.with pre-tax profits of 2.8m."Nisa has futureproofed itself for the increasingly competitive and monopolised convenience market," said GlobalData's Ms Johnson-Jones."Tesco-Booker will operate at a larger scale than any food retail company in the past, and will fundamentally change the structure of the market."It is essential that symbol groups move to acquire greater buying power to avoid being pushed out of the market by the big four [supermarket chains] wielding their new-found convenience and wholesale capabilities.Nisa would now be in a better position to protect its members, she added.However, she said rising costs and high demand for convenience store spaces mean that "it's not going to be easy to be an independent retailer over the medium term, even with a partnership of this size".
Qualcomm rejects Broadcom takeover bid:::::Image copyright Reuters Computer chipmaker Qualcomm has rejected a $103bn (79bn) takeover bid from rival Broadcom.Qualcomm said the offer, which is potentially the largest tech sector takeover to date, "dramatically undervalued" the company.It added that the proposal also came with "significant regulatory uncertainty".Broadcom, which makes chips for products such as smartphones, was offering $70 per share for Qualcomm.The bid comes at a time of consolidation sweeping the industry.Broadcom is waiting for regulatory approval to buy Brocade, while Qualcomm is in talks to buy NXP Semiconductors.Meanwhile, Qualcomm is currently engaged in a legal battle over royalty payments with its biggest customer, Apple.A tie-up between Broadcom and Qualcomm would create the world's third largest chipmaker behind Intel and Samsung.Reacting to the news, Hock Tan, president and chief executive of Broadcom, said: "We continue to believe our proposal represents the most attractive, value-enhancing alternative available to Qualcomm stockholders and we are encouraged by their reaction."Many have expressed to us their desire that Qualcomm meet with us to discuss our proposal."
Huddle's 'highly secure' work tool exposed KPMG and BBC files:::::Image copyright Getty Images The BBC has discovered a security flaw in the office collaboration tool Huddle that led to private documents being exposed to unauthorised parties.A BBC journalist was inadvertently signed in to a KPMG account, with full access to private financial documents.Huddle is an online tool that lets work colleagues share content and describes itself as "the global leader in secure content collaboration".The company said it had fixed the flaw.Its software is used by the Home Office, Cabinet Office, Revenue & Customs, and several branches of the NHS to share documents, diaries and messages."If somebody is putting themselves out there as a world-class service to look after information for you, it just shouldn't happen," said Prof Alan Woodward, from the University of Surrey."Huddles contain some very sensitive information."Image copyright Huddle Image caption The BBC was presented with KPMG's documents In a statement, Huddle said the bug had affected "six individual user sessions between March and November this year"."With 4.96 million log-ins to Huddle occurring over the same time period, the instances of this bug occurring were extremely rare," it said.As well as a BBC employee being redirected to the KPMG account, Huddle said a third party had accessed one of the BBC's Huddle accounts.KPMG has not yet responded to the BBC's request for comment.How was the flaw discovered?On Wednesday, a BBC correspondent logged in to Huddle to access a shared diary that his team kept on the platform.He was instead logged in to a KPMG account, with a directory of private documents and invoices, and an address book.The BBC contacted Huddle to report the security issue.The company later disclosed that a third party had accessed the Huddle of BBC Children's programme Hetty Feather, but it said no documents had been opened.How did this happen?During the Huddle sign-in process, the customer's device requests an authorisation code.According to Huddle, if two people arrived on the same login server within 20 milliseconds of one another, they would both be issued the same authorisation code.This authorisation code is carried over to the next step, in which a security token is issued, letting the customer access their Huddle.Since both User A and User B present the same authorisation code, whoever is fastest to request the security token is logged in as User A.How has Huddle addressed this?Huddle has now changed its system so that every time it is invoked, it generates a new authorisation code.This ensures no two people are ever simultaneously issued the same code."We wish to clarify to Huddle users that this bug has been fixed, and that we continue to work to ensure such a scenario is not repeated," the company told the BBC."We are continuing to work with the owners of the accounts that we believe may have been compromised, and apologise to them unreservedly."
Moncler to push puffas off the catwalk:::::Image copyright Moncler Upmarket outerwear brand Moncler, best known for its puffa jackets, has become the latest fashion company to announce it will no longer launch collections via the catwalk.The company said it would instead mount more frequent brand launches from within its bigger stores.Its jackets can cost about 1,000.Chief executive Remo Ruffini also said Moncler's top designers, Giambattista Valli and Thom Browne, were leaving to work on their own brands.Moncler's twice yearly shows, Gamme Rouge and Gamme Bleu, featured at the Paris and Milan fashion shows this year.There will be one more, for spring/summer 2018.Mr Ruffini said: "The group must vary and open up towards different horizons."Target market A recent report on the luxury goods' sector by global consultants Bain, found a huge percentage of growth - 85% - in the luxury goods market was coming from the younger generation.It also said that down jackets - Moncler's best-known product - were among the three standout categories in which luxury goods companies were hoping to appeal to younger customers.Maureen Hinton, from industry analysts GlobalData, said the move towards store-based events made sense for the brand: "Moncler, despite being luxury, is primarily a casualwear brand, which means trends change less often than with full clothing ranges."Using events and social media is far more likely to engage with its target market and keep the brand front of mind throughout the year.And give a better return on investment."Moncler was founded in France in 1952.Mr Ruffini took over the business in 2003, listing it as a public company in 2013.It now has annual sales of 1bn and has its headquarters in Italy.In a statement, Mr Ruffini said: "I feel really excited about Moncler's future and the challenges that await us.I am all too aware that innovation, focus and dedication are vital for improving every brand and every company."

Regent Street Apple store guard threatened by moped gang:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Robbery in Regent Street Apple store A security guard at a central London Apple store was threatened with a hammer as he tried to stop a gang of raiders on mopeds.Ten suspects on five mopeds smashed their way into the Regent Street shop at 00:45 GMT and escaped with iPhones, iPads and Apple Watches.Two iPhone Xs were later recovered near Kings Cross.The flagship store was fully operational with no visible damage later on Monday morning.Apple declined to comment.Miah Mohammad Sheful, captured video of the raid when he was waiting for a bus nearby.Image caption The Apple store on Regent Street was fully operational later on Monday morning The 28-year-old said it took the suspects several attempts to break in the door of the tech giant's store.Passing cars started beeping their horns to prevent the burglary as they realised what was unfolding, he said.The moped gang got away within seconds.The suspects, described as wearing dark clothing, are said to have made off northbound along Regent Street.The man who threatened the guard was described as black.Moped crime increase The raid comes one month after a gang riding mopeds attacked a jeweller's in the same street.Three suspects are believed to have used a hammer, axe and bats to break into Mappin & Webb on 9 October.They escaped with a high-value haul.Offences involving scooters and mopeds are on the rise in London.Figures suggest that in the year to September, there were more than 19,385 "moped enabled" crimes in the capital - an average of 53 a day - including thefts and robberies.Last month, a moped gang that robbed more than 100 people, including former Chancellor George Osborne, was jailed.Anyone with information about the latest raid is urged to contact the Metropolitan Police.
King Power: Leicester City's owners 'sued for £323m':::::Image copyright Michael Regan Image caption Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha and his family own Leicester City and King Power The owners of Leicester City Football Club are reportedly being sued for 323m over money owed to the Thai government.A criminal court in Bangkok accepted the case against King Power International on Monday, according to Reuters news agency.The case is also being brought against executives of state-owned Airports of Thailand (AOT), Reuters says.The BBC has contacted Leicester City FC, King Power and AOT for comment.Live updates and more from the East Midlands The lawsuit accuses King Power of failing to pay the Thai government 14 billion baht (323m) from the operation of a duty-free franchise it was awarded in 2006.At a hearing on Monday, the Central Criminal Court in Bangkok accepted the case and said it would now hear from witnesses in February next year.The action against King Power, owned by Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha and his family, was initially filed in July.Analysis: Professor Peter Leyland - School of African and Oriental Studies This case almost certainly goes back to the time that the airport concessions were given out when the main international airport in Bangkok was being built.Unravelling the complications of the contract and the concessions is likely to turn out to be a long, drawn out affair, as have been other such cases in Thailand.There have been many cases in recent years that concern Thai billionaires and millionaires, none of whom have ended up in prison.Who are King Power?Image copyright ADRIAN DENNIS/AFP/Getty Images Image caption Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha (right) and his son Aiyawatt joined in the 2015-16 Premier League title celebrations
How missing weather data is a 'life and death' issue:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption 'There's no weather station measuring what's going on' A shortage of weather data is putting many African countries at an economic disadvantage, experts believe.The BBC's Click team went to Tanzania to meet some tech start-ups trying to change the outlook.Tanzania is at the centre of a meteorological experiment that promises to transform lives across Africa.Tech start-up, Kukua, wants to introduce hundreds of low-cost weather stations in the country and beyond, to fill what has become a troubling data void.The World Bank is also backing a scheme being rolled out in Dar es Salaam and elsewhere to spread personal weather monitors.Without accurate weather data, people don't have evidence of what the weather is doing at ground level across the continent.And this, as former TV weather presenter Peter Gibbs explains (see video), can be a matter of "life and death".Climate change has brought more extreme weather conditions to many parts of the world and Africa is no exception.Farmers also face less predictable seasons."Climate change has made an impact over recent years.At first we lost harvests to droughts and recently to heavy unexpected rain," say smallholder farmers, Agnes Chekira and Asha Ahmadi.Image caption Click presenter Dan Simmons meets Tanzanian smallholders Agnes Chekira and Asha Ahmadi "If the rains come too early at the end of the longer rainy season our beans rot.But it's harder now to tell what will happen."A short drive away, also in the Lushoto district of northern Tanzania, we meet Peter, a runner bean grower.Earlier this year he lost his entire crop at the start of the shorter spring rainy season."Timing is everything.If you plant the seeds too early and heavy rains come in the first days, the seeds and dry top soil will be washed off the hillside and into the river channels at the bottom of the fields," he says.Knowing what the weather might do helps him work out when to add pesticides and fertilisers, he explains.Peter has been one of the first farmers in the region to sign up to a text alert scheme that tells him each day what the weather is expected to do in his area.Image caption Runner bean farmer Peter lost $100 worth of seeds in heavy rains Kukua provides the data from several of its new weather stations it has installed in the area.They are low-cost - about $2,500 (1,900)."Obviously the weather stations themselves don't give us a forecast directly but we are able to send the information they collect back to the forecasters in Europe and provide better, more reliable advice on the ground," says Micha van Winklehof, Kukua's chief executive.The World Meteorological Office estimates there are just over 1,100 active weather stations in the whole of Africa - a continent of 54 countries, many with starkly different climates.And the number of stations has halved over the last 30 years due to inadequate government funding, maintenance costs and limited resources.Dr Joseph Mukabana, in his recent report for the African Ministerial Conference on Meteorology, says this "poor and sparse" network needs to be expanded to at least 12,000 to provide basic weather services and help manage climate change.It has created "key gaps in our abilities to predict high-impact weather events", he says.This dearth of weather stations means that what meteorologists call "ground truthing" - verifying predictions made from satellite data with earth-based evidence - is very difficult.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption An automatic weather station for Africa One station has to cover an area of 27,000 sq km (10,425 sq miles) on average, meaning that what should be hard evidence is often just "best guess".Kukua wants to install thousands of weather stations across Africa.They are already in Nigeria, Kenya, Uganda, and Ghana, as well as Tanzania.The first went up in 2016 and the 100th will be in by the end of 2017, paid for by large agricultural companies who will also benefit from more accurate information about what's happening on the ground."On a large scale we have clients interested in climate change and how that's affecting the cocoa belt in West Africa," says Mr van Winklehof."Firms want to know where to base their operations, not just now but in the future."Weather data is also useful for renewable energy firms wanting to know where to place their wind farms, and for insurance companies needing to assess flood risk and verify claims.The US-based International Research Institute for Climate and Society believes that giving farmers access to reliable weather forecasts can help them increase yields by 20%, and sometimes by as much as 80%.More Technology of Business Image copyright Getty Images "That's the difference between eating to survive and sending your kids to school," says Mr van Winklehof.He hopes the data might also be useful for national health departments and non-governmental organisations looking to predict outbreaks of cholera and the spread of malaria - diseases closely linked to rainfall, humidity and temperature.Kukua plans to sell the data the weather stations collect to fund further installations, raising the question that risk low-income farmers could be priced out."The question is, will they openly and freely share the data with everyone at some stage," says David Lemayian, co-director and head of technology at Code for Africa, a not-for-profit organisation campaigning for free access to such information.He wants to see weather and air quality data made freely available across the continent so all sectors can benefit.Image caption Code for Africa's weather sensors can measure air quality Kukua insists it will share data, but is less clear about when and how.Code for Africa is collaborating with the World Bank to spread small, automated weather sensors across Tanzania, Kenya, and other African countries.By the end of 2017 it hopes to have 300 of the basic-looking units working in four countries."Climate change is severe and is happening here in Africa, and we're finding it's women and children who are hurt the most," says Mr Lemayian.The $35 sensors measure temperature, humidity, and the size of particles found in the air."We found the biggest amount of interest has come from mothers wanting to know about the air quality near their homes for the sake of their babies' health," says Mr Lemayian.There are several other projects aiming to fill the weather data void in Africa.But if commercial organisations keep the data to themselves, campaigners argue, local communities could suffer.
Can poo power solve India's toilet problem?:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The founders of Shri, Prabin Kumar, Anoop Jain and Chandan Kumar India is in the midst of a toilet-building frenzy, the government has set aside $20bn (15bn) for the health initiative and aims to stop people having to defecate in the open by 2019.One social enterprise in one of India's poorest areas is taking on the challenge of building public toilets.It is using the waste from the toilets to help pay for their upkeep.More than half a billion people in rural India do not use toilets.It's a situation which leads to a host of health and social problems, including children not going to school and women being assaulted or fearing assault when they go to secluded areas to relieve themselves.Image caption The first Shri facility in the village of Nemua in Bihar State in India Alongside official efforts social entrepreneurs, like the team behind Shri or Sanitation and Health Rights in India, are coming up with some inventive proposals.Upkeep payments When Prabin Kumar, one of the founders of Shri, was at school he would often be late because he had to walk more than a kilometre to get to the river to defecate.Today he's one of three social entrepreneurs building toilets in Bihar state in north east India that communities can use for free.Many of the state-run toilets have encountered problems when it comes to clearing the waste and paying for maintenance and upkeep.Instead of clearing the waste, Shri toilets channel it into a biodigester.Image caption A new biodigester being built in the village of Belle Messari in Bihar, India The biodigester then provides electricity which powers a pump for ground water.This is put through a filtration process at the facility and the filtered water is then bottled and sold for half a rupee (0.01) a litre.The money from the water pays for the maintenance and upkeep of the toilets.Shri currently sells 3,000 litres of filtered water a day.Community toilets Prabin Kumar and fellow founder Chandan Kumar met Canadian-born engineer Anoop Jain in 2010.Four years later they built their first community toilet in the village of Nemua in the Supaul district of Bihar state.The facility contained eight toilets for men and eight for women.The facilities open at four in the morning and close at ten at night.The team have so far built toilets in five villages, each of which they say is used around 800 times a day.Image caption Each Shri facility receives 800 visits a day They estimate that each facility has a start-up cost of around $30,000, but the sales of the filtered water mean that once built the facilities then pay for themselves."We choose villages where there is no government facility yet," Chandan Kumar explains.Before building starts they run an awareness campaign in the village.This is because the barriers to people changing their sanitation habits are often cultural - not just because the facilities have not been available.The BBC's Innovators series reveals innovative solutions to major challenges across South Asia.Ever heard of the concept of "jugaad"?It's a Hindi term meaning cheap innovation.If you have created a life hack or innovation that you are proud of, or spotted one while out and about on your travels, then share your picture with us by emailing yourpics@bbc.co.uk, use the hashtags #Jugaad and #BBCInnovators and share your picture with @BBCWorldService, or upload your submission here.Learn more about BBC Innovators.Enterprising visions "We really count on entrepreneurs to provide innovation," says Nicolas Osbert from Unicef, India."They have the thinking to create new ways of doing business, new ways of addressing sanitation both on the technical side but also on the promotional side."Image caption The founders of Shri believe that their facility design could be rolled out across India Yet Mr Osbert says that while ideas like the biodigester are interesting, he wonders if it could prevent the project expanding on a large scale.However, the Shri team have big ambitions."Our plan is to work closely with the government to scale our intervention," says Mr Jain."We would like to get funds from the government for construction of more facility centres."Our facilities will be managed and operated by communities, and Shri will ensure that they are being used and well maintained."His co-founder Chandan Kumar agrees: "We want to see ourselves in a position where our initiative helps our society to become 100% open defecation-free."
The man helping Americans access safe drinking water:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The water contamination scandal in Flint, Michigan sparked protests It was one of the worst water contamination scandals in recent US history.In 2015 children living in Flint, Michigan, began suffering from rashes and mysterious illnesses.Independent testing found dangerous levels of lead in homes and schools, caused by chemicals in the water supply that corroded the pipes.Officials declared an emergency and residents were told to stop using tap water.They were given free bottled water and filters, but Eric Roy, a chemist living in Washington DC, didn't think regular filters would be capable of dealing with such high levels of lead."They wouldn't solve the problem," the 35-year-old says."So I started building high capacity lead filters just as a charitable effort.I needed to do something."At the time he was working for a Boston company conducting chemical research for the US military, but he set up a GoFundMe page for donations, and began assembling his water filters with a friend in the front room of his apartment."It was very grassroots, very organic," says Mr Roy."We were buying stuff at retail, assembling it and shipping it to people's homes."Image copyright Hydroviv Image caption Eric Roy was determined to help people affected by water contamination Two years later he has turned his charitable effort #FiltersForFlint into a rapidly growing company called Hydroviv with 11 employees and ambitious plans for expansion."After Flint hit the news people started taking a closer look at their water and found that lead is a widespread problem in the US," he says.In the last couple of years alone there have been numerous contamination scares.In 2014 there were 18 cities in Pennsylvania where experts said childhood exposure to lead-contaminated water was worse than in Flint.And in 2015, in Jackson, Mississippi, one in five homes exceeded government limits for lead in water.Replacing pipes can cost millions of dollars which many cities can't afford.Even where that has happened, older homes may still have lead plumbing inside.Mr Roy assesses the type and level of contamination by analysing publicly available data.Image copyright Hydroviv Image caption The filters cost around $225 and contain replaceable cartridges "Once we identify the problem we create a filter that's optimised for that water," he says."So if you're in an area that has very high levels of Chromium-6 [a carcinogenic chemical compound], we'll make sure the filter has an extra capacity for Chromium-6."If you live in a brand new house where there's no lead, but you have high levels of arsenic, we'll make sure we favour the arsenic when we're designing and developing that filter."Filters cost around $225 (172), and replacement cartridges, which are needed every six months, cost $65."We can also test water if there is a discrepancy between municipal data and the Environmental Protection Agency, but we trust that the scientists for the most part are doing the right thing," says Mr Roy."But water quality regulations in the US are quite relaxed, and the public doesn't really understand them.We fill that gap with technology and information."Image copyright Hydroviv Image caption The firm has a small workforce Mr Roy has a PhD in chemistry from the University of Maine, and started his first business, a consulting company, while he was still studying."I'm a bit of an anomaly in that I have a PhD in science and I'm an entrepreneur," he says."Most scientists are not exposed to anything outside of academia while they're in grad school because their advisors have probably only worked in academia."There are universities and colleges right now trying to pierce that bubble - but a lot of those programmes aren't led by entrepreneurs.They're led by people who study entrepreneurs and that's a very different thing."But Roy says there are similarities between scientific research and running a business.Both entail a leap into the unknown, and can lead to discovery and learning.His first big lesson in business was learning how to delegate."I botched my first patent application," he says."Then I went to a patent attorney because intellectual property is a huge part of what we do, so you have to do that right.Image copyright Hydroviv Image caption The cartridges need replacing every six months "In the core part of the business you need to be working with people who actually know what they're talking about."From giving away a few hundred water filters to people in Flint, Hydroviv now makes thousands of units in a small warehouse in Washington DC, and is close to turning over a million dollars a year."As a business we're 100% sustaining and I'm most proud that we've never missed a payroll," Mr Roy says.Even so, he doesn't take a salary himself, and instead lives off savings and doing consulting work.This enables him to invest Hydroviv's profits into research and development.He remains the sole shareholder but is talking to potential investors."The math is pretty straight forward.On average, every customer that we have refers three people."They are also repeat customers because they need to replace the filter cartridges."I definitely think this will be an eight figure business in five years," says Mr Roy."If not, then we've done something wrong."
Dubai Airshow: Building a new supersonic airliner:::::Image copyright Alamy Image caption Boom's planned airliner will have 55 seats Like a lot of young boys Blake Scholl had an interest in things that flew and went very fast.One fascination was Concorde and supersonic flight.Now he's at the Dubai Airshow trying to woo investors and Middle East airlines to back his ambition to once again make breaking the sound barrier commercially viable.It's an idea that a few years ago might have been dismissed with a polite "good luck", but one which is now taking on serious shape.Mr Scholl, founder and chief executive of Denver-based Boom Supersonic, already has 76 pre-orders from airlines and says he is talking to another 20 carriers.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Boom is hoping to attract more interest at this year's Dubai Airshow The former Amazon executive and founder of mobile payments firm Kima Labs (sold to Groupon) is convinced that new technology, composite materials and quieter, more efficient engines, makes a return of supersonic flight possible.He says: "I remember thinking, in 2007 when the iPhone came out, that the world was getting faster and better.That wasn't so true with flying - flights today take as long as they did in the 1950s."When I started looking into this, nothing much was going on in the supersonic market.There was some sci-fi stuff.I thought it was probably impossible."But after researching the field, I started to think - it's possible, but difficult.If you have enough courage and you get the right people together you can do it, I thought."Image copyright Boom Image caption The new airliner is aimed at the luxury market, with tickets costing about $5,000 He won't say which Gulf airlines he is, or hopes, to talk to.But the likes of Emirates and Qatar Airways are obvious targets.Both carriers are continually pushing the luxury end of the market, spending tens of millions of dollars upgrading first class cabins and coming up with new innovations to lure wealthy travellers.Airlines are always looking to differentiate themselves, he says.So, adding supersonic aircraft to the fleet mix would make sense for many carriers."And geographically, the Middle East makes sense.It's ideally positioned as a connecting hub to the rest of the world."Mr Scholl's business plan estimates a market for 1,000 to 2,000 Boom aircraft over the next 10 years, with the first aircraft entering service in 2023.Image copyright Boom Image caption Boom's XB-1 demonstrator should fly next year The first test flight of a one-third-scale demonstrator is scheduled to take place in 2018.It will be a key step in the design and approval process - and help bring in more investment.Fresh funds will also be needed because Mr Scholl has announced that the search for an aircraft production site is underway.A decision on the location is expected in the first half of next year.Mr Scholl hints that a manufacturing site in the Gulf - where aerospace facilities and production are expanding rapidly on the back of airline growth - would not be ruled out.The theme of this week's Dubai Airshow is the Future of Travel, and as he points out: "It is home to some of the most forward-thinking visionaries in transportation."Also on Monday, Mr Scholl announced two new high profile appointments - Bill James, who led wing design on the Airbus A380 superjumbo jet, and Dr Lourdes Maurice, former director of environment and energy at the US Federal Aviation Authority.The former will be in charge of production and finance, while the later will help negotiate the regulatory minefield.They join a team that already includes people from Boeing, NASA, Lockheed Martin and rocket business SpaceX.Image copyright Boom Image caption Boom is now looking for a factory site for its planned supersonic airliners Mr Scholl says the economics of his business plan are comparable with subsonic business class costs - airlines should be able to make a profit charging around $5,000 (3,800) a ticket.The aircraft will have 55 seats (Concorde had 100) and travel about 4,500 miles.That would still mean a refuelling stop on very long-haul flights.But even then, the time saved could make it worthwhile for travellers, he argues."There are about 500 routes globally that are economically viable for supersonic."Key to the project, of course, is the engine."There's been tremendous progress.This aircraft will be quieter - or as quiet - as aircraft flying around Heathrow Airport today.Policymakers won't be allowing new aircraft that make more noise," says Mr Scholl.A decision to adapt existing engine technology, or produce something all-new, has still not been made.Talks and research continue, and he hopes to make an announcement early next year.What of the much-criticised sonic boom that gave Concorde a bad name - at least with those living under the flight path?Tm Robinson, of the Royal Aeronautical Society, believes Boom's supersonic ambitions are "definitely feasible".The technology has certainly improved since Concorde, he says: "The flipside is that environmental rules and noise regulations have got stiffer; it's going to be a challenge."The business case does not rest on overland flights, which is good.But on the other hand, not being able to fly [supersonically] overland was one of the things that did for Concorde."Image copyright Boom Image caption Boom says its new aircraft will be 'significantly quieter' than Concorde Mr Scholl says: "Sonic booms have been set up as a kind of bogeyman.There's a lot of mythology about them breaking windows.But it turns out that it's really hard to break a window with a sonic boom - you have to fly over at 100ft (30m)."The boom will be "significantly quieter" than Concorde, he promises.Boom aircraft will be smaller, reducing air disturbance.There are also things that can be done with the shape of an aircraft that will help, Mr Scholl says.Still, the hurdles are high.Supersonic flight is banned over the US, although Mr Scholl is confident this will soon change because laws set out by the Federal Aviation Administration are currently up for renegotiation.The project has a long way to go.But at least Mr Scholl seems to have confirmed his initial thoughts - building a supersonic aircraft for a new age will be difficult, but it certainly looks possible.
How Joe Mimran's passion for fashion was sparked by a checked suit:::::Image copyright CBC Soft-spoken, gentle, with a broad smile, and generous with his time and advice; they're not the typical attributes of a dragon.But when Joe Mimran appears on Canada's version of the popular television show, Dragons' Den, showcasing budding entrepreneurs, he's not the kind to breathe fire at you, withering your dreams.Perhaps it's because that when you come along, full of hope, to present your beloved idea he remembers how that feels.The 65-year-old Moroccan-born Jewish immigrant has spent his life working in fashion, and is best known as the driving force behind big labels such as Joe Fresh and Club Monaco.But he has had his own ups and downs along the way.He still believes he is "no smarter" than his peers, but he did have a passion for his work from an early age."I always loved design and I always wanted to be an entrepreneur," he says.Aged 12, he already had a houndstooth suit his mother had made for him, because he wanted to dress like Sean Connery.And although his father had a grocery business, it was his mother's couturier business, making suits and dresses, that caught his imagination.More The Boss features, which every week profile a different business leader from around the world: He helped her run the company from the family home and after she opened a small factory in Toronto's garment district, she asked Joe to take over the company's operations."I always wanted to get into business and it was a fantastic learning experience," he recalls.The family firm focused on selling tailored garments for women.But Joe and his brother Saul wanted to go further.They hired the designer Alfred Sung to design them an off-the-peg line of clothing, to be sold on the High Street, something the company had never tried before."It turned out to be a hit with consumers and showed me that a business gamble could pay off," Mr Mimran says.Then one day in the mid-1980s, he was shopping, searching for a plain white T-shirt.When he couldn't find one he liked, he made up his mind to create a whole new brand of affordable-yet-high-quality clothing.Image copyright ?Image caption Club Monaco was launched in 1985 in Toronto Unfortunately, Club Monaco got off to a rocky start.Two of Canada's biggest department store chains at the time, The Bay and Eaton's, decided not to carry it, cutting off a major route to market.The Mimrans were stuck; they had already produced the merchandise, but had nowhere to sell it."We realised that we had all these goods coming in and the only way we could move forward was to open our own stores," he explains.At that time, he says, such a move was highly unusual; retail stores typically bought their wares from wholesalers.However, he recalled how the last gamble he had taken - hiring Alfred Sung - had paid off, and took the plunge.The bet went his way.There were queues "around the block" on the day their first store opened in Toronto, says Mr Mimran."Sometimes you just have to dive in," he says.Even if others are counselling against it.One of his salesmen once warned him against building a sportswear factory, arguing he lacked experience in that market segment.He ignored the advice."We fired him, and we did it anyway," he says."A lot of business people, having had lots of problems in the past, will try to dissuade somebody else," he explains."But your idea might be done in a new way, might resonate in a way that this very experienced person didn't, couldn't, anticipate."It worked for Club Monaco.The brand spread to New York and other global capitals before it was bought up by fashion giant Polo Ralph Lauren in 1999 for $52.5m (40m).Since then he has continued to launch new brands, including the mass market brand, Joe Fresh, for supermarket chain Loblaw, which operates in Canada and the US.Its products are a long way from the bespoke tailoring he saw his mother create for the smartly dressed Toronto set all those years ago.However the brand has faced challenges.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption He launched his flagship Joe Fresh store in New York in 2012 but it closed in 2015 Fast fashion, online retailing, the changes in fortune of some of the big department stores, where designers like him could once rely on showcasing their wares, all of this is making it harder for a traditional fashion brand.Tanmay Manohar, a mens' style consultant and social influencer in New York says the game has changed for fashion magnates like Mr Mimran.In the past "there was something of a template to where you need to be to sell your goods," he says."However, today, you get your message out... with social media and YouTube.It's a one-click world."You need faster reactions in a world of apps and instant gratification, he says.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The actress Noureen DeWulf helped launch the Joe Fresh brand at JC Penney in Beverly Hills in 2013 These market forces have buffeted Mr Mimran's latest ventures.A resale agreement with US department store giant JC Penney was terminated in 2015 and the firm's flagship New York store was closed.So even now, he's been reminded that success is never guaranteed in the competitive world of fashion.Because of this, he says, he can empathise when meeting entrepreneurs who are struggling."I'm not smarter than everyone else out there because you're only as good as your last season," he says."And, no matter... what you know, you can still fail in our business.It keeps you pretty grounded."This humble approach - as opposed to dragon-like ferocity - is the key to Joe Mimran's success, according to fashion designer Joseph Tassoni, who at 18 was the junior menswear designer at Joseph Mimran & Associates."From the sweeper to upper management, Joe greets and literally says hello to all at the start of every work day," he says."He listens to ideas, encourages creativity and talent and pushes you to achieve and possibly exceed your vision and goal."
Do welfare states boost economic growth, or stunt it?:::::Image copyright Getty Images Women in politics are sometimes accused of consciously exploiting their femininity to get ahead in a male-dominated world.Frances Perkins did that, but in an unusual way: she tried to remind men of their mothers.She dressed in a plain, three-cornered hat, and she refined the way she acted, based on careful observation of what seemed to be most effective in persuading men to accept her ideas.Perhaps it's no coincidence that those ideas could reasonably be described as maternal or parental.Any parent wants to shield their children from serious harm, and Perkins believed governments should do the same for their citizens.She became President Franklin D Roosevelt's Secretary of Labour in 1933.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Frances Perkins pictured with the rest of Franklin D Roosevelt's cabinet in March 1933 The Great Depression was ravaging America.A third of workers were unemployed.Those with jobs saw wages plunge.Perkins drove through the changes that became known as the New Deal, including a minimum wage, benefits for the unemployed and pensions for the elderly.Historians will tell you it wasn't Frances Perkins who invented the welfare state.It was Otto von Bismarck, chancellor of the German Empire, half a century earlier.Ultimate responsibility But it was largely during Frances Perkins's era that various welfare states took their recognisably modern shape across the developed world.Details differ, from place to place, measure to measure, and time to time.But the same basic idea links every welfare state: that the ultimate responsibility for ensuring people don't starve on the street should lie not with family, or charity, or private insurers, but with government.50 Things That Made the Modern Economy highlights the inventions, ideas and innovations that helped create the economic world.It is broadcast on the BBC World Service.You can find more information about the programme's sources and listen online or subscribe to the programme podcast.This idea is not without its enemies.It is possible, after all, to mother too much.Every parent instinctively knows there's a balance: protect, but don't mollycoddle; nurture resilience, not dependence.And if overprotective parenting stunts personal growth, might too-generous welfare states stunt economic growth?Welfare trap?It's a plausible worry.Imagine a single parent with two children.He or she might qualify for various payouts: housing benefit, child benefit, unemployment benefit.Could he or she accumulate more from the welfare system than they could get by working at the minimum wage?In 2013, according to research by the Cato Institute, in no fewer than nine European countries, the answer to that question was "Yes".In three of them - Austria, Croatia and Denmark - the marginal tax rate was nearly 100%.That means, if the single parent took a part-time job to earn some extra cash, he or she would immediately lose it in reduced benefits.Such a "welfare trap" hardly seems sensible.But it's also plausible to think that welfare states can improve economic productivity.If you lose your job, unemployment benefit means you don't have to rush into another one: it gives you time to find a new position that makes best use of your skills.Image copyright Getty Images Entrepreneurs might take more risks when they know that a bankruptcy won't be catastrophic: they could still send their children to school, and get treatment when they're sick.So, do welfare states boost economic growth, or stunt it?It's not an easy question to answer - the systems have many moving parts, and each part could affect growth in many ways.Demographic change But the weight of evidence suggests that it's a wash - the positive and negative effects balance out.Welfare states don't make the pie bigger or smaller.But they do change the size of each individual slice.And that helps to keep a lid on inequality.At least, it used to.In the past two decades, the data shows welfare states haven't been doing that so well.And that's not surprising - they're creaking under the weight of a rapidly changing world.There's demographic change: people are living for longer after retirement.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Many countries have seen a large rise in working mothers in recent decades There's social change: entitlements often date from an age when most women relied on male breadwinners, and most jobs were full-time and long-lasting.In the UK, for example, most jobs created since the 2008 financial crisis are the result of people employing themselves.Yet a builder who's employed will get "statutory sick pay" if there's an accident at work, a self-employed builder will not.And there's globalisation: welfare states originated when employers were more geographically rooted than today's footloose multinationals.Unlike today, they couldn't easily relocate to jurisdictions with less burdensome regulations and taxes.Mobility of labour creates headaches, too - the thought of immigrants claiming benefits may have helped set Britain on the path to Brexit.As we ponder how - or even whether - to fix the welfare state, we shouldn't forget that one of the biggest ways welfare states shaped the modern economy was to take the heat out of demands for much more radical change.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Bismarck's welfare state reforms in the 1880s were designed to stop voters backing the rival socialist party Otto von Bismarck was no social reformer in the Frances Perkins mould.His motives were defensive.He feared that the public would turn to the revolutionary ideas of socialists Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels.In America, the New Deal was attacked from the left and right.Image copyright Alamy Image caption Some business organisations opposed Roosevelt's New Deal reforms as "un-American" The populist Louisiana governor Huey Long complained that Frances Perkins hadn't gone far enough.The next industrial revolution?He prepared to run for president on the slogan "Share our wealth" and a promise to confiscate fortunes from the rich.But he was shot dead in 1935, so that policy was never tested.Such political tumult feels long past, but perhaps that's complacent.Some say we're experiencing another industrial revolution now, as the robots come for our jobs.More from Tim Harford: Why the falling cost of light matters What makes gambling wrong but insurance right?What the rise of the robots means for us all How much of the world's wealth is hidden offshore?Inequality, which in many countries widened sharply during the 1980s and 1990s, may widen further.In the past, new and better jobs have come along to replace those that were lost, but perhaps artificial intelligence will be able to do those new jobs better, too.Universal basic income?If in the future human labour is less needed, keeping societies stitched together may require us to reinvent the welfare state.Not all economists think that's worth worrying about just yet.But those who do are reviving an idea that dates back to Thomas More and his 1516 book, Utopia - a universal basic income.It does seem utopian, in the sense of fantastically unrealistic.Could we really imagine a world in which everyone gets a regular cash handout, enough to meet their basic needs, no questions asked?Some evidence suggests it's worth considering.In the 1970s, the idea was trialled in a Canadian town called Dauphin.Image copyright Dauphin Tourism Image caption Results of the 1970s "mincome" experiment in Dauphin were surprising For years, thousands of residents received cheques every month.And it turns out that guaranteeing people an income had interesting effects.Fewer teenagers dropped out of school.Fewer people were admitted to hospital with mental health problems.Hardly anyone gave up work.New trials are under way, to see if the same thing happens elsewhere.It would, of course, be enormously expensive.Suppose you gave every American adult, say $12,000 (9,000) a year.That would cost 70% of the entire federal budget.It seems impossibly radical.But then, impossibly radical things do sometimes happen, and quickly.In the 1920s, not a single US state offered old-age pensions.By 1935, Frances Perkins had rolled them out across the nation.Tim Harford writes the Financial Times's Undercover Economist column.50 Things That Made the Modern Economy is broadcast on the BBC World Service.You can find more information about the programme's sources and listen online or subscribe to the programme podcast.
Dubai Airshow: Storm clouds over the 'Middle East three':::::Image copyright AFP Image caption Dubai's last airshow was in 2015 They have been aviation's 21st century success story.For years, Emirates, Etihad Airways and Qatar Airways - the "Middle East three" or ME3 - looked unstoppable.The airlines became a benchmark for service and quality, while their global reach earned them a nickname: the "super-connectors".However, the headwinds are strengthening.The Dubai Airshow, which starts on Sunday, promises to be a bigger and better showcase for all things aviation, space and defence than the last gathering in 2015.But for the region's biggest three airlines, the economic, political and competitive backdrop is very different to two years ago.Falling oil prices have hit revenues and trade in the region.Security worries about terrorism, particularly in the US, have led to cuts in airline routes.There has also been a long-running diplomatic and trade impasse between Saudi Arabia and its allies on the one hand, and Qatar on the other.And years of rapid growth has led to concerns about over-capacity, which comes just as competition from lower-cost carriers - both long and short-haul - has intensified.'Under pressure' The impact on profits for airlines in the region was underlined in a report by the International Air Transport Association (IATA), the industry trade group.It expects Middle East carriers to post a collective $400m profit this year, down from $1.1bn in 2016.For the first six months of 2017, trading conditions "sharply declined" and "some business models have come under pressure", IATA says."The region is struggling with increased infrastructure taxes/charges and air traffic congestion," it adds.To make matters worse, the once-surging cargo operations have also taken a hit.Image copyright Reuters Image caption Emirates' chairman Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum takes delivery of the airline's 100th Airbus A380.Emirates' woes underline the problems.In May, the region's biggest operator posted its first full-year profit decline for five years.Profits plunged 82% to Dh1.3bn ($340m) after what the airline's president Sir Tim Clark said was one of the carrier's "most challenging years to date".Emirates reported far better news on Thursday when it said half-year net profits more than doubled to Dh1.7bn.It was a result of cuts in capacity and dollar exchange rate benefits.But trading remains tough.IATA says that in September Middle East operators saw their slowest rate of monthly international growth for eight years, with demand up just 3.7%.Its senior economist David Oxley says services from the Middle East to America are clearly suffering despite the lifting of the cabin ban on large portable devices.The Middle East-US "is the only international market not to have grown in annual terms over the first eight months of the year," he says.Image copyright AFP Image caption Etihad posted a $1.9bn loss last year The situation at Abu Dhabi-based Etihad is even worse.Says analyst Seth Kaplan, managing partner of US-based Aviation Weekly: "Emirates is struggling relative to its own history, but it is keeping its head above water.But Etihad is clearly in a lot of trouble."Etihad posted a $1.9bn loss last year, which included an $800m write-down on the value of its investments in other airlines.The airline has spent hundreds of millions of dollars buying stakes in other airlines, including Virgin Australia, Air Serbia and Jet Airways.One of the rationales was to help feed more traffic through Abu Dhabi's hub.But the strategy is under review, a move that landed on Europe's doorstep this summer: Alitalia and Air Berlin filed for bankruptcy after Etihad decided not to invest further in the struggling airlines.Cooperation Lower-cost operators such as India's Indigo, Singapore-based Scoot, and the fast-growing Norwegian Air are chipping away at their bigger rivals.Norwegian was recently offering Amsterdam-Dubai prices at more than half the price of Emirates.The Gulf carriers helped bring back a certain luxury to air travel.But some of the fastest growth is now among airlines in the low-cost long haul market.Image copyright AFP Image caption The Gulf has a fast-growing low cost airline market This month, Emirates deepened its alliance with Flydubai that was first announced in July.There will be some co-ordination of schedules, marketing and reciprocal frequent flyer benefits.But a bigger deal may be on the cards.Last month, Emirates' Mr Clark said he was open to cooperation with Etihad.A merger, or alliance, would cut capacity and costs significantly, given their proximity.But it would be fraught with political hurdles, not just commercial ones, Mr Kaplan says.Even a limited agreement on, say, joint purchasing or maintenance would be complicated, as both sides tried to negotiate common standards, work-share, and protection for their huge airport bases.A lot depends on future oil prices and the revenues generated for governments, says Mr Kaplan."The more prices rise, the less chance of a deal."On "co-operation" with Emirates, Etihad said only that it would consider all opportunities that might make commercial sense.Dubai Airshow The trade-only show has been a regular feature since 1989, when 20 aircraft and 200 exhibitors took part This week's event is expected to attract 72,000 trade visitors, 1,200 exhibitors, 160-plus aircraft and 1,350 media representatives The 2013 event saw the biggest tally of commercial aircraft orders of any airshow - $206bn Russia and China, keen to assert their influence in Middle East will have a big presence, with both displaying fighter jets The space sector will feature prominently during the week, as the United Arab Emirates has a mission-to-Mars programme Of the three major Gulf carries, Qatar Airways had been holding up relatively well.Net profits for the latest financial year rose 22% to 1.97bn (400m) Qatari riyals.The airline has also made more astute investments than Etihad, raising its stake in British Airways-owner IAG to 20% and buying 10% of South America's Latam Airlines.But that was before the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Bahrain imposed an embargo on the state of Qatar in June, accusing it of sponsoring terrorism, which it vehemently denies.The blockade has piled on huge extra costs on the national airline, not least because of the need to re-route flights.In September, Doha was forced to inject $38bn into the economy to cushion the blockade's impact.Image copyright AFP Image caption Qatar Airway's chief executive Akbar al-Baker The ME3's problems mount just as some of their fiercest rivals, the US carriers, see signs of revival.US airlines have long complained that the ME3's success has been bolstered by state subsidies that violate the Open Skies agreement that gave Gulf carriers access to America.They argue that the ME3 has collectively received $42bn in subsidies since 2004.A trade row had seemed unlikely - until Donald Trump was elected president, that is.It now resonates more with his "America First" world view.The ME3 deny receiving unfair aid.Besides, they point out, it was US Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection that helped big US carriers restructure after years of losses.It's possible that life for the ME3 will get worse before it gets better.But in long run they will retain significant advantages.With two-thirds of the world about an eight-hour flight from the Gulf, it will remain a fuel-efficient, time-efficient place from which to fly.And the region's desire to build a tourist industry and diversify from oil-dependence will continue to underpin domestic carriers.Add to that, a lack of disruptive unions and lobby groups complaining about noisy flights, and the Gulf remains a pretty advantageous place to base an airline.
Why have governments struggled to tackle offshore money?:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption How can countries clamp down on tax avoidance?If we needed reminding, the Paradise Papers have shown how attractive it can be to keep money offshore.Wealthy individuals do it, companies do it.So can governments do anything about it?Can they get big firms and the rich to pay what many regard as their fair share of tax?In some cases the appeal of going offshore is to hide illegal behaviour from the gaze of law enforcement authorities.But much of what has been revealed in this massive leak of documents is lawful.In many cases it's about avoiding tax, which is legal, though it involves gaining a tax advantage in a way that the legislation did not intend.What are governments doing about it?Much of the effort needs international co-operation to be effective, and the forum where it's taking place is the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), an international agency whose members are mainly the rich countries.An important part of this initiative involves the exchange of information between tax authorities.The OECD initiative has two systems.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The Cayman Islands are a popular offshore financial centre Under one a tax authority gives information about an individual's finances if the person's home tax authority asks.The drawback is they need to know who to ask about.There is also a system, which is more recent and has fewer countries involved so far, of automatic exchange of information.That might catch more cases, but it can also create a huge volume of information that tax authorities might struggle to assess.Countries can also check schemes that wealthy people use more thoroughly to assess whether they conform with the law.There have also been initiatives on the roles of tax advisers.The UK, for example, has legislation that means advisers can end up paying hefty financial penalties if they recommend schemes that are subsequently ruled against.There is another initiative in the OECD, designed to address some types of tax avoidance that are used by multinational corporations.How do multinationals limit their tax?One technique for minimising tax bills has a very long history and goes by the name of transfer pricing.Different subsidiaries of multinational companies located in different countries buy and sell things to one another.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Starbucks agreed to pay more tax in the UK It may be components, raw materials or sometimes intangible things such as the right to use a trademark, a patent or copyright - known as intellectual property.The choice of what price to charge affects the amount of profit each subsidiary makes, and companies can set these prices with a view to ensuring that the profits appear to be made in the country with the most favourable tax regime.Another technique is for the subsidiary in the low-tax country to lend money to one facing higher business taxes, which can use the interest payments to reduce its tax liability.The OECD's latest plans The OECD has produced a package of proposals and is monitoring the implementation by its members.It's quite a technical initiative, but there are some broad principles involved.One is the idea that tax should reflect where economic activity really takes place.Another is the idea of arm's length transactions.That is the notion that transactions between a multinational's subsidiaries should be at prices that would be charged if they were entirely separate businesses.Many campaigners and experts say that the work being done in the OECD is useful but doesn't answer all the problems.The Tax Justice Network described the OECD's work on corporate tax as a huge step forward.But it also said: "The process has been continually undermined by the army of paid corporate tax advisers and lobbyists, as well as governments seeking to protect some of their pet tax breaks to business."The view of a tax expert Professor Rita de la Feria, a tax expert at Leeds University, says that much of the action taken so far is a temporary fix until firms find new ways to get around the rules.There are options, she argues, that could reduce the scope for avoidance.One would be that countries could tax a multinational's profits on the basis of the proportion of its sales in each state.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Google's tax affairs in Ireland have been criticised It would work better if all countries agreed that approach, she argues, but small groups or even individual states could do it.What we have now though, says Prof de la Feria, is more modest reforms undertaken by countries - with help from the OECD framework - and some incentives on companies, such as "naming and shaming and fear of a reputational impact".In one famous case that led to the coffee shop business Starbucks agreeing to pay more corporation tax in the UK.The Paradise Papers are potentially another example.Prof de la Feria says: "Until we have a global tax reform this is probably the most effective way of making individuals and corporations behave slightly differently."In Europe some companies have been ordered to pay taxes following investigations by the European Commission, and Apple was on the receiving end of this type of action over its tax affairs in the Republic of Ireland.These were investigations into what's called state aid, where the company concerned was found to have had a competitive advantage as a result of its tax arrangements with the EU country concerned.The EU Commissioner for Competition Margrethe Vestager put it like this: "The large majority of businesses, which pay their fair share of tax, shouldn't have to compete with rivals that get special favours from government."Still it's easy to believe that it was not just about tax, that she was also motivated by a more general desire to see large firms pay their share.Find out more about the words and phrases found in the Paradise Papers.Your browser does not support this Lookup Your guide to financial jargon Enter your search term The papers are a huge batch of leaked documents mostly from offshore law firm Appleby, along with corporate registries in 19 tax jurisdictions, which reveal the financial dealings of politicians, celebrities, corporate giants and business leaders.The 13.4 million records were passed to German newspaper Sddeutsche Zeitung and then shared with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ).Panorama has led research for the BBC as part of a global investigation involving nearly 100 other media organisations, including the Guardian, in 67 countries.The BBC does not know the identity of the source.Paradise Papers: Full coverage; follow reaction on Twitter using #ParadisePapers; in the BBC News app, follow the tag "Paradise Papers" Watch Panorama on the BBC iPlayer (UK viewers only)
'I've sat in a changing room in my underwear for ages':::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Would having your own personal stylist on demand help you decide what to wear?Dressing angst.We've all had it.Does this outfit make me look fat?Is it inappropriate for work?Is it something someone half may age would wear?Should I just give up and stay in bed forever?It's then we need help and advice from people we trust."I've sat in a changing room in my underwear for ages waiting for my friends to get back to me," says Sophia Matveeva, founder of fashion advice app, Style Counsel."I wanted their advice on the outfit I was thinking of buying.And my friends on WhatsApp were always asking me what they should wear, but we'd often be in different time zones and the answers would come too late."Fashion dilemmas like this gave her the idea for an app to help women crowdsource advice from stylists and sister fashionistas in a safe, troll-free environment."Young women have always cared about what others think about their look, but social media has amplified this", says Ms Matveeva."Your image can reach far more people than ever before - it's like being a celebrity, and this has made us a lot more worried."Image copyright Style Counsel Image caption Style Counsel founder Sophia Matveeva believes fashion is a social activity Style Counsel users wanting advice on an outfit can post a photo and receive "yes" or "no" answers from other users, or more detailed advice from vetted fashion stylists and bloggers "within minutes", she says.So far around 7,000 people have downloaded the app, and more than 90 stylists are on hand to dispense advice.Photos are being uploaded from North America and Australia, as well as the UK, she says.Fashion advice is a growing business, with dozens of apps, such as AskAnna, Mallzee and StyleDotMe, springing up, primarily targeting young women.Image-focused social media platforms such as Instagram and Pinterest have been a key place for fashion enthusiasts to share ideas and opinions for some years.And all this data about people's like and dislikes is gold dust for retailers."The most expensive piece of research retailers pay for is to find out why something didn't sell.Our platform tells them why - that's valuable feedback," says Ms Matveeva.This endless appetite for customer data undoubtedly prompted retail giant Amazon to launch its Echo Look camera.The $200 (150) voice-controlled device - powered by Alexa - can take full-length photos and videos of your outfit and send them to the accompanying smartphone app.Image copyright Amazon Image caption Amazon's Echo Look camera and app will give advice on which outfit suits you best A "style check" function then compares photos and gives its algorithmically-derived opinion of which outfit is better, based on fit, colour, style and current fashion trends.Amazon says its own panel of fashion experts has helped develop this function.But will this rather impersonal form of advice really appeal to social, sharing-obsessed twentysomethings?"Women, more than men, are social creatures - AI will never stop us talking to each other," says Ms Matveeva."We need human-first technology.Girls will always want the approval of the cool girl at school, and on Instagram there are millions of cool girls."Most young people like to search for and buy clothes online via their mobiles these days - no queues, less stress.But getting the right fit is difficult and leads to hundreds of billions of dollars worth of items being returned each year, at great cost to retailers.Image copyright Adriana Tripa Image caption Isabelle Ohnemus says social media helps online shopping to be a social experience "Every brand has its own sizing parameters - there are no international standards," explains Isabelle Ohnemus, chief executive of EyeFitU, a fashion website that finds clothes to fit your figure."This is why returns are so high."We can set up your size profile in a few seconds with 80% accuracy just knowing your gender, height, weight and age," she says.EyeFitU has about 60 retailers on its site - "mostly big international brands", says Ms Ohnemus - and using all the data it has collected, translates these differing national and brand sizings to suit your actual shape.Tech company Metail is also trying to solve the size issue by enabling shoppers to create digital 3D versions of themselves that they can they dress up virtually on retailers' websites.More Technology of Business Image copyright Getty Images "You can create your own body model giving your main measurements - height, weight, bust size, inside leg, neck size, hips and waist," explains Metail chief executive Tom Adeyoola."We can reach 92-96% accuracy just on those measurements."You can then go on to a Metail-friendly fashion website and see what your digital avatar looks like wearing any of the clothes you select.The images are altered by computer to fit your figure.To get to this stage Metail has to have photographed the retailer's range of clothes as worn by a manikin standing on a revolving turntable.The special photo rig can "shoot 200 garments a day", says Mr Adeyoola.When you think that an online fashion retailer like Japan's ZozoTown can have 500,000 items in its range, that's a lot of photos to take.Mr Adeyoola hopes that his firm's technology will help make buying clothes online "a much more interactive and engaging experience" -

another reason why returns are such a big issue.This is why Amazon has launched its Prime Wardrobe "try before you buy" service.Prime subscribers can order online but have seven days before deciding which clothes to keep and which to return in the prepaid box.All without paying a penny up front.Global fashion retailer Asos, which has 15.4 million active customers worldwide, recently followed suit in the UK with its own "try before you buy" option."The challenge of not being able to try on items before buying them is an an e-commerce perennial," says Dan Winter, Asos director of corporate communications."So it made sense to explore a try before you buy service here in the UK.With this option, customers don't have to worry about waiting for refunds because they will only be paying for what they choose to keep."But when it comes to making those choices, we get by with a little help from our friends.
What ingredients make the world's greatest cocktail bar?:::::Image copyright Rob Lawson Image caption Erik Lorincz is head bartender at the American Bar in London New York likes to think of itself as the home of the cocktail.But these days, London's scene is giving the Big Apple a run for its money.So when it comes to picking the world's greatest cocktail bar, which city wins?Elizabeth Hotson went to find out.From the Gin Rickey and Mint Julep swilling characters in The Great Gatsby, to the Mad Men who can't get enough Manhattans and Whiskey Sours, in the past it's New York that has tended to put the fizz into fancy mixed drinks.But these days, for true flaunt-it decadence, London's hotel bars are hard to beat.Take, for example, The Connaught Bar.At 5pm on a Saturday we're ushered to the last available table, surrounded by Art Deco opulence, all wood panelling, polished chrome, glass and leather.A waitress provides a bowl of fat, bright green olives.Their signature cocktail, the Vieux Connaught, arrives on a mirrored tray and involves a long list of ingredients: rum, rye whiskey, dry vermouth, Benedictine, Angostura bitters, orange bitters.It's not cheap at 20 ($26), but it comes in fitting style - garnished with orange peel in the shape of a lightning bolt and topped off with saffron-infused smoke.Image copyright Niklas Halle'n Image caption Smoke and mirrors - all part of the experience The Connaught represents the glossy, upmarket end of London's cocktail scene.It's about the experience as much as the contents of your glass.If you order a Martini, the Martini trolley is wheeled over, and the gin and vermouth are mixed to your precise specifications.007 would approve.Ten years ago, New York arguably led the cocktail scene; new bars were cropping up offering freshly squeezed juices and craft spirits, often in simpler, less plush surroundings.Now, inspiration has rippled around the globe and most capital cities boast plenty of places where the barman knows his Woo Woo from his Sex On The Beach.So this year, competition for a place on The World's 50 Best Bars (compiled by publishers William Reed) is stiff."A great cocktail isn't just about the liquid in the glass," says Sandrae Lawrence, one of the competition judges and editor of The Cocktail Lovers magazine."It's an overall experience that you're looking for."Great bars come in all shapes and sizes, from neighbourhood bars, to dive bars and five star hotels," she says."You've got to look at hospitality, the team work, how that bar makes you feel."Image copyright Rob Lawson Image caption Cocktails are now sold at 37,000 outlets across the UK, according to CGA And when it comes to the drink, as well as the chemistry and the artistry of presentation, there's also geography - where the ingredients come from; the story behind them is becoming ever more important, she says.According to industry figures, Britons are drinking more cocktails.CGA, which collates data on the food and drink industry, says the market reached 500m last year and is growing at 10% per annum.We're also becoming more adventurous according to CGA's chief executive Phil Tate, and eager for that "added element of theatre" on a night out, particularly in the age of Instagram.Image copyright JCMT agency Image caption Cocktails add an "added element of theatre" on a night out But "theatre" isn't always about sumptuous surroundings.An anonymous door off Old Street roundabout in east London, is the threshold of a more bohemian cocktail scene.Like the rough and ready speakeasies of 1920s America, which offered illicit drinking in an era of prohibition, the tiny basement bar, Nightjar, has bare wooden floors and exposed bricks, subdued lighting and live music.A Little Devil waits for me on the counter.Image copyright Addie Chinn Image caption Edmund Weil co-owns the Nightjar Although the venue is more basic, the drink is far from understated: served in pewter goblet with a serpent winding its way to the top, it's a concoction of rum, the Italian herbal liqueur Amaro, the Chinese herb schisandra, and devil's claw root, commonly used as a herbal remedy.The cocktail world can sometimes seem a little swept away by its own mythology, bartenders who "build" or "create" drinks rather than mixing them, infusions and dashes of ever more exotic ingredients.Might they be accused of going a bit overboard, I wonder, experimenting for the sake of it, rather than for the taste?Edmund Weil, the co-owner of NightJar says not."We really do go to a lot of effort to source interesting ingredients, but you do have to produce drinks with real substance which hang together perfectly," he says.Image copyright Rob Lawson Image caption The American Bar's Black Diamond with salted Lapsang Souchong syrup With the growing fashion for cocktails, the lower priced end of the market is booming, too.The chain Be At One now has over 30 bars all over the country, offering cocktails for 7.50 to 11.Be At One sold two million cocktails in 2016, up fourfold over the last five years.Its most popular is the Pornstar Martini - made with vodka, passion fruit liqueur and prosecco - representing 15% of all its cocktail sales.But the winner of the world's best bar, voted on by over 500 experts, bartenders and waiters, was only ever going to be one of those at the top end of the market.More stories from the BBC's Business Brain series looking at interesting business topics from around the world: So who won?In the end, the American Bar at the Savoy Hotel in London takes first place, its name a nod to a spirit of transatlantic conciliation.But the number two spot was taken by another London bar, Dandelyan.New York's Nomad comes in at number three.After celebrating wildly with his team on stage, Erik Lorincz, the American Bar's head bartender, reflects on the result."We look into every aspect of what we do," he tells me."It's not just the drinks themselves, it's how we serve them and how we greet the guests and look after them."He says he will be toasting the win with a few of his bar's house cocktails."I'll probably start with a Diamond Jubilee Fizz.That's Bombay Sapphire gin, grapefruit and orange oleo saccharum - a sugared oil - Earl Grey tea, lemon juice, almond syrup and champagne."The World's best bars 1.The American Bar, The Savoy, London 2.Dandelyan, London 3.The Nomad, New York 4.Connaught Bar, London 5.The Dead Rabbit, New York 6.The Clumsies, Athens, Greece 7.Manhattan, Singapore 8.Attaboy, New York 9.Bar Termini, London 10.Speak Low, Shanghai Source: William Reed
Have you got what it takes to be a secret shopper?:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The firm transforming market research Meet 29-year-old Hakan Sevgin.He is helping to improve consumer products and shops around the world.A Turkish man who lives in Istanbul, Hakan doesn't work for any retail firm.Instead he is a stage lighting manager in a theatre.Yet he is continuing to help retail companies around the world improve the products they sell, and the shops in which we buy them.So what does Hakan do?In his spare time he is a secret shopper and product tester for a Turkish market research company called Twentify.Twentify has just 27 permanent employees, and has only been going for three years, but its global clients now include Coca-Cola, Danone, KFC, Philips, L'Oreal, Samsung, and Unilever.Image caption Hakan Sevgin earns money doing regular jobs via Twentify's Bounty app, such as photographing storefronts The firm is one of a new breed of market research companies that are transforming a global industry worth $44.3bn (33.4bn) in 2015.Instead of needing an army of employees to conduct interviews or tests, Twentify uses a crowdsourcing model to connect directly with tens of thousands of members of the public via its app, which is called Bounty.So anyone with a smartphone in the countries where Twentify operates can use the Bounty app to do some research for it, and get paid in return.For example, if a chocolate-maker in the US wants to make sure that its bars are being correctly positioned in the stores of a certain retailer, it can ask Twentify to get a mass of Bounty users to find out.Each would then be asked to go to a store, and surreptitiously take a photo, and the geo-locator function on their phone would confirm that they did indeed go to the right place.They simply upload the photo via the app, and get paid $15 for their troubles.Bounty users can be tasked with reviewing whether staff are sufficiently friendly and professional, for instance, or if the store is clean enough.Meanwhile, they can also get paid for testing products or carrying out surveys from their own home.A growing number of apps have very similar business models, such as Findyr, Eyes On, Gigwalk, and Field Agent.Image caption Twentify and its rivals are using apps to transform the market research industry Hakan started using Bounty in 2015, and says he has now made a total of $735.He admits to being very nervous the first time he was a secret shopper."My first attempt, I was excited and I was shy," he says."I was thinking it would seem like it would be difficult to do the task.In fact we are doing these things in our daily lives [testing products and stores].I realised that later on, which made it easier."Twentify is the brainchild of 27-year-old Turkish entrepreneur and the firm's chief executive, Ilker Inanc.Previously a software developer for an Instanbul marketing agency, he quit because he wanted to start his own company.The idea for Twentify was born when Ilker realised that carrying out market research via an app could get results more quickly and cheaply than carrying out more traditional surveys which need a team of staff going out with clipboards, or doing phone interviews.Image caption Ilker Inanc admits that running a business has its stressful moments To attract business customers from around the world the firm advertises on the internet, while most of the members of the public who use its Bounty app join after being told about it by friends.Twentify has now worked with more than 150 business clients in Canada, Turkey and the US.More than 330,000 people have downloaded its Bounty app to do market research in those three countries plus Mexico, Nigeria, South Africa, Thailand, and Ukraine.The aim is to expand further internationally, but Ilker admits that it has not all been plain sailing since the firm was founded in 2014.A year and a half ago the company was not meeting the high growth targets he had set, so salaries and budgets had to be adjusted.Image caption People can earn money doing surveys for a number of firms via their mobile phones "I remember sitting in a meeting room in the office and going through all this stuff that I had to do, and suddenly I realised there were tears coming out of my eyes," he says."It was not because I was sad it was just the pressure, stress levels were high."The firm has also had to wrestle with the different banking systems across the world, to ensure that its users are promptly paid.This is the fourth story in a new series called Connected Commerce, which every week highlights companies around the world that are successfully exporting, and trading beyond their home market.Twentify has yet to make an annual profit as it instead invests to grow.This year it expects to see revenues reach $1.2m, with a loss of between 500,000-600,000.Backed by private investors, including Welsh-Canadian billionaire Terry Matthews, Twentify aims to increase its revenues to $10m by 2018.The company is also planning to relocate its headquarters to Toronto, Canada, but still maintain its existing office in Istanbul.Image copyright Chris McGrath Image caption Turkey does not have a large community of young start-up firms Ilker admits that being a young company in Turkey can be hard as the country doesn't have a large start-up community, so it can be difficult to gain investment, both in terms of finance and mentoring support.Can Selcuki, a board member of the Istanbul-based think tank Centre for Economic and Foreign Relations Research, agrees that this is an issue for Turkish start-ups.Image caption The global market research sector is huge "If you have an investor you don't just need the money, you also need their business knowhow, their connections, their mentorship basically, and I think that is the biggest obstacle in Turkey that tech start-ups face."Ilker says that moving the head office to Canada is needed in order to expand worldwide.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Twentify will soon be moving its main base to Toronto, but will keep its office in Turkey "Going global from North America is much easier for a tech start-up, you are closer to the capital, you are closer to big brands, big clients," he says."We have to make sure we are positioning ourselves not as a Turkish company, but as a global company."
Terror survivor's call for open speech on extremism:::::Image copyright One Young World Image caption Bjorn Ihler survived an attack and now wants to tackle extremist ideas Bjorn Ihler read Anders Breivik's book only a week after jumping into lake Tyrifjorden in Norway to escape the terrorist's bullets.Bjorn was one of the survivors on Utoya island where Breivik killed 77 people in July 2011.What Bjorn found in the far-right "manifesto" surprised him."His worldview was not purely driven by hatred," he says."It was much more about fear of what was happening to his society."This was a guy who grew up in the same city as me, we had similar backgrounds, we went to similar schools, but he saw the world in a completely different way."Since this experience, 26-year-old Bjorn devoted his life to trying to keep other young people from following a similar path to Breivik.Looking for extremists He has scoured the internet and seeks out extremists and former extremists to understand how they came to their views.He claims the unusual and unenviable record of meeting more reformed extremists than anyone else.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Bjorn wanted to tackle the "mindset" of Anders Breivik And he is now one of the leaders in a project talking to students in UK schools about extremist ideas.Bjorn says that before Breivik appeared in court after the attack, people were describing him a "super-intellectual far-right monster".In an echo of Harry Potter's nemesis Lord Voldemort, some were calling Breivik "He Who Must Be Named".Image caption In 2012 Bjorn gave evidence of how he had escaped by jumping into the lake But when Bjorn saw Breivik in the dock, he realised he was no longer at risk from him."I decided that the problem to address right now is all the people who share his mindset," he says.Bjorn is part of an initiative called Extremely Together, a partnership involving the Kofi Annan Foundation, One Young World and the European Commission.Not shutting down debate Bjorn's main recommendation for schools is that they teach students that people are allowed to hold very different ideas and opinions."I would like to see a class teaching critical thinking or philosophy in every school," he says.Image caption Extremely Together visit schools with a message of open debate "Students need to learn to analyse the information they receive, and to understand that there are many ways to interpret information, rather than see the world as black and white."He is concerned that many education systems are "shutting down critical thinking and teaching propaganda".Bjorn says teachers should encourage students to share ideas in the classroom, however unpleasant some of the ideas might seem.He says the mentorship of his old philosophy teacher helped him get through a difficult year following the attack."I was all over the place, I couldn't make sense of anything, so I decided to call my old high school philosophy teacher," he says."He had taught me that people can see the world in different ways.If Breivik had had him as a teacher, I think things could have been very different."Against 'safe spaces' Bjorn says the trend towards safe spaces in educational institutions is "extremely destructive" because it means teachers are hesitant to allow discussion of sensitive subjects."I've probably met more former extremists than anyone else, and one thing they all shared was that no one outside of their group would listen to them," he says.More from Global education Ideas for the Global education series?Get in touch."They never felt they were valued as human beings, they said no one would listen to their ideas."The only way to stop people from believing these ideas is to build a culture in the classroom where they can be discussed, analysed and criticised."Image copyright Reuters Image caption A memorial after Breivik's deadly attack on Utoya island He says this feeling of alienation is a "driving force" for why people turn violent."If they cannot promote their worldview through democratic means, they do it through violence."Countries around the world have been examining how to counter extremism in educational institutions.Bjorn warns that too much interference in schools could "backfire" - if students feel they are being unfairly targeted, they will feel targeted and be more prone to radicalisation.He argues that trying to ban access to extremist material online is "not a solution"."Educational institutions should be places where you are allowed to have weird ideas and discuss them without being reported to the police or have it show up on your record," he says."There is a difference between security and safety, and schools should not be places where ideas and opinions are policed."
How 'Asian Tiger cubs' are driving online shopping:::::Image copyright Post Office Bank of Singapore Image caption Children at Admiralty High School in Singapore show off their new payment wristbands Asia is driving the massive growth in online shopping, with youngsters in particular leading the charge.But why are they so keen and what are they spending their money on?In Admiralty Primary School, in Singapore's Woodlands neighbourhood, a group of students has just joined the e-commerce world."Now I don't need to think about losing my wallet," says Bosco Wong, a 10-year-old student, sporting a new wristband for making digital purchases while at school.The wearable band, called "Smart Buddy", is sponsored by the Post Office of Singapore Bank, and everyone at Admiralty has just received one.It is all part of Singapore's drive to go cashless, and the country's Education Minister Ong Ye Kung was at his school to launch them.Parents can track and manage their children's purchases online.Asia - its younger generations, in particular - has embraced online shopping and digital payments with remarkable enthusiasm.And given the UN's estimate that there are 720 million people aged 15-24 living there - dwarfing North America's 47 million and Europe's 82 million - it's no wonder Asia is driving the e-commerce explosion.China, which overtook the US in 2015 as the country with highest e-commerce spending, now accounts for 40% of the world's online commerce.Image copyright AFP Image caption Jack Ma founded Alibaba in 1999 Retail giant Alibaba, founded by billionaire Jack Ma, recently reported a 61% rise in quarterly revenues to 55.1bn yuan ($8.3bn; 6.4bn), thanks largely to the popularity of its online shopping platforms, Tmall and Taobao.Monthly active users of its Chinese retail marketplaces grew to 549 million in September, up 20 million from three months ago - that's an astonishing rate of growth.By 2020, 60% of all those aged 18-29 will live in Asia and will have a disposable income of $6tn (4.6tn), says consultancy firm Accenture - that's higher than any preceding generation.But why are Asia's youngsters so keen on buying online and what do they spend their money on?Well, this has clearly been a technology-driven phenomenon, with the smartphone as the key innovation changing consumer behaviour.About two-fifths of younger people in Asia have bought something online via their mobile, says Accenture."I do buy quite a lot of books online," says Theophi Kwek, 22, who recently finished university at Oxford and is now doing national service in Singapore's army.Books from overseas are cheaper than they are in Singapore, he says.He often uses UK sites and says shipping "usually takes a couple of weeks at most".Image copyright Theophi Kwek Image caption Singaporean Theophi Kwek likes buying books online from abroad But Yi Ying Ng, the 27-year-old founder of AllSome, a parcel tracking service, is part of a rising trend to connect other Asian markets to China's engine.The volume of packages from China to Malaysia has gone up from about one million a year in 2012, to about 73 million now, says Ms Ng.She takes goods from the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen, and delivers them to online buyers in Singapore and Malaysia, where she is originally from.She will be expanding next year to Indonesia, then Thailand, she says.When she started her company five years ago, posting a parcel from China cost $15-25 and took 30-50 days.She has found ways to lower this to $5, and shorten the delivery time to three days, she says.But her real innovation is helping small merchants to sell to friends and family through Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat, she says."We're trying to help everyone become a merchant, a decentralised approach," she says.Image copyright Ng Yi Ying Image caption Yi Ying Ng wants to help everyone sell online Research from TMI Strategy suggests that worldwide, 62% of e-commerce users under 30 take their cues in purchases from influential users online, whether friends on social media or specialist bloggers.Ms Ng calls her approach "social commerce".Most of her merchants are between 24-28, she says, and most of their customers are in their early twenties.But while China increasingly sells online to the rest of Asia, younger people in its rising urban middle classes are buying goods and services online from further afield.Qiaoyun Zhang and Xiaochen Xu are parents in their thirties, and live in Beijing's prosperous business and embassy district, Chaoyang.Recently they started using a platform called VIPKid to buy live English lessons from teachers in North America, for their four-year-old daughter, Lu-Ke.More Technology of Business Image copyright Getty Images "My husband and I seldom use English in our daily life," says Ms Zhang, "and maybe our English is not that good.So we don't want to teach our children to speak English."The lessons last 25 minutes and their daughter takes four of them a week on an iPad."North American teachers, they are very patient compared with Chinese teachers," Ms Zhang says.Companies wanting to sell to these younger Asian audiences like Mrs Zhang should realise brand loyalty doesn't any more exist, says Michael Talbot, co-founder of 3radical, a brand engagement firm working in East Asia.His firm provided the technology behind Singapore's Smart Buddy."These young people, they're not disloyal, they're just using tools in a very competitive landscape.It's fundamentally different from having one high street with a Chinese, an Indian, and a couple of pubs," he says.Loyalty schemes accordingly tend not to work in China, Vietnam and Thailand, but games tied into a brand and incorporating an element of luck have cultural appeal there, says Mr Talbot.So how will the likes of 10-year-old Bosco Wong be shopping in future?Using his voice to authenticate a purchase perhaps?Tapping the side of his augmented reality glasses?Whatever the technological innovations, these Asian Tiger cubs are likely to be in the vanguard as e-commerce continues to sweep across the world.
The non-stop problem solver who loves to invent:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Uddhab Bharali epitomises India's "jugaad" spirit "I like to solve problems," says Uddhab Bharali."I like to make [people] a little more comfortable with themselves, or a little independent."This is what drives Uddhab Bharali to keep inventing.He started making things to sell more than 30 years ago in order to help pay off a large family debt.Today it is his life's passion.He has created more than 140 inventions, many of which are sold commercially with some winning international awards.He says his main motivation has always been to help people.Across India he is already well-known for his agricultural inventions but his new ideas are helping those with disabilities.He explains that because there is limited government support in India for people with physical disabilities it is up to people like him to come up with solutions.Image caption As well as complicated machines Uddhab invents simple small devices like this coconut cracker.Raj Rehman is 15-years-old and was born with congenital amputations and cerebral palsy.The simple device that Mr Bharali has made for him attaches to his forearm and is made from everyday items like Velcro fasteners and a spoon.It helps him to eat and to write.Mr Bharali has also adapted some footwear which means Raj is able to move around much more comfortably."I used to worry about myself before but now I feel stress free.I don't have to worry how I will cross the railway line to reach school as now I can walk without difficulty," he says."I am happy that I can take care of myself."Human ingenuity Initially, Mr Bharali recalls that people thought he was "worthless" and it took him 18 years to establish himself as "an innovator with class".Image caption Uddhab has become famous because of his inventions Most of his innovations are low cost and use locally available raw materials.This type of frugal innovation is known as "jugaad".It is a Hindi term which can also translate as "ingenious improvisation".Jaideep Prabhu is from Cambridge University's Judge Business School and has written a book about jugaad.He thinks it has a huge role to play in inspiring people to innovate: "This is mainly because it doesn't require much more than your innate human ingenuity."The whole approach is designed for you to find problems that surround you in your community - problems that affect you and people like you, and then to take resources that you have access to and solve those problems," he says.The BBC's Innovators series reveals innovative solutions to major challenges across South Asia.Ever heard of the concept of "jugaad"?It's a Hindi term meaning cheap innovation.If you have created a life hack or innovation that you are proud of, or spotted one while out and about on your travels, then share your picture with us by emailing yourpics@bbc.co.uk, use the hashtags #Jugaad and #BBCInnovators and share your picture with @BBCWorldService, or upload your submission here.Learn more about BBC Innovators.Mr Bharali makes an income from selling his inventions as well as designing technical solutions for businesses and government.But he is keen to help others make money and improve their own financial situation.He has set up a couple of centres to give people access to his machines.At one of these centres women from the local villages are able to come and use a rice-grinding machine that he has designed.The rice flour is then made into cakes and other edible items that can be sold.No shortcut According to the World Bank only 27% of women in India over the age of 15 are economically active."We have no facilities or employment to earn our livelihood in the villages," says Porbitta Dhutta, one of the women who comes to the centre."Here we can use innovations to change our lives to become self-sufficient and make respectable money for ourselves and our families."Men in rural areas have also benefitted from Mr Bharali's ingenuity.He has developed and sold over 200 cement-brick making machines.Each one requires five people to operate it and he estimates that over one thousand men are now employed because of it.Image caption Raj Rehman says he is happy that he can look after himself, thanks to Uddhab Bharali's inventions Although Mr Bharali says there is no shortcut to success, his hard work means his life is now comfortable and he is able to support 25 other families with the proceeds from his business.His engineering background has certainly helped Mr Bharali but he thinks that the fundamentals of innovation cannot be taught: "Any person with a restless mind, who is uncomfortable with things in the world, is an innovator."Innovation comes from inside you.No-one can make you an innovator, you have to feel it."Originally he would design his machines and then hope that they were commercially successful but such is his reputation now that people are commissioning him to make bespoke solutions and he has no intention of slowing down.For him the excitement of innovating continues: "I just enjoy the challenge.Always something fresh.And the joy of being the first person to do something new."Additional research and reporting by Priti Gupta.
How South Sudan refugees are boosting Uganda’s economy:::::Image caption Penina used to have a salon in South Sudan Uganda is often called one of the best places in the world to be a refugee because of its welcoming policies.But how do you rebuild your life - and start making money - having left everything you knew and held dear?The BBC's John Murphy has been finding out."Starting any business is not easy because it's difficult to get money at the beginning," Penina tells me.Most entrepreneurs would tell you that.But imagine how much harder it is when you are living in a refugee settlement in northern Uganda, having escaped war."It's not easy for the refugees to even get money," she continues."You see, they sell their own things like beans, they pay you with [cooking] oil, because there's nothing, there's no money."Penina fled South Sudan with her four children.She didn't want to."I was not going to leave because I love my country, I love my home," she says."But the worst thing is when I saw a woman and a child being killed.How could I, as a woman, continue to stay in South Sudan when such things are happening, when women and children are being killed?"Her husband stayed behind.She says he refused to come and, for a short while, they communicated by phone.But his number no longer works and she doesn't know what has happened.'Use your brain' According to the United Nations refugee agency, the UNHCR, around 85% of the more than one million South Sudanese refugees now in Uganda are women and children.They do get some help from the UN, the international aid agencies and the Ugandan government.Image caption Penina says she finds it therapeutic to work in her salon They are given plots of land - wild bush land - which they have to clear and build shelters on and, when they can, grow vegetables in.They are also given plastic sheeting to construct their homes with, some cooking utensils and food rations.However, a lack of international help has meant that in the last year those monthly food hand-outs have been cut, and many refugees we met complained that the food does not actually last the month.That is where Penina has an advantage.She has a skill.She was a hairdresser back in Yei, in South Sudan, and she has brought that skill with her.She has also been a refugee in Uganda before, in the late 1990s, when there was fighting between north and south Sudan.It means she knows how things work in Uganda and she has a network of local friends.Uganda's refugee influx Uganda saw the largest number of refugees of any other country in 2016, UN figures show.The bulk of the new arrivals (489,000) came from South Sudan, with a smaller number (18,600) coming from Burundi More than a quarter of a million refugees are living in the Bidi Bidi camp alone More people arrived in Uganda in 2016 than crossed the Mediterranean into Europe 'Why I gave my land to a refugee' Is Uganda the best place to be a refugee?Uganda hosts 1m South Sudan refugees One in particular, who helped her set up her hair salon in Imvepi refugee settlement.The salon is, in fact, a shack made of wooden poles and UNHCR plastic sheeting.Hanging from the poles are pictures of hairstyles and an assortment of hair extensions.There is also a large poster of Jesus Christ.When I ask Penina where her energy comes from, she looks to the sky."That's God," she says.I point out that it is her too."Yes," she replies."But you have to use your brain.God has given me all this.I have to use my brain to do something, rather than stay idle."She says business is slow.Sometimes the only way for her to make money, so that she can buy the things she needs for her business, is to take those food rations the refugees give her in payment and to sell them, to get some cash."What can we do?It's the condition we are in."But her salon has proved therapeutic."It's good when you just chat together," she explains."You forget about the stresses and other things in South Sudan, the bad things people were doing."'Business is booming' Not far away, I come across a young man surrounded by piles of charcoal, which crunches underfoot.It is widely used by both refugees and Ugandans for cooking."Business is booming in the refugee camp," says Abdul Karim Ali, a lively 25-year-old Ugandan.He comes from the local town, Arua, which in the rainy season can be about an hour-and-a-half away, driving along muddy roads.He explains how the South Sudanese refugees "cure" the charcoal and he buys it from them, then transports it back to town to sell at a profit.Image caption "In business sometimes you win, sometimes you lose," says Abdul Karim Ali "Charcoal is very expensive in town.But, due to the conditions, they sell it cheaply," he says of the refugees."Some even sell their own stuff, the things given to them by the UN.We get a lot of profit from them."Yet that is a dangerous business, he tells me.The Ugandan government does not like people profiting from the goods handed out by the UN and the police could arrest you if they find you trading in refugee items."But we still buy," insists Mr Ali."In business sometimes you win, sometimes you lose."His positivity is infectious."Look around," he tells me."We are all mixed up in the market, South Sudanese and Ugandan, doing business so that we can survive better."It is true.Swathes of the north Ugandan countryside are being transformed.It is part of the reason why the Ugandan government has been so welcoming to the refugees.What was unproductive bush land in a poor region is being cleared, markets are sprouting up in the settlements and small businesses are growing roots.With little sign of peace returning to South Sudan anytime soon, the refugees have to make new lives for themselves.And some local Ugandans are benefiting too.Find out more on the BBC's Global Business programme
From berated blogger to beauty millionaire:::::Image copyright Lowengrip Image caption Isabelle Lowengrip got into blogging in the late 2000s After finding fame with her lifestyle blog, Isabella Lowengrip went on to establish one of Sweden's best-known beauty companies.But it wasn't all plain sailing for the 27-year-old.When she started her blog at the age of 14, the mainstream media didn't take her seriously at all."Swedes, and particularly teenage girls, were very fast and early adopters," she says of the blogging boom that swept the country a decade ago."But I remember the Swedish media laughing at us and saying, 'look at those young women trying to do business with blogs'.We didn't give up though, and I'm very proud of it."Under the pen name Blondinbella, she quickly became one of the most-read bloggers in the Nordics, and today some 1.5 million people visit her site every week.Image copyright Lowengrip Image caption The Lowengrip Care & Color range includes moisturisers, facial creams, mascara and shampoo Translated into English, German, and more recently French and Arabic, the blog focuses on fashion and beauty, Ms Lowengrip's business ventures, and her efforts to balance a busy career with bringing up two young children.It has also propelled her to becoming one of the Nordics' best known "social influencers", as well as being a launch-pad for a raft of successful spin-off businesses."I see myself more as an entrepreneur than a writer," she admits as we chat at her glitzy offices in Stockholm."I still think I write quite badly!"Ms Lowengrip first showed a flair for business as a teenager, when she secured numerous advertising and sponsorship deals for her blog.Image copyright Lowengrip Image caption Ms Lowengrip with her business partner Pingis Hadenius While some of her contemporaries partied away their earnings, the Swede chose to invest in new ventures.In 2012, she launched her own beauty brand, Lowengrip Care & Color (LCC), which was ranked as Sweden's fastest-growing beauty company last year.It markets itself as selling "gentle" products that offer fast results, including facial creams, mascara, shampoos and body lotions.More The Boss features, which every week profile a different business leader from around the world: LCC has expanded across the Nordics and into Switzerland and Estonia, and last year reported sales of 35m Swedish krona (3.3m)."Building a company is my passion," says Ms Lowengrip of her decision to try new business ventures beyond blogging."It's hard for me to just wear somebody else's make-up or clothes - I want to create everything."But LCC and the blog remain strongly intertwined.Both ventures share the same office space above the exclusive Stockholm mall Sturegallerian and together employ 40 employees in total.Image copyright Isabella Lowengrip Image caption A management meeting at Lowengrip's offices in Stockholm Ms Lowengrip's posts also frequently reference her work at LCC - from meetings with designers and toxicologists, to appearances at beauty fairs and major contract wins.She also often asks her readers' for their opinions on her products or projects.Ms Lowengrip's other business interests include a shoe brand, a clothing label, an investment company and personal finance workshops, and the whole group expects to report sales of 75m Swedish krona this year."When it turned out she had a talent for business, she was taken much more seriously," reflects Frasse Levinsson, a Stockholm-based media commentator and digital editor of popular culture magazine Nojesguiden."She knows which way the wind blows.For example, skincare has become a hot topic in the feminist movement in Sweden.Image copyright Lowengrip Image caption Ms Lowengrip at an LCC product launch "But it's almost like she predicted that because she released her own skincare products just beforehand."Ms Lowengrip puts her success down to a range of factors, from the sheer number of hours she's invested in educating herself on business matters, to collaborating with "smarter colleagues" in her ventures.However, she admits that the time and effort involved in building her career has put a strain on her personal life.She is also candid about projects that failed to blossom, including Egoboost, a traditional glossy magazine that never turned a profit, and Bellme, her first online store, which went bankrupt shortly after she sold the business."I learned so much during those years, so I am very grateful for all those mistakes.You have to just jump on the horse again and not be so afraid of what people are thinking."Image copyright Lowengrip Image caption Ms Lowengrip sometimes models her own products The 27-year-old says she's accepted she's "not the best leader", arguing that she's better at coming up with ideas, and focusing on LCC's bigger vision "to become the next Estee Lauder".For this reason, her business partner, the economist and journalist Pingis Hadenius, has taken on chief executive duties at LCC.Ms Lowengrip's official title is creative director, but she also remains the brand's more public face.Dividing opinion Such a public persona continues to be a mixed blessing.Despite being an icon for hundreds of thousands of Swedish women who've grown up reading about her life, Ms Lowengrip, perhaps inevitably, divides opinion.She recently faced a backlash after divorcing from her husband and being vocal about subsequently buying in more home-help for cooking and cleaning - something of a taboo in Sweden's social democracy.But the mother-of-two says she refuses to be judged for her lifestyle."It's important for me to not have to choose between my business and my family life," she says."And if I'm a happier person by myself, then I am also a better mum, a better colleague and a better leader."
Could giving property rights to the world's poor unlock trillions?:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption What effect do property rights have on the economy?Some of the most important parts of our modern economy can't be seen - but they can be heard.That's what one Peruvian economist concluded while walking through the idyllic rice fields of Bali, Indonesia, in the 1990s.As he passed one farm, a dog would bark at his approach.Then, quite suddenly, the first animal would stop and a new guardian would begin to yap away.The boundary between farms was invisible to him - but the dogs knew exactly where it was.The economist, Hernando de Soto, returned to Indonesia's capital, Jakarta, and met cabinet ministers to discuss setting up a formal register of property rights.They already knew everything they needed to know, he said, cheekily.They merely needed to ask the dogs of Bali who owned what.50 Things That Made the Modern Economy highlights the inventions, ideas and innovations that helped create the economic world.It is broadcast on the BBC World Service.You can find more information about the programme's sources and listen online or subscribe to the programme podcast.Hernando de Soto is a big name in development economics.His energetic opposition to Peru's Maoist guerrilla group, the Shining Path, led to three assassination attempts.His big idea is to make sure that the legal system can see as much as the dogs of Bali.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Hernando de Soto argues better property rights could make a big difference to the world's poor While the Indonesian government was trying to formalise property rights, others have tried to abolish them altogether.Daring plan In 1970s China, for example, where the Maoists weren't the rebels but the government, the very idea that anyone could own anything was seditious, bourgeois thinking.Farmers on collective farms were told by Communist Party officials that they didn't own a thing.Everything belonged to the collective.What about the teeth in my head, asked one farmer?As noted by NPR's Planet Money podcast, he was told that even his teeth were owned by the collective.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The land, its produce - and even the workers' teeth - belonged to the collective in 1970s China This approach worked terribly: if you don't own anything, why bother to look after it?Avoiding toothache is an incentive to brush your teeth.But collective ownership of land left farmers in desperate, gnawing poverty.So, in Xiaogang in 1978, a group of farmers secretly met and agreed a daring plan.Conspicuous success Instead of farming as a collective, they would informally divide up the land, and each keep whatever surplus they produced after meeting collective quotas.It was a treasonous agreement in Communist eyes: discovery risked execution.In fact, they were found out thanks to their conspicuous success: their farms produced more in one year than in the previous five years combined.But luck was on their side.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Deng Xiaoping, who became leader in 1978, laid the foundations for China's modern economy.China now had a new leader: Deng Xiaoping.And Deng let it be known that this was the sort of experiment that had his blessing.And 1978 was the beginning of China's breakneck transformation from utter poverty to, by some measures, the largest economy on the planet.Invisible web The experience in China shows that even informal property rights can be incredibly powerful.If you know your neighbours respect your boundaries, you can feel confident investing time in weeding your vegetable plot, or building a house.But in one critical way, it doesn't help me that my neighbours agree that I own my house.If I want a loan - to improve my house, or build a business - lenders need collateral.And land or buildings make particularly good collateral because they tend to increase in value, and it's hard to hide them from creditors.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Banks will lend against property only if its ownership can be proven in law But the lender needs to be confident it could take the house away from me if I don't repay the loan.So, I need to prove that the house really is mine.That requires an invisible web of information that the legal system and the banking system can use.For Hernando de Soto, this invisible web is the difference between my house being an asset - something useful that I own - and being capital - an asset recognised by the financial system.'Dead capital' In poor countries, a lot of assets are informally held.Hernando de Soto calls them "dead capital", useless for securing a loan.His estimate was that at the start of the 21st Century there was almost $10tn (7.5tn) worth of dead capital across the developing world - more than $4,000 (3,200) for every person.Other researchers think that's an overestimate and the true figure is probably $3tn (2.2tn) or $4tn (2tn), but either way, it's a huge amount.More from Tim Harford: 'The devil's rope': How barbed wire changed America How a creative legal leap helped create vast wealth Do passports restrict economic growth?The great intellectual property trade-off But how do assets become capital?How does the invisible web get woven?It needs a government.Enforcing property rights is one of the few things pretty much everyone on the political spectrum agrees a government should do, except perhaps the Maoists.It's not just an altruistic measure to make it easier to get a mortgage.When government knows who owns land, it can tax it.Napoleonic 'cadastres' Perhaps the first recognisably modern property registry was in Napoleonic France.Needing to fund his incessant wars, Napoleon decreed that all French properties would be carefully mapped, and their ownership registered.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Napoleon decreed that all properties in the territories he controlled would be mapped and registered Such a property map is called a "cadastre", and Napoleon proudly proclaimed that "a good cadastre of the parcels will be the complement of my civil code".After conquering Switzerland, the Netherlands and Belgium, Napoleon introduced cadastral maps there, as well.Bold pioneers In the mid-1800s, the idea of the land registry spread quickly through the British Empire, too.The government drew up maps and allocated title deeds.Of course at that time, nobody with any power had much interest in the fact that indigenous people had their own claims on the land.The process doesn't have to be top-down.In the United States, there was a bottom-up approach.After decades of treating squatters as criminals, the state began to think of them as bold pioneers.Image copyright Chris Dorney / Alamy Stock Photo Image caption The 1862 Homestead Act set out the rules on who could own land in the US's western territories The US government tried to formalise informal property claims, using the Preemption Act of 1841 and the Homestead Act of 1862.Again, the rights of the native people who had been living there for thousands of years were not regarded as of much significance.It was hardly justice.But it was profitable.By turning a land-grab into a legally recognised property right, these land registries unlocked decades of investment and improvement.And some economists - most prominently Hernando de Soto himself - argue that a good way to create property registers for developing countries today is to use the same bottom-up process of recognising informal squatters' rights, coupled with modern databases.Do improved property registers really unlock what Hernando de Soto calls "dead capital"?Evidently, they can.In Ghana, for example, farmers with clearer property rights invested more in their land.Essential infrastructure But the answer, of course, is "it depends".It depends on whether there's a banking system capable of lending, and an economy worth borrowing money to invest in.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The Philippines' labyrinthine property registration system involves 168 steps And it depends on how smoothly the property register works.Hernando de Soto found that in the Philippines, legally registering property took 168 procedures, 53 agencies and a waiting list of 13 to 25 years.Faced with such obstacles, even formally registered properties are likely to become informal again - the next time the property is traded, both the buyer and the seller may decide that formalising the deal is just too time consuming.But get it right, and the results can be impressive.The World Bank has found that after controlling for income and economic growth, the countries with simpler, quicker property registries also had less corruption, less grey-market activity, more credit and more private investment.Meanwhile, the property registry doesn't get much love: it's not a high-speed rail line or a gleaming new airport.It's an unfashionable, invisible piece of infrastructure.But without it, developed economies would go to the dogs.Tim Harford writes the Financial Times's Undercover Economist column.50 Things That Made the Modern Economy is broadcast on the BBC World Service.You can find more information about the programme's sources and listen online or subscribe to the programme podcast.
Persuading would-be migrants to stay at home:::::Image caption Hassan Odjo says he is happy to be back in Senegal It is 10 o'clock at night, and outside the arrivals hall of Dakar's main airport, two Senegalese men are taking a moment to get used to their freedom.Hassan Odjo, 42 and Issa Ba, 23 have just stepped off a flight from Libya, where they had been trapped for months."I was praying every day to Allah to give me the chance to come home," says Hassan, a huge smile spread across his face."I saw people dying in front of my eyes.Every day I was praying to be back in my country.Today is the happiest day for me, it's like it's my birthday."Both Hassan and Issa have returned home under a voluntary repatriation programme run by the International Organization for Migration (IOM).They had travelled through Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger and ended up in Libya - where they became trapped, unable to go further.Dangerous route Hassan had attempted to cross the Mediterranean, but after his boat got into trouble he was picked up by local militia and held in detention.Image caption It can be hard for some to come back and say they failed to get to Europe, says Seydine Ken Hassan tells me of the suffering facing economic migrants in Libya, and describes being held in a room with 300 people, being given only bread twice a day, and bad water."When they catch you they lock you in prison, beat you or maltreat you, ask you to call your parents to send money."In Libya detaining migrants has become a business in itself, he says."They are selling black people like coffee, like a cup of coffee.Yes I'm telling you the truth!"Faced with this reality, it isn't surprising that more migrants are opting to return home.Returning home The International Organisation for Migration has access to the Libyan detention centres, and works with national consulates to offer people the choice to get out.So far this year, the IOM in Senegal alone has helped more than 2,000 people return home.Most of them have either been flown in from Libya, or bussed back from Niger.Others have been brought back from Morocco and Tunisia.Image caption Too many migrants don't realise the dangers they'll face, says the IOM's Senegal boss Jo-Lind Roberts Sene Sitting quietly next to Hassan is Issa Ba.He cuts a contrasting figure; he looks visibly shaken and for him the homecoming is bittersweet."I feel happy because I am going to see my parents again, but at the same time I'm very disappointed.It's a shame you know, it's a dishonour going back without getting to Europe."Listening to all this is Seydine Ken, the IOM case-worker who is at the airport to meet the two.He's used to seeing these kind of reactions from returnees.Seydine says: "The social pressure is really difficult because when they organise their trip, the family mobilises money, and sells their goods to pay for it."And it's very difficult for them to come back, and see what their family invested in the [failed] migration."Seydine is part of the government welcome party; and at the airport he provides pocket money and information to take care of immediate needs, and also questions the two about their migration experience.He's a regular at the airport and says he can be there twice a week to welcome returnees."They have not met their dream.They are very disappointed, physically they are very tired and psychologically they are very weak.These people need help - financial help, health and personal development."Returnees' role The IOM's chief of mission in Senegal is Jo-Lind Roberts Sene.Time and again she notices the serious lack of information about the realities of migrating."It's very frustrating when each time we have a charter flight, I get to the airport and have the same exchanges over and over again - they didn't have sufficient information, they knew the trip was dangerous but never knew to what extent."Image caption In rural Senegal, a lack of jobs is one reason many choose to try and reach Europe Jo-Lind says that around Dakar there is more awareness about the dangers, but that in the countryside and other areas - home to a lot of would-be migrants - there is not this awareness.Voluntary returnees like Hassan and Issa play a vital role in helping change people's views.One of the regions where young men are being re-absorbed is Tambacounda in eastern Senegal, close to the border with Mali.Being a poor, rural region, it is the lack of well-paying jobs for young people that encourages them to leave in the first place.So attempts are being made to reintegrate returned migrants into the community - giving them something to do and a way of earning a living.One project is a maize farm in the rural community of Jalakoto.It's run two European NGOs, Coopi and La Lumiere, along with the IOM, and helps around 100 young men in the surrounding villages.Image caption The maize farm is designed to help people earn a living - and for them to meet returning migrants For men like Mamadou Biagey, who came back from Libya three years ago, it's the only thing they have."Since I arrived I have lived in hardship because all the money I had I used to travel to Libya.For two years I stayed here without doing anything - it's only this year that I started doing something."The Jalakoto project is also designed to give young men thinking of leaving for Europe a reason to stay - not just by providing an income and a purpose, but also by encouraging them to rub shoulders with people who can talk of their experiences travelling to Europe."Sometimes in our debates there are young men who ask, 'what did you do and how did you do it to get to Libya?'," says Mamadou Biagey, "but I try to discourage from going."A quick show of hands among the 15 men working in one field reveals one man who says he initially intended to leave."In the beginning I only wanted to go and I saved enough money," he explains."Later on they brought us the project and explained what it was about and they convinced me.That's how I decided not to go."Competing narratives In Tambacounda and throughout Senegal there is a battle going on between two narratives of what migration to Europe actually entails.Image caption Warnings about the dangers of migrating are competing with individual success stories, says Issaga Cee Back in the town, Issaga Cee, a school principal for 13 years, explains how real-life accounts of the dangers of the journey compete for space with apparent success stories on social media."People communicate a lot through WhatsApp - its very easy to tell the story of someone who has succeeded," he explains."Most of those who return at least have an experience of all the difficulties in Libya, so they have become lecturers about that very difficult trip and its consequences."The IOM's Jo-Lind Roberts Sene says returning migrants have a crucial role to play: "If it's a message that comes from Europeans it won't go through."If it's someone who's tried it, and hasn't made it, and can really explain what it was they experienced along the way, then it will take time - but they really are the ones that can put the message across."A note on terminology: The BBC uses the term migrant to refer to all people on the move who have yet to complete the legal process of claiming asylum.This group includes people fleeing war-torn countries such as Syria, who are likely to be granted refugee status, as well as people who are seeking jobs and better lives, who governments are likely to rule are economic migrants.
Spreading the word: How to promote your online business:::::Image copyright Gemma Day Image caption Nosh Detox founder Geeta Sidhu-Robb used bloggers to help promote her brand Online businesses now have a wealth of digital tools and techniques at their disposal to help them get noticed in the global marketplace.Geeta Sidhu-Robb, founder of juice and health food delivery service, Nosh Detox, was using social media to promote her business long before it became fashionable to do so.Ten years ago, in fact.On a tight budget and needing to convince a sceptical public, she tapped in to the power and reach of bloggers to promote her diet and wellbeing products."Juice fasts didn't really exist in the UK at the time," recalls the former corporate lawyer and single mum of three."In fact some people actually thought a detox could kill you.""We couldn't afford PR [public relations] agencies or expensive advertising campaigns, so we'd talk to pretty much anyone with an online presence and persuade them to take photos, film us on YouTube and write about us," she says.The bloggers would include a link to her website on their pages - occasionally in return for some Nosh Detox freebies Ms Sidhu-Robb admits.This helped push the business to the top of organic - not paid-for - search rankings.A 2m turnover and Hollywood A-list clientele followed, along with significant followings in Russia and Australia.It shows how, on social media, a little can go a very long way when it comes brand promotion.Image copyright EyeFitU Image caption Isabelle Ohnemus is a big believer in finding the right social media "influencer" for your brand Now social media marketing is a business in its own right.Convenient and low cost, with a potentially vast audience reach, the platforms have overtaken all other media for small businesses, says research firm BIA Kelsey.Former investment banker Isabelle Ohnemus has extensively used "influencers" to promote her Zurich-based fashion company EyeFitU, which is an online platform aimed at remedying some of the sizing inconsistencies across fashion brands.Usually young, fashion-conscious females with a prominent online presence act as "brand ambassadors" for EyeFitU, promoting the company to their followers on Instagram, Snapchat or Facebook.Big brands will sometimes pay in excess of $30,000 (23,000) to such influencers for a single post, but smaller companies with more modest budgets can still get in on the action."There is a trend for going with smaller-scale bloggers rather than those with million-plus followers," says Ms Ohnemus,."Having those kinds of numbers doesn't necessarily mean a higher number of conversions."In other words, it's the quality of the following not the size that matters.People who trust an influencer's opinion are more likely to buy the brand's goods, she says.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Reality TV star Marnie Simpson fell foul of the Advertising Standards Authority Of course, there are rules governing this sort of social media influencer marketing, so you have to be careful.Geordie Shore TV star Marnie Simpson recently got into trouble for uploading images of products from two firms she had business relationships with, without identifying them as adverts A spokeswoman for the UK's Advertising Standards Authority tells the BBC: "Our current codes state that if an advertiser gives payment to a social media influencer - this can be in the form of a monetary payment or a freebie - and there is control over the contents of the ad, the social media post would be considered an ad; thus the influencer must clearly indicate somewhere on the post that this is an advertisement."Know your customer One of the main advantages of an online business compared to a traditional bricks-and-mortar shop is the amount of data you can gather about your customers.You can find out which search words people use to find your business, for example, which images they respond to the most, and which website content they share on other platforms.This all helps to refine and target your marketing efforts.Free monitoring tools, like BuzzSumo and Metrixapp, not to mention Google Analytics, are all powerful helpers for the small business.Image copyright Gourmet Meat Club Image caption Gourmet Meat Club found that images of cooked food were more popular than raw ingredients Vikas Shah, visiting professor of entrepreneurship at the MIT Sloan School of Management, says: "You can easily start by using many free SEO [search engine optimisation] tools on platforms like Google and Twitter, and because this activity is very much results driven, you will see a fairly robust relationship between spend and return on investment."Gourmet Meat Club, an online provider of free range British meat, is one of the 54% of websites globally using Google Analytics to delve into customer quirks.Recent insights reveal that Android mobile users visit more web pages than those on an Apple phone, and images of cooked food generate more views in a digital ad campaign than images of raw ingredients.Furthermore, the technology tracks the most popular food searches online, giving Gourmet Meat Club the opportunity to create content based on the very latest trends.More Technology of Business Image copyright Getty Images "It's crucial to act fast," says Stuart Cordingley, the firm's managing director, "jumping onto popular searches as soon as they emerge to get ahead of the competition and be present where the public is discussing its new favourite food topics."This is the best way for the brand to get "ample exposure", he says.Data is now "central to the marketing mix".This up-to-the-minute content is sent to journalists and shared on the firm's own Facebook and Twitter pages.Social media marketing expert Andy Barr says it is an example of how online businesses are increasingly morphing into social media communities, creating content that positions them as authorities on particular topics.But he also advises supplementing this approach with social media advertising."As a general rule of thumb, it's worth spending between 7-12% of your total monthly revenue or income on social media promotion for the best results," he says.
Ever fancied joining a private members' club?:::::Image copyright Paul Winch-Furness Image caption The Hospital Club is one of a new breed of trendy private members' clubs A new breed of fashionable private members clubs are growing in popularity around the world, promising to be more inclusive and diverse than their stuffy older counterparts.Yet while the newer venues certainly have a far more youthful membership, and you certainly don't need to have gone to a posh school or university, they still have high joining fees and strict vetting processes.So how less elitist are they?And what are the benefits of getting your name on the list?"I like how organically relationships happen at Soho House," says tech entrepreneur Tyler McIntyre."You can't wear business suits, you can't hand out business cards, and you can't take phone calls."The 26-year-old joined Soho Beach House in Miami two years ago, after visiting with friends who were members."It's a laidback place to network but it's also given me the opportunity to try things I typically wouldn't do by myself, like wine tastings or a jam-making class.Image copyright Dave Burk Image caption Soho House New York has a rooftop pool "And sometimes I'll go to the sunset DJ parties by the pool, which are loud and pretty crazy."Welcome to the new breed of private members' club, which claim to be less restrictive and more diverse than the stuffy gentlemen's clubs of the past.These modern venues - with their co-working spaces, screening rooms and rooftop pools - are fast becoming the places where many of today's young creative class choose to work and play.Membership isn't cheap though, with some charging more than $2,000 (1,500) per annum, along with joining fees of $300.Image copyright Tyler McIntyre Image caption Tech entrepreneur Tyler McIntyre joined Soho House Miami two years ago "In the past, members' clubs were seen as being elitist and populated by people who went to the same public schools and universities," says Richard Cope, a senior trends consultant at Mintel."But these places are more for entrepreneurs and self-made people.The only thing you have to be able to do is pay the fee, and it can be fairly expensive."While trendy members' clubs have been around for years, they became much more common after the launch of Soho House in London in 1995.The trend has also gained a foothold in the US and other countries."We've see a huge jump in the number of the new types of club coming online, as compared to the traditional model," says Zack Bates of Private Club Marketing, a firm that promotes members' clubs.Image copyright Soho House Image caption Soho House Barcelona looks to attract creative entrepreneurs "In Los Angeles, you can't get into Soho House.So others are being built, the Hospital Club, Griffin Club and Norwood, to keep up with the appetite for these spaces."Soho House itself now boasts 18 venues around the world, including in New York, Istanbul, Berlin, and soon Mumbai.Group revenue rose 3% in 2016 to 293.4m, while global membership jumped from 56,000 to 70,000.However, you have to do more than just fill out an application to join its venues.Membership costs between 400 to 1,580 per annum, depending on the club, although there are discounts for under-27s.Image copyright Soho House Barcelona Image caption The gym at Soho House Barcelona More stories from the BBC's Business Brain series looking at interesting business topics from around the world: Image copyright The Hospital Club Image caption The Hospital Club has a TV and music studio on site And there's a tough background check to ensure potential members are part of the creative class - Soho House frowns on those who work in financial services, for instance.Once accepted, members enjoy a host of perks.Soho House Barcelona, for example, one of the chain's newest venues, boasts a retro-themed gym, pool and free classes like yoga.Members pay full price for food and drink but get discounts on the club's hotel rooms.Mr Cope says: "These clubs offer people a discreet place to network and wind down, typically in cities where personal space is at a premium."However, they are also about "showing off to a degree"."In an age of social media, people like to let others know where they hang out or which restaurants they eat at.So there's an element of satisfying those peacock tendencies."Image copyright Richard Booth Image caption The Hospital Club says it provides its members with networking opportunities The newer clubs do serve more practical functions, though, such as offering young entrepreneurs a place to work.Take London's Hospital Club, based in Covent Garden, which offers its own meeting and conference rooms, and even an in-house TV and music recording studio.Standard membership costs 865 plus a 250 joining fee.While some might find such fees high, it's still cheaper than forking out for your own office space, says Mr Bates."It suits today's digital nomads, who work remotely via their laptops.Paying for an office can be prohibitively expensive, especially in a major city."Members' clubs also offer vital networking opportunities that help further your career, says Zikki Munyao, 40.The remote IT worker joined Common House, a private member's club in Charlottesville, USA, largely for this purpose.Image copyright Andrea Hubbell Photography Image caption The co-working space at Common House "There are areas to socialise and meeting spaces where I can have privacy," he says of the club, where membership costs $150 (113) a month, plus a $600 joining fee."I even met my estate agent over a game of pool."The new breed of members' clubs does face challenges, though.Some warn that as clubs proliferate, their exclusivity is becoming diluted, and they struggle to attract the celebrities that once lent them cachet.The social commentator Peter York tells the BBC: "Traditionally private members' clubs have played on their exclusivity and being able to attract the 'magic people'."But as more and more of them pop up, you get blase.The magical people also can't be corralled in one place anymore."He adds that as clubs like Soho House keep on expanding, they seem to be "more about business", which further dilutes their brand."The danger is that a new challenger, which looks younger and groovier, arrives and steals your limelight."But Mr Cope believes the market for these new clubs is going to expand."Having somewhere where you can unwind and host friends in the centre of cities is useful.So there are a lot of practicalities around this."It is also about expressing your individuality, so I think the emotional need for this is only going to grow."
The new port trying to fulfil our shopping obsession:::::Image copyright DP World Image caption DP World London Gateway opened in November 2013 Just five years ago, DP World London Gateway was still being dredged from the Thames.Now the UK's newest port is trying to lure the world's biggest ships to its quayside to get us our shopping quicker.You browse online, click on something you fancy, and lo and behold often as little as 24 hours later it's on your front door step.This seemingly magical process - a relatively recent phenomenon - is being made possible by one of the oldest industries on the planet - shipping.Most of us don't spend a lot of time thinking about how what we buy gets to us.Yet most of the clothes you wear, much of the food you eat, the TV you watch, your phone and even the materials for the house you live in will have come to you via a ship."You can put anything in a box more or less," quips James Leeson, head of port commercial, at DP World London Gateway.The boxes here mostly contain frozen foods such as chicken and beef, and fruit such as bananas.Occasionally they may contain the lifelong belongings of a family moving overseas, expensive cars, or even, as was the case recently, Virgin founder Richard Branson's yacht.The port officially opened for business just four years ago.Image copyright Thinkstock Image caption Most of what we buy arrives by ship The windswept, vast space has literally redrawn the Essex landscape.Situated 20 miles down the River Thames from London, in Thurrock, Essex, the port sits on a bed of sand and silt dredged from the Thames on the site of a former oil refinery.The 1.5bn construction saw a staggering 350,000 animals moved off site into new habitats.At one stage DP World's office building on the site homed tanks of great crested newts before they were moved into newly created ponds.It was planned long before the financial crisis when the world economy was booming and ports were struggling to handle the sheer volumes of goods coming in.The two busiest container ports in the south east are Hutchison Whampoa's Felixstowe, in Suffolk, and DP World's other port in Southampton.And so far the number of containers London Gateway has handled in its short existence has been dwarfed by its rivals.Last year, Felixstowe handled almost six times as many containers as London Gateway.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Most of the port's processes are automated Mr Leeson is undeterred - saying the company is in it for the long term."It takes a bit of time to get moving.Shipping volumes are up and we've got big names signing up to leases in logistics park," he says.The port's deep channels means it can handle the latest biggest ships, the so called Neo-Panamaxes.These giants, equivalent to the width and length of three football pitches laid end to end, are increasingly the way goods are shipped.Its other big advantage is that most of the port's operations are automated.In a space which is twice the size of the City of London just 500 people are employed.'Frictionless trade' This means faster "frictionless trade", says Mr Leeson.It is this that London Gateway believes will help it to gain more customers.Incoming trucks have to pre-register and are scanned on arrival, before being sent to a specific bay where an automated crane removes or adds their container, meaning they can be in and out in half an hour.The containers themselves are organised by huge cranes which stalk the landscape like Star Wars At-Ats.Like an oversized game of Jenga, where each container goes is carefully organised to make sure that the boxes which need to unloaded or loaded first are near the top.A sophisticated computer system continually tracks where the containers are in the port.Mr Leeson says this is crucial."It used to be that your box would arrive at port and you'd have no clue what happened.Now you can track it through port and see when it's ready for collection.Consumers are more and more demanding and we had to respond to that," he says.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Containers are continually tracked But it is the scale of its logistics park which DP World is betting on to be London Gateway's biggest lure.Currently most of the goods imported into the UK are taken by road, and some by rail, to big distribution centres in the Midlands, the traditional logistics hub for the country.This means shipped goods are often driven from the south, up north to be packaged or priced, and then driven back to the south where the majority of items are bought and sold.DP World believes the space it is offering will enable firms to process goods immediately after arrival, speeding up their deliveries to shops and to consumers increasingly used to Amazon Prime's 24-hour delivery promise.Environmentally it will cut carbon emissions, but crucially DP World also expects it to cut costs.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Consumers increasingly expect goods to arrive within 24 hours So far, parcel giant UPS and discount supermarket Lidl have taken space, with Dixons Carphone also reported to soon be opening up a warehouse.And fruit importer SH Pratt Group is getting ready to build a giant refrigerated facility for its new venture Halo, which will package chilled and frozen goods.Currently, the space is a muddy patch of wasteland, but Halo's managing director Gavin Knight says it will be up and running by next summer.He says the decision to choose London Gateway was "quite simple"."As soon as you put a container on wheels it adds cost.[This way] we're saving time, food miles and money," he says.Global Trade More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade: But Neil Davidson, shipping consultancy Drewry's senior analyst for ports and terminals, says firms will have to weigh up the advantages against the potentially higher cost of renting space and hiring staff in the south east.With the shipping market growing "steadily but not hugely", the only way for London Gateway to succeed will be to steal market share from its local rivals, Mr Davidson says.It's something that London Gateway has already started to do, albeit on a small scale.But Mr Leeson is confident its growth will continue, "We built London Gateway as a future proof model for future trade," he says.And its other big advantage as Brexit looms is that 99% of its trade comes from outside the EU."We are confident that whatever happens we will see an upturn in trade," he says.
Play it again: The firm saving vinyl:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption How a small company in the Czech Republic became the world's largest maker of vinyl records Whether gathering dust in your loft or currently spinning on your turntable, it's a fair bet that at least some of your vinyl records came from a small factory in the Czech Republic.The facility in question is the headquarters of GZ Media, based in the small town of Lodenice, 25km (16 miles) west of the Czech capital, Prague.GZ is today the world's largest producer of vinyl records, of which it expects to press 30 million this year, for everyone from the Rolling Stones and U2, to Lady Gaga and Madonna.The success of the company is a far cry from the early 1990s, when vinyl records appeared to be on the way out, with music fans having switched en masse to compact discs.Back in the early 1970s more than three-quarters of album sales were on vinyl, but by the 1990s that had plunged to just 1.5%.Image caption Producing vinyl records is a multi-step process "In 1993 our output was at its lowest, vinyl was almost dead," says GZ's chief executive Michal Sterba."If we'd have stayed as a vinyl-only producer in the 90s, GZ would be no more."The operation had only become a private company two years earlier after the fall of communism.Prior to that it had been a state-run enterprise called Gramofonove Zavody (Gramophone Record Factory) which had started in 1951, and had pressed records for the world's largest music companies.With demand for vinyl having dwindled, GZ realised that it had to diversify to survive, so it branched out into printing and making packaging for consumer goods.Image caption Michal Sterba is now expanding GZ, with new sister factories in the US and Canada Crucially though, it kept pressing vinyl to satisfy what little demand there was.At the lowest point in 1993 it made just 350,000 discs."We wanted to be the last company standing in the field of vinyl record production," says Mr Sterba.So when the resurgence of vinyl began around 2010, GZ was in a position to take advantage of it.Unlike most rivals, GZ still had the vinyl-making equipment and the expertise.Its successful diversification also gave it the cash to invest.Image caption The company has also seen a rising demand for picture discs Mr Sterba says: "Our competitors could buy machinery and materials, but the know-how is very hard to acquire."The firm's printing and packing capabilities give it another advantage over its rivals, he adds: "As well as producing the actual vinyl discs, GZ also makes the packaging, prints the artwork and any extras such as posters or booklet."One particularly tough job, he recalls, was producing a real metal zip on the cover of the reissued Rolling Stones' Sticky Fingers album.How vinyl records are made The original music, on tape or a digital file, is transferred to a diamond-tipped cutter This cuts a groove of the music into a steel disc coated in a layer of copper just 100 microns thick This master disc is then placed into a solution of nickel salt though which an electric current flows.This forms a layer of nickel on top of the copper The nickel layer is then peeled off, and has ridges that are a mirror image of the grooves on the master disk.This nickel plate forms the "stamper" that will imprint the vinyl Next the vinyl compound (a type of plastic) is heated to 160C, and the stamper is pressed into it with the weight of more than 100 tonnes, to produce one side of a vinyl record To keep up with demand, GZ Media's Czech factory now runs 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and employs 1,600 permanent workers.It's a fast-paced operation at every stage of the production process; from the initial stamping to the high-speed ballet of forklifts loading trucks for delivery.The company has invested $20m in equipment, building 12 new presses, but the old still runs alongside the new.Image caption GZ's Czech factory has a permanent workforce of 1,600 plus 400 seasonal workers Bright white, computer-controlled stations sit next to their huge, pale-green iron counterparts, still dripping oil into trays and buckets.GZ's revenues this year are expected to total $110m (83m), and are growing by 9-10% per year.Meanwhile, its vinyl output has tripled since 2010.For the industry as a whole, global sales of vinyl records are expected to reach $1bn in value this year.This may be just 6% of total music industry revenues but vinyl sales are now at a 25-year high.With most of its customers in North America, GZ recently bought a vinyl plant in Memphis, Tennessee, to supplement its Czech production.It has also opened a production facility in Ontario, Canada.Image caption Staff at the factory listen to the records to test them GZ still makes albums for small indie bands - the punk and metal bands that kept the company going in the 1990s, but now it also works with massive global stars."We'll still press 100 records for a small metal band," says Mr Sterba, "but we're also pressing 100,000 for U2.""As for the future," he says, "we're concentrating on making a success of our plants in North America.But in the longer term, we think manufacturing in Asia and preferably Japan [as well], is the right thing to do."This is the third story in a new series called Connected Commerce, which every week highlights companies around the world that are successfully exporting, and trading beyond their home market.Yet, while vinyl sales are growing, some who buy the records don't actually play them.Last year a BBC/ICM poll found 48% of those questioned said they'd never played the vinyl they'd bought and 7% said they didn't even own a turntable.These fans buy a vinyl album for the "feel" of owning a physical object and for the artwork that often comes with it - but they never actually play it.Image caption Staff at GZ had to add a real metal zip to the cover of the Rolling Stones album Sticky Fingers While vinyl sales are growing, they remain tiny compared with their 1980s heyday, says Paul Lee, a music industry expert at accountancy group Deloitte."Vinyl's first and biggest peak was back in the 80s when a billion records, just albums were sold per year.This year we're expecting about 40 million, so it's about one 25th... so it is nothing like that we had back in the 80s."Image caption The company can make vinyl records in any colour Mr Lee adds: "The reality is vinyl is a lovely product, it's also very difficult to consume compared to just tapping in the name of a song on a smart phone... so we would expect the market to be approaching a peak."Yet with music giant Sony announcing earlier this year that it was to re-open its vinyl manufacturing plant in Japan for the first time since 1989, it doesn't look like the vinyl revival is coming to an end any time soon.
The problem facing Trump's China probe:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Trade tensions will be top of mind during US President Donald Trump's visit to China When US President Donald Trump visits China, one subject high on the agenda will be the sweeping trade investigation of Chinese policies that he ordered in August.The White House said it would probe practices that encourage the theft of intellectual property from US businesses - a long-simmering source of tension in the US, Europe and elsewhere.The Chinese government has said the inquiry was a "serious concern" and has warned that it will not sit back if the US takes actions it deems unfair.But one of the biggest challenges for Mr Trump's investigation comes from his own country.Since the White House started its inquiry, a slew of US business groups have submitted formal comments describing their concerns.But just six companies have proved willing to come forward with complaints, according to the public record of comments.Many of them are smaller businesses describing already known incidents.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The US could risk a trade war with one of its biggest trade partners Analysts say companies are hesitant to put at risk their access to one of the world's biggest markets by speaking out.But the decision to stay quiet has consequences: it is likely to limit the administration's ability to build a strong case against China.It may hurt the ability to identify effective remedies, while also making unilateral action more appealing to the White House."It's going to be a huge problem that companies are unwilling to provide specifics because it's going to be very difficult for the United States government to take effective action," says Lee Branstetter, a professor of economics and public policy at Carnegie Mellon University.Intellectual property The White House's focus on intellectual property theft in China follows years of concerns in the US, Europe and elsewhere over counterfeit goods, piracy, hacking, patent violations and other forms of theft.The Commission on the Theft of American Intellectual Property estimates that the annual cost to the US economy from counterfeit goods, pirated software and theft of trade secrets is between $225bn and $600bn.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption General Motors, which has opened factories in China, is among those working with local partners In recent years, the US says the Chinese government has encouraged some of those practices as part of its economic and national security strategies.Those involve state-backed enterprises and are focused on boosting certain industries such as aerospace, robotics and biotech.The US inquiry asked for information about topics including policies that pressure companies to share information with local business partners; opaque approval processes; and possible cyber espionage backed by the government.But previous US efforts to tackle the issue have been hindered by the hesitance of major companies to speak out, says Phil Levy, senior fellow at the Chicago Council on Global Affairs."This has been the problem," says Mr Levy, who served as a trade economist under former President George W Bush."If you want to say China has these violations and we are acting in response to that... you need to have that fairly well documented.And to do that you need to have the co-operation of the companies involved."Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Beijing has promoted renewable energy and US firms in the industry have been among the few to speak out Edwin Rogers is co-founder of Bonumose Biochem, a small Virginia-based start-up that was one of the six companies that shared its complaints.In his case, he says scientists in China filed a copycat patent for a process of making a healthy rare sugar - technology that he believes his company had purchased rights to after acquiring a firm last year.The scientists worked in the US for that firm, he says.They are affiliated with the Chinese Academy of Sciences, a government-backed entity, and have political connections.He says he felt a "duty" to come forward and hopes his story will help the White House craft a response.China's response The office of the US Trade Representative, which is leading the inquiry, did not respond to requests for comment about the investigation.China maintains it has responded to concerns, pointing to laws that forbid intellectual property theft, success by western companies in Chinese courts, and its own efforts to address cyber crime.In September, after the Trump administration launched its investigation, it announced a four-month crackdown focused on intellectual property and foreign investors.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption China says it has made strides to prevent intellectual property theft In comments submitted to US investigators, Chinese organisations told the US that decisions to establish joint ventures and share technology are voluntary agreements between private companies.They cast government initiatives, such as Made in China 2025, as "promotional" - not mandatory - programmes.Some US businesses also defend China's approach.William Mansfield is the intellectual property director at Abro Industries, a 25-person company based in Indiana that makes products such as glue and tape for sale overseas.He says he has spent years fighting against counterfeiters in China - and has figured out successful ways of using China's system, like asking for help from local authorities instead of immediately pursuing a lawsuit.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption President Trump has reportedly told advisors he wants "tariffs" He says US companies often don't understand how China works and unfairly blame problems on the government."I've just never seen anything that would lead me to believe it's anything other than individual counterfeiters acting to maximise their profit and not really caring about the rules," he says.What next?Many US analysts expect the White House to find fault with Beijing; pointing to the growing corporate involvement of the Communist Party and rules that require foreign companies in some sectors to use local partners.But it is unclear what the White House might do after that.The US could work with the Chinese government, collaborate with other countries to craft a response, bring a complaint in an international forum such as the World Trade Organisation, or take unilateral action.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The US has long had concerns over Chinese intellectual property theft and hacking That risks triggering a trade war but President Trump - who has repeatedly attacked China while dismissing international pacts - may be more open to that approach, Mr Levy says.The White House China's strategy remains unclear as different advisors appear to promote clashing approaches, he adds.Investigation of Chinese steel companies, for example, has not led to action.The White House also wants Chinese cooperation as it responds to missile tests from North Korea."It's hard to puzzle out what they're doing," Mr Levy says.Business concerns US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross says he expects addressing the issue to take time.But he says the US is looking for immediate deals, like ones struck between Boeing and Saudi Arabia, as a sign of good faith.Many businesses remain worried the White House could damage the US relationship with China to satisfy isolationists among President Trump's supporters.Erin Ennis, of the US China Business Council, says about 20% of its members have faced pressure in China to transfer key technology in recent years, but adds that they also report that the environment in China is improving.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Chinese President Xi Jinping visited a US Boeing plant in 2015.Aerospace is one of the industries the Chinese government has promoted She urges the administration to focus on specific changes in China, rather than simply imposing penalties, such as sanctions.For example, China could stop making a distinction between foreign and domestic companies, she says.Even without testimony from major companies, associations like hers have provided enough suggestions for the White House to work with the Chinese government, says Ms Ennis.But Prof Branstetter says the US will need to take stronger, more targeted action if it expects intellectual property thefts to stop.He says it doesn't have the information to do so now and he has doubts about this administration's abilities to craft an adroit response."It's easy to see this going badly," he says.
What happens to Mexicans returned from US?:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption There were protests over the threats to deport undocumented young migrants from the US Hundreds of thousands of Mexicans are deported to their home country each year from the United States.The Trump administration's pressure on undocumented young migrants - the so-called "Dreamers" - could mean many more coming home.But what are so many returning people going to do?Starting a new life in Mexico has been harder than expected for Reyna del Rio, a 29 year old who spent most of her childhood in South Carolina before returning to Mexico.Like many returning bilingual Mexicans, she was able to get a job at a call centre.Tough returning But the long hours and angry customers started to take a toll on her.A new initiative by Mexico's public education ministry, known by the Spanish acronym SEP, could be her ticket to a stable career."If you work at a call centre you do things repeatedly.I don't see it as enjoying my job," said Ms del Rio.Image caption Reyna del Rio has returned to find work in Mexico, having left for the US as a young child "I would like to teach and learn new skills.I would like to pass on what I've learned because I think it will fulfil me more than just doing customer service."She is part of a group of young deportees and voluntary returnees who are in the process of applying for English teaching positions through SEP.It's a project trying to make the most of their English language skills.For more than 600 new teaching jobs, the education ministry adapted the application process to encourage repatriated Mexicans.There were changes to make the positions more accessible to returnees, who often face bureaucratic roadblocks related to their time outside of Mexico.The goal is twofold.It aims to provide employment for young deportees and help Mexico reach its goal of being bilingual - in Spanish and English - in 20 years."We made that clause flexible particularly for repatriated Mexicans, because the idea is that no one who might have the possibility of being an English teacher should be left without the chance of doing so," said Mario Chavez Campos, director of the general directorate of higher education for professionals in education, an office within SEP. 'Dreamers' sent back As well as those deported, there are others returning by their own choice, although often forced by the lack of higher education and job opportunities.This was the case for Ms del Rio, who left South Carolina at the age of 18, hoping to access better educational opportunities in Mexico, when she couldn't get financial aid as an undocumented student in the US.Image copyright Reuters Image caption Prototypes for the proposed border wall between the US and Mexico When she arrived in 2009, she barely remembered the country she left when she was five years old.But she persevered."We have the culture of never giving up," Reyna said of her fellow "Dreamers"."We have always had to fight for many things."These undocumented young people, who might have come to the US as children, are feeling vulnerable.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Looking through from Mexico into New Mexico in the US President Donald Trump decided in September to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals programme, known as DACA.This allowed young undocumented immigrants to work legally in the US and be temporarily shielded from deportation.About 800,000 youths received protected status under DACA, and more than 600,000 were from Mexico.Many could soon face deportation as their DACA permits expire in the upcoming months.Retraining as teachers Mexico has pledged to support returning deportees, with initiatives to help them access employment, health and education.But many of these still remain promises.So far 80% of the returned deportees trying to get a job as an English teacher through SEP have had difficulty meeting requirements, primarily for reasons related to their time spent outside of Mexico, according to Israel Concha, founder of the New Comienzos group which support people returning to Mexico.More from Global education Ideas for the Global education series?Get in touch."They have to understand it's an emergency," said Mr Concha, a deportee himself."Tomorrow if thousands of people get deported because there is no immigration reform or there is nothing for DACA, we need to be ready and the federal government is not ready."To be eligible for teaching, all candidates must have their US schooling recognised in Mexico, pass a test in Spanish grammar and Mexican history, and earn a college degree.The scheme intends to break down the barriers returnees face in completing these steps, but there are still discussions about how to achieve this.Mexican dream Not all bilingual deportees have the training required to become a teacher, so the SEP is brainstorming other ways to incorporate Dreamers into English language lessons at public schools, such as through conversation clubs or as teacher's assistants."This call for English teachers is just the first step," said Mr Chavez Campos of the public education ministry."From there, we have a list of the dreamers and deportees who are interested in participating in the national English strategy."Image copyright Reuters Image caption What opportunities are there for those returning to Mexico?He says this is Mexico's "rapid response to the migration policies of the US".Working as an English teacher would mean a new start for many of Mexico's deportees.If selected to be an English teacher for SEP, Ms del Rio would receive much more than the minimum wage with a starting salary of about $1,100 (830) per month, plus benefits and holidays.Unlike working in a call centre, an English teaching position would provide a long-term career."We need more opportunities where we can have a job where we can retire," said Mr Concha."That's what we are looking for: the actual American dream in Mexico.""The Mexican government wants to make Mexico bilingual in 20 years," said Mr Concha."What better place to start than the dreamers that are coming back?"
