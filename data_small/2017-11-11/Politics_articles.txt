Lawmakers ask whether Trump's CIA watchdog pick misled Congress:::::Two former CIA employees are accusing the Trump administration's choice for CIA chief watchdog of being less than candid when he told Congress he didn't know about any active whistleblower complaints against him.Members of the Senate Intelligence Committee asked Christopher Sharpley, the current acting inspector general who's in line for the permanent job, about complaints that he and other managers participated in retaliation against CIA workers who alerted congressional committees and other authorities about alleged misconduct."I'm unaware of any open investigations on me, the details of any complaints about me," Sharpley testified at his confirmation hearing last month.He said he might not know because there is a process providing confidentiality to anyone who wants to file a complaint against government officials, who often are individually named in cases against management."No action or conclusions of wrongdoing have been made about my career or anything that I've done," Sharpley added.The committee is still considering Sharpley's nomination.Sens.Chuck Grassley, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and Ron Wyden say they find it hard to believe Sharpley didn't know about the complaints when he testified.They said one of the open cases is being investigated by the Department of Homeland Security's internal watchdog.They say that inspector general's office, which is looking into the CIA matter to avoid a conflict of interest, asked Sharpley in January for documents.The office asked to interview Sharpley on Oct. 12.Sharpley's office said he wouldn't be available until after Oct. 17 -- the day he testified to senators."How is it possible that he could have been unaware of any open investigations against him at the time he testified?"Grassley, R-Iowa, and Wyden, D-Ore., asked in a letter they wrote to Senate intelligence committee leaders.GOP Sen. Richard Burr of North Carolina, the Senate Intelligence Committee chairman, had planned a vote on Sharpley's nomination last month.It has been delayed while the committee holds discussions about the whistleblower cases, according to someone familiar with the matter.The person wasn't authorized to discuss the issue and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.CIA spokesman Ryan Trapani defended Sharpley's five-year tenure at the agency as deputy and then acting inspector general.He said Sharpley has 36 years of investigative and law enforcement experience and created two inspectors general offices from scratch within the federal government."Whether there are any complaints or investigations regarding Mr. Sharpley is not something we could confirm or comment on," Trapani said."What we can say is that Mr. Sharpley has had a sterling five-year career at CIA and there have never been any findings of wrongdoing or misconduct of any sort by Mr. Sharpley during his tenure here."Documents provided to the AP by attorneys representing two former CIA employees challenge Sharpley's testimony.They point to discord over several years within the CIA's inspector general's office, an independent unit created in 1989 to oversee the spy agency.It's charged with stopping waste, fraud and mismanagement and promoting accountability through audits, inspections, investigations and reviews of CIA programs and operations -- overt and covert.John Tye, executive director of Whistleblower Aid, who is representing two of the complainants alleging retaliation by Sharpley and other senior managers, said some discord in the office stemmed from a case several years ago involving kickbacks from contractors.The Justice Department announced in 2013 that three CIA contractors had agreed to pay the United States $3 million to settle allegations that they provided meals, entertainment, gifts and tickets to sporting events to CIA employees and outside consultants to help get business steered their way.The criminal case fell apart after intelligence employees discovered that evidence in the case was being fabricated and witness statements were being altered.These employees secretly went around Sharpley and then CIA Inspector General David Buckley and contacted the U.S. attorney's office.Tye said that after learning about the falsified evidence, a guilty plea in the case, which had already been accepted by a judge, was voided at the request of the U.S. attorney.Afterward, leaders at the CIA inspector's office asked auditors across town at the Federal Housing Finance Agency to look into their in-house matter.It's unclear why that agency -- a place where Sharpley previously worked -- was chosen to handle the matter.Results of that investigation haven't been revealed.In an Oct. 30 letter to the Senate Intelligence Committee, Tye said that during the FHFA probe, Sharpley improperly "interrupted witness interviews, walking in special designated conference rooms to learn the names of the whistleblowers within his staff" who reported evidence tampering to outside oversight bodies.Tye said no one within the CIA inspector general's office was prosecuted or disciplined for evidence tampering."Sharpley successfully identified some, but not all, of the whistleblowers," Tye said.He said retaliation involved forcing administrative leave, security clearance decisions and other harassment.One complainant is Jonathan Kaplan, 59, a former special agent and investigator in the CIA's inspector general's office who spent 33 years at the agency.He claims that before he went to talk to staff at the House Intelligence Committee about the contactors case, he queried a computer in his office to refresh his memory on the details.He later received a formal letter of warning for searching the computer system.That ultimately prevented him from renewing his security clearance, effectively ending his government career.He contacted an inspector general overseeing all 17 U.S. intelligence agencies and received a letter earlier this year acknowledging that office was handling the case.A second complainant is Andrew Bakaj, 35, who worked in the CIA inspector general's office as a special agent from 2012 to 2015.He was instrumental in developing agency regulations governing whistleblower reprisal investigations.When some of his colleagues came to him to allege misconduct in the office, he referred them to the same inspector general Kaplan went to.It was an office Bakaj and his colleagues had been told not to cooperate with.He, too, searched on the office computer on a matter he was questioned about and had worked on as part of an investigation conducted by the inspector general that oversees all U.S. intelligence agencies.Two weeks later, superiors summoned him and put him on paid leave that lasted 15 months.He then resigned.
Harassment case puts Democratic Senate candidate in California under spotlight:::::SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- News that a sitting California senator is being investigated for sexual harassment against a young female employee has put a fresh spotlight on a legislative leader this week as he begins a bid against the state's first female U.S. senator.Senate President Pro Tem Kevin de Leon, the Democratic leader of the state Senate, heads the committee in charge of human resources employees who handle workplace complaints.De Leon also rents a room in the Sacramento home of Democratic Sen. Tony Mendoza, the man accused of improper conduct, de Leon spokesman Anthony Reyes said.Mendoza is accused of repeatedly inviting a young woman who worked in his office through a fellowship program to the house, although she never went.Mendoza said in a statement that he would never knowingly abuse his authority, though his statement didn't address the allegation that he invited her to his home.De Leon said through spokesmen that he did not know about the complaint against Mendoza or his alleged invitations to the young woman.De Leon's allies have downplayed the two senators' relationship.But De Leon's handling of impropriety at the Capitol will likely play a role in his U.S. Senate bid against Sen. Dianne Feinstein, one of California's most prominent women in politics and a powerful U.S. senator."It really does feel like we're at this inflection point with sex harassment allegations where suddenly they're being taken seriously," said Kim Nalder, director of the Project for an Informed Electorate at California State University-Sacramento."It's hard to imagine that Kevin de Leon's bid will be completely untarnished by this revelation that someone close to him was accused of this kind of misbehavior."The latest allegations against Mendoza, which come after nearly 150 women signed a letter three weeks ago calling harassment pervasive in the capital culture, shed further light on the Senate's murky processes for investigating its own members.After the initial outcry about harassment in mid-October, De Leon and Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon immediately pledged to review the Legislature's policies.De Leon hired an outside investigator, and the Senate asked women to speak to her.De Leon said at the time that "everyone deserves a workplace free of fear, harassment and sexual misbehavior."That statement was made before the allegations about Mendoza became public.A month earlier, the Senate began investigating Mendoza, Senate Secretary Danny Alvarez confirmed.A former employee of Mendoza's complained to the Senate Rules Committee in September that the senator had repeatedly behaved inappropriately toward a young woman who worked for him through the Sacramento State fellows program, said Micha Liberty, a lawyer for the employee.That month, the employee and two others in Mendoza's office were fired.The Senate and Liberty dispute the timing of the firings relative to the complaint.Mendoza and Alvarez said the firings had nothing to do with the complaints.Liberty, though, said her client made clear she was accusing Mendoza of sexual harassment toward the fellow, and she was forced to sign a confidentiality agreement when she was fired.Liberty would not name her client and did not provide a copy of the confidentiality letter.Mendoza said he did not know about the complaint until the he was contacted by the Sacramento Bee.A spokesman for the university, Brian Blomster, said the university did not know either.The Senate's policy says the deputy secretary for human resources will meet with people named in complaints or those who may have knowledge, and will attempt to treat investigations as confidential.Alvarez did not directly answer a question about when, if ever, de Leon would be notified about an investigation in his role as head of the Senate Rules Committee."As the process requires, the Senate will take action once Senate Rules completes their investigation," he said.De Leon's spokespeople declined to make him available for an interview with The Associated Press on allegations of Capitol harassment despite repeated requests, including on Friday.They did not answer Friday when asked if de Leon had spoken to Mendoza since news of the allegations against him broke or if he planned to strip Mendoza of his committee chairmanship.Mendoza heads the Senate Banking, Insurance and Financial Institutions Committee and sits on other key committees.De Leon campaign spokesman Roger Salazar pointed to his work on gender equity and fighting campus sexual assault as evidence of his record on women's issues."We're not going to be able to stop people from being shameless in trying to play politics with this issue," Salazar said.Feinstein's allies, though, said the allegations at the Capitol will hurt de Leon."De Leon is challenging a feminist icon," said Nathan Ballard, a Democratic strategist backing Feinstein."There is now a dark cloud of impropriety surrounding de Leon that won't make him very popular with Sen. Feinstein's base of Democratic women."It's hard to discern the full scope of sexual harassment allegations at the Capitol because lawmakers shield investigations from disclosure.The Senate and Assembly both rejected requests for information from the AP about how many sexual harassment investigations resulted in discipline since 2012, citing privacy concerns.The Senate reported that in that time it has investigated at least six sexual harassment complaints, although it's unclear if that tally includes Mendoza.When complaints are resolved, employees who make them may never get documentation spelling out the results.Instead, the Deputy Secretary for Human Resources "will orally report the findings and conclusions to the employee," according to the Senate harassment policy.
Trump sidesteps questions on Roy Moore amid sexual misconduct allegations:::::President Trump is deflecting questions about whether Alabama GOP Senate nominee Roy Moore should quit the race amid sexual-misconduct allegations, in a contest that has divided the Republican Party.Trump, who has been traveling in Asia over the past week, said Saturday that he's been too busy reading documents and hasn't had time to catch up on television news coverage about Moore."So I have not seen very much about him, about it," Trump told reporters flying with him on Air Force One from Danang to Hanoi, in Vietnam.I havent been able to devote very much time to it.Trump also referred to a written statement that White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders read to reporters after The Washington Post reported that an Alabama woman said Moore had sexual contact with her when she was 14 and he was a 32-year-old assistant district attorney.The White House statement said Trump believes Moore will "do the right thing and step aside" if the decades-old allegations are true.In the recent GOP primary for the Alabama Senate seat, Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell backed Republican Luther Stranger, appointed to the office when GOP Sen. Jeff Sessions became U.S. attorney general.However, Alabama voters picked Moore, an outspoken conservative Christian and former state Supreme Court judge.Moore also got strong backing from Steve Bannon, the former Trump White House political strategist, who recently returned to influential conservative news outlet Breitbart News.Bannon said Friday night, after The Post story about Moore, I think youre going to find in the mainstream media, either tonight or tomorrow some pretty interesting stories about how that information got dropped and who paid for it and who weaponized it.He added: "Is it just a coincidence that the Bezos Amazon Washington Post did the Billy Bush hit?And they did the hit on Judge Moore."Moore denied the allegation, saying Friday during an interview with conservative radio host Sean Hannity that the alleged encounter with the 14-year-old female "never happened."On Saturday, in Moores first public appearance since the allegations were reported, he again denied the sexual misconduct and that he supplied alcohol to an alleged teen victim.Why now?Moore asked about the roughly 40-year-old allegations.The Democrats know the importance of this election.They see it a prelude to the 2018 races.They are desperate.This is a prime example of fake news.Three other women also told the Post that Moore had sexual contact with them when they were teenagers.Asked when he would decide whether Moore did what he has been accused of, given that four women have come forward, Trump said: "Honestly, I'd have to look at it and I have to see."The allegations have sparked a wave of concern among GOP officials in Washington who are anxious about their slim majority in the Senate.But they have produced little more than a collective shrug from many Republicans in Alabama, which holds a special General Election on Dec. 12 to fill the Sessions seat.Trump, who won the White House on a campaign critical of the Republican establishment in Washington, has nevertheless pledged to campaign for Moore.McConnell, R-Ky., and other GOP senators have said Moore should step aside if the reports are true.In addition, the National Republican Senatorial Committee, the GOPs Senate campaign group, on Friday ended its fundraising agreement with Moore.Also on Friday, senators Mike Lee and Steve Daines rescinded their endorsements of Moore.Trump suggested this weekend that he would have more to say on the matter after he returns to the White House next week."I'll stick with my statement for now," he said."But I'll have further comment as we go down the road.I have to get back into the country to see what's happening."The Associated Press contributed to this report.
McCain hits Trump for failing to mention Vietnam's human rights violations:::::Arizona GOP Sen. John McCain, a Vietnam war prisoner, on Saturday criticized President Trump for failing to mention Vietnam's ongoing human rights violations while visiting Da Nang.@POTUS in #Danang & no mention of human rights - Sad, tweeted McCain, who as a Navy pilot was shot down over Hanoi in 1967 and remained a prisoner of war in Vietnam for roughly the next six years.Trump this weekend, as part of his 12-day Asia tour, praised the Vietnamese people and their leaders for reform efforts, as the country since the end of the war in the mid-1970s has moved away from communist to a more socialist nation.Your people are doing a spectacular job, Trump said Saturday alongside Vietnam President Tran Dai Quang at a state banquet in Hanoi, the nations capital.I toured Vietnam today.I was through the streets of Hanoi, and it's incredible to see.I would like to congratulate you, Mr. President, on an outstanding job.McCain's tweet is the latest in back-and-forth between the Arizona senator and Trump that appeared to start in earnest when the president challenged the senator's status as a war hero during the campaign.The nonprofit group Human Rights Watch has Vietnam on its list of roughly 200 countries that it considers failing to provide citizens with sufficient human rights such as free speech and freedom of religious beliefs.Vietnams human rights record remains dire in all areas, the group says on its website.The Communist Party maintains a monopoly on political power and allows no challenge to its leadership.The police use torture and beatings to extract confessions.

Trump: Putin told me face-to-face 'I didn't meddle' in elections:::::Russian President Vladimir Putin is steadfastly denying that his country meddled in the 2016 White House race, President Trump told reporters Saturday.Trump and Putin briefly spoke several times while in Vietnam for a regional economic summit, as part of the U.S. president's 12-day trip to Asia."He said he didn't meddle, Trump afterward told reporters, aboard Air Force One.He said he didn't meddle.I asked him again.You can only ask so many times.I just asked him again.He said he absolutely did not meddle in our election.He did not do what they are saying he did."Putins words contradict U.S. intelligence community claims that Russia indeed tried to influence the election's outcome -- amid evidence that suggests Russian operatives hacked emails from Democratic Party leaders and tried to sway U.S. voters by purchasing ads of social media."Every time he sees me he says, 'I didn't do that,' and I really believe that when he tells me that, he means it.But he says, 'I didn't do that.'I think he is very insulted by it, which is not a good thing for our country," also said Trump, who deflected answering a direct question about whether he believed Putin's denial.Congress and Justice Department special counsel Robert Mueller are each conducting investigations into whether Trump associates colluded with Russian in the 2016 campaign.Arizona Sen. John McCain, the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, slammed Trump for his comments.President Trump today stated that he believed Vladimir Putin is being sincere when he denies Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and reiterated that he hopes to cooperate with Russia in Syria, McCain said Saturday.There's nothing America First about taking the word of a KGB colonel over that of the American intelligence community.McCain also said, There's no principled realism in cooperating with Russia to prop up the murderous Assad regime, which remains the greatest obstacle to a political solution that would bring an end to the bloodshed in Syria.Vladimir Putin does not have America's interests at heart.To believe otherwise is not only naive but also places our national security at risk.Trump and Putin were in together in Danang, Vietnam, for the 21-nation Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation.They have no plans to hold a formal meeting during Trumps five-nation trip the concludes this weekend.Trump told reporters on the flight from Danang to Hanoi that he and Putin largely discussed Syria in their "two or three very short conversations."At about the same time, the Kremlin issued a joint statement for both presidents about the countries successful and continuing efforts to defeat the Islamic State terror group, or ISIS, in Syria, the caliphates last stronghold.In Syrias years-long civil war, Putin has backed the regime of Syrian leader Bashar al Assad, while Western allies have supported his ousters."I would rather have him get out of Syria, Trump told reporters.If we had a relationship with Russia, that would be a good thing.In fact, it would be a great thing, not a bad thing.Trump declined to comment on the recent allegations about decades-old sexual misconduct by Roy Moore, the GOP nominee for a U.S Senate seat in Alabama.The president said that he hasnt been following the news closely enough to offer an opinion.The Associated Press contributed to this report.
Trump, Putin reportedly agree to defeat ISIS in Syria:::::President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin issued a joint statement on Saturday vowing to continue the fight against ISIS in Syria until the militants are completely defeated, Reuters reported, citing the Kremlin.The statement was released after the two leaders chatted briefly during the APEC summit in Danang, Vietnam, Reuters reported, citing the Kremlin.The statement reportedly said both Washington and Moscow agree that there is no military solution to the conflict and both countries expressed a commitment to Damascus sovereignty.The two leaders chatted on Saturday while they walked to a family photograph at the summit and donned matching silk button-down shirts the day before, holding true to the tradition of wearing local attire at annual display of cooperation among world leaders.The White House and the Trump administration earlier appeared to downplay Trump's possible meetings with Putin during the summit.White House press secretary Sarah Sanders blamed a scheduling conflict for why the two would not have a formal meeting.But she said it was possible and likely that they would have a less formal encounter.U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson told reporters in Beijing on Thursday that there was no reason to schedule a formal meeting between Trump and Putin if the two countries are unable to make significant progress on issues including Syria and Ukraine."The view has been if the two leaders are going to meet, is there something sufficiently substantive to talk about that would warrant a formal meeting," he said.It was reported on Thursday that Washington and Moscow were nearing an agreement on Syria for how they hope to resolve the Arab countrys civil war once ISIS is defeated.The U.S.-Russian agreement that was being discussed focused on three elements, officials told The Associated Press: "deconfliction" between the U.S. and Russian militaries, reducing violence in the civil war and reinvigorating U.N.-led peace talks.The officials weren't authorized to discuss the deliberations and requested anonymity.The Associated Press contributed to this report
Roy Moore accuser worked for Clinton campaign as interpreter, reports say:::::One of the women accusing Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore of sexual impropriety reportedly worked as a sign language interpreter for Hillary Clintons presidential campaign, a new report claims.Deborah Wesson Gibson, who told The Washington Post that she briefly dated Moore when she was 17 and he was 34, founded the language interpreting company, Signs of Excellence, and has worked for a number of democratic campaigns, according to Alabama Local News.The companys Facebook page shows Gibson working for and posing with several Democrats at political rallies including 2016 presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, former Vice President Joe Biden, former Sen. Patrick Murphy, D-Fla., and Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla. ROY MOORE SEXUAL ASSAULT ALLEGATIONS CONDEMNED BY GROWING NUMBER OF REPUBLICAN LAWMAKERS In the expose published by The Washington Post, Gibson said she first met Moore in 1981 when he spoke to her high school civics class.He reportedly asked her out and the pair went on to date for a few months.She recalled her mother saying she was the luckiest girl in the world that Moore wanted to date her, noting that he had this godlike, almost deity status in Gadsen, Ala., The Post reported.WHO IS ROY MOORE?Gibson alleged that she and Moore only kissed twice and said in retrospect, shes glad nothing bad happened.As a mother of daughters, I realize that our age difference at that time made our dating inappropriate, Gibson told The Washington Post.Three other women in the report also accused Moore of sexually inappropriate behavior when they were teenagers, including one woman who alleges she was 14 at the time.Moores campaign labeled the allegations baseless and the very definition of fake news.
Roy Moore says sexual misconduct allegations 'based on a lie':::::Alabama GOP Senate candidate Roy Moore said Friday that allegations that he had sexual contact with underage girls in the late 1970s and early 1980s was "completely false" and "based on a lie supported by innuendo."Moore made the comments in an extensive new written statement and in an interview on the "Sean Hannity Radio Show."On Thursday, a Washington Post report alleged that Moore initiated sexual contact with a 14-year-old girl in 1979, when he was a 32-year-old assistant district attorney in Gadsden, Ala.The report also included claims by three other women that Moore asked them out on dates -- and in two cases, kissed them -- when they were between the ages of 16 and 18.The legal age of consent in Alabama is 16."I have never provided alcohol to minors, and I have never engaged in sexual misconduct," said Moore in his statement, referencing a claim by one of the women that he gave her wine when she was below Alabama's legal drinking age, which is 19."As a father of a daughter and a grandfather of five granddaughters," Moore went on."I condemn the actions of any man who engages in sexual misconduct not just against minors but against any woman."In the radio interview with Hannity, Moore denied ever knowing Leigh Corfman, who told the Post he made sexual advances toward her when she was 14.However, he did not deny dating teenagers as young as 16."You understand this was 40 years ago," Moore said."And after my return from the military, I dated a lot of young ladies."When asked by Hannity if he dated teenagers when he was in his 30s, Moore said "It would have been out of my customary behavior," and added that he didn't "remember dating any girl without the permission of her mother."In his statement, Moore implored "the Washington Post, and everyone involved [in the story], to tell the truth."But on the radio, Moore said he was "sure in the next four weeks, they're gonna come out with another article."He also said that his campaign had "some evidence of collusion," but did not elaborate."I trust that the people of Alabama, who know my record after 40 years of public service, will vouch for my character and commitment to the rule of law," Moore's statement concluded.The allegations have caused an outcry from national Republican leaders, who have called on Moore to drop out of the race if the allegations are proven true.On Friday, the Senate GOP's campaign arm formally ended its fundraising agreement with Moore.The GOP's 2012 presidential nominee Mitt Romney condemned his colleagues' caveat -- only if the allegations are true."Innocent until proven guilty is for criminal convictions, not elections.I believe Leigh Corfman," Romney said."Her account is too serious to ignore.Moore is unfit for office and should step aside."However, the former state Supreme Court justice has emphatically refused to leave the race, telling Hannity if candidates step aside due to accusations, "you might as well not run, because when you run you're going to get allegations."Despite the allegations, Moore also has the support of several Republican officials in Alabama."Humphrey Bogart started dating Lauren Bacall when she was a teenager," said state Auditor Jim Ziegler, referring to the then-19-year-old actress.Paul Reynolds, Alabama's Republican National Committeeman, called it "a firestorm designed to shipwreck a campaign in Alabama.I think it's sinister."Fox News' Alex Pappas and the Associated Press contributed to this report.
GOP Senate campaign arm abandons Roy Moore following sexual allegations:::::The chief fundraising vehicle for Republican Senate campaigns on Friday severed its ties to Roy Moore, the party's nominee in Alabama's special election next month.The break with Moore came a day after The Washington Post reported allegations by four women who said Moore had pursued sexual relationships with them when they were teenagers.At the time, Moore was in his early 30s.According to new paperwork filed with the Federal Election Commission on Friday, the National Republican Senatorial Committee is no longer a part of a joint fundraising committee that includes Moore's campaign, the Alabama GOP and the Republican National Committee.Moore has denied the allegations against him, and his campaign on Thursday said the Post's report, which cited 30 sources, was "garbage," and "the very definition of fake news and intentional defamation."In Washington, Republican senators responded to the report with shock and dismay, telling reporters that if the claims were true, Moore should exit the race immediately.Moore's campaign did not immediately respond Friday to a request for comment about the NRSC's decision to abandon the race.As of 2 p.m.ET Friday afternoon, the RNC and the Alabama Republican Party both remained in the joint committee.
Here are the hurdles the GOP tax plans face:::::After the Senate plan's release Thursday, Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., voiced fears about the effect of broad cuts on the national debt.The budget resolution approved by Congress allows it to pass a plan that adds as much as $1.5 trillion to federal budget deficits over a decade.While the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has not scored the Senate plan, it estimated that an earlier version of the House bill would increase federal budget deficits by $1.7 trillion over 10 years.The current plans appear to come nowhere close to canceling out tax cuts with new revenue."I remain concerned over how the current tax reform proposals will grow the already staggering national debt by opting for short-term fixes while ignoring long-term problems for taxpayers and the economy," Flake, who will not run for re-election next year, said in a statement."We must achieve real tax reform crafted in a fiscally responsible manner."Along with Flake, Sens.Bob Corker, R-Tenn., and John McCain, R-Ariz., have expressed concerns about ballooning the national debt.Corker, who will also leave the Senate, has previously said he would not vote for a tax plan that adds "one penny" to the deficit.The CBO also projected that debt would rise to 97.1 percent of gross domestic product in 2027, up from 91.2 percent under current CBO projections.The forecast did not include the estimated effects of economic growth.Republicans argue that growth sparked by the bill will help to offset, or cancel out entirely, the budget shortfall caused by broad tax cuts.However, it is not clear if the tax cuts can spark the growth necessary to do so.Meanwhile, two other GOP senators called for more changes to the child tax credit to further reduce the burden on middle-class taxpayers.The Senate plan would increase the credit from $1,000 to $1,650.Sens.Marco Rubio, F-Fla., and Mike Lee, R-Utah, on Thursday called for a $2,000 credit."We continue to believe that the best way to provide real relief to working families is through a straightforward, significant, and permanent expansion of the child tax credit preferably doubling the credit to $2,000 per child and expanding its applicability to payroll taxes," they said in a statement."The Senate is not going to pass a bill that isn't clearly pro-family, so we look forward to working with our colleagues to get there."Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., has previously called for even deeper tax cuts.The GOP, which holds 52 seats in the Senate, is working on a tight margin to pass a bill.Republicans can only lose two votes.Meanwhile, in the House, Republicans can lose just 22 votes to still pass a plan.The proposal's fate in that chamber may hinge largely on how a bill treats state and local tax deductions.Many Republicans enough to sink legislation on their own represent districts in high-tax blue states, which benefit from the provision.They have expressed concerns about eliminating those deductions.The House bill changes the provisions to allow taxpayers in those states to deduct up to $10,000 of property taxes.The Senate bill scraps all state and local deductions.No GOP senators represent the states that benefit most from the deductions, like New York, California and New Jersey.If the House and Senate pass separate bills, they will have to reconcile them before approving a final bill.Agreeing on the state and local measures could prove contentious at that time in the negotiations.Republicans, who have long sought to trim corporate and individual taxes to spark economic growth, see passing a tax plan as critical to their electoral chances in the 2018 midterms.
De Blasio: Ending state and local tax deductions will be permanent:::::If Republican lawmakers are able to end state and local tax deductions in their tax-reform bill, Americans will "never see it again," New York Mayor Bill de Blasio told CNBC on Friday.The Senate GOP's tax plan, unveiled on Thursday, would eliminate federal deductions for state and local taxes.The House plan also calls for eliminating the deduction but allows a property tax deduction of up to $10,000.Tax analysts say the move could harm high-tax blue states, such as New York and California, where the state and local tax deduction is a major item."State and local deductibility has been in place since 1913.It has been something agreed upon by Democrats and Republicans throughout.Once it is gone, you'll never see it again," de Blasio told "Squawk Box."He added that if the provision is removed, at least 100 million Americans would be subject to double taxation."So, that puts downward pressure on state and local revenue," he said."The second problem is, the federal government then at any point can start raising the federal tax rate again.There's no prohibition," he said."So, you lose the protection for homeowners, for everyday people, for middle-class people."The Democratic mayor also says the U.S. needs higher growth rates, but the Republicans' tax bill is unlikely to facilitate that.Instead, growth comes from fixing our infrastructure, he said."Our infrastructure is falling apart," de Blasio said, and "we need a strong federal government."De Blasio was elected to a second term earlier this week, beating GOP state Assemblywoman Nicole Malliotakis and several third-party candidates.He is the first Democrat to win re-election as New York mayor since Ed Koch 32 years ago.When asked whether he would seek a third term like Mike Bloomberg, de Blasio said "oh, no.""I have differences with Michael Bloomberg and things I also really appreciate," he said."I think it was a mistake to go for a third.Two-term limit.The people chose it.The people were right."
Trump's CNN attacks may hobble legal case to block AT&T-Time Warner deal:::::President Donald Trump's broadsides against cable network CNN may complicate the U.S. government's legal case if it decides to block AT&T's deal to buy media company Time Warner, according to legal experts.Trump's repeated claims that CNN produces "fake news" and other criticisms of the network could hurt legitimate legal arguments the Department of Justice may use to show the deal gives the company too much power over media rivals and is bad for consumers."His comments have soiled the process," said John Kwoka, an economics professor at Northeastern University."If I were AT&T's lawyers I would certainly introduce them into the evidentiary record as meddling with what is really a law enforcement process."The fate of AT&T's $85.4 billion deal to buy Time Warner, hatched in October 2016, looks set to end up in court as the two sides have so far failed to agree on what conditions AT&T needs to meet in order to gain antitrust approval.Justice Department staff have recommended that AT&T sell either its DirecTV unit or Time Warner's Turner Broadcasting unit, which includes news company CNN, a government official told Reuters on Thursday, on the grounds that a combined company would raise costs for rival entertainment distributors and stifle innovation.AT&T chief executive Randall Stephenson said on Thursday he would not sell CNN to win antitrust approval and would fight the government in court if the two sides could not reach an agreement."If we feel like litigation is a better outcome then we will litigate," Stephenson told the New York Times DealBook conference on Thursday.He said the company had been ready to go to court the day the deal was announced in October 2016.
A Middle-Class Tax Cut? It Depends Who and Where You Are:::::Republicans promised a middle-class tax cut.So far, they have created mostly middle-class confusion.Both the evolving House bill and the emerging Senate plan would slash taxes for businesses and many wealthy individuals.What they would mean for the middle class, however, is less clear.The plans feature a spider web of intersecting and offsetting changes to the tax code that many taxpayers and even many tax accountants are struggling to untangle.This much is clear: Either version of the bill would be bad news for residents of high-tax, high-cost states, most of which tend to elect Democrats.Both bills would eliminate the deduction for state and local income and sales taxes not a big deal in low-tax states such as Florida and Texas, but a potentially huge difference for many taxpayers in high-tax California and New York.More from The New York Times: Cars Lose the Spare Tire for a Leaner Ride, but It Could Cost You Legislator Targets Tech Perks in Baltimore County District Uber Must Treat Drivers as Employees, U.K. Tribunal Rules The Senate bill would go further by also eliminating the deduction for state and local property taxes.That would be especially hard on states such as New Jersey that have high housing costs and that rely heavily on property taxes to fund their governments.(States won by Hillary Clinton in 2016 accounted for two-thirds of state and local tax deductions in 2015.They accounted for half of total income.)Michael Gottlieb, a 32-year-old health care lawyer who lives with his wife and two children in Fair Lawn, N.J., said he believed that his family would pay more in taxes based on the proposals being floated."You add all of this up and I am taking a hit," he said."I don't know if it is a drastic hit, but I am coming out behind, not ahead."His property tax and mortgage interest combined total $24,000 a year, while he estimates his state income tax would total another $10,000, for a total of $34,000 in itemized deductions.But under the new tax system, he would probably take only the standard deduction, which is $24,000 for a married couple filing jointly.Taxpayers across the country were making similar calculations this week.Most analysts agreed that the tax bill would cut taxes for the middle class on average, but would raise them on millions of families.A New York Times analysis this week found that the original version of the House plan would raise taxes on nearly half of middle-class families by 2026.Other independent estimates likewise showed that a significant minority of middle-income taxpayers would pay more under the House plan than they would under current law.That conclusion posed a political problem for Republicans, who have repeatedly promised a middle-class tax cut.Some Republicans, including Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, criticized the House bill for doing too little to benefit families.The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, promised over the weekend that "nobody in the middle class is going to pay more" under the Senate plan.The Senate bill the full text of which was released Thursday probably falls short of that promise.But some economists said the bill would most likely be better for the middle class on average than the House bill.The Senate version keeps most of the provisions of the House bill that would have helped middle-class families, such as the doubling of the standard deduction, and would make others, such as the child tax credit, more generous.It would also preserve some tax breaks that the House bill initially would have eliminated, including a deduction for medical expenses and a tax credit for families who adopt children.Some of those provisions, including the adoption credit, had been restored by the House Ways and Means Committee, which approved a revised version of the bill on Thursday.Still, the tax cuts in the Senate bill would probably be modest for most middle-class families, especially compared with the far larger tax breaks for businesses and some high-income individuals."The tax cut will still be a large windfall for very high-income people and a very small tax cut for low- and middle-income families," said Elaine Maag, who studies tax and spending policy for the Urban Institute.Tax preparers across the country said they were fielding nervous calls from clients wondering how the changes would affect them.Caitlin Campbell, president of Tower Financial Partners in Colorado Springs, said many of her clients had been excited about the prospect of tax cuts until they began to hear details.The House bill would increase the tax credits given to families with children, but also eliminate the personal exemption given to every taxpayer.Those offsetting provisions would leave some larger families worse off."They are surprised," Ms. Campbell said."They thought it was going to be a good deal.They thought it was going to reduce their taxes, and they are surprised that they might not do as well."That kind of uncertainty could pose political challenges for Republicans as they try to round up the 50 votes needed to pass the bill in the Senate.Vanessa Williamson, a political scientist at the Brookings Institution who has studied public opinion on taxation, said the recent Republican approach to tax overhaul differed sharply from the tax cuts passed under President George W. Bush.The Bush tax cuts were simple to explain, easy to quantify and lowered taxes for just about everybody, she noted.This time, the Republican approach is much less simple."People are relatively risk-averse," Ms. Williamson said."So if there's uncertainty about the benefits that you would receive, that's problematic."Deana L. Parsick, who runs a tax preparation company in Springfield, Mo., said clients had been calling her, too, but less out of anxiety than anticipation.Most of her clients have incomes of $25,000 to $35,000 a year, she said.They would benefit from the higher standard deduction and increased child tax credits."So for my clientele, I haven't seen anything that would affect them negatively," Ms. Parsick said."They're excited about the possibility, very excited."For many, the offsetting provisions in the bill are difficult to figure out.Amy and Ben Powell, who live in Louisville, Ky., with their toddler son, collectively earn roughly $80,000.Mr. Powell is a choir teacher at a local middle school, while Ms. Powell works part time at a local coffee shop.They both work on the weekend, in their church, for extra cash: He is the music director and she leads the choir's altos to make sure they are on key.The couple generally prepare their tax return together through TurboTax, which she said makes it pretty clear which tax breaks help them the most: the child tax credit, their mortgage deduction, student loan interest, the credit for teachers who buy supplies for their classroom, and charitable giving."Last year was our first year of claiming a dependent, which gave us a nice chunk back on our return," Ms. Powell said.Most of those deductions would stay in place or grow under the Republican plan.But the Powells would lose the personal exemption more than $12,000 this year and they would no longer be able to deduct their student loan interest or Mr. Powell's classroom expenses.That made them nervous, they said.Ms. Powell said friends also had concerns about prospective changes, including the dependent care tax credit, which was eliminated in the first iteration of the House tax proposal."We are both fortunate that we don't pay for child care," said Ms. Powell, who said her parents help watch their son."But I have heard from friends who are worried that what you pay into child care is being tampered with in some way."
China's Xi preaches 'openness' and 'cooperation' after Trump comes out swinging:::::Seeing profound change in economic globalization, Chinese president says 3:28 AM ET Fri, 10 Nov 2017 | 02:29 Chinese President Xi Jinping on Friday talked up the value of international "cooperation" and economic "openness."Xi's speech at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Da Nang, Vietnam, followed an address from President Donald Trump.Trump similarly called for economic openness, but struck a harsh tone against countries he deemed guilty of "chronic trade abuses."Xi praised many of the results of an increasingly connected world."Over the last few decades, economic globalization has contributed significantly to global growth.Indeed, it has become an irreversible historical trend," Xi said, according to a provided translation."In pursuing economic globalization, we should make it more open, more inclusive, more balanced, more equitable and more beneficial to all," the Chinese leader told the gathering of political and business leaders.Xi is attending the APEC meeting fresh out of last month's 19th Chinese Communist Party Congress during which he consolidated power at the top of the political totem pole.In the last year, he has also sought to market the world's second-largest economy as the flag bearer of free trade despite the fact that many elements of China's economy are not open.
'We can no longer tolerate these chronic trade abuses': Trump lashes out at China and others:::::President Donald Trump on Friday pushed for freedom and economic openness in a forceful speech that portrayed Washington as a more respectful trade partner to Asian nations than China has been.Speaking at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Vietnam, the president also warned against mistreating his country, accusing some countries in the region of "product dumping, subsidized goods, currency manipulation and predatory industrial policies.""We can no longer tolerate these chronic trade abuses, and we will not tolerate them," Trump said."From this day forward, we will compete on a fair and equal basis," he added."We are not going to let the United States be taken advantage of anymore.I am always going to put America first the same way that I expect all of you in this room to put your countries first."Additionally, Washington will "no longer tolerate the audacious theft of intellectual property, we will confront the destructive practices of forcing businesses to surrender their technologies to the state and forcing them into joint ventures in exchange for market access," he said.Many U.S. firms operating in China have complained of such policies.Trump said he did not blame China, the world's second-largest economy, or other countries for "taking advantage of the U.S. on trade," repeating a message he delivered in Beijing the previous day.
Trump believes Roy Moore will 'step aside' if teen sex allegations are true, White House says:::::The White House said Friday that Republican Roy Moore should drop out of the Senate race if allegations are true that he pursued a sexual relationship with a 14-year-old girl when he was 32.President Donald Trump "believes we cannot allow a mere allegation, in this case one from many years ago, to destroy a person's life," White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said aboard Air Force One en route to Vietnam."However, the president also believes that if these allegations are true, Judge Moore will do the right thing and step aside," she said.Moore has denied the allegations, which were published Thursday by The Washington Post.The story included accounts by four women who allege, on the record, that the 70-year-old Alabama Republican tried to start sexual relationships with them while they were in their teens, and he was in his 30s.One of the women, Leigh Corfman, said she was 14 when she met Moore in 1979, after he offered to babysit her while her mother attended a custody hearing at the courthouse where he worked.Corfman said Moore pursued a relationship with her, and brought her to his apartment multiple times, where he engaged in sexual behavior with her that made Corfman deeply uncomfortable.Republicans including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell also called on Moore to withdraw from the race if the allegations are true.In a statement, Moore told the Post: "These allegations are completely false and are a desperate political attack by the National Democrat Party and the Washington Post on this campaign."Moore scored an upset defeat over incumbent Sen. Luther Strange in the September Alabama primary.Moore was backed by former top Trump aide Steve Bannon and Strange was backed by Trump.After the vote, Trump called Moore to congratulate him.Sanders said later that Trump does not share Moore's evangelical Christian views and his positions on several other issues.
China state-controlled media sides with Trump over American 'fake' media:::::President Donald Trump received a ringing endorsement this week from an unexpected source: A highly nationalistic Chinese propaganda outlet.In a Thursday editorial, China's Global Times praised many of the U.S. leader's qualities, and criticized the American media for "fake reports" that painted a negative picture of the man."Trump is one of the most popular heads of state on the Chinese Internet, and generally the Chinese public holds a positive attitude toward him," wrote the Global Times, a Communist Party-owned newspaper.China is this week engaged in an all-out charm offensive to try to butter Trump up for any negotiations he may have with Xi.The U.S. leader arrived in the country on Wednesday.The Chinese "have figured out, as many other countries have realized, that the way to win over President Trump and get him to back off some of his more hostile campaign rhetoric is to turn up the charm," Aaron Connelly, research fellow at the Lowy Institute for International Policy, told CNBC earlier in the week.The dig at the U.S. media is particularly noteworthy because Trump has frequently criticized the press, which he has derided as biased and purveyors of "fake news."The propaganda outlet's mirroring of his terminology, therefore, is unlikely to be a coincidence.In its editorial, the Global Times wrote that the supposed high opinion of Trump in China "doesn't come easily, as the initial impression of Trump was completely led by U.S. media reports."These absurd reports deeply influenced Chinese public opinion.It wasn't until his election victory that the Chinese public realized they had been cheated by the American media," it added.Despite that flattery, the Chinese press has routinely criticized Trump sometimes sharply over differences in issues like Taiwan and North Korea.In December, Global Times called Trump "ignorant like a child" in handling diplomacy after the then president-elect stated that the U.S. did not necessarily have to stick to the "One China" policy.In April, state news agency Xinhua criticized the U.S. for its strike in Syria, calling it the actions of a weak politician who was attempting to flex his muscles.In August this year, Xinhua rebuked the U.S. president for his "emotional venting" on Twitter after he criticized China for not reining North Korea in.Nevertheless, the Global Times posited that: "Many leading U.S. media outlets are now discredited among the Chinese public, partly because of their fake reports during the elections and subjective opposition against Trump."It did not cite any specific reports that it believed were fake.On Thursday, Trump's visit to China was a top trending topic on the country's microblog platform Weibo, where news about the U.S. leader's visit was greeted with a Chinese-language hashtag translating to "#Trumpishere."Reactions to Trump's visit were generally warm in a country where the brash style of the U.S. leader is perceived to be fresh and free-spirited.The Global Times put it this way: "Chinese appreciate his directness, which is in sharp contrast to [2016 presidential rival] Hillary Clinton, who always puts on airs.This has won him popularity since the election campaign.Many feel he may stick to his own ideas, but he is not insidious."Trump's granddaughter's recital of Chinese poetry and her latest rendition of a Chinese song to the Xis have also charmed the Chinese public.Global Times also gave bonus points to Trump for seeming to be "pragmatic" on his Beijing policy so far with "no interest in ideological diplomacy.""He hasn't used the issue of human rights to make trouble for China so far, and this means the Sino-U.S. relationship can focus on substantive matters," it added.
These are the 37 major deals US firms signed with Chinese entities during Trump's visit:::::The Commerce Department has revealed the list of the 37 major deals signed between U.S. and Chinese companies around President Donald Trump's trip through Asia.The dollar value of those deals is in excess of $250 billion.Catepillar, Boeing, and Goldman Sachs are just some of the notable names on the list of companies that made deals with China, the full list of which is below.Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said the deals were a good example of Trump helping to build bilateral trade relationships between the two nations."American businesses are the most innovative in the world and, when given access, can compete with anyone," Ross said."I believe these deals can provide a solid foundation for a stronger relationship that is more free, fair, and reciprocal between the U.S. and China.""It was a great honor for these [deals] to be witnessed by President Trump and President Xi today," Ross added."A special thank you to our CEO delegation for their hard work in support of this historic event."Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein, Qualcomm CEO Steve Mollenkopf, Cheniere Energy CEO Jack Fusco, Air Products CEO Seifollah Ghasemi, and division heads from Boeing and General Electric were among the more than two dozen business leaders who attended.Trade has been one of Trump's core priorities in his first year in office.He held talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping during his visit about the multibillion-dollar U.S. trade deficit with China.
House Republicans' exodus continues. Here's a tally of all the members retiring, and why:::::House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte of Virginia announced Thursday that he will retire from Congress next year, the latest member to join the more than two dozen Republicans who've confirmed they won't be returning to Congress in 2019."With my time as Chairman of the Judiciary Committee ending in December 2018, this is a natural stepping-off point and an opportunity to begin a new chapter of my career and spend more time with my family," Goodlatte said in a statement.Retirements in Congress, as in any other job, are part of the natural workplace cycle.But given the nature of politics, they're often carefully timed to benefit lawmakers' future careers.This is especially true in the House, where members must win re-election every two years.According to Roll Call, an average of 22 House members retire every cycle.So far in the 2018 cycle, that number has jumped to 30 21 Republicans and nine Democrats, with more retirements expected later this month.And while it's tempting to blame the polarizing effect of President Donald Trump on the nation, or the infighting that plagues the House Republican caucus, there's more to it than that.CNBC is keeping a tally of all the House retirements, sorted into groups based on the reasons behind members' decisions, and what the retirements mean for both parties.Below is the latest.Half of the House members who've announced they're retiring next year, 15 of the 30, are leaving to run for governorships or Senate seats in their home states, and among those running for governor there's an even party split: five Democrats and five Republicans.Democratic Reps. Jared Polis, Colo.; Colleen Hannabue, Hawaii; Tim Walz, Minn.; John Delaney, Md.; and Michelle Lujan Grisham, N.M., have all thrown their hats in the ring, as have Republicans Kristi Noem, N.D.; Steve Pearce, N.M.; Diane Black, Tenn.; Raul Labrador, Idaho; and Jim Renacci, Ohio.Another six House members are leaving to run for Senate seats: four Republicans and two Democrats.
Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey says the deactivation of Trump's Twitter should never have been possible:::::Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey said Thursday that it should not have been possible for one of his employees to deactivate the president's Twitter account."We had an employee who, on this person's last day, took it upon themselves to deactivate the account," Dorsey said."There are a number of things that came out of this for us.First, that should never have been possible.We started looking into the controls we have in place, what we can improve and where we have weaknesses, where we have gaps.Second, particular policies around what agents have control over and what they don't."Dorsey spoke in an interview with New York Times columnist and CNBC anchor Andrew Ross Sorkin at The New York Times DealBook Conference.Sorkin asked if Dorsey received a call from the president's staff, and he said they've had "conversations."President Donald Trump had his account deactivated for 11 minutes earlier this month, an action that's very different from an account suspension, according to Dorsey, but results in the account being out of public view.Dorsey said that Twitter has had to flex "new muscles" as far as transparency, especially when it comes to how and why accounts are blocked from the Twitter feed.He said there is a policy to keep content live based on whether it is "newsworthy," referring to the president's tweets."We're trying to close the gap between policy interpretation and policy enforcement," Dorsey said.Twitter is under scrutiny for social media's role in spreading Russian propaganda during the 2016 election.Sorkin asked Dorsey why he did not attend recent congressional hearings on the topic of Russian interference, sending a lawyer instead, just like Google and Facebook.Dorsey said he would absolutely be happy to stand up and represent his company, but that the lawyer was the best person to speak to the deep nuances of Twitter's legal policies."If I was called specifically, I would go," Dorsey said."I would get prepared and make sure I understood every single aspect of what happened and what we're doing about it, more importantly."Twitter recently rolled out extended character limits of 280 characters for tweets.Dorsey said he still will likely average under 140.Dorsey is one of the few people to take on the challenge of running two publicly traded companies, Twitter and Square.Both companies have performed well over the past few months.Dorsey said it took time to understand how to run both companies, but he's learned that the right team and the right use of time are more important than how much time he spends at each company.He compared his ventures to the Walt Disney company in that he plans for his companies to endure beyond his lifetime, and that means building structures that do not depend solely on him.(Dorsey is a board member at Disney.)Twitter reported higher-than-expected earnings for last quarter, despite a nearly flat user base.And Square also exceeded Wall Street's expectations, narrowing losses amid a growing volume of transactions.The company is also delving deeper into hardware with a new product called Square Register.But the pressure is high on both companies to aim for perfection.Square shares have seen triple-digit percentage gains this year.Dorsey said that Square lost some customers to aggressive competitors like Amazon, but many of them have come back.Dorsey said that much of the commentary around financial innovations like bitcoin is very surface level, and that bitcoin research could have wide-ranging and "seminal" implications.Square briefly accepted bitcoin in 2014."It's a decentralized ledger.That has extreme power," Dorsey."I want to make sure as a company and this is not just Square, but also Twitter that we're looking at technologies like the blockchain, like cryptocurrencies, and learning from it, and learning how to apply it."
House Republicans advance tax bill, aim to bring it to a vote next week:::::Republicans still face hurdles in hitting their target of approving a tax bill this year.Some of the legislation's provisions threaten GOP rebellion.Senate Republicans are also pushing to pass their own, separate plan, that lawmakers would have to reconcile if each chamber approved its own bill.The House bill, called the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, cuts the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 20 percent, while moderately reducing household income tax rates.It changes some popular provisions such as the mortgage interest deduction, but leaves others, like the 401(k) tax benefit, unchanged.The Senate plan largely overlaps with the House proposal, but does not repeal the estate tax and leaves the mortgage interest deduction unchanged.The plan's elimination of a federal tax deduction for state and local taxes has sparked the most resistance from the party.Already, Republican lawmakers in high-tax, blue states have pushed back against the provision.The GOP has searched for ways to offset major tax cuts without alienating its members by including unpopular measures.The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that an earlier version of the House bill will lead to $1.7 trillion more in budget deficits over 10 years.The figure tops the $1.5 trillion in deficits allowed under budget rules the GOP is using to pass a tax bill.
Mitch McConnell: Roy Moore should drop Senate bid if sex allegations with teens are true:::::Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell called on the Alabama GOP nominee for Senate, Roy Moore, to withdraw from the race if multiple allegations that he pursued sexual relationships with teenagers are true."If these allegations are true, he must step aside," McConnell told reporters, following the publication of the story in The Washington Post.In it, four women described on the record how Moore allegedly tried to initiate sexual relationships with them while they were in their teens and he was in his early 30s.The 70-year-old Moore denies the allegations.From The Washington Post: Moore chatted with [14-year-old Leigh Corfman] and asked for her phone number, she says.Days later, she says, he picked her up around the corner from her house in Gadsden, drove her about 30 minutes to his home in the woods, told her how pretty she was and kissed her.On a second visit, she says, he took off her shirt and pants and removed his clothes.He touched her over her bra and underpants, she says, and guided her hand to touch him over his underwear.Aside from Corfman, three other women interviewed by The Washington Post in recent weeks say Moore pursued them when they were between the ages of 16 and 18 and he was in his early 30s, episodes they say they found flattering at the time, but troubling as they got older.None of the women say that Moore forced them into any sort of relationship or sexual contact.In a written statement to the Post, Moore said: "These allegations are completely false and are a desperate political attack by the National Democrat Party and the Washington Post on this campaign."In the September Alabama primary, Moore defeated incumbent Sen. Luther Strange, who was backed by President Donald Trump.After the vote, Trump called Moore to congratulate him.White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said later that Trump does not share Moore's views on religion and several other issues.McConnell was not the only Republican senator on Thursday to demand that Moore step aside if the allegations are true.Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski told NBC News she was "horrified" by the allegations, and if they were true, Moore "should step down immediately."Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., also said Moore "ought to step aside" if "there's any truth to that story."Pennsylvania Sen. Pat Toomey echoed Flake: "If there's a shred of truth to it, then [Moore] needs to step aside."But while most Republicans stressed that the allegations needed to be proven before Moore should step down, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said the accounts of the four women, which were corroborated by friends and family, were enough to convince him that Moore should drop out of the race."The allegations against Roy Moore are deeply disturbing and disqualifying," McCain said in a statement."He should immediately step aside and allow the people of Alabama to elect a candidate they can be proud of."Moore's campaign chairman, Bill Armistead, called the story a "last ditch Hail Mary" by Moore's political opponents."Judge Roy Moore has endured the most outlandish attacks on any candidate in the modern political arena, but this story in today's Washington Post alleging sexual impropriety takes the cake," said Armistead.This is not Moore's first brush with controversy.The former Chief Justice of the Alabama Supreme Court first gained national attention in 2003, when he was removed from his position for refusing to take down a statue of the Ten Commandments, which he'd had installed in front of the state's primary judicial building.A decade later, Moore was again elected Chief Justice, and in 2016 he was again removed from office, this time for instructing lower court judges to uphold a ban on same sex marriage, despite a Supreme Court decision which found the ban was unconstitutional.In recent years, Moore has also argued that Muslims should be prohibited from serving in Congress, that homosexuality is "an inherent evil" and that evolution does not exist.During the state's 2017 Senate Republican primary, Moore won the backing of Steve Bannon, former chief strategist to President Donald Trump.Bannon's endorsement came as a surprise to some conservatives, given that Trump had publicly backed Moore's opponent.
Here's how the House and Senate tax bills compare:::::House and Senate on a path to make housing unaffordable: Sen. Cantwell 4:12 PM ET Thu, 9 Nov 2017 | 03:34 Senate Republicans unveiled a tax plan Thursday which chops taxes on businesses and makes major tweaks to the individual tax system.It broadly follows the outlines of a similar bill making its way through the House.However, it contains some key differences from the House proposal, according to a source briefed on it.Among those, it does not repeal the estate, or "death," tax, and it leaves the mortgage interest deduction unchanged.The chart below compares and contrasts some of the key provisions of the House and Senate plans.
Here's what's in the Senate Republican tax plan:::::Senate tax bill has seven tax brackets, say sources 3:02 PM ET Thu, 9 Nov 2017 | 02:39 Senate Republicans on Thursday unveiled a plan which would chop the corporate tax rate and make broad tweaks to the individual tax system.It contains key differences from a bill working its way through the House.GOP senators contend the tax system overhaul will ease the burden on middle-income Americans while encouraging companies to boost hiring and wages.Trimming the tax burden on businesses and individuals has long been a Republican goal.With unified control of the White House and both chambers of Congress, the GOP aims to pass a tax reform plan this year, despite lingering challenges.Issues facing GOP lawmakers include budget deficits generated by the deep cuts, opposition from blue-state House Republicans and backlash from Democrats who say the proposals will not go far enough to help middle-class workers.Here are some of the key features of the Senate plan, much of which was outlined by the Senate Finance Committee: The proposal chops the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 20 percent.It would delay the change until 2019, a source told CNBC.In the House bill, that measure would take effect next year.The Senate plan would keep seven individual income tax brackets, a source told CNBC.A 12 percent bracket would replace the current 15 percent, while the top rate would get cut slightly to 38.5 percent.The House plan would reduce the number of brackets to four.Like the House bill, the Senate proposal would nearly double the standard deduction to $12,000 for individuals and $24,000 for married couples.The Senate plan would eliminate federal deductions for state and local taxes.The House bill also has this.It would not change the mortgage interest deduction, which allows deductions on interest for up to $1 million in mortgage debt.The House bill caps that figure at $500,000.It keeps popular tax breaks for 401(k) retirement accounts and charitable contributions.It aims to reduce the burden on pass-through businesses by adding a deduction.The Senate plan increases the child tax credit from $1,000 to $1,650.The proposal doubles the exemption for the estate tax, or so-called death tax, but does not eliminate it.The House plan repeals the estate tax after six years.The House Ways and Means Committee voted Thursday to advance its tax bill.Committee Chairman Rep. Kevin Brady, R-Texas, made changes to the proposal ahead of the vote.House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., on Thursday said the full House would vote on the proposal next week.
Government never tried to force CNN sale in AT&T-Time Warner deal, official says:::::The Justice Department pushed back Thursday on allegations that it is trying to get AT&T to sell CNN and other properties as part of its plans to acquire Time Warner.In another strange twist to the deal, AT&T's CEO backed up that account.Instead, the DOJ presented AT&T with several options by which it might be willing to satisfy antitrust concerns, but never demanded a CNN sale, a government official familiar with the discussions told CNBC.The official called the accusation that the government was trying to force a CNN sale "shocking" and countered that AT&T was attempting to make the matter political."They're trying to make this a political issue.It's not," the official said.The government suggested that AT&T sell either Turner, which owns CNN, or Direct TV, the official added.In an unusual back and forth played out in the media, AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson said the company would not consider divesting CNN.Stephenson himself gave credence to Thursday's statements out of the DOJ."I have never been told that the price of getting the deal done was selling CNN," Stephenson said at the DealBook conference in New York.Sources had told CNBC that the government had demanded a sale of the Turner properties or Direct TV to approve of the deal.The Justice official said the department would prefer that AT&T abandon the deal altogether.Failing that, the department would like to see a sale of either Turner or Direct TV but also is open to other ideas that would satisfy antitrust concerns.
Mnuchin says Donald Trump will see tax increase under tax plan:::::Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Thursday said President Donald Trump will see a tax increase under the proposed Republican tax plan."He will have a tax increase," Mnuchin said."For people who make over $1 million in the high tax states, there will be a tax increase."Mnuchin was speaking at The Economic Club of New York ahead of the unveiling of the Senate GOP tax plan expected later Thursday.Initial analyses of the tax plan suggest that Trump will see his federal tax rate decline if the Republican tax proposal is passed.His total tax rate, however, including state and local taxes, could increase, just as Mnuchin said.Trump, like others making $1 million a year in taxable income, will benefit from a reduced federal tax rate, according to an analysis by the Joint Committee on Taxation.That analysis showed that the average millionaire will go from a tax rate of 32.5 percent to 29.9 percent.The numbers could change as the House is revising the bill in committee.Despite the likely decrease in his federal tax rate, taxpayers such as Trump who live in high-tax states and localities will be hit hardest by the House GOP's proposed end to state and local deductions for itemized filers.The state and local tax deduction, or SALT deduction, is effectively a subsidy from the federal government to state and local governments.It's generally used by higher-income taxpayers and is disproportionately used by taxpayers in states with high state and local taxes.In Washington, D.C., the average SALT deduction in 2014 was $15,500, according to the Tax Policy Center.For his part, Trump said Tuesday that he called his personal accountant to check how he would be affected, according to The Washington Post.According to the Post, the president told senators Tuesday that he would be a "big loser" under the plan.
Mark Cuban says he would run as an independent for president if he chooses to challenge Trump:::::Mark Cuban says he would run as an independent for president if he chooses to challenge Trump 12:41 PM ET Thu, 9 Nov 2017 | 06:00 Billionaire investor Mark Cuban said Thursday he is considering running for president as an independent.He said his decision on challenging President Donald Trump, whom he has criticized, hinges on whether his wife and family would allow it.I would run as a "Republican before Democrat and most likely independent," Cuban said at The New York Times DealBook Conference."I think there is an incremental value for setting up an independent candidacy....The benefit of being an independent is you go right to the golden ticket time, if I get enough support in the polls then I get to participate in the debates."Cuban admitted it would be difficult to set up the infrastructure for an independent candidacy for president but believes it is the best way to challenge Trump.When asked if he would consider running as a Democrat, Cuban replied: "No, absolutely not."The entrepreneur and "Shark Tank" panelist is the owner of the NBA's Dallas Mavericks.He sold Broadcast.com to Yahoo for about $5.7 billion in 1999.The investor has a net worth of $3.3 billion, according to Forbes.Disclosure: CNBC owns the exclusive off-network cable rights to "Shark Tank," which features Mark Cuban as a panelist.
Senate GOP bill would delay corporate tax cut:::::The Senate tax plan set to be unveiled Thursday would delay and phase in a corporate tax cut, sources tell CNBC.The move contrasts with a bill working its way through the House and the wishes of President Donald Trump.The Senate, like the House, is expected to call for chopping the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent.Republicans argue that the reduction will help to encourage companies to keep operations in the United States, hire more workers and boost wages.One source told CNBC that the corporate tax cut would take effect in 2019.The Washington Post first reported a delay until 2019, citing four people briefed on the planning.Trump wants to give an immediate cut, arguing that it will spark job and economic growth.Speaking at the Economic Club of New York on Thursday, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the president would prefer a 2018 reduction but seemed to open the door to a one-year delay."The president would like this to go into effect right away.I think the sooner we get this, the 20 percent rate, the better it is for the economy, but the House and Senate are having to look at how we pay for all of this, including a major focus of the president is middle-income tax cuts, so these are things that are still being discussed," Mnuchin said."Obviously, right away is better than a year, but a year is better than obviously a longer phase-in," he added.Delaying the corporate rate cut to 2019 could save $100 billion or more, the Post reported.However, putting off the corporate tax cut could discourage businesses from investing in the U.S. or relocating their headquarters from overseas.To reduce that effect, the Senate would call for letting companies deduct capital investments in 2018, according to the Post.Republican lawmakers are looking for ways to offset major tax cuts called for in their proposals.Under budget rules they plan to use to pass a bill, it cannot generate more than $1.5 trillion in budget deficits over a decade.The Joint Committee on Taxation has estimated that a version of the bill proposed by the House would lead to a $1.7 trillion increase in federal deficits over a decade.The House Ways and Means Committee is revising the bill before an expected Thursday vote to advance it.House Republicans aim to hold a full chamber vote on the plan next week.Republicans aim to overhaul the American tax system by the end of the year.If they pass separate bills, lawmakers will have to reconcile the differences.
Obamacare enrollments are way up in Trump's first sign-up season:::::The rate of enrollment in Obamacare health insurance plans was sharply higher in the first week of sign-ups compared with last year, official data released Thursday show.The data confirm earlier reports that there was a big upsurge in consumer demand for individual insurance plans on the first day of open enrollment, Nov. 1, the first season under the Obamacare-opposing Trump administration.The number released Thursday suggests that consumer demand for Obamacare plans almost doubled over last year in the first days of enrollment.But it remains to be seen if that pace will continue.A total of 601,462 people in the first four days of open enrollment selected a plan on HealthCare.gov, the federal Obamacare exchange that serves much of the United States, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.A total of 464,140 customers renewed coverage, and 137,322 new consumers selected a plan on HealthCare.gov.CMS did not release data for the first four days of open enrollment for last season for comparison with the new data.However, a CMS release in November 2016 said that in the first two weeks of open enrollment for that month there were 1,008,218 plan selections on HealthCare.gov.Those two weeks encompassed just 12 days of actual enrollment, given the way CMS measures sign-up periods.That means that each four-day period last year in the first weeks of open enrollment saw about 336,000 sign-ups on average.The first four days of sign-ups this year was 1.79 times as much as that tally.Data released by CMS on Thursday and last November does not include enrollments on the dozen Obamacare marketplaces run by individual states and the District of Columbia.California's exchange, the largest state-run Obamacare marketplace, said its enrollment business was about 25 percent higher on the first day of sign-ups this year compared with last year.Maryland's exchange had 70 percent higher enrollment on the first day.Lori Lodes, a former top CMS official, said the data released Thursday "is a great start to open enrollment and is further evidence that people want health insurance and that they're finding coverage they can afford.""The administration has caused a lot of anxiety for people over the last year when it comes to health care but there's also been a more in-depth conversation about what Obamacare really is about," said Lodes, co-founder of Get America Covered, an enrollment advocacy group."So when most people logged onto HealthCare.gov they found plans that are more affordable than they expected."Obamacare advocates like Lodes have feared that the Trump administration's hostility to the Affordable Care Act will lead to a marked decrease in the final enrollment tally relative to last year, particularly because of a sharp decrease in outreach budgets.There is also a much shorter sign-up window this year compared with last year in much of the country.Open enrollment ends Dec. 15 in states served by HealthCare.gov.Most other states have longer enrollment periods, but all will end by late January.The ACA requires most Americans to have some form of health coverage during the year or pay a fine that can be as much as 2.5 percent of household income.
AT&T would win a fight with the government over Time Warner deal, analyst says:::::AT&T and the Justice Department could be on their way to a major court battle, which one analyst believes the company stands a strong chance of winning.The fight centers on AT&T's hopes to acquire Time Warner and news Wednesday that the government wants the company to first sell Turner Broadcasting, which includes CNN, or sell DirecTV.AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson said the company has no intentions of divesting itself of those holdings.Paul Gallant, a Washington analyst at Cowen Research, thinks the company won't have to."If this does go to court, we think AT&T holds a strong position and would likely prevail," Cowen said Thursday in a note to clients.The company has three advantages, according to Gallant: The deal is "vertical" so it would be difficult to prove harm to the marketplace as it does not eliminate a rival; the DOJ would bear the burden of proof that the deal is anti-competitive; and the department's earlier attempts to negotiate behavioral conditions for approval indicate that it knows a legal case isn't strong.
Sen. John Thune: We have different rate structure than House tax plan:::::Sen. John Thune: We think tax reform should bring higher wages for American workers 12:08 PM ET Thu, 9 Nov 2017 | 05:13 Republican Sen. John Thune told CNBC the tax rate "structure" in the Senate's reform bill, set to be unveiled Thursday, will differ from the House plan.The House bill proposes to cut the number of income tax brackets from seven to four: 12 percent, 25 percent, 35 percent and 39.6 percent."We do have a different rate structure than what we have today, and we do have a different rate structure than what the House plan has," Thune told "Squawk Box."He did not provide specifics.As chairman of the Senate GOP conference, the South Dakota lawmaker is the third-ranking Republican in the Senate.Thune also declined to comment on whether the Senate bill would delay implementing certain measures, such as the corporate tax cut, saying "that'll all come out later."A few hours after Thune's appearance, a source told CNBC that the Senate tax plan would delay a corporate tax cut until 2019.On Wednesday, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said the GOP bill would increase the federal budget deficit by $1.7 trillion over 10 years."We've looked at different options on that," Thune told CNBC on Thursday, adding he's "happy" with what the Senate has done in regards to the rate structure.The highlights of the Senate plan will be similar to the House bill, he said."We'll take a slightly different approach on a couple of the issues," he added."But in the end, we all want to get to the same place.""What we try to do is ensure there's progressivity in the code, that the tax burden is similar to what it is today, and ... the relief flows evenly," he said.Senate Republicans are preparing to put out their tax plan two days after the GOP took a drubbing in off-year elections.Democrat Ralph Northam defeated Republican Ed Gillespie in Virginia's hotly contested race for governor, which many analysts viewed as a referendum on President Donald Trump.In New Jersey, Democrat Phil Murphy won the gubernatorial race against Republican Lt. Gov.Kim Guadagno, who was No.2 to the unpopular, outgoing Gov.Chris Christie.Democrats, who did well around the country in other state races and locally, were looking ahead to next year's midterm House and Senate elections with renewed optimism.
Donald Trump and Lloyd Blankfein have a lot in common, Gary Cohn says:::::CNBC's John Harwood sat down with National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn to discuss a range of topics, including similarities he sees between President Donald Trump and Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein.What follows is a condensed, edited transcript of their conversation.Harwood: Compare the construction of this tax plan that you've been a part of with the process of a major initiative at Goldman Sachs.Cohn: It's similar in many respects, and it's different in many respects.Harwood: Less rational, right?Cohn: I don't think it's less or more rational.So, a major initiative at Goldman Sachs, we would literally go through and we would be very methodical, and very organized, and we would think through what we wanted to achieve, how we were going to achieve it.What would be the intended outcomes; what would be the unintended outcomes?Could we live with the unintended versus the intended?What could go wrong?What could go right?How would we solve for all of the issues?And we would test that over, and over and over again, and bring in as many smart people as we possibly could to test that scenario.Harwood: And how is it different now?Cohn: You only had to convince one, two, or three people to do it.At the end of the day there was a small, small group of us.In dealing with what we have to deal with in taxes, we have 400-plus members of Congress and 100 members of the Senate.So, we not only have to think about what the objective is with taxes, and tax reform.We have to think how do we get 218 votes, and how do we get 51 votes on top of understanding the intended consequences, the unintended consequences.We have to overlay that with a big political umbrella.Harwood: Compare Donald Trump and Lloyd Blankfein as bosses.Cohn: They've got a lot of similarities.Harwood: What are the similarities?I'm surprised to hear you say that.Cohn: Look, they're both very driven.They're both very passionate.They both strongly believe in what they're doing.Their core messaging is very similar.I mean, they come into the office with passion every day.And they are both driven by the mission and feel like they need to get the mission accomplished, day in and day out.Harwood: How are they different?Cohn: Look, a corporate setting and the White House are different settings.You know, one's an elected official with a very public persona, one's a CEO with a fairly private persona and driving messaging inside the private persona where your clients don't really want to see you make news.Where on the other side, where your clients want to see you make news, which is the electorate, you approach those two things from a very different perspective.So, they're both managing their clients very effectively.And I think they both understand who their client base is, and they manage their client base effectively.Read more from the Gary Cohn Speakeasy interview: ... on keeping companies in America.... on repealing the estate tax.... on Cohn's plan after tax reform.... on the value of trickle-down economics.
Gary Cohn: Trickle-down is good for the economy:::::Gary Cohn was in some ways an unlikely choice for Donald Trump's White House.He is a Democratic Wall Street veteran serving a Republican president who cast himself as the champion of "forgotten people" battered by economic change.But Cohn, 57, jumped at the chance to leave a top job at Goldman Sachs and become director of the National Economic Council at the White House.His introduction to government has been relentlessly turbulent, marked by staff shakeups, a damaging defeat on health-care policy, and a president whose popularity sags under the weight of self-generated controversy.After Trump failed to unequivocally denounce white supremacists and neo-Nazis this summer, Cohn himself felt compelled to speak out.But the moment Cohn has waited for is here.He and his boss, along with Republican congressional leaders, have begun the effort to enact their tax-cut plan despite tepid public support, fierce Democratic resistance and uncertain GOP unity.Cohn sat down to discuss the plan in a classroom at American University, where he gained his first exposure to financial markets at a student.What follows is a condensed, edited transcript of their conversation.CNBC's John Harwood: So, we're at American University, where you went to school.Tell me what you learned about yourself.Cohn: I learned a lot about being confident, about learning how to succeed.I did get introduced to the financial markets while I was in college.And I think I learned also how to sort of filter out all of the nonrational, or nonsensible, noise and sort of concentrate on what matters, and that's really what markets are about.Separate the rational from the irrational; separate what matters now to what doesn't matter now.Harwood: I think most people looking from the outside see more irrational stuff happening in this White House than in any White House that they've seen.Cohn: I'm involved in the economic side of the White House.On the economic side, I think the reality is pretty strong for what's going on in this White House.You know, you can look at the jobs data.You know, we had 4.1 percent unemployment last month, which is a 16-year low.We've had two-consecutive quarters of over 3 percent GDP growth with hurricanes in the last quarter.You look at what the stock market's telling you about people committing capital and willing to invest in our economy.Things are really strong.Harwood: All those strengths kind of undercut the argument that 'Oh, we have to do tax reform right now,' don't they?Cohn: We have not had wage growth in this country.So, we've got a lot of Americans finding work, but they're finding work at stagnant wages.Really to continue going on with this recovery, this long recovery, is we have to find a way to really drive wage growth.What our tax plan is really aimed at doing is creating wage growth.Harwood: What were the one or two most important principles that drove what you did?Cohn: The president had two really important principles.Number one is we have to deliver middle-class tax cuts to the hardworking families in this country.Number two, our corporate tax system just is not competitive with the rest of the world.We have to create a corporate tax rate, and along with that a pass-through tax rate, that makes us competitive with the rest of the world so we can attract businesses back to the United States.Harwood: Let me suggest an alternative principle.Look at the components of the plan: big corporate reductions, big pass-through reductions for business, much more tax cuts for businesses than for individuals.You've got the elimination of the estate tax, you've got the preservation of the step-up basis, you've got the elimination of the alternative minimum tax.What you have is a bunch of people, including you, including the president, who think 'What I do is good for the economy, therefore, taxing the things that I do less will be good for the economy and good for other people' instead of giving direct benefits to those people.Because middle-class people in this tax cut do not get very much in direct benefit.Cohn: I just completely disagree with you.Harwood: Look at the numbers.Cohn: I've done nothing but look at the numbers for the last 90 days.Harwood: If you look at Joint Tax, $1 trillion in net cuts for business, $200 billion through the estate tax, and $300 billion for individuals.So, four times as much in business tax cuts and estate tax as for individuals.Cohn: Yup.But, John, if you look at what we're doing for middle-class taxpayers, the reality is kind of simple.The median-income family in the United States, the family that earns about $60,000 in the United States, the Speaker [Paul Ryan] talked about them getting a $1,182 tax cut.That family is now paying a marginal tax rate of less than 1 percent.They're paying less than $500 of total taxes in the system.So a $60,000 earner, family of four, is paying less than $500.We have cut their taxes significantly.You can't go much further in the tax system.Harwood: You're saying you can't give middle-class taxpayers more of a tax break than you've done?Cohn: Unless you want to start going negative tax rates and go into the negative world.So, when people score this, you're scoring against the bound of zero.Harwood: You have a tax bill that takes away deductions for high medical expenses; that preserves carried interest I know they're working on that; that takes away deductions for grad school tuition breaks; that takes away an adoption credit.And on a percentage basis, people in the top 1 percent get twice as much of a reduction in their effective tax rate as everyone else.Cohn: Yeah, look, first of all, we're not done.The only thing you have to work on now is the House blueprint.We're going to get a Senate plan later this week.Remember, the big thing we're trying to do is we're trying to solve for middle income, hardworking families.Harwood: The companies that benefit from pass-through rates are high income because if they were middle income they'd be paying at the 25 percent rate already.The vast majority of those benefits go to wealthy businesses.Cohn: You've got to wait till the whole plan is done and see where we finally end up, and see what the plan comes out.Everything in our tax plan is meant to encourage investment.Harwood: You're not saying, as you did a few weeks ago, that the wealthy do not get a tax cut under your plan?Cohn: No.I'm saying there's unique situations to everyone out there.Everyone has their own story.It's not our intention to give the wealthy a tax cut.Harwood: But they're getting one.Cohn: I don't believe that we've set out to create a tax cut for the wealthy.If someone's getting a tax cut, I'm not upset that they're getting a tax cut.I'm really not upset.Harwood: Your old colleague, Steve Bannon, says, 'Ask him why they didn't design a tax plan focused on average Trump voters.'And when I talked to Larry Summers, who's your predecessor at the NEC, also Treasury secretary, he said, 'Look, they're doing what their money wants.'Cohn: They're entitled to their opinions.Harwood: Why are they wrong?Cohn: We have achieved our objectives.We are delivering a middle income tax cut Harwood: Small.Cohn: We are lowering corporate taxes to make ourselves competitive with the world.Harwood: Big.Cohn: Yeah.Harwood: If you look at the center of gravity of the economics profession, what they will say is that the deficit will go up more than you guys say, growth will increase less than you guys say, and that workers will get less than you guys are projecting.Cohn: We vehemently don't agree.When you take a corporate tax rate at 35 percent and move it to 20 percent, and you see what's happened over the last two decades to businesses migrating out of the United States, migrating profits out of the United States, migrating domicile out of the United States, and hiring workers out of the United States, it's hard for me to not imagine that they're not going to bring businesses back to the United States.We create wage inflation, which means the workers get paid more; the workers have more disposable income, the workers spend more.And we see the whole trickle-down through the economy, and that's good for the economy.Harwood: Another thing Larry Summers told me: 'The country wants to spend more on defense.We've got a whole lot of baby boomers retiring.We are going to need more money for government and not less.'The Penn-Wharton model run by a former Bush administration economist, not a Democrat says that this plan by 2040 will lose $4 trillion.During that time, the number of people on Social Security is going to go from 45 million to 72 million.How in the world does that make sense?Cohn: We firmly believe that we are creating a model that creates economic growth in this country.Harwood: But you know no tax cut's ever paid for itself.Cohn: The years that we increased deficit are years when our economy is slowing down.We continue to borrow more and more money.So, the number one thing we can do for the United States citizens is to grow the economy.This tax plan is meant to grow the economy.Harwood: Are you thinking that you'll deal with that Social Security/Medicare/baby boomer retirement issue later by entitlement reform that reduces benefits?Cohn: Look, the president on the economic front laid out three core principles.Number one was reg reform, number two was taxes and number three was infrastructure.We're working our way methodically through reg reform, taxes and infrastructure.I think when he gets done with those, I think welfare is going to come up.That's our near-term economic agenda right now.Read more from the Gary Cohn Speakeasy interview: ... on keeping companies in America.... on repealing the estate tax.... on Cohn's plan after tax reform.... on comparing Goldman Sachs and the White House.
Gary Cohn says repealing the estate tax helps 'a lot of different people':::::White House economic advisor Gary Cohn says estate tax helps 'lot of different people' 8:11 AM ET Thu, 9 Nov 2017 | 02:13 CNBC's John Harwood sat down with National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn to discuss a range of topics, including the GOP effort to repeal the estate tax.What follows is a condensed, edited transcript of their conversation.Harwood: Why do estate tax at all?If you preserve step-up basis, that means many capital gains for your kids, for Donald Trump's kids, will never be taxed.Cohn: Let's wait and see where the final plan comes out.On the estate tax, if you look at the couple of groups who are the biggest advocates for repealing the estate tax, it really is the pass-through business and it's the farmers.Harwood: It's Donald Trump, Gary Cohn, people like you guys.Cohn: Gary Cohn doesn't care about the estate tax, I can guarantee you.I can guarantee you.Harwood: You're the one who said only a moron pays the estate tax.Cohn: I can guarantee you Gary Cohn doesn't care about the estate tax.Harwood: When you look at the actual number of real farms that pay the estate tax, it is tiny in the dozens.Cohn: Well, I think people have managed to keep themselves below the estate tax.This is the whole issue.Many people are smart enough to know how to manage themselves out of the estate tax.So, if you have a family farm that's big enough that it's going to hit the estate tax, you start paying lawyers, consultants, and accountants to break up your land, and break up your farm, and giving it to the kids when the families would prefer to keep the farm intact, keep it whole, and manage it as one big farm.We're forcing people into irrational behavior, when we'd like to keep them in rational behavior, and run the farm as one big farm.Harwood: Are you seriously saying with a straight face that getting rid of the estate tax is about farmers and not about very wealthy families?Cohn: What I'm saying is that it benefits farms, it benefits small businesses, it benefits a lot of different people.Harwood: Small businesses with more than $11 million estates?Cohn: We do not believe that death should be a taxable event.Harwood: How does it stimulate the economy?Cohn: Well, look, we want that farmer to go out and buy the next piece of land, and the next piece of land, and the next piece of land, and create the economies of scale and be able to compete in the world.That makes sense to me.We want the small business to go double the production line and not have to worry about the size of his factory, worrying that, "Oh my God, I may incur estate tax and my family is going to have to sell this business."Read more from the Gary Cohn Speakeasy interview: ... on keeping companies in America.... on Goldman Sachs and the White House.... on Cohn's plan after tax reform.... on the value of trickle-down economics.
Gary Cohn says he plans to remain with the Trump administration after tax reform passes:::::Gary Cohn says he plans to stay at the White House until after tax reform 8:11 AM ET Thu, 9 Nov 2017 | 01:37 CNBC's John Harwood sat down with National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn to discuss a range of topics, including his professional plans for after tax reform gets passed.What follows is a condensed, edited transcript of their conversation.Harwood: After the events of this summer, many of your friends, peers in the business world decided, 'I don't want to, for my reputation, my company's reputation, be associated with this White House.'They disbanded these economic councils.There was a lot of speculation that you were going to leave.Why didn't you?Cohn: Look, I am in an amazing position.The president has given me unbelievable task, unbelievable responsibility to help him drive his economic agenda.I believe in his economic agenda.I believe in what he's doing on deregulation.I believe what he's doing on taxes, and I believe what he's doing on infrastructure.When I look at myself, I have been really a lucky American to end up where I am.I owe it to the country to work for the citizens of the country, work for the president, and try and help him drive his economic agenda.Harwood: You're not worried that your reputation will suffer by association with the administration?Cohn: I'm not.And when we get tax reform done and the economy grows, I'm really not worried.Harwood: You did speak out though.Do you think the fact that you spoke out is the reason that you were not in the Rose Garden the other day being announced as Fed chair?Cohn: Look, I think the president picked the exact right person to be the Fed chair.Harwood: But do you think that's why?Cohn: I'm very supportive of Jay [Powell].I think Jay is a great selection, and he's the perfect choice to be Fed chair.Harwood: Once tax reform is done, are you going to leave the White House?Cohn: Nope.Harwood: There's been a lot of speculation.Cohn: Nope.I know.There's speculation on anything.Harwood: Is it your plan to stay through the entire first term?Cohn: It's my plan to stay and work as long as I can help the president drive his economic agenda.You know, a year ago today, I wasn't thinking I'd be here.So, for me to tell you where I'm going to be four years from now, I have no idea.Read more from the Gary Cohn Speakeasy interview: ... on keeping companies in America.... on Goldman Sachs and the White House.... on repealing the estate tax.... on the value of trickle-down economics.
Gary Cohn: A year ago, I was advising companies to move out of the US:::::CNBC's John Harwood sat down with National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn to discuss a range of topics, including the matter of luring companies to stay in America.What follows is a condensed, edited transcript of their conversation.Harwood: Do you think the economic effects you're describing will take place even if firms don't take money that they repatriate and invest, but instead give it into share buybacks as they did the last time we had a holiday?Cohn: Absolutely.The minute we pass the law, you are going have to take an accrual on your books for the taxes owed on that money.Once you end up owing us the taxes, now you're making a business decision.If people bring the money back because they think there's an economic return that makes sense here in the United States, we believe there's a great economic sense.If they go to your alternative, which is that they issue dividends, or they buy back stock, guess what?We get another 20 percent tax on the money that they issued in dividends or they issue in taxes.So, we get a repatriation tax, we get a dividend or capital gains tax.But people to get those dividends, or they get those capital gains, they're probably investors.What are they going to do?They're going to go reinvest that money back in the market.Harwood: That doesn't limit the wage effects you guys are expecting, the idea that you're going to hire more workers and pay the marginal worker more?Cohn: I'm saying the open investor doesn't want the money.If I got a pool of capital invested in the market today, and you send me a big dividend, I'm most likely sending that money back to someone else so they can reinvest it and hire workers.Harwood: The Penn-Wharton model that was run by this former Bush economist has got a new projection out that shows that there is a chance that this will shrink the economy in the long run because of the deficit drag.Cohn: We don't agree with that.We believe that we're going to have a very stimulative effect on the economy by lowering the business tax rate, by lowering the corporate rate, and making America competitive with the rest of the world.Look, a year ago, I was on the other side of this equation.I was advising companies how to get out of the burdensome U.S. tax system.We were talking about inversions we were talking about moving companies out of the United States.The most compelling presentation I could make to a board is, hey, I can turbocharge your earnings without doing anything in your company.I can just relocate your domicile, and you can hold your board meetings, you can do a few things, and you can go from a 35 percent tax rate to a 15 percent tax rate.You can deliver 20 percent of your earnings to the bottom line.Harwood: Did you feel guilty advocating that as an American?Cohn: No.I didn't feel guilty because boards have a fiduciary responsibility to their shareholders.That's what they're supposed to do.So, you know what?We're going to make America competitive.We're going to make it compelling for people to build their companies in America.Harwood: You, I imagine, are the point person in the White House for big CEOs because you come from their world, they know you.What are you hearing from them right now?Cohn: The most excited group out there are big CEOs, about our tax plan.They all tell me how they excited they are to get a tax plan that makes the United States competitive, makes it so they can grow their business domestically, makes it so they can actually pay wages here.People have trapped their money offshore.So, you can't pay U.S. workers.You can pay non-U.S. workers, 'cause you've got the money offshore.Harwood: Don't businesses have a ton of domestic cash?Cohn: Well, they borrow money at home to expand if they want to expand at home, but their real earnings are trapped offshore.If companies were making that money onshore, they'd be paying their labor, they'd be paying their workers more money.So, our biggest supporters are really the Business Roundtable.When you talk to all the CEOs they're the most excited about this.Read more from the Gary Cohn Speakeasy interview: ... on Goldman Sachs and the White House.... on repealing the estate tax.... on Cohn's plan after tax reform.... on the value of trickle-down economics.
Trump's $250 billion China 'miracle' adds gloss to 'off-kilter' trade:::::Trump's China deal is missing one big thing, analyst says 6:25 PM ET Thu, 9 Nov 2017 | 02:41 President Donald Trump can return to the United States claiming to have snagged over $250 billion in deals from his maiden trip to Beijing.Whether those deals live up to the lofty price tag is another question altogether.Watched by Trump and China's President Xi Jinping at a signing ceremony in Beijing, U.S. planemaker Boeing, General Electric, and chip giant Qualcomm sealed lucrative multibillion-dollar deals."This is truly a miracle," China's Commerce Minister Zhong Shan said at a briefing in Beijing.The quarter of a trillion dollar haul underscores how Trump is keen to be seen to address a trade deficit with the world's second-largest economy that he has long railed against and called "shockingly high" on Thursday.But U.S. businesses still have many long-standing concerns to complain about, including unfettered access to the China market, cybersecurity and the growing presence of China's ruling Communist Party inside foreign firms.William Zarit, chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, said the deals pointed to "a strong, vibrant bilateral economic relationship" between the two countries."Yet we still need to focus on leveling the playing field, because U.S. companies continue to be disadvantaged doing business in China."U.S. tech companies like Facebook and Google are mostly blocked in China.Automakers Ford Motor and General Motors must operate through joint ventures, while Hollywood movies face a strict quota system."(These deals) allow Trump to portray himself as a master dealmaker, while distracting from a lack of progress on structural reforms to the bilateral trade relationship," Hugo Brennan, Asia analyst at risk consultancy Verisk Maplecroft, said in a note.
Goldman CEO Blankfein, a frequent Trump critic, says the president has America's back on the world stage:::::Exclusive: Goldman's Blankfein says view on Trump is both critical and constructive 8:24 AM ET Thu, 9 Nov 2017 | 04:12 Donald Trump is certainly a pro-business president, but he's not trying to enrich the wealthy, Goldman Sachs chief Lloyd Blankfein told CNBC on Thursday.Blankfein, a frequent critic of the White House, was traveling in Beijing with President Trump and a delegation of business leaders for the U.S. state visit to China.The Trump administration is "a kind of champion for American interests," Blankfein said, but added he finds the president's rhetoric "excessive" sometimes."There are things I disagree," he said, reflecting, "maybe I haven't shown enough appreciation for the positives" of the Trump administration.He stressed that he believes Trump is supporting business in such a way to boost the economy and help all Americans.However, Blankfein noted, "It's not growth at all costs.We need to have some regulation."Blankfein also talked about his firm's agreement to establish a $5 billion investment vehicle with China's sovereign wealth fund.He said the fund is aimed at putting money into "U.S. companies that could be helped by better access to China."Meanwhile, he also told CNBC it's inevitable that the Chinese economy will be bigger than the U.S. economy based on the sheer population disparity alone.But on the measure of "purchasing power," China has already surpassed the U.S., he said.
Trump Is Rapidly Reshaping the Judiciary. Heres How.:::::Its such a depressing idea, that we dont get appointments unless we have unified government, and that the appointments we ultimately get are as polarized as the rest of the country, said Lee Epstein, a law professor and political scientist at Washington University in St. Louis.What does that mean for the legitimacy of the courts in the United States?Its not a pretty world.For now, conservatives are reveling in their success.During the campaign, Mr. Trump shored up the support of skeptical right-wing voters by promising to select Supreme Court justices from a list Mr. McGahn put together with help from the Federalist Society and the conservative Heritage Foundation.Exit polls showed that court-focused voters helped deliver the presidents narrow victory.Now, he is rewarding them.We will set records in terms of the number of judges, Mr. Trump said at the White House recently, adding that many more nominees were in the pipeline.Standing beside the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, he continued, There has never been anything like what weve been able to do together with judges.Photo Appellate judges draw less attention than Supreme Court justices like Neil M. Gorsuch, whom Mr. Trump installed in the seat that Justice Scalias death left vacant and that Republicans, led by Mr. McConnell, refused to let Mr. Obama fill.But the 12 regional appeals courts wield profound influence over Americans lives, getting the final word on about 60,000 cases a year that are not among the roughly 80 the Supreme Court hears.Nan Aron, of the liberal Alliance for Justice, said that her group considered many of Mr. Trumps nominees to be extremists hostile to the rights of women, minority groups and workers, and unduly favorable to the wealthy.But conservatives, who have rallied around Mr. Trumps nominees as a rare bright spot of unity for the fractious Republican Party, see them as legal rock stars who will interpret the Constitution according to its text and original meaning.And they see tremendous opportunity in the fact that Mr. Trump is the first Republican president whose nominees can be confirmed by simple-majority votes, especially since he is likely to fill an unusually large number of vacancies.Mr. Trump started with 21 open appellate seats because after Republicans gained control of the Senate in 2015, they essentially shut down the confirmation process.Six additional appellate judgeships have opened since his inauguration, and nearly half of the 150 active appeals court judges are eligible to take senior status semiretirement that permits a successors appointment or will soon reach that age, according to Russell Wheeler, a Brookings Institution scholar.Almost Half of Appeals Judges Are Eligible for Senior Status State of the federal appeals courts at the start of each presidents first term.President Median Judge Age Vacant Seats Senior-Eligible Seats Richard M. Nixon Nixon 59 10% 10% Gerald Ford Ford 59 3% 10% Jimmy Carter Carter 60 6% 14% Ronald Reagan Reagan 60 4% 15% George H.W.Bush Bush 59 12% 16% Bill Clinton Clinton 59 13% 13% George W. Bush W. Bush 60 16% 14% Barack Obama Obama 62 9% 27% Donald J. Trump Trump 66 11% 44% As a result, Mr. Trump is poised to bring the conservative legal movement, which took shape in the 1980s in reaction to decades of liberal rulings on issues like the rights of criminal suspects and of women who want abortions, to a new peak of influence over American law and society.Advertisement Continue reading the main story What makes this a unique opportunity in modern history is the sheer number of vacancies, the number of potential vacancies because of the aging bench, and the existence of a president who really cares about this issue in his gut, said Leonard A. Leo, an informal adviser to Mr. Trump on courts who is the executive vice president of the Federalist Society.Liberals have accused Mr. Trump of outsourcing his nominations process to the Federalist Society.But two administration officials argued that this claim misunderstands how the conservative legal movement has matured as the generation of Republican lawyers shaped by reading the originalist dissents of Justice Scalia and by the bitter 1987 fight over Judge Robert H. Borks failed Supreme Court nomination has come of age.Mr. McGahn and nearly all the lawyers working for him at the White House are longtime society participants, so relationships built on the network of like-minded conservatives saturate discussions of potential nominees from the inside, they said.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Mr. Trump has also had help from the Senate Judiciary Committee chairman, Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, in lowering impediments and keeping the confirmation assembly line moving.For example, confirmation hearings have usually featured just one appellate hopeful at a time (along with several district judge nominees).But Mr. Grassley has scheduled three hearings this year with two appellate nominees as many as took place during all eight years of the Obama administration, according to congressional aides.The independent guardrail role of the American Bar Association, which has vetted potential judges since the Eisenhower administration conducting confidential interviews with people who worked with them and rating their experience, integrity and temperament is also weakening.Picks by presidents of both parties have sometimes run into trouble, but Republicans have accused the group of bias against conservatives.Traditionally, the groups volunteers vet potential judges before the White House decides whether to send their names to the Senate, but Mr. Trump like President George W. Bush exiled it from that role, leaving it scrambling to evaluate nominees afterward.Already this year, Mr. Grassley has held hearings for four district judge nominees before the group finished its work which happened with only seven during the eight Bush years.Photo The bar group later deemed two of them unqualified to be trial judges, saying they lacked sufficient trial experience.On Thursday, the Judiciary Committee nevertheless advanced both to the Senate floor.One, Holly Teeter, a 38-year-old federal prosecutor who fell just shy of the bar groups minimum standard of 12 years of experience, gained bipartisan approval.But the other, Brett Talley, a 36-year-old with virtually no trial experience and who wrote politically charged blog posts on topics like gun rights, had a party-line vote.Republicans may go further in ousting the group from its semiofficial gatekeeping role after it rated L. Steven Grasz, Mr. Trumps nominee for the appeals court in St. Louis, as not qualified to be a judge, portraying him as gratuitously rude and unlikely to separate his role as an advocate from that of a judge on matters like abortion.The White House is weighing telling future nominees not to sign confidentiality waivers that give A.B.A.evaluators access to disciplinary action records and not to interview with the bar group, an official said.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Conservatives are also pressuring Mr. Grassley to reduce one of the few remaining constraints on letting a president with an allied Senate majority appoint whomever he wants to a life-tenured judgeship: the Judiciary Committees blue slip practice, named for the color of the paper that senators use to sign off on nominees for judgeships in their states.While it has been handled differently in different eras, throughout the Obama years, Mr. Grassley and his Democratic predecessor, Senator Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont, refused to let the confirmation process proceed for nominees without two positive blue slips.That approach forces presidents to consult with senators and, when they are from opposite parties, incentivizes the compromise selection of relative moderates.Senator Al Franken, Democrat of Minnesota, has announced he will not return a blue slip for David R. Stras, an appeals court nominee who is a Minnesota Supreme Court justice and is on Mr. Trumps short list for the United States Supreme Court, saying he was not meaningfully consulted and objected to him.(An administration official said the White House had primarily negotiated with Minnesotas senior senator, Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat who did turn in a blue slip.)Conservatives want Mr. Grassley to hold a hearing anyway.Democratic senators in Oregon and Wisconsin have also not turned in blue slips for pending appellate nominees, but the question of how much control senators will retain over judicial appointments in their states is not limited to partisan politics.Senator John Kennedy, Republican of Louisiana, has not returned a blue slip for Kyle Duncan, an appeals court nominee who represented conservative clients in several culture-war cases, including whether corporations may refuse to provide contraception coverage to employees based on owners religious beliefs, and whether transgender students may be barred from using the school bathrooms of their gender identities.The Judicial Crisis Network, an opaquely funded group that runs ads pressuring Democratic senators not to block Trump nominees, has begun airing ads in Louisiana supporting Mr. Duncan.Mr. Franken warned that if the blue-slip constraint eroded, Republican senators would lose, too and not just when Democrats regained power.But many conservatives want to take full advantage of their window of opportunity.Mr. Leo, of the Federalist Society, said Mr. Trump had instructed his transition team to prioritize appointing conservative judges who would be strong and could resist tremendous political and social pressure.Mr. Trump understood that the American people cared about judges, and he for his own purposes cared very deeply about it and recognized that he could be a president who could help restore the judiciary to its proper role, he said.
Full Transcript of Trumps Remarks on Russia:::::TRUMP: Its going to save tremendous numbers of lives.And we did that very quickly.We agreed very quickly.As you know, we saw each other last night just for a picture, and that was the first time.And then today we had a round table with numerous countries.You have a list of the countries, obviously.Right?You have a list.And we spoke intermittently during that round table.We seem to have a very good feeling for each other and a good relationship considering we dont know each other well.I think its a very good relationship.We had two or three very short conversations because of the meeting, the fact that were at a meeting.But during those conversations, we talked about Syria and de-conflicting, etc.You know, we have areas where troops are facing our troops I mean, their troops are facing our troops and theres nothing in between.And we issued a statement a joint statement.It was just approved, and I think people are going to be extremely happy with it and also very impressed with it.REPORTER: Did Russias attempts to meddle in U.S. elections come up in the conversation?TRUMP: He said he didnt meddle.He said he didnt meddle.I asked him again.You can only ask so many times.But I just asked him again, and he said he absolutely did not meddle in our election.He did not do what theyre saying he did.And he said REPORTER: Do you believe him?TRUMP: Well, look, I cant stand there and argue with him.Id rather have him get out of Syria, to be honest with you.Id rather have him you know, work with him on the Ukraine than standing and arguing about whether or not because that whole thing was set up by the Democrats.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.I mean, they ought to look at Podesta.They ought to look at all of the things that theyve done with the phony dossier.Those are the big events.Those are the big events.Advertisement Continue reading the main story But Putin said he did not do what they said he did.And, you know, there are those that say, if he did do it, he wouldnt have gotten caught, all right?Which is a very interesting statement.But we have a you know, we have a good feeling toward getting things done.If we had a relationship with Russia, that would be a good thing.In fact, it would be a great thing, not a bad thing.Because he could really help us in North Korea.We have a big problem with North Korea.And China is helping us.And because of the lack of a relationship that we have with Russia because of this artificial thing thats happening with this Democratic-inspired thing, we could really be helped a lot, tremendously, with Russia having to do with North Korea.And, you know, youre talking about millions and millions of lives.This isnt baby stuff.This is the real deal.And if Russia helped us, in addition to China, that problem would go away a lot faster.REPORTER: How did you bring up the issue of election meddling?Did you ask him a question?TRUMP: He just every time he sees me, he says, I didnt do that.And I believe I really believe that when he tells me that, he means it.But he says, I didnt do that.I think hes very insulted by it, if you want to know the truth.Dont forget, all he said is he never did that, he didnt do that.I think hes very insulted by it, which is not a good thing for our country.Because again, if we had a relationship with Russia, North Korea which is our single biggest problem right now North Korea, it would be helped a lot.I think Im doing very well with respect to China.Theyve cut off financing; theyve cut off bank lines; theyve cut off lots of oil and lots of other things, lots of trade.And its having a big impact.But Russia, on the other hand, may be making up the difference.And if they are, thats not a good thing.So having a relationship with Russia would be a great thing not a good thing it would be a great thing, especially as it relates to North Korea.And Ill say this, Hillary had her stupid reset button that she spelled the word wrong, but she doesnt have what it takes to have that kind of a relationship where you could call or you could do something and they would pull back from North Korea, or theyd pull back from Syria, or maybe pull back from Ukraine.I mean, if we could solve the Ukraine problem Advertisement Continue reading the main story But this is really an artificial barrier thats put in front of us for solving problems with Russia, and he says that very strongly.He really seems to be insulted by it, and he says he didnt do it.So REPORTER: (Inaudible) do you believe him TRUMP: Excuse me?REPORTER: Even if he (inaudible) one-on-one, do you believe him?TRUMP: I think that he is very, very strong in the fact that he didnt do it.And then you look, and you look at whats going on with Podesta, and you look at whats going on with the server from the D.N.C.and why didnt the F.B.I.take it, why did they leave it, why did a third party look at the server and not the FBI if you look at all of this stuff, and you say, whats going on here?And then you hear its 17 agencies.Well, its three.And one is Brennan and one is whatever.I mean, give me a break.Theyre political hacks.So you look at it I mean, you have Brennan, you have Clapper, and you have Comey.Comey is proven now to be a liar and hes proven to be a leaker.So you look at that, and you have President Putin very strongly, vehemently says he had nothing to do with that.Now, youre not going to get into an argument.Youre going to start talking about Syria and the Ukraine.
Republicans Try to Block Moores Path as Candidate Denies Sexual Misconduct:::::The frenzy reflected not just the worry over the Senate seat once held by Jeff Sessions, now the attorney general, but also the broader danger of the Republican Partys being associated with Mr. Moore.If Doug Jones, the Democratic nominee, wins next month, Mr. McConnells majority will shrink to one, possibly imperiling the Republican push to overhaul the tax code and most everything else that lawmakers are aiming to do to reverse their spiral before the midterm elections.It could also raise at least the potential that Democrats could seize control of the Senate in 2018, by holding all of their endangered seats and winning Republican seats in Nevada and Arizona.But if Mr. Moore wins, the party faces a potentially more untenable prospect: welcoming a child-molesting suspect into their ranks, a move that every Republican candidate would have to answer for.That raised memories of Todd Akin, the Republican Senate candidate who in 2012 said victims of legitimate rape rarely got pregnant, an assertion that Democrats hung around every candidate that year.And Mr. Moores interview within the sympathetic confines of Mr. Hannitys show, which was also an initial safe harbor for Mr. Akin in 2012, made Republicans in the capital only more determined that he had to step aside.I dont remember ever dating any girl without the permission of her mother, Mr. Moore told Mr. Hannity.Asked by Mr. Hannity if he ever dated teenagers when he was in his 30s, Mr. Moore equivocated, replying, Not generally, no.Some Senate Republicans have encouraged Mr.Strange who lost to Mr. Moore in a bitterly contested Republican runoff election in September to run as a write-in candidate, an option Mr.Strange is considering, according to Republicans who have spoken with him.But some Republicans believe he would do little more than play spoiler, ensuring either that Mr. Moore is elected by taking votes Mr. Jones would otherwise get or that the Democrat wins by siphoning support from Mr. Moore among Republicans seeking a palatable third option.Mr. McConnell and Senator Cory Gardner of Colorado, the chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, spoke with Mr.Strange about the prospect immediately after the Moore news broke on Thursday, according to Republicans familiar with the conversation.And Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, who won re-election in 2010 as a write-in candidate, was planning to discuss logistics with Mr.Strange this weekend.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Asked Friday if he thought Mr.Strange should run as a write-in candidate, Mr. McConnell said only that youd have to ask Luther what his intentions are, given this development.Republicans in Washington and Alabama have also approached other potential candidates about a write-in effort, including Representative Robert B. Aderholt, a mainstream conservative from northern Alabama.But it is unclear that any prominent Republican will be willing to mount a wild-card campaign for the Senate unless Mr. Moore stands down first.Absent Mr. Moores cooperation, Republicans in Washington have conferred with election lawyers to explore other long-shot options for replacing or marginalizing him, several of which would probably lead to a clash in court with Mr. Moore and his supporters.One approach that Republicans are considering, according to people briefed on the deliberations, would involve asking Gov.Kay Ivey to order a new date for the election sometime early next year and giving the party time to ease Mr. Moore from the race.Photo Alabama election law requires candidates to withdraw at least 76 days before an election in order to be replaced on the ballot, a deadline Mr. Moore has already missed.State law gives the governor broad authority to set the date of special elections, and Ms. Ivey, who is a Republican, already rescheduled the Senate election once, after inheriting the governors office in April when her predecessor, Robert Bentley, resigned in a sex and corruption scandal.Ms. Iveys advisers have not ruled out exercising that power again, according to Republicans in touch with her camp, but she has signaled that she would like reassurances of support from the White House before taking such an aggressive step.Scott Jennings, a Republican strategist close to Mr. McConnell, said presidential intervention was needed to bring any order to the situation in Alabama.He suggested that President Trump could personally nudge Mr. Moore out of the race and back a write-in campaign by Mr.Strange, or perhaps Mr.Sessions, a popular figure with Alabama Republicans.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Youve got a wild-card politician, who may or may not support your agenda, whos now got horrific allegations of molestation of a child, Mr. Jennings said, referring to Mr. Moore.It strikes me that the people of Alabama would listen to the president.A spokesman for Ms. Ivey did not reply to an email asking about her intentions, but she has been in contact with Nick Ayers, Vice President Mike Pences chief of staff, according to Republican officials.Advertisement Continue reading the main story But there is no apparent precedent for rescheduling an election so close to the planned vote, Republicans acknowledged.In addition to state election laws, such an extreme step could also run afoul of federal voting rights law.Then there is the possibility that if Mr. Moore stayed in the race and won, the members of the Senate would deny him a seat.While sidestepping a question about whether he would support such an extraordinary step, Mr. McConnell recalled how, as a relatively junior senator, he pushed to oust Senator Bob Packwood, Republican of Oregon, a long-serving and powerful figure, after a throng of women came forward to accuse Mr. Packwood of sexually harassing or abusing them.I ended up making a motion to expel the chairman of the Finance Committee of my own party, which was approved unanimously, and he subsequently resigned, Mr. McConnell said.So character does count in America and in the United States Senate.While maintaining his typically stoic public face, Mr. McConnell was said to be highly irritated that, after he had fended off problematic candidates in recent years, Mr. Moore had instantly revived the type of difficulties Republicans suffered with Mr. Akin and other hard-liners.But in Alabama, Republicans appeared far more willing to give Mr. Moore the benefit of the doubt.Lets let this thing work out, said Trip Pittman, a state senator.Youre innocent until proven otherwise.Mr. Pittman urged Mr. Moore to aggressively rebut the claims.That, he said, would be really helpful.Alabamas congressional Republicans remained silent on Friday, wanting to see how emphatically Mr. Moore responded to the charges, but there were conversations about eventually issuing a joint statement.Some of them were rattled and not just because of the Moore story.Advertisement Continue reading the main story As members of the states House delegation arrived Thursday in Birmingham, Ala., for a fund-raiser with Speaker Paul D. Ryan, there were hydraulic problems with the plane as it touched down.Shortly after enduring a bumpy landing, their phones lit up to reveal The Posts report.For their part, Democrats appear to be ready to join the fray.The party had been holding back, in part out of fear that getting involved could nationalize the election and compromise Mr. Joness brand as an independent-minded local candidate.But on Friday, Democratic donors appeared increasingly interested in the race.Stephen J. Cloobeck, a Nevada hotel magnate who contributed $500,000 last year to a Senate-focused Democratic super PAC, described Mr. Moore as despicable and said he would gladly direct money to Mr. Jones.If theres an event, I will participate, because I have a 14-year-old little girl, and if anyone touched her, Id kill them, Mr. Cloobeck said.Id kill them.
Alabama Republicans Defend Roy Moore: It Was 40 Years Ago:::::Total contrived media garbage Thats how John Skipper, 66, a former chairman of the Mobile County Republican Party, characterized the claims, speaking to The New York Times.He said that he and other Alabama Republicans would continue to support their candidate and echoed Mr. Moores assertion that the Democratic Party had been behind the story.Most of them will not be shocked, he said, and will rather be expecting these shenanigans being pulled by the Democrats as standard operating procedure.Mary was a teenager and Joseph was an adult carpenter Alabamas state auditor, Jim Ziegler, told The Washington Examiner that the womens claims were much ado about nothing and said that Mr. Moore had done nothing immoral or illegal.(Alabama law, both in 1979 and now, finds that someone who is 19 or older and has sexual contact with someone between the ages of 12 and 16 is guilty of second-degree sex abuse.)Mr. Ziegler sought to justify Mr. Moores actions by comparing him to the biblical Joseph, saying, Mary was a teenager and Joseph was an adult carpenter.They became parents of Jesus.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.You cant be a victim 40 years later Ed Henry, a state representative, told The Cullman Times, in Cullman County, Ala., that the women who came forward should be subject to legal action.If they believe this man is predatory, they are guilty of allowing him to exist for 40 years, he said.I think someone should prosecute and go after them.You cant be a victim 40 years later, in my opinion.Fourteen-year-olds dont make good decisions Daniel Dale, a reporter for The Toronto Star, contacted multiple Republican officials in the state and kept a running report of their responses to the story.Jerry Pow, the party chairman for Bibb County, told Mr. Dale that hed back Mr. Moore even if the candidate had committed a sex crime.Advertisement Continue reading the main story I would vote for Judge Moore because I wouldnt want to vote for Doug, he said.Im not saying I support what he did.Others, including the party chairmen for Covington County, William Blocker, and Mobile County, John Skipper, dismissed the story as a Democratic trick.Mr. Blocker said that he would not change his mind even if there was proof that Mr. Moore was guilty.Riley Seibenhener, the party chairman in Geneva County, told Mr. Dale that if the allegations were true, he would not support the candidate.But he also said that Mr. Moore was not guilty of forcible rape.I know that 14-year-olds dont make good decisions, he said.
Trump Administration Guiding Health Shoppers to Agents Paid by Insurers:::::From there, consumers can connect with a service the administration added this year specifically to connect them with licensed agents and brokers who can provide immediate assistance.Get help now!says a federal website describing the new service, called Help on Demand.A marketplace-registered agent or broker will contact you in 30 minutes or less to help you enroll.Agents and brokers services are generally free to you.Theyre usually paid for by insurance companies.More than 43,000 agents and brokers have received training and been certified to sell health plans through the federal marketplace.Their advocates said they could provide a lifeline for consumers in a confusing and troubled marketplace.Michael Lujan, a former president of the California Association of Health Underwriters, called agents the unsung heroes of health care and the marketplace.The Trump administration set out to sabotage the Affordable Care Act by defunding many of the nonprofit navigator groups, Mr. Lujan said.Agents can help fill the gap.Agents and brokers can recommend specific health insurance plans and typically receive commissions paid by the insurers whose plans they sell.By contrast, nonprofit navigators and other assisters cannot recommend specific plans.In fact, the Trump administration recently warned navigators that they could not accept payment from an insurer and could not be paid even by their own organizations on a per-application or per-enrollee basis.The website for the Help on Demand service is operated by BigWave Systems, a privately held technology company in Colorado, in partnership with HealthCare.gov, the federal marketplace.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Personal and financial information provided by consumers is confidential.But an assessment prepared by the Department of Health and Human Services says, BigWave Systems makes no warranties or representations regarding the security of the data submitted to the Help On Demand application, and use of the Help On Demand website is at the consumers own risk.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Marcia Benshoof, a spokeswoman for BigWave Systems, said that personal information was encrypted and stored behind a firewall and that there had not been any unauthorized disclosures.The administration has reduced funds for the navigator program by 41 percent, to $36.9 million, from $62.9 million last year.Among the states hit the hardest, according to data provided to Congress by the administration, are Georgia, down 61 percent; Michigan, down 72 percent; New Jersey, down 62 percent; and Ohio, down 71 percent.A survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that insurance agents and nonprofit navigator groups differed in some ways.People using agents last year were less likely to be uninsured and less likely to have income low enough to qualify for Medicaid, it said.California has had one of the most successful health insurance marketplaces in the country, and has studied the lessons to be learned from its experience.Agents are funded by health plan commissions and do not have an incentive or the resources to promote the overall marketplace, said Peter V. Lee, the executive director of the states exchange.But he added, Many of them are small-business owners who are trusted voices in their communities, and they have enrolled hundreds of thousands of people in California.Agents enrolled 47 percent of the people who had coverage this year through the state-run insurance marketplace known as Covered California.By contrast, nonprofit navigator groups generated about 3 percent of enrollment, according to the agency that runs the state marketplace.Many customers said they had bought insurance on their own without receiving assistance.Patricia R. Martin of Chardon, Ohio, said she had always had health insurance through a large company for which her husband worked.When he died suddenly at 54, she said, she had to find other coverage, and a local agent provided invaluable assistance.Health insurance just boggles my mind, Ms. Martin said.Its fine to go online, but Id much rather deal with a person.I have complete faith in my agent.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The open enrollment period for the federal marketplace lasts 45 days.But Nicholas A. Moriello, an insurance agent in Delaware, said agents do marketing and outreach to customers throughout the year and typically receive a commission or fee for each month that a consumer remains enrolled in a health plan.Agents and brokers are able to provide our recommendations to consumers, and thats something theyve really needed in trying to evaluate their choices, Mr. Moriello said.But in the same way that federal funding has been reduced for navigators, insurance companies all around the country have reduced the compensation that they pay to agents and brokers, and in some states they have eliminated it altogether.So I fear that in this years open enrollment, there may be a reduction in the number of agents and brokers for consumers to turn to.But with rising premiums, shrinking options and much confusion, consumers need more help.Kelly L. Rector, an insurance broker in OFallon, Mo., near St. Louis, said many of her clients were being required to give up their physicians because Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield was pulling out of the local market and a company entering the market, Centene, had a slimmer network with fewer doctors to choose from.Besides an increase in premiums for 2018, Ms. Rector said, the biggest issue for some of my clients is that they will be unable to continue to see any of their current doctors.
The Power of the Courts Is Messing Up Politics:::::Photo AS four newly Senate-approved federal appellate judges move into their chambers seven months after Neil Gorsuch joined the Supreme Court, they may seem to have vindicated conservatives who swallowed their qualms about Donald Trump last year out of a conviction that, whatever his flaws, he would save the judiciary.Yet this but the courts defense of Mr. Trump says less about him than it does about the courts: namely, that their importance is swollen beyond constitutional recognition.If a branch of government that Alexander Hamilton dismissed as the least dangerous can overshadow every other concern about Mr. Trump, the branch is more dangerous than it was supposed to be.Originalists who believe these judges will help to tame judicial overreach should credit Mr. Trump for the appointments.But all should take notice of the fact that the but the courts argument reveals a judiciary of outsize importance.Conservatives did not always hold the judiciary in such awe.Judge Robert Bork, whose nomination to the Supreme Court the Senate rejected three decades ago, became a martyr to the cause of originalism because he believed in the courts demotion in the constitutional scheme from the inflated role they had assumed under Chief Justice Earl Warren.Using the same reasoning, Mr. Bork also criticized conservative judges of earlier generations, like those who overruled economic reforms in the Progressive Era.Now, however, as a constitutional matter, deference to the judiciary unites a broad coalition of right and left, which dispute how, not whether, the judiciary should exercise a far-reaching power to overrule the peoples elected representatives.Liberals have long argued in favor of an extensive understanding of individual rights, especially on issues such as privacy, a stance to which Mr. Borks judicial modesty was a correction.Originalism is a diverse movement that consists of both opponents and supporters of Mr. Trumps election.Many of them still support a deferential judiciary, but growing numbers seek control of the courts to promote conservative ends.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.The but the courts argument for voting for Mr. Trump percolated largely from grass-roots quarters, among religious conservatives in particular where one would have expected the most hostility to Mr. Trump.Deflating the power of the judiciary might help to normalize our politics and help restore the primacy of considerations like policy and character in the choice of public officials.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Courts have removed wide areas of jurisdiction from the publics authority, corroding the ethic of measured majority rule that James Madison described as the vital principle of our free Constitution.Elected officials have been willing participants eager to shed their responsibility to the courts despite the fact that the Constitution imbues them with ample authority to exercise it themselves.When President Barack Obama used executive authority to provide subsidies for health care that House Republicans said the Affordable Care Act did not authorize, they did not retaliate legislatively, as Madisons Federalist 51 the paper that based the separation of powers on each branchs propensity to defend its own turf would have predicted.Instead, they sued, essentially asking the judiciary to shelter them rather than sticking up for themselves.When they raised constitutional objections to Mr. Obamas executive order on immigration, Representative Jim Clyburn, Democrat of South Carolina, dismissed them by disclaiming the authority that the Constitution had placed in his hands: Thats not for Congress to decide, thats why we have courts to make that decision.
Were Sick of Racism, Literally:::::Photo Estifanos Zerai-Misgun, a black Brookline, Mass., police officer, pulled up in an unmarked car and greeted his superior, a white lieutenant.He wasnt prepared for the response by the lieutenant, who said, as he gestured at the vehicle, Who would put a black man behind one of these?I was shocked, the officer later told a Boston news station about the experience.It was one of several derogatory racial comments he would hear on the job.It got so bad that he and a black colleague walked away from the force in 2015.The statements theyd heard were offensive and at times threatening in the moment, but they also made the men fear for their safety at work in a broader sense: The black officers werent sure that the white colleagues who were so willing to antagonize them would back them up if they were attacked on patrol.Even if Mr. Zerai-Misgun and his colleague were never directly physically harmed, the experience probably took a toll on their bodies.Perceptions of discrimination like those the officers experienced, as well as those that are less direct, may make us sick.And in the current political environment, with its high-profile expressions of racism, sexism, anti-Semitism, Islamophobia, homophobia and xenophobia, along with widely covered acts of hate and bigotry, countless Americans are at risk of this type of harm.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Take Mr. Zerai-Misgun as an example.Chances are, in reaction to each instance of perceived discrimination, he had a stress response.His blood pressure increased, his heart rate went up, and his brain sent a signal to release cortisol.We know this because in 2008, researchers studied the effects of discrimination on blood pressure.Black and Latino study participants recorded their interactions with perceived racism and were outfitted with blood pressure monitors.The results were striking.While blood pressure normally dips at night, those who said theyd experienced racism were more likely to have blood pressure that did not and this has been strongly linked to increased mortality.Over time, this high blood pressure hardens our arteries, increasing the risk of a clot forming in our hearts or brains.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.In 2015, researchers examined the effect of discrimination on cortisol, a natural hormone that helps the body deal with stressful situations.They followed black and white children in Maryland, measuring their perceived racial discrimination starting in seventh grade and for 20 years thereafter.When study participants were in their early 30s, researchers calculated their cortisol levels.Perceptions of discrimination consistently predicted slower declines in cortisol level throughout the day, which is associated with obesity, depression, decreased immune function, cancer and death.
Social Media and Democracy:::::Discreet changes to the underlying algorithms of these platforms have immense power over what is seen by users but, more important, they affect what goes unseen.But Silicon Valley corporations are willfully opaque in explaining how and where their algorithms work, what their objectives are and whom they are ultimately benefiting.To call these platforms a mirror fails to acknowledge the role that ideology plays in their construction and the power Big Tech has to determine the winners and losers in our society.JASON FRIEDMAN, BROOKLYN To the Editor: Re How to Fix Facebook?We Asked 9 Experts (news article, Nov. 1): I found the suggested fixes to Facebook et al.unhelpful, focused on technical tweaks or appeals to somehow make us nicer or more knowledgeable.Facebook, Twitter and so forth are publishers of readers posts.The closest comparison to them is perhaps the letters column of The New York Times.You curate your letters page very carefully; so should they.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.It is no excuse to protest that they simply have too much ink to ever be able to do this.If you provide a huge platform, you should have a huge number of people looking after it.Like any publisher, they should be legally responsible for what they publish.ANTHONY J. WALTERS, CHICAGO To the Editor: Getting the toothpaste back into the tube will not be easy.Its been clear for some time now that social media is an instrument of chaos.It is the equivalent of millions of people standing on soapboxes on the street and shouting things at you.Many of the things are false, some are abusive and a lot of people hide behind curtains so you cant know their true identities.As more and more Americans believe what they see on social media, they will not agree on what is real and what is fake.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Democracy requires an informed and involved citizenry, and if the people in the country cannot even agree on what is actually happening, then how can our democracy survive?It may be too late, but at the very least Facebook and the others must limit their news feeds to only what comes from legitimate, acknowledged professional journalism sources.There will still be a lot of alternate facts, conspiracy theories and plain lies bandied about by both innocent and willful postings, and the sites certainly should provide fact-checks about any of these that gain currency.But to wean people, especially young people, away from social media and back to legitimate news sources may be an impossible task.MICHAEL SPIELMAN, BRONX To the Editor: While reports of entities associated with the Russian government posting propagandistic material on social media outlets are undoubtedly true, those reports are neither surprising nor significant.It is no secret that outlets such as Facebook and Twitter are online gossip boards rather than journalistic or scholarly venues.What is surprising is that people would base important decisions on social media postings since verification of their accuracy is virtually impossible.Doing so is intellectually lazy at best.PAUL ROMERO, OAKLAND, CALIF.
Women Cracked Wartime Codes. They Can Fix Tech Today, Too.:::::When most Americans think about our veterans on Veterans Day and all too infrequently in between they often think of acts of valor as fixed in an earlier era.But the story of our countrys female veterans, pressed into service at a trying time, can tell us a lot about challenges we face today, as can the contributions of those civilian women, like Caracristi, who played a critical role in the wartime military effort.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.In certain important ways, the early 1940s were a progressive, experimental era in which the military recruited from many quarters.That era can give us clues to performing better in all sectors today.During the worst, costliest, bloodiest war in American history, it was an inclusive mind-set that helped the Allies defeat the Nazis.Women were key to any number of wartime advances, but their presence was crucial in intelligence and communications, as well as in the arena that combines both: signals intelligence, or code breaking.World War II was a war of encrypted signals.As armies and navies fought in distant corners of the globe, combatants developed myriad code and cipher systems to cloak their radio and telegraph communications, and code breaking came into its own as a way to eavesdrop on enemy plans.Advertisement Continue reading the main story More than half of the American code-breaking force was female roughly 10,000 women.Many were college graduates who had been shut out of graduate schools and excluded from fields such as math and engineering, and who now had a place for their talents.Even before Americas formal entry into war, women formed an important part of the civilian staff in clandestine offices that were attempting to break Japanese and European systems.One such was Genevieve Grotjan, a mathematician who aspired to teach college-level math but was unable to find any university math department willing to hire her.She joined a team trying to break Purple, a cipher-generating machine used by Japanese diplomats.The team labored for more than a year; in September 1940, Grotjan spotted the coincidence that broke the cipher.The breakthrough provided key intelligence for the entire war and those officials privy to the contents called it Magic.Once the attack on Pearl Harbor brought America into the war, the countrys code-breaking offices were enlarged.As men were shipped overseas as fast as ships could get them there, military leaders and Congress realized that the United States could not staff a multi-ocean war using only men, and so womens military groups were created.Women went to work in air traffic control towers and, despite fears they would become hysterical in a crisis, kept their wits.In addition to the millions of female factory workers, women ran radios and radar, worked as chemists, bacteriologists and gunnery instructors and calculated weapon trajectories.Those who tested high for aptitude were routed into two top-secret code-breaking centers in the Washington area, one for the Army and one for the Navy.Other women joined the Office of Strategic Services, forerunner of the C.I.A.A Vassar math professor, Grace Hopper, helped develop the Navys Mark I computer.A team of women programmed the Armys first large-scale, general-purpose digital computer.(Programming at the time was considered somewhat secretarial, which is why women were employed to do it.)Its not too much of a stretch to say that inclusion the willingness to welcome genius is one reason the right side won the war.The country also benefited from the contributions of other marginalized groups, including Navajo code talkers, Tuskegee airmen and other black troops (including women) serving in a segregated military.Advertisement Continue reading the main story There is a lesson here for the tech bros. Economists have long been mystified by the impulse to discriminate, given that shutting out any group deprives society of advances.Studies show that diverse teams get better results.Inclusion never entails lowering the bar.It enlarges the pool of talent and brings the best people in.To be sure, even during the war, inclusion was seen as a temporary emergency measure, and the spectacle of tens of thousands of young women boarding trains to the nations capital unnerved many.Ads and posters featured plaintive children asking, Mother, when will you stay home again?After the war, backlash set in.The female code breakers got very little public credit for their achievements, and credit would be a long time coming for towering figures like Grace Hopper.And so here we are: The notion that genius is a male trait has once again raised its head.In todays rhetorical climate, its not just a handful of entitled engineers who feel empowered to impugn certain groups.The same animus lies behind the Trump administrations eagerness to exclude refugees, and behind the proposed ban on transgender people serving in the military.In gratuitously acting to exclude willing citizens from military service, the president has declined to avail himself of the array of ingenuity and courage this nation has to offer.World War II is a reminder that, when freedom hung in the balance, inclusion kept us safe.Its also a reminder that our military once took the lead on social change at a time when more families felt connected to military service.Now we are greatly divided.Were losing a key military edge and could lose a technical one, if we give in to the notion that some groups are more gifted than others.History has shown that exclusion tends to be the approach of, as Donald Trump might put it, the losers.
The Swine of Conservatism:::::But there are other styles of predation that flourish within conservative communities.For instance, there is the burrower, the networker, the institutionalist the predator who embeds himself within a hierarchical system that protects him because it wants to protect itself.Many Catholic priest-abusers fit this pattern.Their clerical authority didnt always keep them from getting chased out of parishes.But they were networked with other predators who helped them skate through to the next assignment, and the larger ecclesiastical entity saw its own self-protection as more important than their punishment.Then finally there is the serial repenter the creep who relies on the promise of forgiveness to keep his place and his powers and his opportunities to prey again.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.Here, too, Biblical precedents are often invoked in the predators defense.Didnt King David sleep around?Doesnt every saint have a past, every sinner a future?All good Christian wisdom except that some sinners only want a future where they can return to the same old awful sins.All these predatory categories overlap, of course, and they also overlap with the way predators operate in liberal circles.Harvey Weinstein ran Miramax the same way an abusive religious leader rules his cult.Bill Clinton was both a liberal pig backing feminist causes to buy immunity and a serial repenter in the style of his Baptist youth.A liberal academic eminence grooming disciples to be victims has a lot in common with a man of God who does the same.But still there is enough thats unique about conservative styles of predation to draw some lessons for tradition-oriented cultures and communities.One lesson is that any social order that vests particular forms of power in men needs to do more, not less, to hold the male of the species accountable.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Some cultural conservatives, in evangelical Christianity especially, combine a belief in male headship in churches and families with a boys will be boys and girls shouldnt tempt them attitude toward sex.Its a combination thats self-contradictory and deeply toxic, handing men not just power but a permission slip to abuse it which, predictably, they do.Another lesson is that the impulse to hide or dismiss scandal because it hurts the short-term cause, which is common to all institutions but particularly strong for conservative ones, is a path to self-destruction in the long run.Again, the Catholic Churchs sex abuse experience is a case study.And we may be watching something similar happen with evangelicals, who decided with Donald Trump and may decide with Roy Moore that in the war against secular liberalism, they simply cant afford to police the morals of their leaders.Its a theory that makes sense if you think only of todays elections, but in the long term its cultural suicide because it tells your neighbors and your children that your religious convictions are always secondary to your partisanship.For nothing is hidden that will not be made manifest, nor is anything secret that will not be known and come to light.These words apply everywhere now, to Hollywood pagans and Alabama Christians alike.But the Christians have particular reasons to meditate upon them and to consider that they dont just apply to sexual predations, but to the worldly impulses that make otherwise decent people into defenders of the indefensible.
Trump Team Begins Drafting Middle East Peace Plan:::::Mr. Trump, who considers himself a dealmaker, decided to adopt the challenge when he took office in January, intrigued at the idea of succeeding where other presidents failed, and he assigned the effort to Jared Kushner, his son-in-law and senior adviser.Neither had any background with the issue and the effort was greeted with scorn, but the fact that the president entrusted it to a close relative was taken as a sign of seriousness in the region.Mr. Trumps team sees the convergence of factors that make the moment ripe, including an increased willingness by Arab states to finally solve the issue to refocus attention on Iran, which they consider the bigger threat.With that in mind, Egypt is brokering a reconciliation between Mr. Abbas, who presides in the West Bank, and Hamas, which controls Gaza, a deal that would cement the Palestinian Authority as the representative of the Palestinian people.Saudi Arabia has summoned Mr. Abbas to Riyadh to reinforce the importance of a deal.The stars begin to align in a way that creates a moment, said Nimrod Novik, a fellow at the Israel Policy Forum who served as foreign policy adviser to former Prime Minister Shimon Peres, who negotiated the Oslo Accords in the 1990s.But obviously the two key questions are will Prime Minister Netanyahu decide to go for it and will President Trump, once hes presented a plan by his team, decide its worth the political capital required.Still, neither Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel nor President Mahmoud Abbas of the Palestinian Authority is in a strong position to negotiate.Mr. Netanyahu faces corruption investigations and pressure from the right in his narrow coalition not to make concessions, while Mr. Abbas is aging and endures strong opposition among his own constituents.Photo Skepticism abounds, especially among those who spent years struggling to overcome the same challenges with the same set of tools.President Barack Obama and his advisers debated putting forth their own parameters for a deal last year, but ultimately opted against even a general set of principles as time ran out on his administration.Theres nothing new under the sun when it comes to Middle East peace, said Philip Gordon, a White House Middle East coordinator under Mr. Obama.When you get into these details, thats when you come up against the strong objections of the two sides.If they dont want it to be dead on arrival, they may wind up with vague principles, but as weve seen, even vague principles are beyond what the parties are willing to embrace.Tamara Cofman Wittes, a State Department official under Mr. Obama, said both Israeli and Palestinian leaders are heavily constrained not only by their own governing coalitions but by suspicious and risk-averse publics.Its hard even for willing political leaders to make major concessions under those circumstances, she said.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The core four-member team drafting the plan includes Mr. Kushner, Mr. Greenblatt, Dina H. Powell, a deputy national security adviser, and David M. Friedman, the ambassador to Israel.They are consulting with Donald Blome, the consul general in Jerusalem, and others from the State Department and National Security Council.Officials said the effort may take until early next year.Mr. Trump and his team make no bones about being pro-Israel.The president has boasted of being Israels biggest friend and Mr. Kushner, Mr. Greenblatt and Mr. Friedman are all Orthodox Jews with ties to Israel.But Ms. Powell is an Egyptian-born Coptic Christian and Mr. Kushner has developed strong ties with the Saudis and other Arabs and recently returned from a visit to Riyadh.Mr. Trump has met with Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Abbas three times each.The team has drawn praise from across the spectrum.We do believe this is a historic opportunity, and we will spare no effort to support President Trumps investment in a better future, Husam Zomlot, the Palestinian Authoritys envoy to Washington, said in an interview.During a trip to London this month, Mr. Netanyahu said, They are trying to think out of the box.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Barak Ravid, an Israeli journalist who has broken stories on the American effort, wrote in the left-leaning Haaretz newspaper last spring that Mr. Trump had succeeded in bringing peace, which in recent years had become a dirty word, back to the center of Israeli public and political discourse.But privately, officials from both sides express concern that Mr. Trump and his team are still nave about the Middle East and ineffective in accomplishing their objectives.Dennis Ross, the veteran Middle East peace negotiator, said Mr. Trumps team has done a very good job of presenting themselves as having listened and is now taken seriously in the region.Photo The decision to present a concrete plan makes sense if ground is prepared in advance.If you simply resume negotiations and nothing accompanies it, nobody will take it seriously, Mr. Ross said.People will say weve seen this movie before.You have to show people no, something is different this time.Some analysts said they believed Mr. Trumps plan may come with confidence-building provisions that each side will already have agreed to.For Israel, it could include limiting settlement construction to current blocs without taking new land, recommitting to a two-state solution and redesignating a small part of the West Bank to give Palestinians more control.For the Palestinians, it could include resuming full security cooperation with Israel, holding off seeking further international recognition and ending payments to families of Palestinians imprisoned for terrorist attacks.Arab states, particularly Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Jordan, could add their own commitments, like overflights by Israeli passenger planes, visas for business people and telecommunications links.Advertisement Continue reading the main story A White House official dismissed that as mere speculation.But the challenges of getting even to that stage are formidable, much less tackling harder questions.Mr. Zomlot, the Palestinian envoy, said any plan must establish a sovereign Palestinian state along the borders from before the 1967 Arab-Israeli war with East Jerusalem as its capital.This is not our maximum.This is our minimum, he said.What everybody needs to understand is the historic compromise has already been made.Israels allies in Washington are pressing from the other side.The House Foreign Affairs Committee on Wednesday will consider a bill to cut aid to the Palestinian Authority unless it ends payments to families of Palestinian attackers.If the Palestinians are going to be trustworthy partners in any kind of peace discussion, they have to show that theyre not inciting terrorism, said Representative Doug Lamborn, a Republican from Colorado sponsoring the legislation.And when you pay people and, in fact, if you pay them more, the more Jews they kill thats pure incitement to terrorism.Palestinian leaders say the payments are meant to help destitute families, not promote terrorism, and they accuse Israel of subsidizing violence by encouraging settlers in the West Bank.One compromise floated recently would have the Palestinian Authority help those families through a general welfare program that does not prioritize relatives of prisoners.Still, some analysts think Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Abbas are simply playing along with the goal of ensuring the other is blamed when the process collapses.The biggest impediment to the peace process is the two leaders, said Grant Rumley, a scholar at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies.Ultimately, both Netanyahu and Abbas just have this long, long history and theyve played this game really well.And they dont trust each other and I dont think they will ever get to the point where they will trust each other.
A Shadow Delegation Stalks the Official U.S. Team at Climate Talks:::::Yet seven in 10 Americans believe global warming is occurring, according to a Yale University survey, and more than 60 percent say they are at least somewhat worried about its effects.Theres a debate in the United States between the denialists who pooh-pooh any thought about climate change and the catastrophic dangers it portends, and those who agree with the scientific academies of every country in the world that were facing an existential threat and we have to do something about it, Governor Brown said Saturday.He and Mr. Bloomberg announced that the states, cities and businesses that had pledged to abide by the Paris accord were on track to meet the Obama administration pledge to cut emissions at least 26 percent below 2005 levels by 2025.Former Vice President Al Gore, a longtime champion of strong action on climate change, said Mr. Trump represented a minority view on the subject.President Trump does not speak for the country as a whole on the climate issue, Mr. Gore said.Of course hes our president, of course he has the authority that any president has.But on this issue he is very much out of sync with the country as a whole.According to a new report from Americas Pledge, a group led by Mr. Bloomberg and Mr. Brown, if the institutions working to meet the Obama targets were a separate country, they would be the third-largest economy in the world after the United States and China.Even as the Trump administration plans to roll back federal climate change policies like the Clean Power Plan, the study found, falling clean technology prices, the low price of natural gas and local carbon-cutting efforts have already cut domestic greenhouse gas emissions by 11.5 percent between 2005 and 2015.The official American negotiating team for now is laying low.Career State Department officials are managing the technical negotiations, speaking up on issues like demanding more transparency from developing countries on their progress cutting emissions.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The Trump administrations true debut will come Monday when a team from the White House hosts a forum promoting fossil fuels and nuclear energy.Speakers will include executives from Peabody Energy, a coal company; NuScale Power, a nuclear engineering firm; and Tellurian, a liquefied natural gas exporter.Christiana Figueres, a former United Nations climate envoy who spent her morning with the shadow American delegation, said the Trump administration was sending the wrong message to a conference aimed at decarbonizing the global economy.Coal is to be thanked for all of its hard work and it now deserves to be retired.It is of retirement age and needs to be put in the retirement home, Ms. Figueres said.Jim Lakely, a spokesman for the Heartland Institute, said he hoped United Nations climate delegates would also hear his groups message.Carbon dioxide is not a pollutant and it is not the driver of global warming, he said.So there is no moral case for restricting the use of fossil fuels, especially because that is vital to raising the quality and length of life of the worlds poorest people.Diplomats from other countries said they were glad to see governors, mayors and other Americans still committed to the Paris agreement making their presence felt.But they also said they werent sure which voice of American policy they should believe.Unfortunately theres no connect between those processes, said Dr. Ian Fry, lead negotiator for Tuvalu, a South Pacific island threatened by rising seas.Its just two worlds, unfortunately.
Trump Says Putin Means It About Not Meddling:::::Every time he sees me he says, I didnt do that, and I really believe that when he tells me that, he means it, Mr. Trump said of Mr. Putin.I think he is very insulted by it, which is not a good thing for our country.His remarks came as the investigation into the Trump campaigns ties to Russia deepened, with disclosures over the past two weeks showing that there were more contacts between Trump campaign advisers and Russians than were previously known, and that senior campaign officials were aware of them.And the comments inspired immediate ridicule from Democratic lawmakers, including Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, which is investigating Russian interference in the election.You know who else is insulted by it, Mr. President?The American people, Mr. Schiff said on Twitter.You believe a foreign adversary over your own intelligence agencies.Representative Ted Lieu, another California Democrat, called Mr. Trump dumb as a rock.Mr. Lieu wrote on Twitter that both he and Mr. Trump had seen classified information on Russias interference in the election, and that Mr. Trumps comments were lies.Trump knows the Kremlin hacked America last year, Mr. Lieu said.Senator John McCain of Arizona, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said in response to Mr. Trumps statements, Theres nothing America First about taking the word of a K.G.B.colonel over that of the American intelligence community.Mr. Trump heaped disdain on the former leaders of three American intelligence agencies John O. Brennan, the former C.I.A.director; James R. Clapper Jr., the former director of national intelligence; and James B. Comey, the F.B.I.director he fired this year appearing to suggest that they were less trustworthy than Mr. Putin.Advertisement Continue reading the main story I mean, give me a break theyre political hacks, Mr. Trump said.You have Brennan, you have Clapper, and you have Comey.Comeys proven now to be a liar, and hes proven to be a leaker, so you look at that.And you have President Putin very strongly, vehemently says he had nothing to do with that.The Central Intelligence Agency on Saturday declined to comment on the remarks by President Trump about Russian interference in the election.Last week, in response to questions about the views of the director, Mike Pompeo, on the intelligence assessment, the C.I.A.said the director stands by, and has always stood by, the January 2017 Intelligence Community Assessment.But since taking over the agency after being appointed by Mr. Trump, Mr. Pompeo has, at times, sought to downplay the Russian interference in the election.At a public appearance last month, he said that the intelligence assessment had found that Russias interference did not affect the outcome of the election.In fact, the assessment stated that it did not address whether Russia had any impact on votes outcome.We did not make an assessment of the impact that Russian activities had on the outcome of the 2016 election, the assessment said.The president said lingering questions about whether his campaign aides had worked with Russia to sway the election were souring Washingtons relationship with Moscow on a host of vital security issues.Having a good relationship with Russia is a great, great thing, Mr. Trump said.This artificial Democratic hit job gets in the way, and thats a shame, because people will die.The allegations of collusion are the subject of an investigation by the special counsel Robert S. Mueller III, as well as multiple congressional inquiries.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Trumps comments about the Russian president and his warning about deteriorating Moscow ties came after the close of the APEC conference in Danang, where the White House steered clear of a formal meeting between the two men and made a point of announcing on Friday that one would not occur.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Reporters who travel with Mr. Trump were barred from covering his activities for most of Saturday, leaving them in the dark about his informal interactions.But video showed him shaking hands with Mr. Putin on Friday at a gala dinner and chatting with him on Saturday before and after a group photograph of the APEC leaders.The Kremlin released a statement saying that the leaders had met and struck an agreement on Syria, but the White House did not immediately confirm the information.Speaking with reporters later, Mr. Trump said he had two or three brief conversations with Mr. Putin, mostly about Syria.The talks were described in a joint statement by United States and Russia that reaffirmed previous commitments to defeat the Islamic State and to untangle conflicts between their forces on the Syrian battlefield.It said that Mr. Trump believed he had a good meeting with Mr. Putin on common efforts that, once in place, would save thousands of lives.Mr. Trumps description of the exchange about election meddling was striking because it suggested that he concurred with Mr. Putins oft-stated contention that the issue was a contrived story that had been allowed to become a detriment to both the United States and Russia.This is really an artificial barrier thats put in front of us for solving problems with Russia, Mr. Trump said of Mr. Putin.He says that very strongly; he really seems to be insulted by it, and he says he didnt do it.Mr. Trumps reaction recalled the first face-to-face talk between the two presidents, on the sideline of the Group of 20 summit meeting in July in Hamburg, Germany, during which Mr. Trump broached the subject of Russias election meddling but threatened no consequences.When Mr. Putin denied it, American officials said at the time, Mr. Trump said the two countries must agree to disagree on the issue and move on to other topics where they could work together.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Russian officials provided an alternative account, asserting at the time that Mr. Trump had accepted Mr. Putins denial of the election interference and even said that some in the United States were exaggerating Moscows role without proof.That seemed to have been Mr. Trumps message on Saturday, when he repeatedly blamed Democrats for allegedly harming his efforts to improve relations with Russia by pushing false charges.I call it the artificial Democrat barrier that gets in the way, Mr. Trump said.Which is a shame.Mr. Putin similarly brushed off recent revelations that Russians had contacts with Mr. Trumps campaign team including an aide who had met with a woman described as Mr. Putins niece as a domestic political struggle in the United States.I think that everything connected with the so-called Russian dossier in the United States is a manifestation of a continuing domestic political struggle, Mr. Putin said after the summit meeting, in remarks carried by Russian news media.I learned only yesterday about some sort of meeting of my relatives with representatives of the administration or official figures, Mr. Putin said.He said his press secretary, Dmitry Peskov, had told him about the reports.I know absolutely nothing about this absolutely nothing, Mr. Putin said.It seems like nonsense.He told reporters in Danang, Its important that we find an opportunity, with our teams, to sit down at the level of presidents and talk through our complex relations.He added: Our relations are still in crisis.Russia is ready to turn the page and move on.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Putin said a scheduling conflict and an unspecified issue with protocol had gotten in the way of a more substantive meeting with Mr. Trump.This was connected to Mr. Trumps schedule, and my schedule, and certain formalities with protocol that our teams, unfortunately, didnt resolve.Well, they will be punished, he said.Still, nothing terrible happened, Mr. Putin added.We spoke in the course of todays gathering; we had a conversation.Mr. Putin said that Mr. Trump behaved at meetings with the highest level of good will and correctness, adding, He is a cultured person, and comfortable discussing matters related to work.
Trans-Pacific Trade Partners Are Moving On, Without the U.S.:::::Other countries are slowly but surely making progress on their own sweeping trade deals, without any participation from the United States.China is negotiating a potential deal with 16 Asia-Pacific countries, including Japan, India and South Korea.The European Union and Japan hope to strike separate trade pacts with a group of South American countries, Brazil and Argentina among them.From tough talk on China (they took our jobs) to casting doubt on the decades-old North American Free Trade Agreement (the worst trade deal ever made), Mr. Trump has threatened to lob a grenade at an increasingly integrated global economic system.His administration has questioned years of efforts to lower global trade barriers, arguing that they hurt American workers and led to big trade deficits.It also means dealing with nations one-on-one, rejecting the regional and global pacts his predecessors pursued.But other factors are pushing the rest of the world to fill the void left by the United States.Chinas rise as a regional and economic power is driving other nations either to join with it or to join together to counter it.Fast development in places like Southeast Asia means potential new markets for all kinds of products.The absence of the United States means potential opportunities for others.At some point, the administration may begin to see that this was a strategic mistake and that dropping out of trade is not in the interest of American workers, said Rufus Yerxa, president of the National Foreign Trade Council, a lobbying group that represents companies like Walmart, Ford and Microsoft.Weve got to compete and be a winner in global markets and the danger is, the strategy is divisive, he added.More worrying for some is the possibility that the Trump administration is ceding its position as global leader to China, a rising economic and political influence in the region.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The U.S. has lost its leadership role, said Jayant Menon, an economist at the Asian Development Bank.And China is quickly replacing it.Under the new Trans-Pacific trade deal, members would enjoy tariff-free trade with one another.That would allow companies in the member countries to have faster and better access to other markets than their American rivals.But there are still challenges ahead of the group, and not all the prospective member states meeting in Danang, Vietnam, were in complete accord over the finer details of a new deal.We are pleased that progress is being made towards a possible agreement, but there is still some work to be done, Franois-Philippe Champagne, Canadas minister of international trade, said in a statement.He added that Canada would sign a deal only once its interests had been addressed.Photo Even without the United States, the deal would be the largest trade agreement in history.It is intended to increase protections for intellectual property in some countries, while opening more markets to free trade in agricultural products and digital services around the region.It also has provisions on improving working conditions, although there is debate about the likely results.In a statement posted online, the Australian government said that the agreement in principle demonstrated the 11 countries commitment to open markets, to combat protectionism and to advance regional economic integration.The 11 countries working toward the new agreement are Japan, Australia, Canada, Mexico, Singapore, Malaysia, Vietnam, Chile, Peru, New Zealand and Brunei.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Mr. Trump has expressed support for the nations regional allies even as he rejects or criticizes trade deals with them.He reiterated American support for cooperation on security during his stops in Japan and South Korea.In China, he went out of his way to woo President Xi Jinping, going so far as to suggest that the trade deficit with the United States was the fault of past American administrations rather than of China itself.Advertisement Continue reading the main story I dont blame China, Mr. Trump said in a tweet on Friday morning shortly before leaving for Vietnam.The U.S. has been the driving force, not just behind the global economic order, but also pursuing higher standards on free trade and securing provisions that go way above the World Trade Organization obligations, said Stephen Olson, a former United States trade negotiator who worked on Nafta.If the U.S. abdicates that role, it puts us in uncharted territory, he added.In the absence of American leadership, Japan has driven the new round of talks.Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has spoken of the countries working on an agreement as Oceans Eleven, after the movie.Japans long-term hope is that the United States will eventually return to the fold.We will just go ahead and make it and we will welcome the United States back if they decide to do so, said Ichiro Fujisaki, a former Japanese ambassador to Washington.Completing a deal now, he said, makes the possibility of the U.S. coming back more likely.The new agreement has been crafted with the hope that the United States will one day participate.Some of the provisions among them ones that the United States lobbied for could ultimately be suspended, including some on copyright protection.Given the intensity with which Mr. Trump excoriated the original deal, it seems unlikely that this administration will come back to the table.It will be difficult for the administration to backtrack, said Wendy Cutler, a former United States trade negotiator who worked on the Trans-Pacific deal and is now managing director of the Washington office of the Asia Society Policy Institute.But other countries like Korea, the Philippines and Thailand are expected to join once the deal is ratified, said Ms. Cutler.Advertisement Continue reading the main story For members, the pact could offer a sense of security in a time when a number of politicians around the world are questioning the impact of trade and globalization.Speaking last week, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull of Australia said the deal promised greater transparency and a stronger rule of law, in a world which is dangerously short of both, referring to the siren songs of populists, advocating protectionism.The T.P.P.creates rules of the road to match the new economic world we are living in, Mr. Turnbull said.Notably, the Trans-Pacific pact includes Mexico and Canada, which are at loggerheads with the Trump administration over Nafta.Mr. Trump has raised the prospect of the demise of that agreement, citing the movement of industrial jobs from the United States to those countries.There is a genuine risk that the U.S. is going to further disengage from regional economic interaction, said Christopher Nelson, editor of the Nelson Report, a foreign policy and trade newsletter.And from the corporate standpoint, American companies are disadvantaged competitively if were not out there with both feet playing the game.
Bannon Put a Target on His Back. McConnells Answer: Ha-Ha.:::::Villainized by the presidents populist wing, Mr. McConnell nonetheless is pressing forward with a conservative agenda that he hopes will give Mr. Trump some big wins and perhaps a legacy.He knows he must pass a tax overhaul in the coming weeks if his party is to have any hope of holding on to a united Congress next year and if he is to remain majority leader.Meantime, he is trying to remake the nations judiciary, stocking the bench with Mr. Trumps judicial nominees.At 75, Mr. McConnell is a man of few words but many sayings.Among his favorites: Losers go into another line of work and winners come to Washington to make policy.And: When youre hit with a pebble, respond with a boulder.The target of that boulder would appear to be Mr. Bannon, a man whose name he refuses to utter, favoring this particular individual or that particular element of our party, or simply they.Their specialty is nominating people who lose in November, Mr. McConnell said acidly, adding, When they prevail, and they havent done that in recent years, we lose, and our intention in 2018 is they will not prevail anywhere.Mr. Bannon has been urging Senate candidates to pledge to vote against Mr. McConnell for majority leader, and he is making his campaign strikingly personal, because the Senate and Mitch McConnell have been the most outrageous in their lack of support of President Trumps agenda, he said.Why Mitch McConnell?Mr. Bannon asked.Because the institution of the majority leader has so much power, and he has used that power to, quite frankly, thwart President Trumps agenda.Mr. McConnell shot back: Virtually everyone he has criticized, including myself, supports the president over 90 percent of the time.He added: The only way the presidents agenda doesnt get enacted is if this particular element were to defeat enough senators in the general election to hand the Senate over to Democrats.Thats the only possible outcome if this kind of mentality were allowed to prevail.But I assure you it will not.It will not.Photo The battle with Mr. Bannon puts the leader in a precarious position.On the one hand, he is trying to improve his tenuous relationship with Mr. Trump.On the other, he finds himself fending off attacks from one of the presidents closest allies.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mitch will be very calm, hell be very strategic, hell be very surgical and he will eventually eviscerate Mr. Bannon, and Bannon wont even know what happened to him, said Bill Stone, a former chairman of the Republican Party in Louisville who is close to Mr. McConnell.Bannon is dealing with a man of intellect and a man of experience and a man of patience and resolve like hes never met in his life.Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee and one of Mr. McConnells closest friends in the Senate, said the leader is paying scant attention.Mitch is experienced, hes tough, hes purposeful, Mr. Alexander said.Hes not deflected by irrelevant attacks.But the denizens of McConnell World, as the leaders allies like to call themselves, are not so indifferent.They plan a campaign that will attack Mr. Bannon personally and seek to undermine his credibility by spotlighting his controversial comments and linking him with white nationalist groups.The first hints of that strategy have surfaced in the press and on social media.Mr. McConnells former chief of staff, Josh Holmes, referred to Mr. Bannon as a white supremacist in a recent interview with The Hill newspaper.And the Senate Leadership Fund, a political action committee closely aligned with Mr. McConnell, recently took to Twitter to circulate a newspaper headline that called Mr. Bannon an anti-Semite.For his part, Mr. Bannon called the charges a hundred percent media fabrication and the refuge of opponents that have nothing else.They think the only way they can run is by smearing you to be a nativist, a misogynist, a racist, a homophobe, he said.Just go down the line.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.(A recent article in BuzzFeed News used leaked documents and emails to directly link Mr. Bannon and his publication, Breitbart News, to the right-wing provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos and some of the most extreme elements of the rising white supremacist movement.)Billy Piper, a lobbyist and former chief of staff to Mr. McConnell, sees trouble in the brewing fight.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The worst fights are often the inside-the-family fights, Mr. Piper said.If we dont navigate these waters the right way, I think the inevitable result is losing seats, and thats not in any Republicans interest and certainly not in the presidents interest.Its challenging, and McConnell is at the center of that.Mr. McConnell has long been celebrated as a brilliant tactician, but he is struggling to govern with just a two-vote majority, and his record of legislative accomplishments this year is thin.He is still grappling with the fallout from the Senates failure to repeal the Affordable Care Act.Theres no way you can put lipstick on that pig and make it look good, said Trent Lott, a former Senate Republican leader.Photo Mr. McConnell has also had a difficult relationship with Mr. Trump.They spent months feuding with one another, a conflict that reached a nadir in August, when Mr. McConnell privately told allies he feared Mr. Trump could not salvage his presidency.He has to use considerable diplomacy working with the White House and elements of the administration, said Richard G. Lugar, a former Republican senator who lost a re-election primary to a Tea Party challenger in 2012, who then lost the Indiana seat to a Democrat.He understands human nature and the differing ambitions of people.But also he understands his responsibility.Hes the leader.He has to produce.The two worked to patch things up during a White House lunch last month, followed by a 45-minute impromptu news conference in the Rose Garden that left the leader feeling buoyed and fellow Republicans feeling relieved.They are both focused on the tax agenda, and I think the president realizes that he needs Mitch in order to accomplish his agenda, said Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine.And after a string of legislative losses, Mr. McConnell can at least point to one win: The Senate recently confirmed four circuit court judges, bringing to eight the number of federal appeals court judges the chamber has confirmed during Mr. Trumps presidency.Afterward, Mr. Trump rewarded him with enthusiastic Twitter praise: Our courts are rapidly changing for the better!Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. McConnell makes the case that Mr. Trumps most lasting legacy will come from remaking the federal judiciary by putting conservative jurists on the bench including Justice Neil M. Gorsuch of the Supreme Court, who was seated after Mr. McConnell refused to allow hearings on Merrick Garland, former President Barack Obamas nominee.Mr. McConnell said that transforming the judiciary is his No.1 priority, even higher than the tax overhaul.The most important decision Ive made in my political career, he said, was the decision not to do something; it was the decision not to fill the Supreme Court vacancy created by the death of Justice Scalia.____________ How do I listen?On your iPhone or iPad: Open the preloaded app called Podcasts; it has a purple icon.If youre reading this from your phone, tap this link, which will take you straight there.(You can also use the magnifying glass icon to search; type The New Washington.)Once youre on the series page, you can tap on the episode title to play it, and tap the subscribe button to have new episodes sent to your phone free.Or if you prefer another podcast player, you can find The New Washington there.(Heres the RSS feed.)On your Android phone or tablet: You can listen and subscribe using the free app RadioPublic, which is available worldwide.If youre reading this from your phone, tap this link to play the latest episode and learn more about the app.Or if you prefer another podcast player, you can find The New Washington there.(Heres the RSS feed.)From a desktop or laptop: Click the play button above to start the show.Make sure to keep that window open on your browser if youre doing other things, or the audio will stop.
Trump to Asia: Unite on North Korea, but Go It Alone on Trade:::::From Tokyo to Beijing, Mr. Trump has played the dealmaker with foreign leaders, flattering them personally even as his administration pushes hard-edge views on economic issues.But the contradictions also reflect a more fundamental disarray in the presidencys policy toward Asia.It seems caught between the geopolitical realism of Mr. Trumps diplomats and the economic nationalism of his political aides.These competing impulses have left allies and adversaries alike confused about Americas motives and staying power.Over time, several experts said, the balancing act will be impossible to maintain.Already with China, Mr. Trump has had to soft-pedal his ambitious trade agenda in an uphill effort to persuade President Xi Jinping to do more to press the neighboring North Korean government.With the smaller nations of Southeast Asia, Mr. Trump may feel less pressure to compromise.His comments in Vietnam lacked the solicitous tone he had used in China and Japan, veering into the defiant populism he used on the campaign trail.Yet his go-it-alone message could drive these countries further into the orbit of China, which has moved at this meeting of Pacific leaders to fill the vacuum left by the United States.Photo The region is looking for a robust American presence, not just on security but on trade, said John Delury, an associate professor of Chinese studies at Yonsei University in Seoul, the South Korean capital.For Trump to come with an America First agenda leaves Asian leaders in the lurch.Jeffrey A. Bader, a former China adviser to President Barack Obama, said Mr. Trumps words would make Asian leaders feel that the U.S. is less of a factor in the region.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Theyre always looking for hedges against local bullies, like China, he added, and the U.S. is much less of a hedge.Indeed, Mr. Trump was the odd man out at this meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.The other 20 leaders formally endorsed the idea of a liberal trade regime, arbitrated by the World Trade Organization, and condemned moves to erect new barriers.We recognize the work of the W.T.O.in ensuring international trade is rules based, free, open, fair, transparent, predictable and inclusive, the members wrote in their joint statement released on Saturday, using language that American negotiators had reportedly resisted.On Friday, Mr. Trump railed against the W.T.O., accusing it of treating the United States unfairly.Rather than uphold principles of free trade, he said, it contributed to a systematic exploitation of Americans, in which jobs, factories and industries were stripped out of the United States.While Mr. Trump vowed never to sign a regional trade deal like the Trans-Pacific Partnership, from which he withdrew the United States early in his presidency, the remaining 11 members of that deal agreed on Saturday to press on with it, creating a broader free-trade area across Asia that will pointedly exclude the United States.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.As the Pacific leaders gathered here on Saturday, much of the attention focused on whether Mr. Trump would meet with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia.The White House steered clear of a formal meeting, though the two men conferred briefly.The United States and Russia later issued a joint statement on Syria that reaffirmed previous commitments to defeat the Islamic State and to untangle conflicts between their respective forces on the Syrian battlefield.Until Saturday evening, when Mr. Trump unloaded to reporters on Air Force One about Mr. Putin and the investigations into Russian election meddling, this trip had been a surprisingly disciplined exercise for the president.Still, for Mr. Trump, this trip has been a surprisingly disciplined exercise.Mr. Trump joined the other leaders in wearing matching electric-blue, traditional Vietnamese shirts at dinner on Friday evening, adhering to a peculiar tradition of this summit meeting.Photo With a jam-packed schedule, he has tweeted sparingly and has kept generally on message.The White House has cut down on unscripted moments, limiting media access and acquiescing to the Chinese reluctance to allow questions after his joint statements with Mr. Xi.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Trumps encounters with leaders have been harmonious even leaders, like President Moon Jae-in of South Korea, with whom he has differences.That is in keeping with Mr. Trumps pattern throughout his presidency, though it was perhaps never as striking as in Beijing, where he lavished praise on Mr. Xi, only to criticize Chinas trade practices a day later in Vietnam.There is some value in treating counterparties with respect, in trying to build relationships with them, despite the distasteful nature if it, said Mr. Bader, the former Obama official.But if Mr. Trumps stops in Northeast Asia were aimed at building a coalition against North Korea, his swing through Southeast Asia seemed calculated to remind people that he has little use for the post-World War II concept of the United States as global leader.At moments, his speech in Vietnam had the tub-thumping atmosphere of one he may have given in Pennsylvania or Wisconsin.When a member of the audience broke into applause after he accused countries of not opening their markets to American goods, a sardonic Mr. Trump exclaimed: Funny.They must have been one of the beneficiaries.Administration officials framed the speech as a chance for Mr. Trump to promote a free and open Indo-Pacific, which the White House has embraced as its answer to Mr. Obamas Asia pivot.But the president put little meat on the bones, emphasizing the sovereignty and independence of nations over common interests or universal rights.Human rights are, in essence, an international agreement, said John Sifton, the director of Asia advocacy for Human Rights Watch.When he talks about trade in those terms, it suggests that he doesnt hold the multilateral legal system in very high regard and thats frightening.Human rights groups, Mr. Sifton said, were focusing their energies on lobbying Canada and Japan rather than the United States.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Chinese leaders do not dwell on human rights either, to say the least.But Mr. Xi came to Vietnam primed to take over some of the ground usually commanded by the American president.During his speech, which came right after Mr. Trumps, he declared, Opening up will bring progress, and those who close down will inevitably lag behind.In the absence of an alternative sales pitch from the United States, experts said, China will inevitably make further gains.China has made significant inroads in cultivating Southeast Asia, said Tang Siew Mun, head of the Asean studies center at the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore.This isnt an entirely bad proposition for the region, but Chinas success is disastrous for the U.S., as Chinese advances are at the U.S.s expense.At the end of the day, Mr. Tang said, America First may devolve into the U.S. being home alone.
Saudi Arabia Comes for Hezbollah:::::Hezbollah was part of Lebanons national unity government formed in late 2016 with Mr. Hariri as the prime minister.Iran and Saudi Arabia which views itself as the protector of Lebanons Sunni community blessed the power-sharing agreement.Photo Hezbollah agreed to the deal because it wanted to avoid conflict in Lebanon and to direct its energy toward the Syrian war, where it fights alongside the government of President Bashar al-Assad.As a leader with strong ties to both the Sunni Arab states and the West, Mr. Hariri provided Hezbollah with political cover as it continued to dominate Lebanon.The militias important role in the fighting in Syria has made it more powerful than ever.But Mr. Hariris resignation exposes Hezbollah and its allies in the Lebanese government to harsher United States sanctions, a potential war with Israel or even an economic blockade led by Saudi Arabia and its Sunni Arab allies, similar to the one imposed on Qatar.Hezbollah, which was founded in the 1980s during a civil war and an Israeli invasion, is now the countrys dominant political and military force.It is unrealistic of Saudi leaders and the Trump administration to expect that it can be supplanted by a popular Lebanese groundswell against it or removed by a foreign military force without causing catastrophic damage to Lebanon.Saudi Arabias new ruler, King Salman, and his son and designated heir, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, are pursuing a far more aggressive foreign policy than previous Saudi rulers.They have been bolstered in this by Mr. Trumps support for the kingdom in its conflict with Iran.Now that Irans ally, Mr. Assad, has essentially won the civil war in Syria, Saudi Arabia is looking to contain Iranian influence elsewhere.Lebanon is a tempting target.The Saudis have also been emboldened by their recent outreach to Shiite factions in Iraq, especially the nationalist cleric Moktada al-Sadr, who visited the kingdom in July and met with Prince Mohammed.The Saudis are hoping to cultivate Mr. Sadr and other Shiite leaders who can be a counterweight to Iranian influence in Iraq, especially ahead of parliamentary elections next year.But the Saudis wont be able to find a Sadr in Lebanon, a political figure who can offer a serious alternative to Hezbollah and Iranian influence in the Shiite community.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Since the end of Lebanons civil war in 1990, Hezbollah has entrenched itself in the largely Shiite areas of southern Beirut and southern Lebanon.With Iranian support, it opened schools and hospitals, provided business loans and fielded candidates for parliamentary elections.It also extended its military capability, deploying thousands of missiles along the border with Israel.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.In February 2005, Rafik Hariri, a billionaire construction tycoon and Lebanons former prime minister, was assassinated in a bombing in Beirut.His death deprived Lebanon of its most prominent Sunni leader and Saudi Arabia lost its most important Lebanese ally.After Mr. Hariris death, his son Saad took over his fathers Saudi-based construction empire and the Sunni political mantle in Lebanon.In the summer of 2006, Hezbollah fought a monthlong war with Israel, which ended in a draw and increased the militias popularity across the Muslim world.But by early 2011, Hezbollahs standing began to wane after a United Nations tribunal indicted several of its members for Mr. Hariris assassination.If Mr. Hariris killing was a first salvo of the proxy war between Iran and Saudi Arabia in Lebanon, subsequent battles also did not go Riyadhs way.In May 2008, Hezbollah broke a post-civil-war vow not to turn its weapons against other Lebanese factions.At the time, Lebanon was mired in a political stalemate between a United States- and Saudi-backed government which included Sunni, Christian and Druze parties and Hezbollah and its allies.Hezbollah was infuriated by a government decision that outlawed its underground fiber-optic communication network, which was critical to its success during its 2006 war with Israel.Hezbollahs leaders sent hundreds of fighters into largely Sunni neighborhoods of West Beirut.They overpowered Sunni militiamen and seized the offices and media outlets of political rivals, including Mr. Hariri.Hezbollahs success so alarmed the Sunni Arab states that Saudi Arabia toyed with the idea of sending an Arab military force to intervene in Lebanon.Prince Saud al-Faisal, the Saudi foreign minister at the time, asked a visiting American diplomat whether the United States and NATO could provide equipment, logistics and naval and air cover to assist such an army, according to a classified American diplomatic cable disclosed by WikiLeaks.Prince Faisal warned Washington that Hezbollahs actions would lead to an Iranian takeover of all Lebanon.Years later, Saudi leaders organized a similar force to wage their war in Yemen, against Houthi rebels allied with Iran.A day after Mr. Hariris resignation, the front page of a Saudi-owned pan-Arab newspaper declared, Hariri departs Hezbollahs republic.The subtext was clear: Without its most prominent Sunni leader, Lebanon is under Hezbollahs full control and it will be fair game in the latest battle with Iran.
Saudi Arabias Special Power Over Donald Trump:::::Photo Consider this foreign policy challenge: A Mideast leader undertakes a stunning power play to cement domestic control, carrying out mass arrests without due process and installing loyalists in key ministries.He ratchets up criticism of a regional rival and accuses it of effectively declaring war.And another Mideast leader, while on a visit to the first ones country, abruptly resigns and doesnt return home.If all this were happening in Iran, its a fair guess that President Trump, Congress and a host of other voices would react with outrage.In truth, the scenario sums up whats been happening in Saudi Arabia in the last week under Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.And Mr. Trump could not have been more effusive.I have great confidence in King Salman and the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, they know exactly what they are doing, he tweeted.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.Theres a big difference, of course, between Saudi Arabia and Iran; the former is an American ally, the latter an antagonist.But it has not been American practice to give allies a free pass when theyre destabilizing the region, and Saudi policies, both domestic and foreign, have become increasingly aggressive under Crown Prince Mohammed.In addition to his power play, hes escalated Saudi involvement in Yemen; continued his boycott of Qatar, ostensibly another American ally; and made inflammatory statements about Iran.Saad Hariri, the Lebanese prime minister, resigned a week ago while in the Saudi capital, Riyadh, in circumstances that remain a mystery.No problem, suggests Mr. Trump, who made clear early on that he would side with the kingdom and its Sunni allies against Shiite-led Iran.But there is a problem: Mr. Trumps uncritical support of the princes behavior is stirring fears of a war with Iran and undermining American interests.Secretary of State Rex Tillerson knows this, even if his boss doesnt.On Friday Mr. Tillerson reaffirmed Lebanons independence, hailed Mr. Hariri and cautioned against using Lebanon for proxy conflicts.His words were a stern, if indirect, admonishment to Saudi Arabia.And to his boss in the Oval Office.Though why should a headstrong Saudi prince pay any attention to an American underling who has been repeatedly undermined by that same boss?
China Has Donald Trump Just Where It Wants Him:::::There could scarcely be a more explicit offer of China as an alternative, single-party, authoritarian model to the liberal democratic system of the United States (of which Trump has been such a feeble advocate).China is now actively pursuing almost an ideological competition with the United States, said Yun Sun, a senior associate at the Stimson Center.Xis speech was a declaration of the Chinese saying that we have won this game, we are winning this game.They are, for now.The Chinese gambit in the past, China has been reticent about offering itself as a global paradigm comes at a moment of American democratic fracture.Its a good moment for Beijing to talk of arriving center stage.Trump does not really have ideas.He has impulses (like his dangerous infatuation with Saudi Arabia).Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.On his Asian swing, the president spoke of pursuing a free and open Indo-Pacific region built around democracies including India, Japan and Australia.This was the right thing to say to counter China.Hundreds of millions of Asians outside China dont want to find themselves obliged to study Xi Jinping Thought.They prefer liberalism to Leninism.Xi Jinping Thought calls for building the Chinese military into world-class forces that obey the partys command, can fight and win.It portrays the leadership of the Communist Party as the defining feature of Chinese society.So Trumps commitment to Indo-Pacific freedom is significant.Its also dubious.Trump likes surpluses, hates deficits.Its not clear whether any Trump strategy can get beyond such zero-sum rabble-rousing.Around Asia, the last thing countries want is to have to choose between China and the United States.From Singapore to Myanmar, they know that America is the only possible balance to China.If China is money and investment, the United States is security and freedom.The Chinese-American relationship is what the regional order depends on.Those Chinese targets for 2035 and 2050 presuppose one essential thing: regional stability.Thats the headline, not Trumps machinations.A second Korean War would be a nuclear war.This is the last thing China wants.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The second-to-last thing is the end of the North Korean regime and a united Korean Peninsula at its border, allied to the United States.Chinas rise to dominance is predicated on stability until that dominance is achieved.Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader, must be managed in this context.Therefore, China will try to squeeze Kim, not to the point of denuclearization (let alone collapse) but to the point where he does not further provoke the United States or Japan.The question is whether Kim is controllable.The other question is whether Trump is controllable.Xi projects the image of a reliable partner committed to an open, stable trading system.Trump, meanwhile, goes on walkabout with the Saudis.For now, a conventional Saudi-backed war in Lebanon against Iranian-backed Hezbollah is more likely than nuclear war with Pyongyang.These things happen when an America-First American president cant think beyond next week (or money).
Russia Scandal Befalls Two Brothers: John and Tony Podesta:::::For some Democrats, there is little question over who deserves the most sympathy.Sure, the Clinton campaign made some mistakes, but thats not like representing a dictatorship, said James Carville, who has known John Podesta for years through Democratic political circles.Mr. Carville said he was less acquainted with Tony Podesta, but added that by reputation, you cant put them in the same book.John is one of the straightest guys I know.Everybody says, Can you believe that those guys are brothers?Mr. Trump, for his part, went after both brothers last month, lumping them together as emblematic of the swamp of Washington special interests against which he campaigned.In fact, the Podesta brothers, who were raised in a modest two-flat on Chicagos northwest side by a Greek-American mother and an Italian-American father, represent very different strains of a Washington establishment now under attack from left and right.John Podesta, 68, served as a top White House aide to the last two Democratic presidents, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, and was believed to be in line as White House chief of staff if Mrs. Clinton had won the presidency.In between campaign and White House stints, John Podesta helped to create and run some of the leading institutions on the American left, including the Center for American Progress think tank, and provided policy and political advice to generations of Democratic politicians and operatives.Tony Podesta, 74, built one of the highest-grossing lobbying firms in Washington, signing clients across industries and ideologies including defense contractors like Lockheed Martin, banks like Wells Fargo, drug makers like Mylan and foreign regimes like the government of the former Egyptian dictator Hosni Mubarak.Tony Podesta is known for his fund-raising in 2016, he donated or raised nearly $900,000 for Mrs. Clintons campaign and the Democratic Party as well as for a lavish lifestyle.Had Mrs. Clinton prevailed, as official Washington expected, it most likely would have cemented the legacies of both brothers John Podesta as a key confidant to presidents and one of the most important Democratic strategists of the past century, and Tony Podesta as the go-to lobbyist for Democratic administrations.Instead, the Podestas have been drawn into the vortex of investigations and conspiracy theories that have enveloped Washington in the Trump era.Tony Podesta stepped down from his firm hours after it was obliquely referenced in the indictments of Mr. Manafort and Mr. Gates, though he had been in talks about leaving for months.It is unclear what will happen to his investment in the Podesta Group, which has been hemorrhaging clients and employees, both because of the mounting scrutiny and because businesses are looking for lobbyists with connections to the Trump administration, according to interviews and lobbying filings.Some firm partners are starting a new firm next month called Cogent Strategies, in which Tony Podesta will have no stake.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Last weeks indictment did not name the Podesta Group or another firm with which it worked on the Ukraine account, Mercury Public Affairs.Instead, the indictment referred to them as two Washington, D.C., firms that were recruited by Mr. Manafort and Mr. Gates.While both firms disclosed the work to Congress under less-rigorous domestic lobbying rules, they did not initially register under the Foreign Agents Registration Act.The indictment alleges that was done intentionally by routing the money through a Brussels-based nonprofit to minimize public disclosure of their lobbying campaign that was under the ultimate direction of Mr. Yanukovych, his party and his government.Tony Podesta and his lawyers are working to navigate the issues raised by the Mueller investigation and accompanying attacks from the right.They have already demanded a retraction from the conservative news media on claims that both Podestas worked with Mr. Manafort to advance Russian interests.Photo John Podesta, for his part, has dedicated his time since the election to trying to expose the connections between Mr. Trump, his associates and Russia.After the postelection publication of a dossier by a former British spy into those connections which included some salacious claims John Podesta met with Glenn Simpson, the co-founder of the firm that commissioned the opposition research, to compare notes on Russias involvement, according to an associate of Mr. Podesta.During the general election season, the firms research was funded by the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee, though John Podesta has told congressional investigators that he had no knowledge of those payments.The associate said the meeting came as Mr. Simpson was considering whether, and how, his firm could continue its Russia-related Trump research.A spokeswoman for Mr. Simpsons firm, Fusion GPS, declined to comment.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.John Podesta has helped raise millions of dollars from major donors with whom he has personal and financial relationships including the San Francisco mortgage billionaire Herbert Sandler for nonprofits fighting the Trump administration.With funding from Mr. Sandler, he helped begin a group called Democracy Forward that is suing the Trump team on a number of fronts, including at least one lawsuit intended partly to reveal whether Mr. Trumps aides tried to influence the Russia investigation.John Podesta could have gone into a bunker and vanished, but instead he dedicated himself to fighting this, said Faiz Shakir, who worked for him at the Center for American Progress and serves with him on the board of Democracy Forward.He is very driven by exacting some measure of justice for the unscrupulous form of politics that was utilized against him and his side, said Mr. Shakir, who considers Mr. Podesta a mentor.Both brothers declined interview requests through their representatives.But John Podesta provided a written response to a question about whether he saw it as tragic or at least ironic that the Russia investigation for which he has been advocating has ensnared his brother.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The only tragedy is that Donald Trump is president and got there with the Russians help, he said.Thats a tragedy for the American people.For both John and Tony Podesta, the connections with Democratic politics began at an early age.In 1970, they worked together on the Rev.Joseph D. Duffeys antiwar Senate campaign in Connecticut, for which Tony Podesta served as a top official, and his younger brother as well as Bill and Hillary Clinton were volunteers.Over the next 23 years, the brothers paths intertwined.They wove in and out of campaigns and car-pooled together to Georgetown Universitys law school, from which they both earned degrees in 1976.Tony Podesta joined the United States attorneys office in Washington, while John Podesta went to work at the Justice Department.After a few years, the brothers left those jobs John Podesta joining the Democratic staff of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and Tony Podesta becoming the founding president of the liberal advocacy group People for the American Way.In 1987, the brothers teamed up to create a lobbying and public relations firm called Podesta Associates, which was seen as having a liberal bearing, representing a mix of public interest groups and media companies and associations.But after Mr. Clinton won the presidency in 1992 a campaign for which both Podestas worked the brothers paths diverged once and for all.John Podesta took a job in the White House and divested his stake in the firm, which Tony Podesta pointed in a less ideological direction.By President Obamas second year in office, domestic lobbying revenues for the Podesta Group had risen to more than $29 million, buoyed in part by the perception of access to the new administration.The brothers remained close, even as their lifestyles took different paths.Tony Podesta moved into a 7,000-square-foot house in Washingtons exclusive Kalorama neighborhood, which he had bought for $3.9 million in addition to his homes in Australia and Venice.After three years of renovations, he turned it into a fund-raising hot spot with a modern art collection and a wine cellar with thousands of bottles.His divorce from his second wife, 26 years his junior, was widely chronicled in Washington.John Podesta, who remains married to the mother of his three children, lives in a relatively modest house near American University in Northwest Washington, where his clan makes a habit of getting together for home cooked pasta.In the end, said Lanny Davis, who has known both Podestas since the Duffey campaign, the brothers have much in common.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Tony Podesta may have clients that are way to the right of him in politics, he said, but neither John nor Tony Podesta, no matter who their clients are, have withdrawn one inch from being liberal Democrats with progressive values.
California Looks at Republican Tax Measures and Sees Payback:::::The bills would phase out the ability to deduct personal casualty losses from wildfires and earthquakes a constant threat in vast parts of the state but keep the deduction for damage from hurricanes and floods like those in Florida and Texas this year.I would like to think that this isnt directly aimed at California, but its hard not to think that Congress has their sights set on the Golden State, said State Senator Mike McGuire, a Democrat whose district includes areas ravaged by the recent wildfires in the north.No matter if its an earthquake, a wildfire or a hurricane, families should be able to deduct the damage.California is overwhelmingly Democratic.Hillary Clinton outpolled Mr. Trump by nearly four million votes here, and Democrats control both houses of the Legislature.Party leaders have been at the forefront of denouncing Mr. Trumps policies on issues from the environment to health care.There has long been concern here that the states confrontational stance toward the Trump administration could invite retribution from Washington.Gov.Jerry Brown, a Democrat, said in an interview that the rush by Republicans to pass a bill made it impossible to judge how much the legislation could hurt the state.I cant penetrate the inner motivations of the Republican leadership, Mr. Brown said.But I will say there is something very odd about their rushing this very gigantic tax proposal through Congress without serious transparency or debate.They are doing so primarily, it seems, to reward their corporate donors.I dont like this way to govern in a democracy, he said.Representative Darrell Issa, whose San Diego County district is among the most vulnerable Republican seats in the state, said he would oppose the bill.Advertisement Continue reading the main story I cannot endorse changes that may make the tremendous burden felt by California taxpayers even worse, he said.Tax reform should lower taxes for all taxpayers regardless of where they live.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.But so far, Mr. Issas opposition appears singular within the states Republican delegation, at least among those who will offer comment.Representative Kevin McCarthy, the majority leader, who represents a Central Valley district, strongly backed the effort.He said other parts of the bill such as increasing the standard deduction and eliminating the alternative minimum tax would help California taxpayers who were, he said, saddled with high state taxes.State Senator Jeff Stone, a Republican, also endorsed the effort, saying it would bring welcome relief to California taxpayers.The Democrats keep raising taxes in California, he said.Its about time the federal government stops letting them off the hook by giving them cover with an overly complicated federal tax system.On the Democratic side, Anthony Rendon, the Assembly speaker, called the bill anti-California, and said he was surprised that so few California Republicans had spoken against it, especially in contrast to Republicans in other states, like New York, that would also be hurt.Its to a large extent political suicide for a lot of these folks, he said, and they dont seem to care.Like everything in the tax measure, affordable-housing credits are a moving target.The House version eliminated a lot of things, and the Senate version restored some of them.But as Republican legislators shape a bill that delivers a big cut in corporate taxes while remaining within deficit limits that allow a party-line vote, the houses have consistently looked at reducing credits and deductions whose ripple effects would be minimal in most of the country but profound for taxpayers who live, generally, in Democratic states.For instance, both the House and Senate bills either reduce or repeal the deduction for state income, sales and property taxes.Californias top personal income-tax rate is the nations highest.The House bill lowered the limit on the mortgage-interest deduction for new home purchases from $1 million in debt to $500,000.That move would affect fewer than 3 percent of mortgage holders nationally, and there are only four metropolitan areas in the United States where more than half of the homes are priced above $500,000.All four are in California.(The Senate bill keeps the limit at $1 million.)Advertisement Continue reading the main story Also, no state benefits more from itemized deductions, which the bills limit, and in many cases discourage, by increasing the standard deduction.Economic models suggest that the bulk of the millions of families that would face tax increases under the legislation itemize their deductions.More than a third of Californians itemize their deductions, according to data compiled by the Pew Charitable Trusts; the average benefit from those deductions was nearly $37,000 in 2015.California is not the only state whose voters would lose deductions from the tax bill.According to an analysis by the Tax Foundation, an independent think tank, six states California, New York, New Jersey, Illinois, Texas and Pennsylvania claim more than half of the total amount deducted for state and local taxes.
Sex, Senators and  Oh Gosh, Mitt:::::Its not what theyre getting from most Senate Republicans, who are simply shaking their heads and saying Moore should step down if it turns out he really did the terrible thing that The Washington Post reported in stupendously credible detail.(John McCain was one of the first to demand that Moore drop out; Jeff Flake was telling the world what a terrible person Moore was even before the sex accusations came up.)President Trump, according to his press secretary, believes a mere allegation shouldnt destroy a persons life.This is pretty unsurprising.After all, if the president had said anything less weaselly, we would swiftly point out that this is the guy who was recorded bragging that he didnt bother to wait for permission before he started kissing women, adding Grab em by the pussy.You can do anything.Which we now have no excuse for bringing up.Meanwhile, the Alabama Republican Party has been desperately trying to cover Moores tracks: Other than being with an underage person he didnt really force himself.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.The same thing went on when President Trump ran for office; there was about 15 ladies who ran to the press and said the same thing.Theres just nothing immoral or illegal here.Maybe just a little bit unusual.That last was from the Alabama state auditor the guy who cited the Bible and argued that Joseph did the same thing with Mary.I have covered politics for a very long time, but I swear this is the first time Ive seen a race hinging on the issue of virgin birth.Its very possible Moore will be elected.Alabama is a super-red state.American voters do not have a strong history of switching parties in order to punish a politician for personal misbehavior.And the ballot is already printed.(A Hollywood studio is erasing Kevin Spacey from an entire movie, but once youre on a ballot, no earthly power can get you off.)The whole spectacle would be less awful if at least Republicans from outside the state had the spine to speak up to follow Romneys lead.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Whoever thought wed get to the point of urging everybody to just agree with Mitt?Romney appears to be a man with an exemplary private life, but on the political front he has had no moral spine whatsoever.He spent all of 2016 warning the world what a terrible, terrible person Donald Trump was, but then he wouldnt even say who he voted for in November, except that it wasnt Hillary.Which was exactly as helpful as sitting outside the polling place under a sign that says, Im sulking.Now, however, we are looking at him with new eyes.And really, hes due.George W. Bush is getting super-popular, and at least Romney never wrecked the entire Middle East.True, he did get the Republican nomination in 2012 by slamming his opponents as soft on illegal immigrants.But having a history of babbling about self-deportation somehow seems a lot less troubling these days.Its also true that Romney once complained that Barack Obama had been elected with the help of college-age women trading their votes for free contraceptives.But now weve got a president whos turning pregnancy prevention programs over to people who dont believe in birth control.And yes, as a candidate Romneys idea of expressing empathy for low-income Americans was saying, Theres no question its not good being poor.But thats better than Trumps recent revelation that he felt so sorry for rich people he had to propose eliminating the estate tax just to give them something.Whod have ever thought it?I wish Mitt was president.
State Department to Offer Buyouts in Effort to Cut Staff:::::For top diplomats, a $25,000 buyout which taxes would probably reduce to about $16,000 is not enough to change career plans, so many have already left.The number of those carrying the departments top two ranks equivalent to four- and three-star generals has dropped almost in half, from 39 to 21.And nearly 20 percent of those with two-star-equivalent ranks have signaled their intention to leave in what is an unprecedented exodus, according to an accounting provided by the American Foreign Service Association.Where is the mandate to pull the foreign service team from the field and forfeit the game to our adversaries?Barbara Stephenson, the unions president, asked in a letter to membership this week.Mr. Tillerson is in the middle of a departmentwide reorganization, an effort he has called his most important priority.But the staff reductions have nothing to do with that overhaul, according to those briefed on the plans.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.Because the buyouts are voluntary, many who take the money and leave are likely to have skills or be in jobs that Mr. Tillerson is hoping to maintain or increase in a reorganized department.Instead, the cutbacks are meant to make a down payment on the 31 percent budget cut that President Trump proposed for the department this year.That Congress rejected that suggestion and largely maintained the departments budget has not affected Mr. Tillersons plans, a fact that is likely to infuriate many on Capitol Hill.These actions are going to harm our security and our ability to lead on the global stage, said Representative Eliot L. Engel of New York, the senior Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee.In September, when the Senate Appropriations Committee unanimously approved a bill to maintain the departments funding at prior levels, Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, issued a statement, saying, Now is not the time for retreat, now is the time to double down on diplomacy and development.Advertisement Continue reading the main story But Mr. Trump has repeatedly indicated that he wants fewer diplomats.Asked about the many vacancies at the State Department, Mr. Trump said in an interview with Laura Ingraham of Fox News: You know, dont forget, Im a businessperson and I tell my people, When you dont need to fill slots, dont fill them.But we have some people that Im not happy with there.Pressed about critical positions like the assistant secretary of state, Mr. Trump responded in a statement that has since reverberated around the State Department.The one that matters is me, he said.Im the only one that matters because, when it comes to it, thats what the policy is going to be.Similarly, when President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia forced the United States in July to reduce its diplomatic personnel by 755, Mr. Trump said he was grateful.I want to thank him because were trying to cut down on payroll, and as far as Im concerned, Im very thankful that he let go of a large number of people, because now we have a smaller payroll, Mr. Trump told reporters at his golf club in Bedminster, N.J. Mr. Tillerson has sharply pared down the number of briefings he receives from senior diplomats as well as the number of people who normally travel with the secretary of state.As a result, Mr. Tillerson has had repeated gaffes in foreign capitals.He is also wildly unpopular in the State Department, and the president is rumored to be eager to replace him.Some employees will not be eligible for the buyouts, including many members of the security, information technology, medical and building staffs, areas in which the department is trying to hire more people or is offering bonuses for them to stay.
The Insanity of Taxpayer-Funded Addiction:::::Photo The pharmaceutical industry was listed as one of the Contributors to the Current Crisis in the final report of President Trumps Commission on Combating Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crisis.The report cites decades of aggressive marketing and industry-sponsored physician conferences aimed at expanding opioid use by minimizing the dangers of addiction.Lawsuits by state attorneys general, counties and local jurisdictions allege that the industry fostered the epidemic by overpromoting its products, while raking in billions as Americans became addicted and overdosed.To this day, the commission says, the opioid pharmaceutical industry influences the nations response to the crisis.It sure does.In its response to an epidemic that now kills 50,000 Americans a year, the Trump administration wants to spend tens of millions of dollars in part to help the industry responsible sell ostensibly nonaddictive pain medications and abuse deterrent opioids that are as addictive as the original opioids.In a recent speech, President Trump praised a new public-private partnership involving the National Institutes of Health and pharmaceutical companies to develop nonaddictive painkillers and new treatments for addiction and overdoses.Ill be pushing the concept of nonaddictive painkillers very, very hard, he promised.The N.I.H.says it hasnt set a budget for its public-private initiative but spent roughly $600 million on research into pain and opioid use and abuse in 2016.The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that prescribers avoid opioids for most chronic pain.Experts not affiliated with the pharmaceutical industry urge doctors to make greater use of over-the-counter analgesics and non-pharmacological pain relief methods like physical and spinal manipulative therapies, movement retraining and electrical stimulation.Advertisement Continue reading the main story In September, at a meeting in Trenton with more than a dozen pharmaceutical manufacturers to explore solutions to the crisis, the opioids commissions chairman, Gov.Chris Christie of New Jersey, said developing nonaddictive drugs was a priority.Among the companies he hosted was Purdue Pharma.In late October New Jerseys attorney general joined 10 other states in suing Purdue, owned by the Sackler family, alleging that Purdue deceptively marketed its drug OxyContin as safe for long-term use.The attorney general makes those judgments, not the governor, Mr. Christie said.
Yard Rage: The Rand Paul Assault:::::At least she didnt back her car into me.Thats what a landscaper in 1997 claimed Martha Stewart did when she discovered him erecting an illegal fence for Harry Macklowe next to her Hamptons property.She had already been feuding with Mr. Macklowe, a real estate magnate, winning a ruling from the village zoning board when she accused him of trying to suburbanize the area with inappropriate dark greenery.He put in more dark greenery anyway, and she managed to rip several plants out before his injunction stopped her.The lawsuits went on for years.Another celebrity yard war involved Julie Newmar, who, The Los Angeles Times reported in 2004, had once egged the house of Jim Belushi.Among her biggest gripes: Additions to his home kept the sunlight from her garden.If good fences make good neighbors, then entitlement, it seems, makes bad ones.Blocking a view is another cause of arboreal animosity.Larry Ellison of Oracle was in the news in 2011 for suing the San Francisco neighbors below him for letting their privacy trees grow despite the citys Tree Dispute Resolution Ordinance guidelines.They eventually settled, but not before The Wall Street Journal jumped into the media birdbath and called it a full-blown spectacle.More recently, on Kauai, Hawaii, Mark Zuckerberg rankled locals by building a legal wall that blocked an ocean view from the road and, some even claimed, a breeze.One neighbor told the local paper that the wall was oppressive.Others made unfair comparisons with the presidents proposed wall for Mexico.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Later, when Mr. Zuckerberg had to file a lawsuit to sort out ancestral land rights issues on the 700-acre property, more neighbors took offense and one local elected official told the press, You dont initiate conversation by filing a lawsuit.But you also dont initiate conversation by assaulting a neighbor.Senator Paul has six broken ribs and an injured lung.Nearly a week after the incident, with his assailant out of jail on a $7,500 bond, the reason for the attack remains anyones guess.My own is that its not just about a yard or politics.Often this kind of dispute is more about control than anything else, said Barri Bonapart, a Bay Area lawyer who specializes in tree law and who once had to stop a client in a view war from buying a gun.If youve been fired from your job, have family conflicts or a serious health issue, a common response is to fixate on things you believe you can do something about, even if that turns out to be delusional.She also thinks conflict can be an opportunity to find a solution.Advertisement Continue reading the main story But on Thursday, the assailant, a retired anesthesiologist, pleaded not guilty to misdemeanor assault charges and otherwise remained, well, mum.His lawyer insisted the attack wasnt political and was over trivial matters.Jim Skaggs, the developer who sold both men their homes, agreed and noted that the senator dislikes the communitys property rules.A Republican strategist said to CNN that coastal elites fail to understand the leaf-blower wars that take place all across Middle America.Is there a lesson in this bizarre story?One might be to watch your back this month while blowing your leaves.Also watch where youre blowing them.
Trump in the Age of the Strongman:::::Photo In recent weeks, two leaders Xi Jinping in China and Mohammed bin Salman in Saudi Arabia have consolidated personal power to degrees unprecedented in their countries recent histories.And Donald Trump, presumptive leader of the free world, has praised them both for doing it.In later October, Chinas Communist Party added what it called Xi Jinping Thought for the New Era of Socialism With Chinese Special Characteristics to the Constitution.A cult-of-personality campaign for Xi, reminiscent of the days of Mao Zedong, is in full swing.So are purges of his political rivals, dressed up as anti-corruption drives.A few days later it was Saudi Arabias turn, with Crown Prince Mohammed launching a wave of dismissals and detentions of senior ministers and fellow members of the royal family.Again, the pretext was corruption.Again, the goal was to sideline rivals as he aims to take his elderly fathers throne and remake the kingdom at best, as an Arabian version of the autocratic liberalism practiced by the late Shah of Iran (an improvement, to be sure, over current conditions).Xi and Mohammed are not alone.We are living through another age of strongmen: Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Turkey; Abdel Fattah el-Sisi in Egypt; Rodrigo Duterte in the Philippines; Viktor Orban in Hungary; Vladimir Putin in Russia.Trump isnt one of them the American system wont allow it, as Tuesdays elections happily remind us though he fits the psychological profile and yearns for their level of control.Advertisement Continue reading the main story We are also living through another era of democratic self-doubt.Low growth became the new normal for the better part of a decade.We fight wars we dont know how to win and rue the consequences of action (Iraq) and inaction (Syria) alike.We inhabit a culture we despise and see no way of improving.Congress is paralyzed.The parties are broken.The president is a dolt.
A Link Between Alcohol and Cancer? Its Not Nearly as Scary as It Seems:::::Lets stipulate that there may be a correlation between light or moderate drinking and some cancers.We still dont know if the relationship is causal, but lets accept that theres at least an association.For breast cancer which is the cancer that seems to be garnering the most headlines light drinking was associated with a relative risk of 1.04 in the announcement.Relative risk refers to the percentage change in ones absolute (overall) risk as a result of some change in behavior.(And 1.04 is a 4 percent change from 1.0, which represents a baseline of no difference in risk between an experimental group and a control group.)A 40-year-old woman has an absolute risk of 1.45 percent of developing breast cancer in the next 10 years.This announcement would argue that if shes a light drinker, that risk would become 1.51 percent.This is an absolute risk increase of 0.06 percent.Using whats known as the Number Needed to Harm, this could be interpreted such that if 1,667 40-year-old women became light drinkers, one additional person might develop breast cancer.The other 1,666 would see no difference.Of course, moderate or heavy drinking might increase the risks further.The absolute risks for that 40-year-old would go to 1.78 percent from 1.45 percent for the moderate drinker, and to 2.33 percent for the heavy drinker.Those numbers are still not that scary.But maybe any increase in risk is too much for you.Thats fine.If youre one of those people, though, you have to acknowledge that you cant look at any one cancer in a vacuum.A person can get almost any cancer.The large meta-analysis upon which this announcement was based looked at 23 types of cancer with respect to alcohol consumption.It found a harmful relationship between three of them and light drinking.But it also found protective relationships meaning a decreased risk of cancer between six of them and light drinking.Im not arguing that you should engage in light drinking to avoid those six cancers.Im merely pointing out that cherry-picking allows you to come to different conclusions.With respect to moderate drinking, there were harmful relationships with seven cancers and protective relationships with three.The announcement focused on the former, not the latter.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.A 2013 meta-analysis in the Annals of Oncology that looked at all cancers found that, over all, light drinking was protective; moderate drinking had no effect; and heavy drinking was detrimental.Its even cherry-picking to focus only on cancer, though.A person can get any number of diseases, and this fact makes the dangers of light and moderate drinking even muddier.Advertisement Continue reading the main story If you accept the methodology of case-control and cohort studies, from which many of the links between alcohol and cancer arise, you have to accept the results of similar studies of other diseases.For instance, a cohort study of about 6,000 people found that those who drank at least once a week had better cognitive function in middle age than those who didnt.A 2004 systematic review found that moderate drinkers had lower rates of diabetes (up to 56 percent lower, although thats a relative risk reduction).Randomized controlled trials of alcohol (they do exist) show that light to moderate drinking can lead to a reduction in risk factors for heart disease, diabetes and stroke.These protective factors may be greater than all the other negative risk factors (even cancer) that might be associated with light or moderate drinking.More women die in the United States of heart disease than cancer.So do more men.Moreover, dire warnings have consequences.I know far too many people who now throw up their hands at every news story because it seems as if everything causes cancer.These stories rarely acknowledge an alternative point of view.The absolute risks of light and moderate drinking are small, while many people derive pleasure from the occasional cocktail or glass of wine.Its perfectly reasonable even if a risk exists and the overall risk is debatable to decide that the quality of life gained from that drink is greater than the potential harms it entails.This is true for many, many foods, not just alcohol.What can we do about this?We could make simple changes to have a better understanding of risk so that each new proclamation doesnt send us into a tizzy: 1) Consider the absolute risks.A 30 percent increase in risk sounds scary, but an increase from 1 percent to 1.3 percent absolute risk does not, though these are the same things.Likewise, we should be more concerned about a 5 percent risk increase to 21 percent from 20 percent than about a 30 percent increase to 1.3 percent from 1 percent.2) Dont give too much weight to observational data.This is especially true when causal data are available.3) Dont focus on any one disease while ignoring others.Something may be harmful regarding one disease while beneficial regarding another.4) Dont cherry-pick.That is, dont focus only on some studies, or only on some results.Review all the evidence for the most holistic picture possible.5) Acknowledge the harms, as well as the benefits, of recommendations.Consider both cost and joy.These rules may not make for exciting headlines.They may, however, lead to happier, and perhaps healthier, lives.
The Unsung Role That Ordinary Citizens Played in the Great Crime Decline:::::This long-term trend has fundamentally altered city life.It has transformed fear-inducing parks and subways into vibrant public spaces.It has lured wealthier whites back into cities.It has raised the life expectancies of black men.And even in an age of widening urban inequality, it has meant that the daily lives of the most disadvantaged are less dangerous now than they were a generation ago.These poor neighborhoods, Mr. Sharkey has found, have been the greatest beneficiaries of this tectonic change in safety.The same communities were participating in another big shift that started in the 1990s: The number of nonprofits began to rise sharply across the country, particularly those addressing neighborhood and youth development.Mr. Sharkey and the doctoral students Gerard Torrats-Espinosa and Delaram Takyar used data from the National Center for Charitable Statistics to track the rise of nonprofits in 264 cities across more than 20 years.Nonprofits were more likely to form in the communities with the gravest problems.But they also sprang up for reasons that had little to do with local crime trends, such as an expansion in philanthropic funding.A spike in nonprofits addressing subjects like the arts and medical research occurred in this same era.Comparing the growth of other kinds of nonprofits, the researchers believe they were able to identify the causal effect of these community groups: Every 10 additional organizations in a city with 100,000 residents, they estimate, led to a 9 percent drop in the murder rate and a 6 percent drop in violent crime.In a criminology field that has produced some eyebrow-raising ideas, this one is actually not so surprising.That national finding echoes local studies of some individual programs, like one run by the Pennsylvania Horticultural Society that converts abandoned lots into green spaces and that has been linked in Philadelphia to reduced gun violence.The research also affirms some of the tenets of community policing: that neighborhoods are vital to policing themselves, and that they can address the complex roots of violence in ways that fall beyond traditional police work.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Its absolutely consistent with what I would argue is probably the prevalent theory of policing among the major cities today, Richard Myers, the executive director of the Major Cities Chiefs Association, said of the new research.Local organizations also say Mr. Sharkeys results validate what they have already witnessed.Any time peoples basic needs are met, violence goes down thats not new, said Noreen McClendon, who directs the nonprofit Concerned Citizens of South Central Los Angeles.The group, led by Ms. McClendons mother for many years, was formed in the 1980s to fight a proposed waste incinerator in the neighborhood.It evolved in the 1990s to address many of the neighborhoods other challenges.The group created dozens of block clubs to care for individual streets.It cleaned alleys and repaired potholes, and hired local ex-offenders to do that work.It established a credit union, sponsored a jazz festival and developed hundreds of units of affordable housing.Photo During a time of major disinvestment in cities, and severe cuts in federal support for urban programs, residents of the neighborhood believed no one else was coming to help.Nobody, Ms. McClendon said.And if the group had not done this work itself?There would have been a lot more death, she said, between violence amongst people, violence from police brutality, just drugs.Many similar groups did not explicitly think of what they were doing as violence prevention.But in creating playgrounds, they enabled parents to better monitor their children.In connecting neighbors, they improved the capacity of residents to control their streets.In forming after-school programs, they offered alternatives to crime.In the East Lake neighborhood of Atlanta, the crime rate in the mid 1990s was 18 times the national average.The drug market in the neighborhood was estimated to be doing $35 million in business a year.There hadnt been a new building permit issued in the neighborhood in nearly three decades, a sign of how little anyone had invested in the community other than to buy drugs there.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Then the newly formed East Lake Foundation developed new mixed-income housing to replace a decaying public housing project.It started a golf program for neighborhood children on a nearby but long-deteriorating golf course.The foundation eventually opened a charter school, where the first class of seniors had a 100 percent graduation rate in May.We knew we wanted to see violence and crime go down in the community, said Carol Naughton, who led the foundation for years and today is the president of a national group, Purpose Built Communities, that is trying to teach East Lakes model in other cities.But weve never had a crime-prevention program.Today violent crime in East Lake is down 90 percent from 1995.But Ms. Naughton is momentarily perplexed by the question of whether she believes groups like hers have gotten enough credit for contributing to that outcome.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Were not part of the crime-reduction world, or the public safety world, in the same way that were part of the health and education and housing world, she said.It never occurred to us that were not getting the credit, because we dont even know that world is out there.The lesson in that response, and in Mr. Sharkeys work that effective crime prevention doesnt necessarily look like stop-and-frisk, or hot-spot policing, or mass incarceration is particularly relevant today as cities rethink policing.A lot of these communities were in despair because they needed resources, said Robert Sampson, a sociologist at Harvard who has studied Chicago neighborhoods damaged by violence.And what did they get?Well, they mainly got crime control.They got increases in incarceration.Those tactics may have contributed to the decline in crime as well.But theyve come with costs that have become clearer over time, in antagonizing communities and disrupting families.Mr. Sharkey is pointing to one possible solution with less evident downsides.And hes suggesting that communities can effectively take on the very roles that the police say have strained them as theyve increasingly been asked to perform jobs they werent trained for, as guidance counselors or marriage therapists or substance-abuse experts.They are taking that burden away from the police that probably never should have been there, but by default has kind of landed there, said Mr. Myers of the chiefs association, who is also a former longtime police chief himself, in Michigan, Virginia, Colorado and elsewhere.As Mr. Sharkey publishes his findings, crime rates are now diverging after a generation in which violence fell reliably year after year nearly everywhere.Its not clear yet whether the great crime decline he writes about will continue.But he argues that its time for a new model of violence prevention, one that relies more heavily on the kind of work that these community groups have been quietly doing than on the aggressive police tactics and tough sentencing that the Trump administration now advocates.The model that weve relied on to control violence for a long time has broken down, Mr. Sharkey said.If communities want police to step back, he is pointing to some of the people who can step in.This gives us a model.It gives us another set of actors who can play a larger role.
Democrats Cheer, but They May Have to Do Better in 18:::::All of the conditions for a 2018 wave are in place.The presidents approval rating is stuck in the mid-to-high 30s.The Democrats hold nearly a double-digit lead on the generic congressional ballot.The presidents party nearly always struggles in midterm elections.These conditions have been in place all year.They just havent yielded Democratic victories until now because the high-profile races have been fought in reliably Republican areas districts that voted for either Mr. Trump or Mitt Romney by at least 15 points.But Virginia voted for Hillary Clinton by five points in 2016, and it backed Barack Obama twice as well.New Jersey, Washington States 45th Senate district, New Yorks Westchester and Nassau Counties and Maine are generally even more Democratic-leaning.The big surprise of the night was the huge Democratic surge in Virginias House of Delegates, but that also came in Clinton Country.Of the 16 districts where Democrats currently lead in Virginia, Mrs. Clinton won 15 of them and received 49.7 percent of the vote in the other, according to data from the Virginia Public Access Project and Daily Kos Elections.Twelve of those 15 districts voted for Mrs. Clinton by at least five points.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Just because Tuesdays victories came in states or districts won by Mrs. Clinton doesnt mean they can be dismissed, however.College-educated white voters, paired with nonwhite voters, could profoundly endanger the G.O.P.in traditionally Republican, upscale districts.Up until the polls closed in Virginia, it was reasonable to suppose that Mrs. Clintons performance represented something of a ceiling for Democrats in well-educated areas.It would be easy, the theory went, for Republican voters to distinguish their longtime Republican representatives from Mr. Trump.Jon Ossoffs failure to outdo Mrs. Clinton in Georgias Sixth Congressional District seemed fully consistent with that possibility.But well-educated voters in Virginia didnt appear to make any distinction between Mr. Trump and their incumbent representatives.Ed Gillespie, who was thought to have run a pretty strong campaign for governor against Ralph S. Northam, wound up running well behind Mr. Trump in many well-educated suburbs, a possibility that few imagined heading into the contest.The catch, though, is that the overwhelming Democratic strength in well-educated areas did not cross the political divides of the 2016 election and reach into white working-class areas.In fact, Mr. Northam, a Virginia Military Institute graduate with a strong Southern pedigree, didnt even come close to matching Gov.Terry McAuliffe, Mr. Obama or Senator Tim Kaine in rural western Virginia.Democratic State Assembly candidates didnt run well ahead of Mrs. Clinton, either.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Yes, the political divisions of the 2016 presidential election wound up working pretty well for Democrats in Virginia, a highly educated state.But that might not be the case for Democrats in a lot of the rest of the country.There are only 11 Republican-held congressional districts in the United States where Mrs. Clinton won by five points or more.Even if Democrats swept those 11 districts, it wouldnt get them that far toward the 24 seats they need to flip the House.To my surprise, its not obvious that a rerun of the Virginia House of Delegates election on a national scale would yield Democratic control of the House.Without greater strength in areas that supported Mr. Trump, it would still be a tossup.The good news for Democrats is that they did run well ahead of Mrs. Clinton in white working-class areas during this springs special congressional elections.And on Tuesday, Mr. Northam ran ahead of her in some of those areas, too, even if he landed short of prior Democratic benchmarks.The big question in 2018 might prove to be whether Democrats can have it all: Will it be possible to combine a Virginia-like near sweep of Republicans in Clinton districts with a broad Democratic overperformance in white working-class districts?If they can do both, they will be favored to retake the House.One or the other would probably make the fight for House control a tossup.The fact that theyve done both at various points this year might be an early clue.
After a Tough 2016, Many Pollsters Havent Changed Anything:::::Nearly all of the private pollsters interviewed for this article have, at minimum, begun to do something about education.There is widespread agreement that the industry failed to properly represent less educated white voters, and that this was part of why last years polls were too favorable to Democrats.Its likely to remain a big issue, at least as long as white voters split so decisively on educational lines.The postelection report of the American Association for Public Opinion Research, the nations leading polling association, reached a similar conclusion.One possible fix is to weight by education, which would give more or less weight to certain respondents to ensure that less educated voters represent the appropriate share of the polls final estimate.For many public polls, weighting by education would make a big difference.It could move an otherwise lightly weighted poll by as much as four percentage points toward the Republicans in the Virginia governors race, for example, based on an analysis of the most recent Upshot/Siena College poll.With the Democrat, Ralph Northam, holding a modest lead in most polls, the difference could be enough to flip several surveys in the state.Education Can Make a Big Difference How the Upshot/Siena College poll of Virginia might have gone if it followed three common public polling methods and used weights for: The race, gender and age of registered voters, with a likely voter screen The race, gender, age, region and party primary history of the likely electorate, using only those who vote regularly The race, gender, age, region and party primary history of the likely electorate The Upshot/Siena College methodology without education with education +7 Dem.+2 without education with education +8 Dem.+5 without education with education +5 Dem.+4 with education +3 Dem.The race, gender and age of registered voters, with a likely voter screen The race, gender, age, region and party primary history of the likely electorate, using only those who vote regularly The race, gender, age, region and party primary history of the likely electorate The Upshot/Siena College methodology without education with education +7 Dem.+2 without education with education +8 Dem.+5 without education with education +5 Dem.+4 with education +3 Dem.There are a few pollsters in Virginia like The Washington Post and Quinnipiac that do weight by education, and did so before the 2016 presidential election.Most others werent weighting by education before 2016 and arent weighting by it today.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The disparity can be extreme.Sixty-six percent of likely voters were listed as college graduates in the latest Christopher Newport University survey of Virginia, well above the range of 49 percent to 52 percent in Upshot estimates.Mr. Northam led by six points in the Christopher Newport University poll.A Gravis poll, which showed Mr. Northam ahead by five points, had four-year college graduates at 60 percent of the electorate.A tied Roanoke poll had the college-educated share of the electorate at 57 percent.The relative lack of change among public pollsters doesnt mean that the pre-election polls in Virginia or elsewhere are doomed to miss by as much as they did in 2016.By most accounts, the 2016 polling error took a perfect storm: Just about everything that could break Mr. Trumps way appears to have done so.Next time, it could be the Democrats who beat turnout expectations and sway undecided voters.Theres also no guarantee that the stark educational divide of the 2016 presidential election will be as prominent without Mr. Trump on the ballot, or as important with midterm voters, who tend to be more educated.But the lack of change hints at a bleak possibility: a mismatch between the scale of the challenge facing the survey research industry and the capacity of many individual public pollsters to respond.Education Is a Mystery It might seem obvious that the 2016 election would drive public pollsters to adopt big changes.But many individual public pollsters were reasonably satisfied by their results, even though the industry as a whole seemed to get it wrong.Its not completely unreasonable.Last years polling error was an odd one.It was almost perfectly distributed across the battleground states to maximize the electoral consequences.There were large errors in a small number of states where Mrs. Clinton had a big lead, like Wisconsin and Michigan.But elsewhere the errors were more typical, or even nonexistent.Virginia is one such state: Mrs. Clinton led by five or six points in all the final polling averages; in the end, she won by 5.3 points.If pollsters didnt take any surveys in the Midwest, most or all of their results were probably in the margin of error.Their result might have leaned toward Mrs. Clinton, like everyone elses, but they could explain that away: There is a lot of evidence that undecided voters broke toward Mr. Trump.And most public pollsters didnt conduct enough polls, late enough in the race, to be sure of just how well or poorly they really did.Some pollsters did take enough surveys late enough in the race to merit a re-examination, but they didnt think education was decisive.Patrick Murphy of Monmouth University, for instance, found that weighting by education would have explained only one percentage point of bias in his surveys.But perhaps the bigger issue is that education is a mystery: Its hard for pollsters to even know if theyre getting it wrong, let alone to fix it.Advertisement Continue reading the main story I dont weight to education because its pretty hard to find accurate benchmarks for a likely-voter profile based on education, said Matthew Towery of Opinion Savvy, a firm that often conducts state polls using automated calls.Thats not something thats necessarily easily ascertained most of the time.Hes right.Its not easy to weight by education, and its especially tough for pollsters who rely on voter registration files the big data that powers most campaigning polling and analytics.Many pollsters use voter file data, rather than dialing telephone numbers at random (known as random digit dialing, or R.D.D.), to conduct their surveys and estimate the composition of the electorate.Voter files offer pollsters rich demographic and political data to help them weight their survey and estimate the likely electorate.R.D.D.surveys have their own advantages, but the loss of this data is a considerable disadvantage, especially in a low-turnout election.Unsurprisingly, the Virginia polls that at least partly use R.D.D.have occasionally produced somewhat outlying results.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.But the voter file has a weakness: Education is not reliably included on public voter files.To weight by education, pollsters using the voter file have to look elsewhere something pollsters who trust the voter file are generally reluctant to do.Not coincidentally, only two of the nonpartisan Virginia pollsters using a voter file appear to weight by education; all but one of the pollsters using random digit dialing in Virginia do, most likely using the census.Whats the alternative?A pollster could ask voters how much education they have in order to match estimates for the likely electorate from some other source, but there isnt a definitive benchmark for weighting.There still isnt universal agreement about how many voters in 2016 had a college degree: Theres a wide 10-point gap between the exit poll results and the census postelection survey.The combination of the uncertainty around the true educational composition of the electorate and the reluctance to weight voter-file surveys by self-reported measures has been enough to deter many public-voter-file-based surveys from weighting by education.These same factors pose a challenge to private partisan pollsters.But the pace of change among them has nonetheless been far greater.All but one of the 10 private partisan pollsters interviewed for this article have begun to do something about education, whether by weighting or by other means.This is the first time ever that Ive weighted education, getting ready for some elections in 2018, said Glen Bolger, a pollster for Public Opinion Strategies, a prominent Republican polling firm, because education is a pretty damn good predictor.Advertisement Continue reading the main story For private pollsters, there is a lot more acceptance of the problem and more acceptance that they just got it wrong, especially on the Democratic side.The big private polling firms conducted more than enough surveys, in enough states, late enough in the race, to have no illusions about whether their results were meaningfully biased.Some of them were already doing something about it before the election, but now theyre generally doing more.Theres still uncertainty about the exact way to do it, but most private pollsters are persuaded by the necessity of change uncertainty is no longer an excuse to do nothing.Its kind of a cop-out, said Anna Greenberg, a Democratic pollster at Greenberg Quinlan Rosner Research.You cant say I cant deal with education because I dont know the exact weight of it.You wouldnt not weight on race because you couldnt figure it out.Is It Enough?The debate among private pollsters, especially on the Democratic side, has instead advanced to a different stage: whether weighting by education is enough.The cause for debate is simple.Even weighting by education wouldnt have been enough to give Mr. Trump the polling edge.One possibility, often advanced by more traditional firms, is that the residual error could be explained by turnout or shifts among undecided voters.But theres a more ominous possibility.It wasnt just that polls didnt capture enough less educated white voters; it was also that they didnt get the right less educated white voters.Perhaps the polls missed less educated voters in the most rural areas.Maybe they missed those who dont work in office jobs, in old-economy sectors like manufacturing or agriculture.Or maybe they missed voters with low levels of social trust or a lower propensity to volunteer, who have long been less likely to respond to surveys and may have been more likely to support Mr. Trump in 2016.If true, the problem is a lot more difficult to solve.Weighting by education would not be an adequate remedy, since baristas arent exchangeable with factory workers, as David Shor of Civis Analytics puts it.Civis is the Democratic firm that has probably been the most vocal about the possibility that the polling industry suffers from bigger nonresponse challenges than can be fixed by weighting by education.The possibility of a deeper kind of nonresponse bias is now broadly held in the Democratic analytics world, but its nowhere near a consensus across the polling industry.Thats in part because theres limited public evidence to support it at this stage.Its also because many traditional pollsters are skeptical of analytics firms with an economic incentive to argue that traditional polling is broken or even impossible.But traditional pollsters mentioned some of these issues as well.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Research in this area seems poised to continue for the foreseeable future.But most of these efforts are occurring out of the view of public polling firms.If something is more profoundly wrong with public polling than weighting by education alone can address, its hard to see how many public polling firms will be able to do anything about it.
Upshot/Siena Poll Gives Democrat Narrow Lead in Virginia Governors Race:::::The poll asked respondents how they voted in last years presidential race, and there was a consistent pattern across demographic groups and geography.The governors race, although reminiscent of 2016, hasnt quite polarized voters to the same extent.White working-class voters said they backed Mr. Trump by a 48-point margin, 67 percent to 19 percent, somewhat wider than Mr. Gillespies 40-point edge.Mr. Northam holds a 26-point lead among voters from Northern Virginia; voters from that area said they backed Mrs. Clinton by 31 points.Its a pattern up and down the ballot.The pattern has also been fairly common beyond Virginia this year.In special congressional elections, Republicans have fallen far short of Mr. Trumps strong showing in white working-class areas, while Democrats have struggled to exceed Mrs. Clintons showing in the areas where she excelled, like Georgias Sixth Congressional District.But the Virginia contest seems to have a distinct dynamic.Mr. Gillespie, with establishment roots as a former chairman of the Republican National Committee, has run a campaign plainly intended to rally Mr. Trumps supporters, making the question of whether he can approach Mr. Trumps strong tallies somewhat more interesting.If Mr. Gillespie prevails or runs well ahead of Mr. Trump, it might be interpreted as a sign that establishment Republicans can excel by embracing Mr. Trumps message.According to this view, they could lure white working-class Trump supporters with his message on race and immigration, while maintaining greater support among well-educated voters with their establishment-friendly credentials and tone.Even if Mr. Gillespie loses by a small margin, his campaign could be judged a success, given national political conditions and Virginias Democratic lean.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Northam entered the race as a clear if modest favorite.Virginia, with a high percentage of college-educated voters, backed Mrs. Clinton by a five-point margin in November, and the national political environment would seem to be very favorable to a Democrat.The party out of power has generally won the Virginia governors race, and Republicans have underperformed in this years special elections.Mr. Trumps approval rating has consistently been in the 30s, and Democrats have a considerable lead on the generic congressional ballot.These conditions are consistent with a so-called wave election, like the ones that swept Democrats into power in the House in 2006 and back out in 2010.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.But Mr. Trumps approval rating was at 39 percent in the Upshot/Siena survey, with his disapproval at 51 percent.These figures are somewhat better for Mr. Trump than those of most other surveys perhaps in part because this poll tries to capture likely voters in an off-year election, and those voters are considerably older and whiter than the overall adult population.The poll was sampled from an L2 voter file, and its weighted to a likely electorate.It supposes a turnout of around 2.4 million votes, up somewhat from the 2.24 million cast in the 2013 governors race.But higher or lower turnout would not necessarily be a clear advantage for either side, according to our results.The Democratic strength among well-educated voters and the robust Democratic turnout in the primary for this race gives the party more strength among high-turnout voters than has been the case in recent elections.About 14 percent of respondents were undecided or refused to answer, while another 2 percent backed the Libertarian candidate Cliff Hyra.The relatively high proportion of undecided voters is partly because the sample includes a large number of less likely voters, who are vastly more likely to be undecided than the likeliest voters.Many public polls sample only frequent voters, or screen their sample down to the likeliest voters.Mr. Northam would have led by three points, 46 to 43, if the sample had counted only voters who were almost sure or very likely to vote.How the Poll Has Changed The poll is the first Upshot/Siena survey since the 2016 presidential election, when polls generally overstated Mrs. Clintons support in the decisive battleground states.Mr. Trump led by four points in our final Florida survey in 2016, and he was tied in our final North Carolina survey.But the Upshot/Siena survey also had Mrs. Clinton up by seven points in earlier polls of North Carolina and Pennsylvania, taken soon after the third debate, when she still had a wide lead in national and battleground state polls.The apparent shifts over the last few weeks of the race make it more difficult to assess the performance of these surveys.But a close analysis of last years surveys, combined with insights from across the survey industry, has helped inform two initial changes to the Upshot/Siena poll since last Novembers election.Advertisement Continue reading the main story First, the poll is weighted by self-reported education to match estimates based on the census Current Population Survey.Theres considerable evidence that the failure to weight by education was a major reason state pre-election polls were off the mark, especially in the Rust Belt states.Its not so clear that education weighting would have considerably improved the performance of Upshot/Siena surveys.Thats because the Upshot/Siena sample design and weighting scheme was already intended to properly represent low-turnout voters, who tend to be less educated.The education weight had no effect on the results of this Virginia survey.Second, we sampled and weighted to a likely electorate, rather than registered voters.Similarly, the modeled turnout score our estimate for the probability that a voter will turn out, based on past voting record and other measures now represents 60 percent of our estimate that a respondent will turn out, up from 50 percent in 2016.The remaining 40 percent of the estimate is based on respondents answers to several questions about their interest in politics, the coming election and their intention to vote.Over all, these changes would have eliminated about half of the bias and one-third of the error in our final

Dont Nudge Me: The Limits of Behavioral Economics in Medicine:::::At first glance, behavioral economics the basis of Richard Thalers recent Nobel Prize in Economics seems like a rich field of potential solutions.People tend to do things, like donate organs, when its the default option as opposed to something they need to request.They tend to be less likely to miss appointments if you tell them how many other patients show up for theirs.They tend to be more likely to engage in preventive behaviors like using sunscreen if you focus on the benefits, not the harms.Many are turning to ideas like these to improve medication adherence.But those excited about the potential of behavioral economics should keep in mind the results of a recent study.It pulled out all the stops in trying to get patients who had a heart attack to be more compliant in taking their medication.(Patients adherence at such a time is surprisingly low, even though it makes a big difference in outcomes, so this is a major problem.)Photo Researchers randomly assigned more than 1,500 people to one of two groups.All had recently had heart attacks.One group received the usual care.The other received special electronic pill bottles that monitored patients use of medication.Those patients who took their drugs were entered into a lottery in which they had a 20 percent chance to receive $5 and a 1 percent chance to win $50 every day for a year.Thats not all.The lottery group members could also sign up to have a friend or family member automatically be notified if they didnt take their pills so that they could receive social support.They were given access to special social work resources.There was even a staff engagement adviser whose specific duty was providing close monitoring and feedback, and who would remind patients about the importance of adherence.This was a kitchen-sink approach.It involved direct financial incentives, social support nudges, health care system resources and significant clinical management.It failed.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.The time to first hospitalization for a cardiovascular problem or death was the same between the two groups.The time to any hospitalization and the total number of hospitalizations were the same.So were the medical costs.Even medication adherence the process measure that might influence these outcomes was no different between the two groups.The researchers in this trial deserve praise for their frank assessment of their results, as well as for trying to brainstorm ways in which they might achieve success in the future.Getting patients to change their behavior is very hard.In the past, weve tried making drugs free to patients to get them to adhere to their medications and improve outcomes.That failed.Weve tried lotteries (as in the study above) to nudge people to achieve better compliance.That failed.Maybe financial incentives, and behavioral economics in general, work better in public health than in more direct health care.There have been successes, after all, with respect to weight loss although these seemed to disappear over time.Weve also seen promise with respect to smoking cessation, although these come with caveats as well.Experts caution that the interventions that achieve success are often very intensive.They demand a great deal of attention, and can be quite expensive.Moreover, they are very focused, usually on a single issue or condition.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The problem is that health has so many moving parts.The health care system has even more.Trying to improve any one aspect can make others worse.Behavioral economics may offer us some fascinating theories to test in controlled trials, but we have a long way to go before we can assume its a cure for what ails Americans.
Your Race Against Time: How Climate Affects the Marathon:::::And while the biggest impacts show up in the performances of amateurs and weekend warriors, elite runners are not immune to these effects.When considering the top 20 finishing times at the largest marathons, the assessment found that temperatures in the 50s did not slow them, relative to days in the 40s.But temperatures in the 60s increased their times by three minutes, and those in the 70s increased their times by four minutes.Photo Since temperature has such a big effect on times, would it make sense to adjust marathon times for the weather?If this were done, five of the 25 fastest mens marathon times through March 1, 2017, would beat the current adjusted world record.Indeed, three of them would be more than two minutes faster.The current world-record holder is Dennis Kimetto from Kenya, but the temperature-adjusted record-holder would be Kenenisa Bekele from Ethiopia, who would move up from No.3 on the list.The second-fastest time would belong to the Ethiopian Tamirat Tola, who would move up from No.18.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Adjusting times for temperatures would lead to smaller changes among women.Paula Radcliffe of Britain (who has won the New York race three times) would remain the record-holder.The interactions between climate and a sport like long-distance running are only going to get more pronounced as the climate changes.Over the last 50 years, the temperature has exceeded 60 degrees on just 5 percent of the days during the first week of November, when the New York race is typically held.By 2050, this is projected to rise to 18 percent of days, and by 2090 it is expected to be 38 percent.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.How will runners and organizers react?National governments, city planners and large corporations are all realizing that a warmer world will force them to change the ways they do business.Marathons will be no exception.The organizers of the New York race will probably not want their event to be one where it is difficult, or perhaps even impossible, for people to set their personal best or to lower the world record.So they may want to adapt by moving the marathon to later in the year.At the same time, runners may switch from the New York City Marathon to others held in cooler climates to find the perfect temperature at just the right time of year.Could a Montreal Marathon be among the worlds most prestigious by 2050?Athletic equipment companies will surely develop new technologies to aid adaptation as well.For runners, the breathable mesh and cooling towels of today could easily be traded in for shirts with built-in air-conditioners.Seem far-fetched?They already exist.Indeed, I was one of the authors of a recent study of just how powerful a role technology can play in helping people adapt to warmer temperatures.For example, the rise of air-conditioning has reduced the mortality consequences of extremely hot days in the United States by more than 70 percent since 1960.Marathons and marathon runners appear likely to be able to adapt to climate change with relative ease through changes in when, where and how.But in many other areas of our lives, the costs of climate change are expected to be greater.More intense hurricanes, and the increased occurrence of extremely hot days, will elevate risks to life and property, which can only be offset through costly adaptation efforts.These include building more expensive housing, accelerating the deployment of air-conditioning and making painful decisions to move away from current homes as well as acceptance of increased risks.In this way, the climate choice in front of us is similar to the one faced by people training for a marathon.More time spent training makes for a faster marathon.Its not a great idea to show up on the day of the race without having invested much in your performance.The time for that is well in advance of the big day.In the case of climate change, we can devote resources now to reducing greenhouse gas emissions so that we face lower costs in the future.As with so many things in life, both marathons and the climate problem are subject to an old rule no pain, no gain.
What Did Bernie Sanders Learn in His Weekend in Canada?:::::Mr. Sanders, who drew huge crowds as a presidential candidate in the United States last year, learned firsthand that he is also a household name in Toronto.His policy vision, decidedly from the left in the United States, matches mainstream Canadian views.You received the welcome here that is normally reserved for celebrity rock stars, said Greg Marchildon, the director of the North American Observatory on Health Systems and Policies at the University of Toronto.Ed Broadbent, the chairman of the progressive Broadbent Institute, called Mr. Sanders the most important social democrat in North America even though Mr. Sanders is not a Canadian social democrat, and is not even a particularly powerful member of the Senate.Photo Lesson 2: Doctors like the system as much as patients do Many developed countries have achieved universal health coverage, but Canada is relatively distinct in its insistence that individuals should not have to pay any money at the point of care.When Canadians go to the doctor or hospital, they just show their Canadian Medicare card.At Womens College Hospital, executives showed Mr. Sanders an empty billing window.The hospital, they told him, has one employee who manages bills.For the entire hospital?Mr. Sanders said, in mock disbelief.Several patients told him about the comfort that comes from not having to pay for their care directly.And doctors, too, said they felt more comfortable recommending their patients get an operation or see a specialist than they might if those treatments werent free.I didnt have to fill out any forms; I didnt have to worry about how I was going to pay for the simple job of staying alive, said Lilac Chow, a kidney transplant patient at Toronto General Hospital, who had been brought in to share her experience with the senator.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Whenever Mr. Sanders was asked what he learned about the Canadian system, the value of free care came up.What I think stuck out to me was from both the patients and the physicians, the importance of not having to worry about money in terms of the doctor-patient relationship, he said in an interview after his trip on Tuesday.His Medicare-for-All bill includes free care as a central feature.If the legislation became law, no American would pay directly for a doctor, dentist or hospital visit, and co-payments for prescription drugs would be limited.(Taxpayers would, of course, finance the system.)Photo Lesson 3: Sometimes, you have to wait At a round-table discussion at Womens College Hospital, the chief of surgery noted that Canadian patients cant always get all the care they want right away.Wait times, you could argue are a problem for certain procedures, said Dr. David Urbach, before discussing the ways the province and hospital were working to shorten the lines.Mr. Sanders quickly turned to the glass-half-full interpretation.What you are arguing correct me if Im wrong is that waiting times are not a problem, and its an issue you are dealing with, he said.In Canada, where government finances health insurance and the private sector delivers a lot of the care, patients with life-threatening emergencies are treated right away.But patients with cataracts or arthritis often have to wait for operations the Canadian system considers elective.A governmental review of the Ontario system recently found that wait times were getting worse in some cases, like knee replacements.The Canadian system puts hospitals on a budget and limits the number of specialists it trains, both factors that can lead to lines for complex care thats not life-threatening.The system also limits access to services, like M.R.I.scans, that are much more abundant south of the border.On his weekend tour, Mr. Sanders didnt see the places where patients might wait.Hospital executives instead showed him a refugee primary care clinic, a neonatal intensive care unit and a cardiac surgery unit.But he points out that many Americans who are uninsured or who have limited savings and insurance with high deductibles may wait even longer than Canadians for elective, or even urgent, care.Advertisement Continue reading the main story If youre very, very rich, youll get the highest-quality care immediately in the United States, Mr. Sanders said, in the interview.If youre working class, if youre middle class, it is a very, very different story.The Commonwealth Fund, a health research group, ranked the United States health system at the bottom of its most recent 11-country rankings, published in July.But Canada did only a little better, at No.9.Of all the measures in the study, Canada ranked the worst on the timeliness of care.(A team of Upshot experts eliminated Canada in the first round in an eight-country virtual bracket tournament of international health system performance.)Any single-payer system will need to grapple with how much it should spend over all, and where it will save money.Mr. Sanderss Medicare-for-All bill currently includes few details about how the government would set budgets and allocate resources once all Americans were brought into the government system.Photo Lesson 4: Even Canadas system has holes Mr. Sanders wants to bring big, sweeping change to the American health care system.Unlike the Affordable Care Act, which filled in holes in an existing system, his Medicare-for-All plan would take away the health coverage that most Americans hold now, replacing it with a single, very generous government system.It would do away with the premiums, deductibles and co-payments that individuals and businesses pay for health care, and instead impose large tax increases.That is not the kind of change that would be politically trivial.In his speech, he noted that the creation of a single-payer system in Canada and Britain followed grass-roots movements, and political landslides by the parties that favored the change.Real change always happens from the bottom up, he said, to big applause.Youve got to struggle for it.Youve got to fight for it.Youve got to take it.And that is the history of all real change in this world.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Yet even in Canada, he learned, changes to the health care system have been difficult.The Canadian system, with insurance run at the province level, covers doctors and hospitals.But decades after the 1984 Canada Health Act, many Canadians pay for supplemental private insurance through their jobs for prescription drugs, dentistry and optometry despite a growing recognition that medications are essential to care.Any one of us around the table is just a job loss away from having access to prescription medications, and thats a problem, said Danielle Martin, a vice president at Womens College Hospital and policy researcher, who helped organize the trip, at a round-table discussion.Im on my own going to the dentist, said Naomi Duguid, a patient, sitting across the table.Its the only time I get to experience what it must be like to be an uninsured American.Ontario has recently started a program that will provide coverage for medications to residents under 25.And there is a patchwork of drug coverage programs for older people, the poor and those who get insurance from work.But even in Canada, its tough to find the resources to expand coverage.Advertisement Continue reading the main story We have to find the money to fund the program up front, said Kathleen Wynne, the premier of Ontario, who helped establish the youth drug coverage program.Photo Lesson 5: Canadians seem to value fairness more than Americans do Equity.Fairness.Throughout the weekend, Mr. Sanders kept asking Canadians what they thought about the higher taxes theyd paid to finance their system.Every one among the patients and doctors selected to meet him said the trade-off was worth it because it made the system fair.I think its a really fair way to do it, said Frederick Brownridge, 67, of Etobicoke, Ontario, as he sat by the window in his Toronto General Hospital room, with IV lines in his arms.Mr. Brownridge had had two heart valves repaired and a double bypass three days earlier.It also means if youre in a lower economic status or higher economic status, youll get the treatment you need.On Tuesday, Mr. Sanders said the uniformity of this message really stuck out to him: There really is, I think, a deep-seated belief in Canada that health care is a right, and whether youre rich or whether youre poor or whether youre middle class, you are entitled to health care.In the United States, though, Republicans control the presidency and the Congress, and many candidates last year ran on a promise to roll back government support for health care coverage.Several recent public opinion surveys show majority support for a government guarantee of health coverage, but support declines substantially when pollsters mention that government coverage would mean higher taxes.Mr. Sanders said he knows his bill isnt going to become law anytime soon, but he thinks discussing the idea will help make its underlying values more broadly acceptable.When you talk about health care, youre not just talking about health care, he said in his Toronto speech.Youre talking about values, because how a society deals with health care is more than medicine.Its more than technology.It is about the values that those societies hold dear.
Just Say No to Opioids? Ads Could Actually Make Things Worse:::::Photo In declaring the opioid epidemic a public health emergency last week, President Trump promised that the federal government would start a massive advertising campaign to get people, especially children, not to want to take drugs in the first place.But past efforts to prevent substance abuse through advertising have often been ineffective or even harmful.Perhaps the most famous American antidrug advertisement featured a sizzling egg in a frying pan to the sound of ominous music and a stern voice-over warning, This is your brain on drugs.A sequel to this ad featured Rachael Leigh Cook smashing an egg and the better part of a kitchen to dramatize the impact of heroin.Many other ads denouncing drugs and emphasizing their destructive effects as in the Just Say No campaign appeared regularly on television and in print beginning in the 1980s.Most of them were funded by the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy, which received hundreds of millions of dollars a year from Congress for such campaigns.Visually dramatic though the ads were, evaluations of them were deeply discouraging.The billions spent from the late 1980s through the mid-2000s at best had no effect on drug use, research shows.At worst, exposure to the campaign might have actually increased the likelihood of adolescent marijuana use.A study of over 20,000 youths 9 to 18 found that those who had been exposed to more antidrug ads expressed weaker intentions to avoid marijuana and more doubts that marijuana was harmful.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Why was the original campaign such a failure?In part it suffered from perverse incentives.Congress provided substantial money for the ads and was intensely interested in them at the height of the so-called war on drugs, creating internal pressure to make the ads appealing to members of Congress.But while ads that lectured or scared people about drugs might have seemed compelling to the modal member of Congress (a 60-year-old white male), they did not necessarily dissuade drug use by adolescents.In some cases, this kind of approach may make drugs more attractive as a sign of rebellion.
Revised Data Shows Community Colleges Have Been Underappreciated:::::The old graduation measures date to the late 1980s, when Senator Bill Bradley championed legislation requiring colleges to report graduation rates for their basketball and football players and, while they were at it, everyone else.The measures were limited to students who enroll in college for the first time and take a full course load.This is a perfectly reasonable way to measure graduation rates at Mr. Bradleys alma mater, Princeton, because nearly all undergraduates there start full-time, a few months after finishing high school.The federal graduation rates also calculated the percentage of students who graduated within six years of enrollment.This made sense for four-year universities, where the vast majority of bachelors degrees are earned within six years.The problem was that the graduation rate rules were then applied to the entire higher education system, including two-year community colleges, where nearly half of all undergraduates begin.The typical community college student isnt a fresh-faced 18-year-old taking a full slate of courses.Most community college students are nontraditional adults, parents, people with full-time jobs, people returning to school after years away.They often enroll part-time, taking longer to graduate than the three years the Education Department used to gauge the success of people pursuing two-year degrees.Many community college students also transfer to four-year colleges before finishing a degree a good result, but one that wasnt counted for graduation rates.So, following the committees lead, education officials made several changes.They included part-time and returning students in the calculation.They extended the time period to eight years.And they made separate calculations of how many students transferred before graduation, and how many were still in college.The results paint a very different picture of community college success.The old measures, for example, captured about 620,000 students who began as first-time, full-time freshmen in 2008.Only 20 percent graduated from the community college they started at within three years.North Shore Community College was typical its old graduation rate was 19 percent.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Such dire numbers became fodder for people defending for-profit colleges from heavy criticism of their high cost and poor outcomes.In 2014, Steve Gunderson, head of the main for-profit college trade association, wrote: Our institutions have a 63% graduation rate in our two-year programs, while our colleagues at comparable public institutions community colleges have a graduation rate of 20%.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.The new graduation rates, by contrast, captured more than 1.5 million community college students.Even though that group included more than 710,000 part-time students, who are often less likely to graduate, extending the time frame to eight years increased the average graduation rate to 27 percent.But transfers are where community colleges really shine.Some 510,000 students transferred before graduating, bringing the combined graduation and transfer rate up to 60 percent.Including all of the part-time and returning students and looking over eight years boosted North Shores graduation rate to 35 percent.Another 19 percent transferred before graduation.Others were still working toward a degree.All told, more than half of Mr. Burtons students had a successful outcome not, as the old rates suggested, fewer than one in five.The for-profit picture is not so rosy.The two-year programs Mr. Gunderson chose for comparison make up less than one-fifth of all for-profit enrollment.Four-year programs at for-profits have much lower graduation rates than those of comparable public institutions.Combined, they had a 34 percent graduation rate under the old measures.And in contrast with community colleges, the new measures make for-profits look worse, dropping their average graduation rate to 32 percent.For-profit students seldom bring their credits elsewhere.Including transfer students increases the average for-profit success rate to just 39 percent, compared with 60 percent at community colleges.In other words, Mr. Gunderson had it backward.The new measures suggest that community colleges are much more successful than for-profit colleges, not much less.They are also far cheaper and leave the average student with much less debt.Some for-profit results are catastrophic.Take South University, a Savannah, Ga.-based for-profit college.In 2008, it enrolled 12,233 new students in its online degree programs more than the University of Georgia and Georgia State University combined.The old measures show South University Online with a mind-boggling 2.4 percent graduation rate.But, as with community colleges, most South University Online students are nontraditional.What happens when all the students are counted over a full eight years?Answer: The graduation rate increases to just 7.8 percent.Add in transfers?8.1 percent.Include those still enrolled?8.5 percent.Three years after leaving college, only 23 percent of South University Online students have paid back even a dollar on the principal of their student loans, probably because nearly all of them failed to earn a degree.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Despite these results, South University Online remains accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools, the same body whose response to a multidecade academic cheating scandal at the University of North Carolina was to put the campus on probation for a single year.By comparison, the graduation rate of Georgia Northwestern Technical College, a public school, increases to 50 percent from 25 percent using the new measures.Preparing students to transfer falls to regional public universities in Georgia, instead of community colleges.Savannah State University has only a 33 percent eight-year graduation rate.But include transfer students, and its success rate rises to 81.2 percent.Not all community colleges look better.San Jose City College in California, which graduates 19 percent of traditional students within three years, sees its graduation rate drop to 18 percent when part-time and returning students are included, even when the time frame is extended to eight years.Transfers improve the success rate only to 21 percent.Most students at San Jose City College are falling short.Many community colleges have room to improve.But the big picture shows that community colleges were unfairly tarred by the old graduation rates.The results produced by including all students and by looking over the right time frame and accounting for transfers suggest that many prospective undergraduates may benefit from giving their local community college another look when searching for an affordable path to a degree.And lawmakers who have typically underfunded community colleges may want to direct more resources to institutions that are doing a difficult job better than we knew.
How a Republican Idea for Reducing Medicare Costs Could Affect You:::::If Medicare already has a form of a premium support model, whats all the fuss about?The important difference is in how stipend levels are set.Todays stipends are not driven by the market, but are set according to legislatively established formulas.But the type of premium support Medicare reformers usually advocate what people generally mean when they use this term would use market signals to set stipend levels.Photo Premium support could result in increased efficiency in the Medicare program, said Bryan Dowd, a health economist at the University of Minnesota, and co-author of a book that analyzed various premium support options.That efficiency could push the hospital trust fund depletion date further into the future and reduce the financial burden on future generations.Premium support models take many forms, but there are two crucial variables.One is how stipend levels are set, which determines how much of beneficiaries own money they need to contribute.The other key feature of premium support is how much the stipend grows over time.Both aspects are hotly debated.Advertisement Continue reading the main story In some versions of premium support, the stipend level would grow more slowly than health care costs, forcing people to pay more out of pocket over time to purchase coverage.In other versions, the stipend level would grow at the same rate as health care costs, so beneficiaries would continue to pay about the same share of their own money for health insurance.Most premium support approaches would retain traditional Medicare, though its fate would be uncertain, a source of controversy.A lot rides on how the governments support level differentially impacts the cost to beneficiaries of private plans versus traditional Medicare, said Timothy McBride, a health economist with Washington University in St. Louis.Geography also plays a role.If traditional Medicare is disadvantaged, that would hit rural beneficiaries harder, because a larger share of rural America relies on the traditional program than do urban Americans.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.As a report this month from the Congressional Budget Office reveals, how much premium support could save the government varies considerably depending on how stipend levels are established.Across the variations the C.B.O.examined, Medicare spending could fall by as much as 9 percent or as little as about 0.5 percent.But premiums could rise, including the premium for traditional Medicare.Under one projection, the C.B.O.estimates, traditional Medicares premium could double.In all the scenarios the C.B.O.analyzed, stipend levels would be based on bids from Medicare Advantage plans and traditional Medicare that reflect the cost to cover a person for standard Medicare services.Stipend levels would keep pace with overall health care costs, but they could still be lower than what many Medicare beneficiaries receive today.For example, tying the stipend to the second-lowest bid and requiring all Medicare beneficiaries to be subject to that new, lower level would save $419 billion over 2022-2026, the C.B.O.estimated.Tying it to the average bid or requiring only new beneficiaries to be subject to the new stipend would save less.In either case, people would have access to plans that dont cost more than todays.But those who opted for more expensive plans because they offer more benefits, or the traditional program because it covers any doctor willing to accept Medicare patients, would pay more out of pocket.Consequently, more people would opt for cheaper, private plans and fewer would choose traditional Medicare.This worries some health policy experts.Traditional Medicare has been the leader in reforming the health care payment and delivery system to improve efficiency, said Paul Van de Water, senior fellow with the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.It has outperformed private insurance in holding down the growth of health costs, but its ability to continue to do that would shrink significantly if premium support caused its enrollment to dwindle.Exactly how much more people would pay depends not only on the plans they select, but also on where they live.In some markets, many plans, including the traditional program, might charge premiums close to the second-lowest bid.In others, plans that many beneficiaries may want might cost a lot more.In the premium support debate, theres a fundamental lesson: Its conceptually simple to reduce federal spending on health care, but its very hard to do so in a way that doesnt increase costs for at least some consumers.To actually reduce total (not just federal) health care spending for everyone, one has to overhaul how care is delivered, not just how it is paid for.Thats much harder.
Trump, McConnell call on Roy Moore to exit Alabama Senate race if these allegations are true:::::Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and other GOP senators on Nov. 9 called on Roy Moore to withdraw from a Senate race in Alabama if allegations of sexual misconduct are true.(Jordan Frasier,Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post) Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and other GOP senators on Nov. 9 called on Roy Moore to withdraw from a Senate race in Alabama if allegations of sexual misconduct are true.(Jordan Frasier,Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post) A growing chorus of Republicans, including President Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), have called on Senate candidate Roy Moore to withdraw from a special election in Alabama if allegations prove true that the former judge initiated a sexual encounter with a 14-year-old girl nearly four decades ago.White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who was accompanying Trump as he traveled from China to Vietnam on Friday, said, Like most Americans, the president does not believe we can allow a mere allegation, in this case one from many years ago, to destroy a persons life.However, the president also believes that if these allegations are true, Judge Moore will do the right thing and step aside.McConnell, in a formal statement on behalf of all Republican senators, said, If these allegations are true, he must step aside.Other Republican senators weighing in included Jeff Flake of Arizona, David Perdue of Georgia, John Thune of South Dakota, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Cory Gardner of Colorado, Richard C. Shelby of Alabama and Patrick J. Toomey of Pennsylvania.Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) called on Moore to step aside as well and without couching his statement with if true language.The allegations against Roy Moore are deeply disturbing and disqualifying, McCain said.He should immediately step aside and allow the people of Alabama to elect a candidate they can be proud of.Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Tex.)quickly makes comments to journalists about Senate candidate Roy Moore on Thursday.(Melina Mara/The Washington Post) Vice President Pence also found the allegations in the story disturbing and believes, if true, this would disqualify anyone from serving in office, said spokeswoman Alyssa Farah.[Woman says Roy Moore initiated sexual encounter when she was 14, he was 32] Moore has denied the allegations and given no indication that he will exit the race.Our children and grandchildrens futures are on the line, he tweeted Thursday.So rest assured I will NEVER GIVE UP the fight!Moore also emailed a fundraising pitch off the revelations.I believe you and I have a duty to stand up and fight back against the forces of evil waging an all-out war on our conservative values, he wrote.The state Republican Party has the power to disqualify Moore from the election, according to the Alabama secretary of state.If that happens, McConnell and other Republicans would face the challenge of figuring out which candidate would run in Moores place and how to win an election in which it is too late to replace the former judges name on the Dec. 12 ballot.Under Alabama state law, the ballot cannot be changed within 76 days of an election.However, in the event of either disqualification or withdrawal, votes cast for Moore would not be certified.In addition, state law allows write-in votes to be cast in general elections, as long as the names are for living people and written in without using a rubber stamp or stick-on label.Despite a state law barring candidates from appearing twice on ballots in the same election cycle, Sen. Luther Strange (R-Ala.), who lost in the primary to Moore, would be an eligible write-in candidate, said John Bennett, an official at the state secretary of states office.Several state Republicans suggested Thursday that the party is unlikely to disqualify Moore.The Post's Michael Scherer followed Senate candidate Roy Moore (R) in the final days of his primary campaign against Sen. Luther Strange (R-Ala.).Here's a look into his controversial views.(Jenny Starrs,Michael Scherer/The Washington Post) Samuel H. Givhan, the senior vice chairman of the state party, described The Washington Post story as allegations from somebody who has been silent for over 40 years who was speaking out just weeks before an election.When asked about the Senate majority leaders call for Moore to step aside if the accusations are found to be true, Givhan said, Im not sure Sen. McConnell has any say so in this.Jonathan P. Gray, a Republican consultant in Alabama who is not working with any of the Senate candidates this year, was more pointed: I think it was already perfectly well stated that no one in Alabama gives a s--- what Mitch McConnell or John McCain thinks we should do.A group close to McConnell that spent millions of dollars to oppose Moore in the primary called on Gov.Kay Ivey (R) and the state party to investigate the allegations.If theres even a shred of evidence to these accusations, Gov.Ivey and the Alabama Republican Party need to do everything in their power to remove Judge Moore from the ballot, said Steven Law, chief executive of the Senate Leadership Fund.There is no place in our party for sexual predators.Strange avoided reporters questions in the Capitol on Thursday, but Shelby, his Alabama colleague, said: Luther Strange is a good senator, hes a friend, and I support him.I dont know what hes going to do, but well see what develops.In an extensive report published Thursday, The Post detailed the allegations against Moore by the then-14-year-old and three other girls who were between the ages of 16 and 18 when they said the incidents occurred.None of the women sought out The Post.While reporting a story in Alabama about supporters of Moores Senate campaign, a Post reporter heard that Moore allegedly had sought relationships with teenage girls.Over the ensuing three weeks, two Post reporters contacted and interviewed the four women.All were initially reluctant to speak publicly but chose to do so after multiple interviews, saying they thought it was important for people to know about their interactions with Moore.The women say they dont know one another.The news struck the Capitol with a thunderbolt Thursday afternoon.As senators headed in for an afternoon vote on a Transportation Department nominee, reporters swarmed Republicans in a bid to get their reaction.McConnell was hounded more than usual as he headed to the Senate Chamber, with reporters shouting questions at a lawmaker they know usually stays mum when asked questions in the hallway.Once he stepped onto the floor, McConnell quickly voted and conferred with aides.Moments later, Strange came to the floor and headed straight for McConnell.They conferred for several moments before McConnell asked an aide to track down his top spokesman, Don Stewart.You cant make this up, mouthed one of McConnells aides to another colleague.Stewart came to the floor and told McConnell and Strange that a statement was being sent to reporters.In it, McConnell called on Moore to step down if the allegations are true.Strange, seemingly unsure of what to do, was instructed to vote and leave the chamber as quickly as possible.McConnell then conferred with other senators, including Rob Portman (R-Ohio), Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) and Thune.Stewart also assured the senators that a statement was out but then, realizing that reporters were watching from above, instructed McConnell, Please go.He walked toward the back door of the Senate Chamber, paused momentarily and stepped out.Several reporters were waiting for him in the Ohio Clock Corridor.McConnells inner circle spent late Thursday morning discussing the repercussions and how Republicans should move forward and grousing that if Strange, their preferred candidate in the primary, was still the nominee, they would not be answering questions about Moores conduct.If its true, the Republican Party doesnt have any place for pedophiles and he should step down immediately, said Josh Holmes, a McConnell confidant and his former chief of staff.Steve Bannon is responsible, he added about the McConnell foil and former White House chief strategist, for enabling candidates such as Moore who are out of the GOP mainstream.That view was shared by Scott Reed, a political strategist for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, who opposed Moores nomination.Here we go another Steve Bannon special, Reed said.Ed OKeefe, Karoun Demirjian, Paul Kane and David Weigel contributed to this report.Read more at PowerPost
A few months after Harvey, Houstons long recovery quietly heads inside:::::A worker repairs Kolter Elementary School, damaged by the flooding from Hurricane Harvey, on Oct. 31.(Ilana Panich-Linsman for The Washington Post) When Hurricane Harvey hit and hovered for days above this city, a half-dozen school district employees manning pumps stayed at Kolter Elementary School in the flood-prone Meyerland neighborhood.Eventually, they had to be rescued from the roof.The flooded school is now full with construction crews, its students miles away in a cramped campus to which they arrive on charter buses, the deluxe kind fitted out with video screens.To them, its like theyre going to the Grammys every day, said Julianne Dickinson, the schools principal.For Dickinson, the novelty of displacement has worn off.Like many here, she feels fortunate that her ruined school has a new home, even if the campus is holding 200 more students than it was ever meant to.Improvisation has become an art, as it has for many in the countrys fourth-largest city.The school halls bear the familiar crayon-and-construction-paper decor of student drawings.Kids in costume lined up one recent morning for the Parade of Book Characters, a literary twist on Halloween unique to Kolter Elementary.But it is not the same place.Two special-needs classes have been taken in by an undamaged school with more room.Pallets of donated copier paper and print cartridges line the already tight hallways.The small cafeteria holds only one class at a time, so lunch hour runs all day.The entire staff shares an office, and at home, Dickinson has taken in a fourth-grade teacher whose house was destroyed in the flood.Were only eight kids short of what we anticipated, Dickinson said, noting that, despite it all, just a few families moved out of the district after the flood.Its pretty wonderful, and it says something about us and all these people wanting to stick it out.[A massive storm flooded Houston.Experts say Californias state capital could be next.]Nearly three months after the historic storm, a very public disaster has become a largely private one.To the eye, the city has returned to a semblance of normalcy.Schools are open.The power is on.The International Quilt Festival packed in visitors on a recent weekend in the downtown convention center where thousands sought shelter during Harvey.Much of this has happened ahead of schedule.The federal government has paid out about $1.4 billion in emergency housing and other assistance to people in Houston and the other counties designated disaster areas, money to fund the immediate repairs needed to make homes livable as quickly as possible.But the challenges, which will take years to solve and will redraw this citys geography in doing so, have moved inside homes and classrooms and government offices.Debris piles have mostly disappeared.They have been replaced by contractor trucks parked in the driveways of thousands of Houston homes, the pounding of hammers and buzzing of saws coming from inside.More than 9,000 city residents are adjusting to life in hotel rooms.The steady soundtrack of radio ads offering cash for damaged homes is evidence of the private money that is turning once-stable, now gutted neighborhoods into a speculators paradise.In addition to the emergency housing aid, the federal government, strained by competing disasters in South Florida and Puerto Rico, has paid out more than $4.2 billion in flood insurance claims associated with Harvey.But some, particularly those who have the least, complain about weeks-long delays and backed-up bills.The governments bills lie ahead.Houston schools opened within a month of the storm, a recovery that far exceeded expectations after more than 200 of the districts 287 campuses were damaged.But the repair costs will be exorbitant, probably exceeding $200 million, including the likely need to rebuild at least four schools from the ground up.The weakened state of the city is working against the districts ability to raise the money.Houston public schools are funded by property tax revenue, and those are projected to plummet in the years ahead because of the extensive storm damage.Im very, very pleased with the speed of the recovery and how the city is bouncing back, Mayor Sylvester Turner (D) said in a recent interview.That is not to say that there are not tremendous needs.There are tremendous needs, so let me be clear about that.But I dont think any other city could have responded more quickly than this city has.Rush to normal, then waiting Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner (D) turned to recovery even before Harvey wholly dissipated, trying to get his city back to normal.(Ilana Panich-Linsman for The Washington Post) Harvey dumped more than four feet of rain on Houston over a few days in late August, and even as boat rescues continued in residential neighborhoods, Turner began to look ahead to recovery.His early priority, after ensuring public safety following a storm that killed scores and left tens of thousands homeless, was to make the city feel as normal as possible.He turned to baseball.His office helped coordinate an appeal to the New York Mets, who agreed to keep their doubleheader date with the now-world champion Astros in downtown Minute Maid Park before the storm had even cleared the city.The Astros won both games, including a win against Mets starting pitcher Matt Harvey.[With thousands still in shelters, FEMAs caution about temporary housing hinders hurricane recovery] He called Janet Jackson.The singer had a concert planned for the Toyota Center the following weekend, and she considered canceling, given the state of the city.Turner talked her out of it, and she visited the nearby George R. Brown Convention Center beforehand to spend time with the more than 1,000 Houstonians sheltered there.All emergency shelters have closed.Many have returned to patched-up homes or moved in with families.More than 50,000 others statewide are living in hotel rooms.Now Turner is looking at the long-term costs of the storm and the way the aftermath will determine how and where Houston, which has flooded each of the past three years, is rebuilt.Local officials have identified 65 neighborhoods, comprising roughly 3,300 homes, that have flooded repeatedly.Turner said the city and county governments will look to buy out hundreds of homeowners on a voluntary basis before they rebuild in those high-risk areas that lie at least two feet below the floodplain.Future development will also come under closer scrutiny.Earlier this month, Turner used his prerogative to pull consideration of a new housing development off the city councils agenda to allow for more study.Reservoirs will have to be built to protect the citys vulnerable west side.The poor and the elderly, who suffered severely in a storm that generally did not discriminate by class, will need long-term assistance to regain purchase on disrupted lives.We are living in the post-Harvey world, and so we just have to be mindful of the impact of what we do, Turner said.But we are still the same city.We are still developing.Congress approved $15 billion for Harvey assistance, and the state of Texas has given another $50 million to Houston so far.Turner believes the recovery cost for the region may run as high as $180 billion, and his city and the counties around it need money quickly.He has lobbied the state for additional funding.So far Gov.Greg Abbott (R) has declined requests to open the rainy-day fund for emergency relief, saying Houston has enough money so far.Abbott has said he would reconsider his position as the recovery progresses, and Turner believes he will eventually send more money when the costs become clearer.Its like we were just waiting on the dollars to come down from D.C. so we can get into these homes and put them in better shape, Turner said.Its like a wheel.We are moving, and were moving at lightning speed.We simply want the others to do the same.Recovering on credit Drucilla Bolden, 64, checks on her home mid-repair on Nov. 1.Her insurance money has been slow to come in, and the contractor fixing her house has been working on credit for weeks.(Ilana Panich-Linsman for The Washington Post) In the Gulf Meadows neighborhood southeast of Houstons downtown, Drucilla Bolden is one of those waiting.She is 64 years old, a retired schoolteacher, and her sister and housemate, Vera, is 70.The two were among 200 women evacuated by fishing boat from the suburb of small, single-story houses as Harvey poured down.Her home for the past 25 years suffered severe water damage, and on a recent day, a contractor sawed through moldy drywall in the effort make it livable again.[Surviving Harvey: A long and fraught recovery] Bolden does not have any money to pay him.She received a $40,000 advance against her federal flood insurance claim from the government, but the money only paid for supplies and a bit of labor.The contractor has been working on credit for weeks.During Boldens frequent trips to Lowes, she hears from many others in her neighborhood lingering in the same financial limbo.The sisters have been staying with another sister not far away.But Bolden said she feels like a burden with no money to contribute for the emergency hospitality.Vera always tells me to pack my patience, Bolden said.My patience is done.Its going to take time In the citys low southwest side sits Meyerland, a comfortable upper-middle-class neighborhood whose design ethic has been shaped by successive floods.New multi-floor homes raised four to five feet off the ground loom next to the neighborhoods initial single-story ranchers and architectural originals.The new houses identify those who rebuilt after the Memorial Day flood of 2015, including the Flippen family.Margaret Flippen said the familys original home was destroyed in that flood and only after long consideration did she and her husband, an energy executive, decide to rebuild in the same spot.Margaret Flippen, 40, weathered Harvey in her house, which didnt flood, thanks to storm-resistant building.Her previous house was destroyed by flooding in 2015.(Ilana Panich-Linsman for The Washington Post) The mother of three said the decision was based in large part on keeping the children in Kolter Elementary, which she called the heart of the neighborhood, just up her oak-lined street.She used to walk her children there, as did most of her neighbors.Now her husband drives them to the new campus a few miles to the north.The Flippens moved into their new home in December.A set of steep stairs leads to their porch and front door.As Harvey began, three families in older, lower homes arrived, filling the spacious house with 10 kids under the age of 7 to wait out the storm.Soon, boats began patrolling what was the street outside.The water rose, all the way to the top step of the porch, prompting the families to move all the furniture upstairs.But the house remained dry, although many on Flippens street filled with water.Its going to take time more time than the last time to recover, but I feel like there are sections of the neighborhood that already have momentum, she said.People are reinvesting.But whether to stay is a very personal decision.A few streets away, Jim Dubbert has made the decision to leave, only he cannot.His original midcentury modern home, built in 1961, is a complete loss.It flooded two years ago with 18 inches of water; Harvey filled it with 44 inches.He and his wife, Mary-Dodd, would have moved the last time if he could have sold the house for enough to pay off the mortgage.Instead, he began making the renovations himself, unable to hire a contractor for the work, because the home itself does not meet city code.The back of the house is all glass, making it impossible to raise.A semiretired consultant, Dubbert worked on the renovations against the clock, knowing another flood was inevitable, but he was unable to finish in time to sell before it came.He has begun again, the TV news on in the background, his dog Auggie nearby.Out back is an RV, which he and Mary-Dodd call Harvey, lent to them by friends so they do not have to sleep inside the musty house.If you dont have friends, you have no chance at a time like this, no way to do it by yourself, said Dubbert, who is 72.But if we flood again, sorry, the bulldozer starts on that end of the house and pushes all the way to that end.
He said he didnt meddle: Trump talks with Putin about U.S. elections and Syria in brief interactions:::::President Trump on Nov. 11 said he believes that Russian President Vladimir Putin is being truthful when he denies that Russia meddled in the 2016 presidential election.(Reuters) President Trump said Saturday that Russian President Vladimir Putin again denied that Moscow tampered in the U.S. presidential campaign last year.The two men had brief conversations during a larger meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Danang, Vietnam, before Trump flew to Hanoi for a bilateral meeting Sunday with Vietnamese leaders.Trump said that he had two or three brief conversations with Putin mostly centered on the war in Syria, but added that he pressed the Russian leader on Moscows role in attempting to interfere in the 2016 election.He said he didnt meddle, Trump said, answering questions in the press cabin on Air Force One.I asked him again.You can only ask so many times....He said he absolutely did not meddle in our election.He did not do what they are saying he did.Trump said that he believed Putin was sincere in his denials, and that Putin seemed to find the question insulting.Suggesting that what he called the artificial Democratic hit job of investigations of his campaign were preventing U.S.-Russian cooperation on a range of issues, including North Korea, Trump said that it is a shame, because people will die because of it.In his own news conference after their talks, Putin said he knew absolutely nothing about contacts with Trump campaign officials, and called reports that a campaign official sought a meeting with his niece bollocks, according to an interpreter.They can do what they want, looking for some sensation, Putin said of the investigations.But there are no sensations.Putin said he and Trump hardly know each other, but described the U.S. president as very professional, very friendly, he behaves very appropriately.Unfortunately, we did not have enough time to get down to some more details, he said, because we have many matters to discuss.He blamed the lack of a formal meeting between the two at the conference on the failure of their respective teams, and said they would be lectured on the lapse.The two leaders issued a joint statement pledging to continue their cooperation to defeat the Islamic State in Syria, and their commitment to U.N.-brokered peace negotiations between the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and opponents fighting to oust him.Trump also described former FBI director James B. Comey, who testified to Congress that Trump asked him to drop an investigation of his campaigns ties to Russian officials, as a proven liar and leaker.Trump called the former U.S. intelligence officials who concluded that the Russians tampered including former director of national intelligence James R. Clapper Jr. and former CIA director John Brennan political hacks.Clapper, Brennan and Comey, on behalf of the 17-agency intelligence community, issued a report in January describing an unprecedented Russian intelligence operation to undermine public faith in the U.S. democratic process and help elect Trump.The intelligence agencies have said that Russian hackers stole and made public thousands of emails from the Democratic National Committee, also spread misinformation in an attempt to help Trump beat Democrat Hillary Clinton.Trump, however, has said he does not believe that Russia actively sought to help him.The assessment sparked ongoing, separate investigations by Congress and special counsel Robert S. Mueller III, a former FBI director, of Russian interference in the campaign.Those inquiries include determining whether there was any collusion between the Russians and the Trump campaign.Trump said that Putin is very, very strong in the fact that he didnt do it.You have President Putin very strongly, vehemently, says he has nothing to do with that.Now, you are not going to get into an argument, you are going to start talking about Syria and the Ukraine.Sen. Mark R. Warner (Va.), the ranking Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said in a statement that he was left completely speechless by Trumps willingness to take the word of Vladimir Putin, a former intelligence operator who spent years working against us, over the conclusions of our own combined intelligence community.In response to questions about Trumps remarks, the CIA issued a statement saying that Director Mike Pompeo stands by and has always stood by the January 2017 Intelligence Community assessment....The intelligence assessment with regard to Russian election meddling has not changed.The assessment did not address whether Russian meddling altered the election outcome.[New York Times photographer tweets photo of black box to protest White House coverage blackout] Muellers team recently brought indictments against former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and an associate, Richard Gates, alleging that between 2006 and 2016, they attempted to launder money made as consultants to Russian-allied leaders in Ukraine and that they had acted as unregistered agents for a foreign government.There was no collusion, Trump said on the plane.Everybody knows there was no collusion.He labeled phony a dossier compiled by a former British intelligence agent alleging ties between Trump and Moscow.The document was later turned over to U.S. law enforcement authorities.Many of the allegations have not been independently confirmed.Trump also cast blame on former president Barack Obama and Clinton, a former secretary of state, who famously attempted a reset of U.S. relations with Russia during Obamas first term.Trump referred to Clintons stupid reset button, in which she presented Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov with an oversize reset button that erroneously used the Russian word for overload instead of reset.Hillary tried it, she failed, nobody mentions it, Trump said.She hit that reset button.It was a joke.But she tried and she failed.Trump said that Obama had bad chemistry with Putin and that Clinton was in way over her head.When Trump was asked during the flight to Hanoi whether he believed Putins denial of tampering, he said: Every time he sees me, he says, I didnt do that, but I really believe that when he tells me that, he means it....I think hes very insulted by it, and thats not a good thing for our country.Trump met with Putin this summer on the sidelines of the Group of 20 summit in Germany, after which he said Putin issued similar denials.Both then and now, Trump did not directly respond to questions as to whether he believes Putin.[Trump had undisclosed hour-long meeting with Putin at G-20 summit] On a different topic, Trump was asked whether Roy Moore, the Republican nominee in the U.S. Senate race in Alabama, should drop out of the race over allegations that he had sexual contact with a 14-year-old girl when he was 32 .White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters two days ago that Trump thinks that mere allegations are not enough to ruin Moores life but that if the allegations are true, he should do the right thing and step aside.Trump said he has been too busy during the Asia trip to focus on the allegations against Moore.Believe it or not, even when Im in Washington or New York, I do not watch much television, he said.I know they like to say that.People that dont know me, they like to say I watch television people with fake sources.You know, fake reporters, fake sources.But I dont get to watch much television.Primarily because of documents.Im reading documents.A lot.And different things.I actually read much more.I read [articles by] you people much more than I watch television.But anyway.So I have not seen very much about him, about it.And you know I put out a statement yesterday that hell do the right thing.Nakamura reported from Danang, Vietnam.DeYoung reported from Washington.
Trump dominates the GOP base. Party leaders live with the consequences.:::::The Republican Party has been plunged into ever more turmoil, thanks to the outcome of the off-year election in Virginia, the results of contests elsewhere around the country and an allegation of sexual misconduct against Roy Moore, the partys candidate for Senate in Alabama.The Virginia gubernatorial campaign illustrated the Republican dilemma as it morphs into becoming the party of President Trump.For Ed Gillespie, the attempt at a balancing act proved awkward and ultimately unsuccessful.A candidate with deep roots in the establishment wing of the party, he tried, after receiving a scare in the primary from a pro-Trump opponent, to become more Trumpian.The controversy over whether Moore should step aside in the face of an accusation of sexual misconduct with a teenager highlights the waning power of GOP leaders to affect the partys fortunes and the split with the Republican ranks about how to deal with such problems.Moore has denied the allegation.In Virginia, Gillespies strategy didnt work.He lost to Democrat Ralph Northam by an unexpectedly wide margin of nine points.The margin of defeat has rightly rattled Republicans who wonder whether this portends an anti-Trump wave in next years midterm elections.The size of Northams margins among women (22 points) and voters younger than 45 (30 points) should add significantly to those concerns.Virginia is not the nation.It has been trending blue for some time.Its population includes more college graduates than many states, and the proximity to the nations capital affects attitudes about the federal government.It is not Pennsylvania or Michigan or Wisconsin, states with different electorates, as the 2016 results demonstrated.But as the principal data point staring at Republicans over the weekend, Virginia illustrates why the debate about the partys fate under Trump will accelerate.There are no easy answers.Former Alabama Chief Justice and U.S. Senate candidate Roy Moore speaks at an event in Alabama.(Brynn Anderson/Associated Press) The president had an instant opinion about what went wrong in Virginia.He weighed in with a tweet of displeasure at Gillespies campaign soon after Northam was declared the winner.Gillespies mistake was not embracing Trump more fully, the president said from South Korea.In one sense, the president is correct: Among Republicans, taking on the president can extract a very high price.Its the rest of the electorate that worries party leaders looking to next year.All that could be compounded by the unfolding Alabama story and the question of whether Moore will hold firm and continue his candidacy.Whether he stays or goes, the party faces more internal division.[Roy Moore and the diminished power of Washington Republicans] Republicans have been dealing with a split between their establishment wing and a populist insurgency for some time.This is a function of the widening socioeconomic coalition that now comprises the Republican Party, a coalition that includes what used to be called country club Republicans; evangelical Christians, who became a powerful force inside the party beginning with Ronald Reagan (and who are no longer a monolithic political force); and a 21st-century version of what once were called Reagan Democrats.Trump has added an additional layer.The tea party was a manifestation of the tensions within the party.Its rise in 2010 produced some of the same kinds of divisions that former White House chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon is trying to generate today dissatisfaction aimed at the partys Washington leadership.Before there was candidate Trump, the Republicans were embroiled in a different kind of debate about their future.That dispute was symbolized by the presidential candidacies of Sens.Marco Rubio of Florida and Ted Cruz of Texas.Cruz represented the view that the party should double down on its conservative values and rally what he said was its silent, conservative base.Rubio envisioned an appeal designed to expand the GOP coalition in a different way, by attracting more Latinos and younger voters.The argument was a response to Barack Obamas victories in 2008 and 2012.Cruz said the party lost those elections not because Republican policies and ideas were too conservative and its appeal too narrow.He argued that the problem was that Sen. John McCain in 2008 and former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney in 2012 were not sufficiently or authentically conservative.It was Cruzs belief that there were in fact millions of conservative voters who were on the sidelines because their presidential nominees were not true conservative champions.President-elect Donald Trump addresses supporters during an election night event in New York in 2016.(Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post) Rubio had a different vision, grounded in the changing demographics of the country and concerns that a party dependent on white voters for 85 to 90 percent of its support, as the GOP has become, would have a diminished future as the nations population became increasingly diverse.Rubio and others argued that the votes needed to win the White House could be found among those rising populations, if the party presented itself as open and welcoming to them, with policies to match.[Do Virginias election results foreshadow more GOP losses?]Candidate Trump ran roughshod over those issues and questions.He attracted his own coalition, found a path through the states in the upper Midwest that secured his electoral college victory, and along the way rewrote the rules for how a Republican could win the presidency.Now the party is at an inflection point, brought about by the presidents electoral success and the reactions of both Democrats, Republicans and independents to what has happened in the year since that victory.Can they prosper if they truly become the party of Trump?Or are they more likely to suffer losses in midterm elections because, whether they do or not, they are now seen as the party of Trump?Congressional Republicans hope that passing a tax bill will ease public frustrations with their performance and boost their chances in 2018, but something larger is at work in the way voters are seeing the stakes of a Trump presidency.One question is whether the coalition that Trump assembled in 2016 is his and uniquely his.Democrats found that there can be a huge difference between perceptions of a president and his party.Backed by the enthusiastic support of young voters and minorities, including historic turnout among African Americans, Obama twice won the presidency with a majority of the vote.Meanwhile, his party suffered devastating losses in midterm elections in 2010 and 2014 and the presidential election of 2016.It became clear that the Obama coalition was not easily transferrable to other Democratic candidates, as Hillary Clinton learned last year.As a result, by 2017, the party no longer controlled the White House, the House or the Senate, held fewer than a third of the nations governorships and had lost power in state legislatures across the country.Democrats are still trying to recover from that, the Virginia election notwithstanding.Perhaps its the same for the Trump coalition.Its possible that, no matter how much they embrace him, other Republican candidates will not be able to generate the kind of energy for themselves that Trump did for his candidacy.Meanwhile, as the Virginia race showed, voters dissatisfied with the president particularly women appear highly motivated to turn out to register their unhappiness.In the days after the Virginia election, SurveyMonkey, the online polling firm, asked people whether they thought the Republicans should become the party of Trump or fight against becoming the party of Trump.Among Republicans and Republican-leaning independents, almost 8 in 10 said the GOP should become the party of Trump.The rest of the electorate strongly disagrees.The implications of that are clear, as Gillespie found during the Virginia race.For Republican candidates, crossing the president risks the ire of the Trump base and depressed turnout.Embracing him too fully risks energizing the opposition.Trump wont be on the ballot until 2020.In the meantime, he has made the GOP his party, and those who share the label are left to deal with the consequences.
Republicans had a great week on taxes. Or did they?:::::House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) changed his talking point on taxes after an inquiry from the Fact Checker.His original point was still misleading.(Meg Kelly/The Washington Post) House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (Wis.) and his fellow Republicans celebrated crossing off a big one from their tax bill to-do list this week: Getting their bill through a key committee.The full House of Representatives could vote on the bill as early as next week.Meanwhile, Senate Republicans unveiled their tax package Thursday.There was a lot of momentum for Republicans this week on tax reform.But look a little closer, and you'll see that the process was also beset with struggles that underscore some major cracks in their plan.Here's a rundown of the Republicans' not-so-great great few weeks on tax reform and how the entire plan could still derail.Since its release Thursday, there are already enough potential no votes to kill the Senate bill.At least three Senate Republicans have said they would not support a tax plan that adds too much to the debt, report The Washington Post's Damian Paletta and Mike DeBonis.Retiring Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) expressed direct concerns about the Senate GOP plan, citing staggering national debt by opting for short-term fixes while ignoring long-term problems for taxpayers and the economy.Three no votes is one too many for GOP leaders, who are trying to pass this tax plan in the Senate with only Republicans.They hold 52 seats in the chamber, which was already an extremely tight margin.Even if they get a bill through the Senate, GOP leaders will only be halfway done: They still need to square it with the House bill, which has some major differences.They are losing a public opinion battle about whether their plan helps the middle class.Half of Americans oppose the plan President Trump and Republicans outlined in September, according to new Washington Post-ABC News polling.They don't believe it will help the middle class more than it will help the wealthy.Independent analysts say Americans are right to be skeptical.The House bill would clearly cut the tax rates for businesses and the wealthy, but for people lower on the income scale, it would provide a mishmash of tax cuts and lost deductions.It would expand tax credits for families and nearly double the standard deduction, but the bill also would roll back popular tax deductions, such as allowing some people to deduct state and local income taxes they pay on their federal returns.That could raise taxes overall on some Americans at least 10 million, one analysis found.This week, Ryan got dinged by The Post's Fact Checker for originally saying everyone will get a tax cut; that's not true.Independent analysis says all income levels would see a tax cut under the House bill for the first year it's implemented, though taxes could rise in the next decade.House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) changed his talking point on taxes after an inquiry from the Fact Checker.His original point was still misleading.(Meg Kelly/The Washington Post) Republicans need to find a way to change perceptions about who their tax plan would help, and quickly.They need the tax reforms to show any substantial accomplishments this session: Their various bills to roll back Obamacare polled in the teens for popularity and didn't make it through Congress.The president is a complicating factor.President Trump delivers a speech in Vietnam.(Jonathan Ernst/Reuters) Republicans have already had to publicly disagree with or even ignore President Trump on whether 401(k) plans would be altered (he didn't want to touch contributions, while House Republicans wouldn't rule it out), how much to cut the corporate tax rate (he originally wanted it lower than 15 percent) and whether to use this tax plan to also implode Obamacare by repealing the individual mandate (Trump suggested it, Republicans haven't taken him up on that).Trump also isn't helping by being off-message.In a call with Senate Democrats this past week to convince them to get on board, the president said his accountant told him he'd be a big loser under the proposal.During that call, Trump also reportedly threw House Republicans' carefully crafted bill under the bus, telling Senate Democrats they'll like the their chamber's version much better.After Tuesday's election results, the pressure is ON Virginia Governor-elect Ralph Northam, right, celebrates his victory with Virginia Gov.Terry McAuliffe (D) and his wife, Dorothy.(Cliff Owen/AP) Part of the urgency on a tax bill comes from the fact Republicans are 10 months into governing without a major legislative victory.Whatever pressure was on Republicans before this week to get a tax bill done just got dialed up to 11.In state and local elections Tuesday across the nation, Republicans got whomped.Exit polls showed Virginia voters especially wanted to stick it to Trump.Republicans on Capitol Hill read Tuesday's results as a warning sign they've got to get tax reform done sooner rather than later.Asked whether the election could complicate the GOP's tax plan by putting more pressure on lawmakers, Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah), one of the top tax-writing senators, responded, "It could, because the elections went against the Republicans.The distractions are on, too Alabama GOP Senate candidate Roy Moore.(Brynn Anderson/AP) Senate Republicans unveiled their tax plan Thursday and then the allegations against Roy Moore, the GOP candidate for Senate in Alabama, sucked the air from the room.Instead of promoting the bill, GOP senators spent the afternoon deciding whether to call for Moore to drop out of the critical Senate race after being he was accused of initiating a sexual encounter with 14-year-old girl when he was 32.
He means it: Trump appears to take Putins denial about election meddling at face value:::::President Trump on Nov. 11 said he believes that Russian President Vladimir Putin is being truthful when he denies that Russia meddled in the 2016 presidential election.(Reuters) While on his way to Hanoi, Vietnam, at the tail end of a 12-day trip across Asia, President Trump spoke with reporters aboard Air Force One after refusing to do press conferences with world leaders.He recapped the reception the Chinese gave him and appeared to accept Russian President Vladimir Putin's denial about election meddling.Here's his conversation with reporters, annotated with Genius.com.Click on the highlighted text to read the annotations.PRESIDENT TRUMP: Everybody okay?Everybody happy?Everybody healthy?Two more days -- no problem.It's been a -- I think it's been a great trip.In certain ways, it's been very epic.I think things have happened that have been really amazing.Prime Minister Abe came up to me just at the end, and he said that since you left South Korea and Japan, that those two countries are now getting along much, much better.That's from Prime Minister Abe -- that there's been a real bonding between South Korea and Japan.So that was great.And we had a time in China.You were there.Were most of you there?Jennifer?Q We all were, sir.PRESIDENT TRUMP: They say in the history of people coming to China, there's been nothing like that.And I believe it.Did you see the show?Did most of you see the show or part of the show afterwards?It was incredible.Q We saw the opera but not the -- PRESIDENT TRUMP: The opera was great too, but the following night -- that was the first time that theater has been used at the Forbidden City in over a hundred years.You know that.They prepared the theater for that -- the first time in over a hundred years.No, it was an amazing -- we have an amazing feeling toward each other.And he's for China; I'm for USA.You know, it's one of those things.But we have a great feeling.So it's been really very incredible.And then today was excellent.Today was a different kind of a thing.It's a conference.And then tonight they're having a state dinner in Hanoi.And we then go to the Philippines, which was a rough trip the last time.That was a rough presidential trip, but this won't be.And we're staying the extra day because they have the two conferences; they have first day and they have the second day.And the second day, a lot of people say is very important.And I said, you know what, if I'm there, I should do it.But it's gone really well.I've really enjoyed it.Developed some new friendships -- some really good friendships.But the three countries we've stopped in, the original three are -- they're really in our camp, and we're in their camp.Q How were your discussions with Vladimir Putin?Did you discuss Syria?And apparently they've issued a joint statement that -- PRESIDENT TRUMP: We issued a joint statement.We're going to be -- have you seen the statement yet?MS. SANDERS: It's going out -- it's on the way.PRESIDENT TRUMP: So I think it'll go out.You'll see it in a little while.MS. SANDERS: It may be out, now that you guys -- now that we're in the air.PRESIDENT TRUMP: It's going to save tremendous numbers of lives.And we did that very quickly.We agreed very quickly.As you know, we saw each other last night just for a picture, and that was the first time.And then today we had a roundtable with numerous countries.You have a list of the countries, obviously.Right?You have a list.And we spoke intermittently during that roundtable.We seem to have a very good feeling for each other and a good relationship considering we don't know each other well.I think it's a very good relationship.We had two or three very short conversations because of the meeting, the fact that we're at a meeting.But during those conversations, we talked about Syria and de-conflicting, et cetera.You know, we have areas where troops are facing -- our troops -- I mean, their troops are facing our troops and there's nothing in between.And we issued a statement -- a joint statement.It was just approved, and I think people are going to be extremely happy with it and also very impressed with it.Q Did Russia's attempts to meddle in U.S. elections come up in the conversation?PRESIDENT TRUMP: He said he didn't meddle.He said he didn't meddle.I asked him again.You can only ask so many times.But I just asked him again, and he said he absolutely did not meddle in our election.He did not do what they're saying he did.And he said -- Q Do you believe him?PRESIDENT TRUMP: Well, look, I can't stand there and argue with him.I'd rather have him get out of Syria, to be honest with you.I'd rather have him -- you know, work with him on the Ukraine than standing and arguing about whether or not -- because that whole thing was set up by the Democrats.I mean, they ought to look at Podesta.They ought to look at all of the things that they've done with the phony dossier.Those are the big events.Those are the big events.But Putin said he did not do what they said he did.And, you know, there are those that say, if he did do it, he wouldn't have gotten caught, all right?Which is a very interesting statement.But we have a -- you know, we have a good feeling toward getting things done.If we had a relationship with Russia, that would be a good thing.In fact, it would be a great thing, not a bad thing.Because he could really help us in North Korea.We have a big problem with North Korea.And China is helping us.And because of the lack of a relationship that we have with Russia because of this artificial thing that's happening with this Democratic-inspired thing, we could really be helped a lot, tremendously, with Russia having to do with North Korea.And, you know, you're talking about millions and millions of lives.This isn't baby stuff.This is the real deal.And if Russia helped us, in addition to China, that problem would go away a lot faster.Q How did you bring up the issue of election meddling?Did you ask him a question?PRESIDENT TRUMP: He just -- every time he sees me, he says, "I didn't do that."And I believe -- I really believe that when he tells me that, he means it.But he says, "I didn't do that."I think he's very insulted by it, if you want to know the truth.Don't forget, all he said is he never did that, he didn't do that.I think he's very insulted by it, which is not a good thing for our country.Because again, if we had a relationship with Russia, North Korea -- which is our single biggest problem right now -- North Korea, it would be helped a lot.I think I'm doing very well with respect to China.They've cut off financing; they've cut off bank lines; they've cut off lots of oil and lots of other things, lots of trade.And it's having a big impact.But Russia, on the other hand, may be making up the difference.And if they are, that's not a good thing.So having a relationship with Russia would be a great thing -- not a good thing -- it would be a great thing, especially as it relates to North Korea.And I'll say this, Hillary had her stupid reset button that she spelled the word wrong, but she doesn't have what it takes to have that kind of a relationship where you could call or you could do something and they would pull back from North Korea, or they'd pull back from Syria, or maybe pull back from Ukraine.I mean, if we could solve the Ukraine problem -- But this is really an artificial barrier that's put in front of us for solving problems with Russia, and he says that very strongly.He really seems to be insulted by it, and he says he didn't do it.So -- Q (Inaudible) do you believe him -- PRESIDENT TRUMP: Excuse me?Q Even if he (inaudible) one-on-one, do you believe him?PRESIDENT TRUMP: I think that he is very, very strong in the fact that he didn't do it.And then you look, and you look at what's going on with Podesta, and you look at what's going on with the server from the DNC and why didn't the FBI take it, why did they leave it; why did a third party look at the server and not the FBI -- if you look at all of this stuff, and you say, what's going on here?And then you hear it's 17 agencies.Well, it's three.And one is Brennan and one is whatever.I mean, give me a break.They're political hacks.So you look at it -- I mean, you have Brennan, you have Clapper, and you have Comey.Comey is proven now to be a liar and he's proven to be a leaker.So you look at that, and you have President Putin very strongly, vehemently says he had nothing to do with that.Now, you're not going to get into an argument.You're going to start talking about Syria and the Ukraine.Q You seem to have a fairly warm relationship with a number of -- PRESIDENT TRUMP: I do.Q -- totalitarian or authoritarian leaders -- PRESIDENT TRUMP: And others.Q And others.So, Putin, Xi, leader of the Philippines.Do you think you -- what do you think -- do you think you understand them in a certain way or relate to them in a way that other Presidents haven't?PRESIDENT TRUMP: I dont know.They had a story today in one of the papers about China.China likes me.China likes me.And I get along with them; I get along with others too.I get along very well with Angela.You people don't write that.I actually get along really well with Angela.You know, they had that handshaking event.I was with her for a long time before that.And somebody shouts out, "shake her hand, shake her hand."And I didn't hear them.So by not shaking her hand, they said -- I have a great relationship with her.I have a great relationship with Theresa May.I have a great relationship with Justin Trudeau, who I just left.I think I -- I'll be honest with you, I think I have a great relationship with every single one of them.Every person in that room today -- you had what, 15, or so, or 18?Asia Pacific -- Q Well, 21 including you.PRESIDENT TRUMP: Everyone in that room, I have a good relationship.They're very different people, but everyone.And I do have a very good relationship with Xi, obviously.It's the biggest state -- it's the biggest state entrance and the biggest state dinner they've ever had, by far, in China.He called it a state-plus.Like he said it -- he actually said, state-plus-plus, which is very interesting.But he's -- you know, look, again, he's a strong person.He's a very smart person.I like him a lot; he likes me.But, you know, we represent two very different countries.But we get along very well.And that's a good thing that we along; that's not a bad thing.And on trade, you know, it was -- most of the news covered it fairly.Some didn't.When I said it's not your fault -- because I was saying how China has been hurting us on trade for many decades, for many years -- and it really is.It's not his fault.We should have been doing that.But we didn't do it.It's the fault of the administrations that preceded me.And we're not going to do that anymore; we're going to be very tough on trade.And he understands that.Q In the past, American presidents have felt the obligation to raise issues about human rights abuses.Do you feel like that's an obligation and that's something that you feel is important to do?PRESIDENT TRUMP: Well, I do.But I also raise issues on many other things.I mean, I have an obligation -- we lost, last year, with China, depending on the way you do your numbers, because you can do them a numbers of way -- anywhere from $350 [billion] to $504 billion.That's with one country.Im going to fix that.And I've got to fix what we have with Mexico, who was there today too, who I also have a very good relationship with.And I have a great relationship with France.Some of you were in France with me, with the Eiffel Tower dinner.We have a great relationship with Emmanuel.So I think that's the thing.I've actually been getting -- I always said it, I think -- I said, I think one of my strong suits is going to be foreign affairs.And we're actually getting very good marks having to do with foreign affairs.There's nobody that I can think of that I don't have a very good relationship with.But when we can -- I mean, you'll be seeing the release that's put out.But we can save many, many, many lives by making a deal with Russia having to do with Syria, and then ultimately getting Syria solved and getting Ukraine solved and doing other things, having a good relationship with Russia is a great, great thing.And this artificial Democratic hit job gets in the way.It gets in the way.And that's a shame because people will die because of it.And it's a pure hit job.And it's artificially induced.And it's a shame.But anyway.Q If we could ask you about Roy Moore.Is it time to pitch him overboard?PRESIDENT TRUMP: Well, again, I've been with you folks, so I haven't gotten to see too much.And believe it or not, even when I'm in Washington and New York, I do not watch much television.I know they like to say -- people that don't know me, they like to say I watch television.People with fake sources -- you know, fake reporters, fake sources.But I don't get to watch much television, primarily because of documents.I'm reading documents a lot, and different things.I actually read much more -- I read you people much more than I watch television.But anyway -- but so I have not seen very much about him, about it.And, you know, I put out a statement yesterday that he'll do the right thing, that -- he was interviewed.Q But four women have come forward and accused him of inappropriately touching them, basically making advances when they were underage, including a 14-year-old.I mean, at what point -- and you said, "if he did it."But at what point do you decide if he did it?It's right now their word against his.PRESIDENT TRUMP: Honestly, I'd have to look at it and I'd have to see.Because again, Im dealing with the President of China, the President of Russia, I'm dealing with the folks over here.So I haven't devoted -- I haven't been able to devote very much time to it.And I've been at -- I mean, you people are just as strong as me.You're following me all over the place.I mean, we are going to lots of meetings, right?And, by the way, anybody that took the bet, pick up your money, okay?And the hard stuff was that.Really hard.Q What was the bet again?PRESIDENT TRUMP: Well, a lot of people said it's almost physically impossible for someone to go through 12 days.What I didn't want to do was come back because I would have had to come back.And we would have been on this plane again in five weeks from now exactly to do four days.We were going to do four days and four days.And this way we did twelve, and we hit the big conferences, which is a big asset.So anyway.Q So you're not yet prepared to say that Roy Moore should -- PRESIDENT TRUMP: I will see it when -- I mean, I basically put out a statement which was obvious.So I'll stick with statement for now, but I'll have further comment as we go down the road.I have to get back into the country to see what's happening.Q Is there one thing that you were pressing President Xi on that you can say you're going to take away, where he changed his mind or agreed to something that you're looking to do specifically on North Korea?PRESIDENT TRUMP: President Xi made a statement.If you read his statement yesterday -- were you all there when he was speaking and made the statement in the big room -- the Great Room?He made a statement that he's committed to stopping the nuclearization of North Korea.That's a big statement.He made that statement, and a lot of people didn't -- they didn't pick that up.I don't think it was -- because it was part of the speech.And somehow a lot people -- to me, that was a very big statement.I even looked up -- because Im sitting waiting to speak -- and I said, wow, that's a big statement.He made that statement in his speech yesterday or the day before, when he made -- you know, when we were speaking together.He put a statement out, Sarah, that said he's committed to making that happen.That's a big statement.You know, he was, through this process -- he's the most powerful Chinese leader since Mao Zedong.Some people say more powerful than Mao.With that being said, I really believe he's a good person, he's a good man, he wants to do right, he's representing his people.He's strong, he's very strong.But you know, you look at some of what you saw was very impressive.It was very impressive.Q What's the next thing you'd like to see him do on Korea?PRESIDENT TRUMP: Oh, I'd like to have him ratchet it up, and I think he's doing that.We had a long talk about it.Q But ratchet it up with what?PRESIDENT TRUMP: And I was with him for hours.You know, I was with him -- like I sat with him.You were there at the beginning of that evening, right?Of the -- Q No.PRESIDENT TRUMP: Oh, really?Q I wasn't pool.PRESIDENT TRUMP: Well, I was sitting with him.We were together for hours.And the day before, we were together for hours.And we get along very well.You know, it's easy to be with him for hours.Whereas, if you don't have chemistry, you people know, you can't be with somebody for two minutes.And we talked a lot about North Korea.We talked about a lot of things.We talked a lot about North Korea.No, I think he's going to ratchet it up.I did not speak to President Putin about it because we just had these little segments that we were talking about Syria.But President Putin would be tremendously helpful -- tremendously helpful -- if I had Russia and China helping us with North Korea, I think that would solve it.But this artificial barrier gets in the way.I call it the "artificial Democrat barrier."It gets in the way, which is a shame.Q So you didn't have time to ask Putin specific things on North Korea?PRESIDENT TRUMP: I wasnt able to -- because I really didn't, Jennifer.I really just -- we did, like, little snippets in between.We didn't have a planned meeting.We spoke, but we didn't have a planned meeting.Q Where did you leave it with President Putin?Are you looking for another meeting?Him coming to the U.S.?Or are you -- PRESIDENT TRUMP: We'll have a meeting.I think we have the potential to have a very good relationship.I dont know him like I know President Xi because I've spent a lot of time with President Xi, but I think we have the potential to have a very, very good relationship.I have it with Abe.I have it with Abe.Very good.Q Did you see Abe fall at the sand trap?PRESIDENT TRUMP: I didn't.I say this: If that was him, he is one of the greatest gymnasts because the way he -- (laughter) -- it was like a perfect -- I never saw anything like that.No, wasn't it amazing?And he was standing up.I told him -- I said, I'm not going to ask -- because it was shot from a helicopter.I said, I will not ask if that's you, but if it was, I'm very impressed because you're better than any gymnast I've ever seen.Q What do you mean by "artificial Democratic barrier"?I mean, you and Putin can't warm up because of this investigation?Or what -- PRESIDENT TRUMP: There's an artificial barrier that puts in the way by the Democrats.It's a fake barrier.There was no collusion.Everybody knows there was no collusion.I mean, you speak to these people -- I saw Dianne Feinstein the other day and I respect her.She was on television the other day saying there's no collusion.The Democrats -- the Republicans come out screaming it, but the Democrats come out, and they say, "No, there's no collusion."There is no collusion.There's nothing.And I think it's a shame that something like that can destroy a very important potential relationship between two countries that are very important countries.Russia could really help us.And the Democrats wanted to have a good relationship with Russia, but they couldn't do it because they didn't have the talent to do it.They didn't have the chemistry to do it.They didn't have what it takes to do it.You know, there is a talent to that.But I think Putin and I -- President Putin and I would have a great relationship, and that would be great for both countries.And it would take a lot of the danger out because we're really -- you know, this is a dangerous time.This isn't small stuff.This is a very dangerous time.And having a great relationship, or even a good relationship, with the President of Russia -- Hillary tried it, and she failed.Nobody mentions that.They act like, you know -- it's so terrible.She did that reset button; it was a joke.But she tried and she failed.Obama tried and he failed.Couldn't have it, because he didn't have chemistry.They didn't have the right chemistry.And you know what?I understand that, because there are some people I don't have chemistry with.Let's see, some of you are right here.(Laughter.)There are some people I don't -- you know, sometimes if you don't have chemistry with somebody, you don't.But Obama did not have the right chemistry with Putin.And Hillary was way over her head.MS. SANDERS: Let's take one more and then let them have lunch.Q Were you able to get any commitments -- when it comes to the trade balance, some of the issues you talk about like intellectual property theft -- did he make any commitments there to make changes?THE PRESIDENT: You know, the intellectual property -- you're talking about $300 billion a year.It's tremendous.We talked about it.But I said, we're friends, but this is a different administration than you've had for the last 30 years.For the last 30 years, China -- and, in all fairness, and other countries.Look, we have a $71 billion trade deficit with Mexico.We have a $70 billion trade deficit with Japan.We have a $30 billion trade deficit with South Korea.I could go through a whole list.There are few countries we have a surplus with, and those countries it's like a two-dollar surplus.It's disgraceful.And I don't blame any of those countries.I blame the people that we had representing us who didn't know what they were doing.Because they should have never let it happen.Q I'd like to ask a question on AT&T and CNN.Do you want AT&T to sell CNN for the -- THE PRESIDENT: Well, I didn't make the decision.That was made by a man who's actually a very respected person -- a very, very respected person.I did make a comment in the past as to what I think.I do feel that you should have as many news outlets as you can, especially since so many of them are fake.This way, at least you can get your word out.But I do believe you should have as many news outlets as you can.Now, with that being said, I didn't make a statement on it, but I made that statement long before at the very early part.So we'll see how that -- it will probably end up being maybe litigation, maybe not.We'll see how it all plays out.Q Did you talk to Xi about opening China to Twitter and other social media?THE PRESIDENT: About what?Q Opening China to Twitter.THE PRESIDENT: I mentioned it very briefly.Honestly, it wasn't number one on my list.Number one on my list with him was North Korea and trade.Those are the two I really spoke.I mentioned it, you know, briefly, but we'll talk.I'm going to have plenty of time to talk.He'll come here next time.This all started in Florida, and it's a great feeling to have that kind of a relationship where you can really help your country.Because we can really help our country, and he can really help his country.But we're going to be very tough on trade.This is not going to be like it was in the past.I did tell him that.This is not going to be the old days.This is a whole different thing going on.And, you know, it's not acceptable what's been happening with trade, generally.China, yes -- but generally.And I can think of almost no examples where it's good.It's all bad.We had the worst negotiators, whether it's the Iran deal or any other thing.We had the worst -- our trade deals are so bad.Last year, we lost $800 billion, right?Yeah.$800 [billion], approximately.Check it.But approximately $800 billion on trade.Why?Q You put your own guys in there now.So what did you get from him?THE PRESIDENT: I have a great team.Bob Lighthizer.Bob Lighthizer is -- he's going to town.And he works with me.He works with me.But Bob is going to town.So I hope you're all enjoying yourselves.Tonight we're going to Hanoi.Q Any highlights from APEC?Do you have any asks for the other countries?THE PRESIDENT: I think the APEC was just -- good, very collegial.Q Did anyone ask you for specific things?THE PRESIDENT: No, but I told them we're going to have much tougher trade policies now, because, you know, they have barriers.We don't.I'm not only talking about tariffs.They have non-tariff barriers, and we don't.I said, you got to remove them.Good to be with you.Good to be with you.We'll talk to you -- Q Thank you for coming back.THE PRESIDENT: I'll see you in Hanoi.Are you all going up?Q Yes, sir.Q We are.
Roy Moores shaky defense of the sexual misconduct allegations against him, annotated:::::For the first time since The Washington Post reported Thursday that four women said Roy Moore pursued romantic or sexual relationships with them when they were teenagers and he was in his 30s, the GOP Senate candidate publicly defended himself.Moore spoke to Sean Hannity on Fox News Radio.We've annotated this rough transcript of their conversation using Genius.com.Click on the highlighted text to read the annotation.SEAN HANNITY: A lot of the last day talking about these allegations about Senate candidate down in Alabama Judge Roy Moore and this relates to a Washington Post piece that we read all the details but I'll remind you what it says now the allegations come from 38 years ago.Now a woman the headline of The Washington Post woman says Roy Moore initiated a sexual encounter when she was 14 and he was 32.Now I want to explain this in all of its detail and then Judge Moore is going to respond to all of this exclusively here on the program today.And I said this yesterday if anyone is behaves this way or is responsible for this type of behavior of course it is unacceptable in any society be shameful et cetera.Everyone would agree.32 year old man pursuing a 14 year old girl is despicable and that's something I think should transcend all politics.Roy Moore has however been in the public eye for 40 years a controversial figure for many of those years.Does everybody in this country have a presumption of innocence and a right to defend their name?One of the things I've said on radio and TV is our goal this is not a political issue.This is the goal to get to the truth in light of all of these people that we have mentioned from Harvey Weinstein and Kevin Spacey and Ben Affleck and Dustin Hoffman and the list goes on and on and on.It is revealed.Roman Polanski is hailed as a hero by Hollywood.So my goal is only to find the truth.This isn't political for me in any way shape or form.So The Washington Post alleges that back in 1979 when she was 14 years old that she had sexual encounters with the then 32 year old Roy Moore.And on one occasion the woman alleges that Moore kissed her and during another she says that Moore allegedly inappropriately touched her and asked her to.And he took off her shirt and pants and then guided her hand to touch him.Although she claimed no other sexual conduct had taken place.No sexual intercourse.She described the incident to the Washington Post stating I wanted it over with.I want it out.Please just get it.Get this over with whatever it is.Just get it over with and the woman says she has more to take her home which he did.And you have three other women also accusing Moore of misconduct back in the 70s while they were teenagers raging in age from 16 to 18 years old.The age of consent in Alabama 16 women are alleging that more pursued romantic relationships with them and one allegation involve kissing and only kissing and will go into all the details of all this in a second but joining us now is the Alabama Senate candidate Judge Roy Moore.Judge welcome back to the program.Thanks for being with us.ROY MOORE: Nice to be you.HANNITY: Judge let's talk about first thoughts.You're now reading it.I know you put out a number of statements but I think we should address it head on.What what do you make of these allegations?MOORE: Well Sean first let me say this these allegations are completely false, false and misleading.But more than that it hurts me personally because you know I'm a father I have one daughter I have five grand daughters and I have a special concern for protection of young ladies.This is this is really hard to get on the radio and explain this and as these allegations are just completely false.HANNITY: What do you make specifically?Let's start with what they talked about that you had struck up a conversation with this young woman who was 14 Leigh Corfman and her mother says that you offered to watch the girl while the mother went inside for a custody hearing which they confirmed it actually happened at that time.What is your...do you know Ms. Corfman?Do you know the mother?MOORE: I don't know Miss Corfman from anybody.I never talked to or never had any contact with her.Allegations of sexual misconduct with her are completely false.I believe they are politically motivated.I believe they're brought on to stop a very successful campaign.That's what they're doing.I've never known this woman or anything with regard to the other girls.You understand this is 40 years ago after my return from the military, I dated a lot of young ladies.I do recognize however the names of two these young ladies, Debbie Wesson and Gloria Thacker, which they have a maiden...that's their maiden name.And they... HANNITY: Well let me let me give the details.Debbie Wesson Gibson says she was 17 when you spoke to her high school civics class and asked her out on several dates and it did not progress her words beyond kissing according to the Washington Post let's stay on her.Did that happen?MOORE: I do not remember speaking to civics class.I don't remember that.I do not remember when we...I seem to know or remember knowing her parents...that they were friends.I can't recall the specific dates because that's been 40 years but I remember her as a good girl.But neither of them have ever stated any inappropriate behavior.She didn't say anything.They said about me... HANNITY: But do you remember ever going on a date with her?She said that you asked around out on the first of several dates but nothing progressed beyond kissing.MOORE: I don't remember specific dates.I do not and I don't remember if it was that time or later.But I do not remember that.HANNITY: But you know hard but you never dated her ever?Is that what you're saying?MOORE: No but I don't remember going out on dates.I knew her as a friend.If we did go on dates then we did.But I do not remember that.HANNITY: What about Gloria Thacker Deason says she was an 18 year old cheerleader when you began taking her on dates that included bottles bottles ros wine.She's 18 at the time.The Alabama drinking age at the time is 19.Did that ever happen?MOORE: No.Because in this county is a dry county.We would never would have had liquor.I would never...I believe this she said that she believed she was under age and as I recall she was 19 or older and that just never happened.I never provided alcohol, beer or intoxicating liquor to a minor.That'd be against the law and against anything I would have ever done.And I seem to remember her as a good girl or I seem to remember I had some sort of knowledge of her parents, her mother in particular.HANNITY: At that time in your life...Let me ask you this you do remember these girls would it be unusual for you as a 32 year old guy to have dated a woman as young as 17?That would be a 15 year difference or a girl 18.Do you remember dating girls that young at that time?MOORE: Not generally, no.If did, you know, I'm not going to dispute anything but I don't remember anything like that.HANNITY: But you don't specifically remember having any girlfriend that was in her late teens even at that time?MOORE: I don't remember that and I don't remember ever dating any girl without the permission of her mother.And I think in her statement she said that her mother actually encouraged her to go out with me.HANNITY: Well actually there was there was one though, a 14 year old that was working as a Santa or helper when you approached her.And when she was 16 and her mother forbade her, that was the third case.Let me let me, let me go back to Corfman for a minute here because this is the issue here.She gives specific instances where the first day you met her at the courthouse, you got a phone number you talked her on the on the phone and on that you drove through drove her 30 minutes from her house to the woods in where you lived and you kissed her and on a second visit you took off her shirt, pants, removed your clothes, touched her bra, underpants and you guided her hand to touch him over your underwear.Now those are specific charges she's making.And I think you know obviously it's about a month away from this election campaign.Are you saying none of yours....Is that your position none of that ever happened?MOORE: It never happened and I don't even like hearing it because it never happened and they're doing this a month away, four weeks away, after 40 years in public service.I've run five successful campaigns or five campaigns, statewide campaigns, three in the county.This has never been brought up.It has never been even mentioned and all of a sudden four weeks out they're bringing out they're bringing up because it's political.It's a direct attack on this campaign and it involves a 14 year old girl which I would have never had any contact with nothing with her mother or any courthouse or anywhere else would I have done that.In fact, her allegations contradict the whole behavior pattern of the other two young ladies who even witnessed yourself.HANNITY: You mentioned you'd never go out with any young girl I assume you meant like when you were 32 at that time of your life, would you always ask the permission of the parent before you would take a girl out?MOORE: Well I mean I'm saying that in their statements that they made these two young girls said their mother actually encouraged them to be friends with me.And you know that's what they said.I don't remember.I wasn't privy to their conversation but obviously we never had any sexual activity.There was never anything like that.And the behavior was all together appropriate according to them.HANNITY: Continued Judge Roy Moore responding to the Washington Post and the headline woman says Roy Moore initiated sexual encounter when she was 14 and he was 32.So I guess you know you've got yourself in a position here where you're a month out of an election.This all drops on you.You're denying everything.What do you want to tell people.And I'll just give you the microphone about how they should view the Washington Post these people making these charges and your denial.How should people see it?MOORE: Well I think they should see it as it really is, and that's 40 years I've been in the the public eye.I've been serving as a deputy prosecutor.I've been a judge I've been a chief justice twice.I've run a foundation for moral law.And now I after 40 years, four weeks out of the election -- it's not even mentioned in the primary -- they bring charges and try to back them up with other things that sound bad.But then the alleged things that are completely untrue.I never knew this woman.I never met this woman and these charges are politically motivated and they're there to do exactly what they're doing.The Democrat is 11 points behind.He's very liberal.They don't want to talk about his record.They don't want to talk about his inexperience.They want to diffuse this just like they diffuse President Trump's agenda about bringing up the Russian deal.They're bringing up something to track through this campaign and they know what they're doing.And they've got me officially on the radio hearing things about a sexual encounter that never happened.I would put you in the same position you would feel just like me.You'd be angry.You'd be very angry.And that's exactly the position I'm in.This never happened.They know it never happened.And obviously you don't wait 40 years to bring out something like this.They're going to come out fast.There will be facts to show in this situation.This was a Democrat and maybe even the established Republican efforts to undermine this campaign because they don't want to hear the truth in Washington and they don't want to hear the truths about God and about the Constitution.HANNITY: Last thought on the establishment Republicans, you think they're partly involved in this?MOORE: Well they say they're not involved in the implementation of it so they're backing away very quickly.HANNITY: And then what about those that don't give you the presumption of innocence?What do you say to them?MOORE: Well that's what I'm talking about they're not even giving me the presumption of innocence.They're saying I should resign because the Washington Post brought these charges against the president and allegations about the Russian involvement.The Washington Post has attacked my foundation, they've attacked my wife and now they're attacking me personally on a sexual matter.I don't know what's coming next but I'm sure that in the next four weeks they're going to come out with another article because they've got an agenda and they're fulfilling their agenda right as we speak.HANNITY: Judge Moore thank you for taking the time and we appreciate you giving your side we believe in being fair and balanced.Thank you so much for talking to our audience answering these questions.We appreciate it.Wish you the best.Thank you.MOORE: Thank you.
Trumps America first looks more and more like America alone:::::President Trump sits in the motorcade after arriving at Noi Bai International Airport in Hanoi on Saturday.(Minh Hoang/AP) On his third day in office, President Trump signed an executive memorandum withdrawing the United States from a 12-nation Asia-Pacific trade accord that had been painstakingly negotiated over a decade by two of his White House predecessors.Everyone knows what that means, right?Trump asked rhetorically in the Oval Office.It meant, he said, that the country would start winning again in the face of unchecked globalization that had harmed ordinary Americans.But on the 295th day of his presidency during a trip to the region where the trade pact was most vital a competing narrative emerged.Trumps America first slogan has, in many ways, begun to translate into something more akin to America alone.As the presidents motorcade wove up a mountain road Saturday to a regional summit in the Vietnamese city of Danang, news broke that the 11 nations that had once looked to U.S. leadership to seal the deal on the Trans-Pacific Partnership had moved on without the United States and announced a tentative agreement among themselves.It marked a stunning turnabout that foreign-policy analysts warned could further erode U.S. standing at a time when China is embarked on a major economic expansion and further undermine global confidence in the United States ability to organize the world around its own liberal values.Members of the Trans Pacific Partnership said Nov. 11 they had agreed to continue working on the trade deal without the United States.(Reuters) For Trump, the Asia trip has cast into sharp relief the high-stakes bet he placed that turning the United States away from multilateralism will make the nation more prosperous and safer.The world has many places, many dreams and many roads.But in all of the world, there is no place like home, Trump told business leaders in Danang, cribbing the Wizard of Oz line in which Dorothy tries to wake from a dream about a misadventure in a frightening world.For the glory of God, protect your home, defend your home, Trump said, ending a speech meant to assure the region of U.S. staying power on a protectionist note of the sort that defined his campaign.[Trump says U.S. wont be taken advantage of anymore.Hours later, Pacific Rim nations reach deal on trade without America.]It is not just on trade that Trump has sought to stake out positions that have isolated the United States from the rest of the world.His plans to withdraw from the Paris climate accord at the earliest opportunity in 2020 could mean that the United States is the only country in the world not committed to it, since Syria announced its intention to join last week.And Trumps decision to decertify the Iran nuclear deal last month put him at odds not just with China and Russia, but also with U.S. treaty allies Britain, Germany and France.Another ally, Japan, where Trump made a state visit this week, is among the signatories of the new TPP, as are Australia, New Zealand, and U.S. neighbors Canada and Mexico.Vietnam, where Trump is making a state visit in Hanoi on Sunday, is projected to be the biggest beneficiary of the trade pact in terms of net impact on its gross domestic product.President Trump said the U.S. would no longer tolerate chronic trade abuses during his remarks at the APEC summit in Vietnam on Nov. 10.(Amber Ferguson/The Washington Post) White House aides rejected suggestions that the United States was being left behind, leaving a void that others, including China, are rushing to fill.They emphasized that Trumps five-nation, 12-day Asia trip including his participation at regional summits in Vietnam and the Philippines before returning to Washington was designed to reaffirm U.S. commitment.In a speech to the South Korean legislature, Trump issued a rallying cry for other countries to join the U.S.-led effort to tighten economic and diplomatic pressure on North Korea over its nuclear weapons program.And in his address at the Asia Pacific Economic Forum in Danang, Trump sketched out a vision for an integrated Indo-Pacific that includes half the worlds population stretching from India to Oceania to Northeast and Southeast Asia.Trump also insisted that, despite tough talk about other countries, he gets along well with virtually all the world leaders he has met including Chinas Xi Jinping and Russias Vladimir Putin, as well as the heads of liberal democracies such as Germanys Angela Merkel, Frances Emmanuel Macron and Canadas Justin Trudeau.China likes me.And I get along with them; I get along with others, too, Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One while flying from Danang to Hanoi.I get along very well with Angela.You people dont write that.He said an incident in which he appeared to snub her during a photo op at the White House in March was misinterpreted by the media, asserting that he had not heard photographers asking him to shake her hand.[Trump: I really believe Putins denials of election interference] Trump emphasized that he is working hard to improve U.S. relations with authoritarian regimes in China and Russia to win greater cooperation on the threats in North Korea and Syria.He faulted former president Barack Obama and former secretary of state Hillary Clinton for lacking the right chemistry to have a productive relationship with Putin.I always said I think one of my strong suits is going to be foreign affairs, and were actually getting very good marks, Trump said.Theres nobody that I can think of that I dont have a very good relationship with.But other signs from the presidents swing through the region reflected a shift in the way the United States promotes itself abroad and in how the country is viewed and treated by others.In Japan and Korea, Trump emphasized that his foreign policy is aimed at achieving peace through strength a phrase popularized by President Ronald Reagan that Trump used during his campaign.The optics of the first half of his trip were heavy on military power.The president toured Pearl Harbor, spoke to hundreds of U.S. and Japanese troops at Yokota Air Base and attempted to make a surprise visit to the Korean demilitarized zone before bad weather grounded the Marine One helicopter.[Trump chooses visit to military base over DMZ] Less clear is what else Trump is offering the region.Obamas Asia strategy relied on a three-prong approach of defense, economics and values diplomacy.In 2011, Obama took a lengthy trip to Hawaii, Australia and Indonesia, unveiling plans for the United States to take the lead on TPP negotiations, base Marines in Australia and offer presidential-level support of Burmas fitful transition from military rule to democracy.On foreign trips, Obama tried to use his charisma to promote American soft power to persuade foreign nations to move closer to the United States through means other than military might or trade.Obama conducted town-hall-style events with young people and delivered speeches at universities.Trump, by contrast, has refrained from mingling with the general public.Over the past week, he has golfed with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, spoken to troops at military bases and joined Xi on a private tour of the Forbidden City in Beijing, where he and first lady Melania Trump were treated to Peking opera performances of scenes from The Monkey King and The Drunken Beauty.[In Beijing, Trump declines to hit Xi on trade: I dont blame China] But Trump has not faced the public and barely answered to the American press corps.Although Trump participated in a formal news conference with Abe, he and Xi did not field questions during a joint statement before reporters.White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the Chinese had insisted on no questions even though the Obama White House persuaded Xi to answer a question from an American journalist in 2014.On Saturday, the White House fielded more complaints about press access when it did not allow members of the traveling press pool to cover Trumps participation in the summit meetings in Danang.Trump visited the press corps on the presidential plane to Hanoi in part because he empathized with their concerns, Sanders said.Yet if the White House blamed its hosts for the news blackout, it also appeared to reflect an acknowledgment from other nations that the United States was led by a president who has not been a public champion of the independent press corps.Trump has railed against fake news and suggested limiting the reach of news outlets over unflattering coverage.Trump also has spent time during the trip excusing predatory economic behavior of China and other countries and blaming past U.S. administrations for allowing the unfair trade imbalances he railed against during the campaign.Although Trumps former White House chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, was forced out of the West Wing in August, his visceral dislike of globalists and multilateralism has continued to permeate Trumps administration and the presidents own thinking.Not long after Trump arrived in Asia, Bannon warned back home about the dangers of a rising China, which he called a hegemonic power.We have an enemy of incalculable power, and theyre not a strategic partner, he said in an interview on a Breitbart radio show.They are an enemy, and we have to understand that.Trump surprised onlookers by lavishing praise on Xi during their two-day summit.I dont blame China, Trump said, adding that he gives Chinese leaders a lot of credit for taking advantage of the United States.Such behavior would end now that he is president, Trump said in a speech to a conference hall of business executives at the summit in Danang.But the president offered scant details of how he intends to enforce such changes and maintain U.S. primacy across the globe.Beijing has swept through the Asia-Pacific and beyond promoting a belt and road initiative whose centerpiece is widespread economic investment abroad.As Trumps motorcade was leaving the Danang convention center, another motorcade rolled in, with Chinese license plates.Xi had arrived to deliver the keynote address.
Roy Moore: Alabama voters will see through this charade of sexual misconduct claims:::::Alabama GOP Senate Nominee and suspended Chief Justice Roy Moore delivers remarks to the Mid-Alabama Republican Club.This is the first time Moore has spoken publicly since allegations of sexual misconduct with an underage girl.(Cameron Carnes/For The Washington Post) GOP Senate candidate Roy Moore spoke defiantly Saturday morning at a political gathering in Alabama that allegations against him amounted to fake news perpetrated by The Washington Post and political opponents engaged in a desperate attempt to stop my campaign.The Post reported earlier this week that four women said Moore had pursued sexual or romantic relations with them when they were teenagers and he was in his 30s.These campaign attacks are false and completely untrue, Moore told an audience of more than a hundred supporters, who gave Moore several standing ovations during his speech at the Veterans Day breakfast.More than being completely untrue, they are deeply hurtful to me personally.He talked about his marriage, four children and five granddaughters.I have the highest regard for the protection of young children, he said.To be attacked on allegations for sexual misconduct contradicts my entire career in law.I want to make it clear: ...I have not been guilty of sexual misconduct with anyone.These allegations occur 4 weeks before the election.Why now?Roy Moore, the Republican nominee in a special election in Alabama for a Senate seat, said on Nov. 11 that he has not been guilty of sexual misconduct with anyone.The Washington Post reported on Nov. 9 that a woman said Moore initiated a sexual encounter in 1979 when she was 14 and he was 32.(WBRC) Moore said he has been investigated more than any other person in this country.To think that grown women would wait 40 years to come forward right before an election is absolutely unbelievable, he said to a smattering of applause from the audience.He said that details would emerge soon about the claims against him.We expect the citizens of Alabama to see through this charade, he said.Moore arrived the event Saturday morning with his wife, Kayla, amid boos from about a dozen protesters gathered outside, including some chanting No Moore.The former Alabama chief justice refused to answer questions as he walked inside.I was horrified, Lisa Wienhold, 56, who was protesting outside, said of the allegations.I never liked Roy Moore that much, but when I heard about that, I was beyond horrified....There are a lot of smart people who have been on the other side for whom maybe this will be the final straw.A protestor speaks to the media after Alabama GOP Senate Nominee and suspended Chief Justice Roy Moore delivers remarks before the Mid-Alabama Republican Club.(Cameron Carnes/For The Washington Post) Im not surprised, said Lisa Sharlach, 49.Its usually the people who are screaming God and Jesus that are the ones with skeletons in the closet.Half a dozen Moore supporters acknowledged Leigh Corfman, who said she was 14 when Moore initiated a sexual encounter with her, might have been telling the truth.But ultimately, they said, they do not believe her and are standing confidently by Moore.From what Ive read, it seems like this 14-year-old girl who is now 50-something has a somewhat checkered past, said Johnny Creel, 56, an insurance broker wearing a Make America Great Again hat.You have to judge a story like that on the credibility of the accuser....I dont think it happened.Willie A. Casey, one of the few African Americans at the event, said the story is the hottest thing going in Birmingham, especially in the black community.But he said the allegations have not changed his position.I believe in his biblical principles, said Casey, 70, comparing the United States to Sodom and Gomorrah.I think in America, weve gone so far out of the Bible, someone needs to bring it back.Roy Moore Supporter Willie Casey before Alabama GOP Senate Nominee and suspended Chief Justice Roy Moore delivers remarks before the Mid-Alabama Republican Club.(Cameron Carnes/For The Washington Post) Moores comments at his first public speaking engagement since The Post report followed a radio interview with Sean Hannity on Friday in which he addressed the charges of sexual misconduct.These allegations are completely false and misleading, Moore told Hannity.He specifically denied the Post report that he had a sexual encounter with Corfman in 1979.However, in the interview Friday, Moore did not rule out that he may have dated girls in their late teens when he was in his early 30s.Some Republican women who attended the event Saturday said further allegations against Moore could change their feeling about him.But on the whole, they continue to back the judge, they said.How come it has taken 40 years for this to come out?asked Julie Palmer as she sat down inside the library.Why after all these years?Residents of Gadsden, Ala., Roy Moore's hometown, have mixed feelings about the sexual misconduct allegations against the Republican Senate nominee.(The Washington Post) Ann Eubank, who helps lead a conservative group called Alabama Legislative Watchdogs, said The Post was part of a political conspiracy against Moore.Yall chose the month before to bring a hit piece thinking you could influence how Alabamians vote.And thats what makes Alabamians mad.Dont come down here and tell us how to vote, she said.Corfman has said she thought of confronting Moore for years, and almost shared her story during his first campaign for state Supreme Court in 2000 before deciding against it.She worried about how it would affect her children, who were still in school at the time, and was concerned that her background three divorces and a messy financial history could undermine her credibility.Moore, who won the Republican nomination touting his belief in the supremacy of a Christian God over the Constitution, has invoked a defiant tone.His breakfast remarks occurred as a growing number of national party leaders called for Moore to leave the race before the Dec. 12 election.Two former GOP presidential candidates, Sen. John McCain (Ariz.) and Mitt Romney, called for Moore to step down immediately, while Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.) and Vice President Pence said Moore should step aside if the allegations prove true.On Friday, the National Republican Senatorial Committee pulled out of a joint fundraising committee with Moore, depriving him of a key pathway to securing campaign dollars.Yet Saturday morning his campaign sent out its own appeal of support for Moore, who vowed he will not give up.The Obama-Clinton Machines liberal media lapdogs just launched the most vicious and nasty round of attacks against me Ive EVER faced, he wrote in a fundraising appeal sent by the campaign under the name of his wife.Sometimes I grow tired and weary from the strain of moving directly from slugging it out with the GOP establishment to fighting off the powerful Obama-Clinton Machines constant stream of nasty and vicious attacks, he wrote.But our nation is at a crossroads right now both spiritually and politically...rest assured I will NEVER GIVE UP the fight!he wrote.Republicans have been calling on Moore to drop out of the race even though the GOP wouldnt be able to get another candidate on the ballot to run against Democrat Doug Jones, who was running a tight race against Moore even before the allegations surfaced.Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore denied allegations of sexual misconduct on Nov. 10 and called them "politically motivated."Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said Moore should withdraw from the race if allegations are true.(Jordan Frasier,Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post) Moores defenders in Alabama and elsewhere have been outspoken in his defense, questioning the Post report and asking why women would remain silent for decades before emerging to tell their stories weeks before the special election to fill the seat vacated by Attorney General Jeff Sessions.Stephen K. Bannon, the former adviser to President Trump who backed Moore in his recent primary against Sen. Luther Strange (Ala.), blamed the press, which he described in a speech Thursday night as the opposition party.It is purely part of the apparatus of the Democratic Party.President Trump, traveling in Asia, has not spoken in depth about the allegations against Moore.But his press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, said: Like most Americans, the president believes we cannot allow a mere allegation, in this case one from many years ago, to destroy a persons life.However, the president also believes that if these allegations are true, Judge Moore will do the right thing and step aside.Read more at PowerPost
Moore: I have not been guilty of sexual misconduct with anyone:::::(WBRC) Moore: I have not been guilty of sexual misconduct with anyone
He said he didnt meddle: Trump talks with Putin about U.S. elections and Syria in brief interactions:::::President Trump on Nov. 11 said he believes that Russian President Vladimir Putin is being truthful when he denies that Russia meddled in the 2016 presidential election.(Reuters) President Trump said Saturday that Russian President Vladimir Putin again denied that Moscow tampered in the U.S. presidential campaign last year.The two men had brief conversations during a larger meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Danang, Vietnam, before Trump flew to Hanoi for a bilateral meeting Sunday with Vietnamese leaders.Trump said that he had two or three brief conversations with Putin mostly centered on the war in Syria, but added that he pressed the Russian leader on Moscows role in attempting to interfere in the 2016 election.He said he didnt meddle, Trump said, answering questions in the press cabin on Air Force One.I asked him again.You can only ask so many times....He said he absolutely did not meddle in our election.He did not do what they are saying he did.Trump said that he believed Putin was sincere in his denials, and that Putin seemed to find the question insulting.Suggesting that what he called the artificial Democratic hit job of investigations of his campaign were preventing U.S.-Russian cooperation on a range of issues, including North Korea, Trump said that it is a shame, because people will die because of it.In his own news conference after their talks, Putin said he knew absolutely nothing about contacts with Trump campaign officials, and called reports that a campaign official sought a meeting with his niece bollocks, according to an interpreter.They can do what they want, looking for some sensation, Putin said of the investigations.But there are no sensations.Putin said he and Trump hardly know each other, but described the U.S. president as very professional, very friendly, he behaves very appropriately.Unfortunately, we did not have enough time to get down to some more details, he said, because we have many matters to discuss.He blamed the lack of a formal meeting between the two at the conference on the failure of their respective teams, and said they would be lectured on the lapse.The two leaders issued a joint statement pledging to continue their cooperation to defeat the Islamic State in Syria, and their commitment to U.N.-brokered peace negotiations between the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and opponents fighting to oust him.Trump also described former FBI director James B. Comey, who testified to Congress that Trump asked him to drop an investigation of his campaigns ties to Russian officials, as a proven liar and leaker.Trump called the former U.S. intelligence officials who concluded that the Russians tampered including former director of national intelligence James R. Clapper Jr. and former CIA director John Brennan political hacks.Clapper, Brennan and Comey, on behalf of the 17-agency intelligence community, issued a report in January describing an unprecedented Russian intelligence operation to undermine public faith in the U.S. democratic process and help elect Trump.The intelligence agencies have said that Russian hackers stole and made public thousands of emails from the Democratic National Committee, also spread misinformation in an attempt to help Trump beat Democrat Hillary Clinton.Trump, however, has said he does not believe that Russia actively sought to help him.The assessment sparked ongoing, separate investigations by Congress and special counsel Robert S. Mueller III, a former FBI director, of Russian interference in the campaign.Those inquiries include determining whether there was any collusion between the Russians and the Trump campaign.Trump said that Putin is very, very strong in the fact that he didnt do it.You have President Putin very strongly, vehemently, says he has nothing to do with that.Now, you are not going to get into an argument, you are going to start talking about Syria and the Ukraine.Sen. Mark R. Warner (Va.), the ranking Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said in a statement that he was left completely speechless by Trumps willingness to take the word of Vladimir Putin, a former intelligence operator who spent years working against us, over the conclusions of our own combined intelligence community.In response to questions about Trumps remarks, the CIA issued a statement saying that Director Mike Pompeo stands by and has always stood by the January 2017 Intelligence Community assessment....The intelligence assessment with regard to Russian election meddling has not changed.The assessment did not address whether Russian meddling altered the election outcome.[New York Times photographer tweets photo of black box to protest White House coverage blackout] Muellers team recently brought indictments against former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and an associate, Richard Gates, alleging that between 2006 and 2016, they attempted to launder money made as consultants to Russian-allied leaders in Ukraine and that they had acted as unregistered agents for a foreign government.There was no collusion, Trump said on the plane.Everybody knows there was no collusion.He labeled phony a dossier compiled by a former British intelligence agent alleging ties between Trump and Moscow.The document was later turned over to U.S. law enforcement authorities.Many of the allegations have not been independently confirmed.Trump also cast blame on former president Barack Obama and Clinton, a former secretary of state, who famously attempted a reset of U.S. relations with Russia during Obamas first term.Trump referred to Clintons stupid reset button, in which she presented Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov with an oversize reset button that erroneously used the Russian word for overload instead of reset.Hillary tried it, she failed, nobody mentions it, Trump said.She hit that reset button.It was a joke.But she tried and she failed.Trump said that Obama had bad chemistry with Putin and that Clinton was in way over her head.When Trump was asked during the flight to Hanoi whether he believed Putins denial of tampering, he said: Every time he sees me, he says, I didnt do that, but I really believe that when he tells me that, he means it....I think hes very insulted by it, and thats not a good thing for our country.Trump met with Putin this summer on the sidelines of the Group of 20 summit in Germany, after which he said Putin issued similar denials.Both then and now, Trump did not directly respond to questions as to whether he believes Putin.[Trump had undisclosed hour-long meeting with Putin at G-20 summit] On a different topic, Trump was asked whether Roy Moore, the Republican nominee in the U.S. Senate race in Alabama, should drop out of the race over allegations that he had sexual contact with a 14-year-old girl when he was 32 .White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters two days ago that Trump thinks that mere allegations are not enough to ruin Moores life but that if the allegations are true, he should do the right thing and step aside.Trump said he has been too busy during the Asia trip to focus on the allegations against Moore.Believe it or not, even when Im in Washington or New York, I do not watch much television, he said.I know they like to say that.People that dont know me, they like to say I watch television people with fake sources.You know, fake reporters, fake sources.But I dont get to watch much television.Primarily because of documents.Im reading documents.A lot.And different things.I actually read much more.I read [articles by] you people much more than I watch television.But anyway.So I have not seen very much about him, about it.And you know I put out a statement yesterday that hell do the right thing.Nakamura reported from Danang, Vietnam.DeYoung reported from Washington.
Roy Moores refusal to exit Alabama Senate race reflects diminished power of Washington:::::Roy Moore, the Republican nominee in a special election in Alabama for a Senate seat, said on Nov. 11 that he has not been guilty of sexual misconduct with anyone.The Washington Post reported on Nov. 9 that a woman said Moore initiated a sexual encounter in 1979 when she was 14 and he was 32.(WBRC) Roy Moore, the Republican nominee in a special election in Alabama for a Senate seat, said on Nov. 11 that he has not been guilty of sexual misconduct with anyone.The Washington Post reported on Nov. 9 that a woman said Moore initiated a sexual encounter in 1979 when she was 14 and he was 32.(WBRC) Roy Moores refusal to bow out of Alabamas special election for a Senate seat is the latest demonstration of the diminished power of congressional leaders and other once-powerful institutions in Washington.The Republican nominee, accused of sexual contact with a 14-year-old when he was a 32-year-old local prosecutor, brushed off calls for him to stand down as part of plot by establishment figures to undermine this campaign before the Dec. 12 ballot.Moore ignored the severing of financial ties by the National Republican Senatorial Committee for similar reasons.He summed up todays environment in a fundraising pitch to supporters Friday morning: I will NEVER GIVE UP the fight!Moore is right it might be entirely up to him when or if he will ever give up the fight.The tools available to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and other Washington figures to drive Moore out of the race either no longer exist or have been rendered impotent by the rise of a new political structure.From the media to big corporations to Congress, public distrust has grown across the board and made it easier for outlier figures such as Moore to thumb their nose at the purported leaders.Its a distrust of institutions, all institutions, said Josh Holmes, a senior political adviser to McConnell.Theres just no deference at all in politics today.That change has occurred rapidly.In 2002, then-Vice President Richard B. Cheney called Republican Tim Pawlenty on his way to announce his bid for the Senate and informed him that Norm Coleman would be the GOP Senate nominee.Pawlenty, Cheney told him, was running for governor, a message he relayed to his surprised supporters a few minutes later at his kickoff announcement.The Minnesotans followed Cheneys orders, winning both races that year.On Thursday evening, after The Washington Posts article on the accusation against Moore published, Vice President Pences spokeswoman called the accusations disturbing and said, if true, would disqualify anyone from serving in office.The next day, on Sean Hannitys radio show, Moore gave a long, sometimes contradictory explanation of the allegations, fully denying the accusation of sexual contact with the 14-year-old but leaving open the possibility that he had dated other teenagers.[Senate candidate Roy Moore does not rule out that he may have dated teen girls when he was in his 30s] Its one thing to dismiss McConnell.Like every congressional leader of this era, he is very unpopular.Just 25 percent of Americans approve of his job performance, while 50 percent disapprove, according to a Post-ABC News poll released last week.Among Republicans, McConnells support is lukewarm at best.Less than 40 percent of somewhat conservative and very conservative Republicans approve of McConnells tenure.In such a conservative state as Alabama, its no wonder Moore feels as though he can dismiss the Senate leader.Yet Pence and his boss, President Trump, both remain very popular in Alabama, with public polls showing the presidents job performance liked by about 60 percent of voters.Alabama residents have mixed reactions about the sexual misconduct allegations against Republican Senate nominee Roy Moore.(Arik Sokol,Melissa Macaya/The Washington Post) If those two lean harder into trying to push Moore out, it might have more of an effect.Then again, ask Roland Burris about his defiance of an incoming president and congressional leadership.The Chicago Democrat was appointed to fill the vacant Senate seat of then-President-elect Barack Obama in January 2009, but that appointment came from the indicted governor, Rod Blagojevich, who was accused, and later convicted, of trying to sell the appointment to whoever raised him the most campaign funds.At first, Obama joined with Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.), then the Senate majority leader, and other leading Democrats to block Burriss appointment.Burris refused to give up, holding news conferences outside the Capitol and traveling to Springfield, Ill., to plead his case to leading state Democrats.After several days, and a ruling from the state Supreme Court, Reid gave in and allowed Burris to take his seat in the Senate.Heres an example from the following year: After then-Sen. Arlen Specter switched parties, Obama, Vice President Biden, Reid and others tried to clear a path for him in the Democratic primary.But Joe Sestak refused and defeated Specter later that spring.It was very different just four years earlier.Then during the 2006 midterm elections, Senate Democrats successfully shoved aside a liberal firebrand in Ohio in favor of Sherrod Brown, an experienced House member at the time who went on to easily win that Senate race.It used to be impossible to work outside the party, said Holmes, whose first campaign was working on the Cheney-mandated Coleman race for the Senate.The Moore case is obviously different, given the nature of allegations against him, so it probably more closely resembles the Republican establishments inability to try to force Todd Akin to relinquish his Senate nomination in August 2012.In a local TV interview, Akin had suggested that a woman could not get pregnant during a legitimate rape to explain his antiabortion views in all circumstances.It was factually wrong and politically fatal, driving female voters away from Akin in what should have been an easy win for Republicans against Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.)in a year that GOP presidential nominee won the state by 10 percentage points.McConnell rallied the opposition to Akin, including Mitt Romney, but the congressman refused to yield.He lost to McCaskill in a landslide.One cause of this diminished clout is the Supreme Courts 2010 Citizens United ruling, allowing for the flourishing of unlimited donations to super PACs and other dark money entities that can fund renegade campaigns outside traditional avenues.Stephen K. Bannon, the former Trump strategist, is trying to use his Breitbart News media platform as a central hub of anti-establishment groups both to provide financial support for candidates such as Moore and to amplify their message to their supporters.Rather than back away from Moore, Bannon has instead falsely accused The Post of working with the former judges opponents to plant the story.He wants Alabama voters to rally around Moore as a way to offend McConnell.Ultimately, Moore may be guided out of the race, but it will not be from any pressure applied by McConnell.More likely, it would have to come from close friends in Alabama and would probably happen only if new polling showed a collapse in support in a race in which he previously had a clear edge.In 2012, Akin caused a contagion effect in other Senate races.Another Republican gave a bad answer to a rape-related abortion question and lost, while other candidates in close races kept getting peppered with questions about Akins views.As The Posts Michael Scherer and David Weigel reported Friday, GOP advisers fear that will happen again if Moore doesnt stand down and allow a different Republican to run as a write-in instead.Im prepping my candidate for what he is going to say if he is asked, said one GOP campaign manager for a top 2018 race, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to not draw attention to the race.Moore, Holmes said, doesnt seem to care if he takes the entire Republican Party down with him in the process.Read more from Paul Kanes archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.
Senate candidate Roy Moore does not rule out that he may have dated teen girls when he was in his 30s:::::Republican senators called on Roy Moore to withdraw from a Senate race in Alabama if allegations of sexual misconduct are true.President Trump echoed the sentiments, calling it "mere allegation."(Jordan Frasier,Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post) Republican senators called on Roy Moore to withdraw from a Senate race in Alabama if allegations of sexual misconduct are true.President Trump echoed the sentiments, calling it "mere allegation."(Jordan Frasier,Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post) Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore declined Friday to rule out that he may have dated girls in their late teens when he was in his 30s, though he said he did not remember any such encounters and described such behavior as inappropriate.If I did, Im not going to dispute these things, but I dont remember anything like that, Moore said on Sean Hannitys radio program, when asked whether he had dated 17- or 18-year-old girls at the time.In the same interview, Moore denied outright the claim of Leigh Corfman that he had initiated sexual encounters with her when she was 14.I dont know Ms. Corfman from anybody, he said.The allegations of sexual misconduct with her are completely false.Moores comments came as GOP leaders scrambled Friday to limit the political damage from the allegations.Two Republican senators Steve Daines (Mont.)and Mike Lee (Utah) withdrew their endorsements of Moore after his interview with Hannity.Having read the detailed description of the incidents, as well as the response from Judge Moore and his campaign, I can no longer endorse his candidacy for the US Senate, Lee wrote in a tweet.In a tweet, Daines was more succinct: I am pulling my endorsement and support for Roy Moore for U.S. Senate.Daines also retweeted Lees statement.Earlier in the day, the National Republican Senatorial Committee pulled out of a joint committee it had set up with Moore, depriving him of a fundraising vehicle for the final weeks of the campaign.At the same time, current and former national party leaders admitted that they have little power to force Moore from the race.The special election is Dec. 12.The comments came a day after The Washington Post published a story in which a woman said Moore had initiated a sexual encounter with her in 1979, when she was 14 and he was 32.Three other women said he had asked or taken them on dates when they were teenagers.None of those three women say Moore forced them into any sort of relationship or sexual contact.President Trump, who has been traveling in Asia, said Saturday that he has been too busy to focus on the allegations against Moore.I have not seen very much about him, about it, he said in Vietnam.And you know I put out a statement yesterday that hell do the right thing.The president referenced a statement delivered Friday by press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders: The president also believes that if these allegations are true, Judge Moore will do the right thing and step aside.In the interview with Hannity, Moore recalled knowing two of the older women, Gloria Thacker Deason and Debbie Wesson Gibson, as well as their parents.I knew her as a friend, he said of Gibson, who has said Moore asked her on a date when she was 17, after speaking at her high school.If we did go out on dates, then we did, but I do not remember that, Moore said.When asked about Deasons claim that he provided her wine on dates when she was 18, Moore said: In this county, its a dry county.We never would have had liquor.Alcohol sales began in Etowah County in 1972, years before the alleged encounter, and The Post confirmed that wine was for sale at the time at the pizzeria where Deason remembered Moore taking her when she was under the legal drinking age of 19.The legal age of consent for sexual activity in Alabama is 16, as it was at the time of the alleged encounters.After my return from the military, I dated a lot of young ladies, Moore told Hannity.When Hannity asked Moore again if he could unequivocally say he never dated anybody in their late teens when he was 32, Moore said, Thats out of my customary behavior.Hannity said he would not want his 17- or 18-year-old daughter dating a 32-year-old.I wouldnt either, said Moore.And you think thats inappropriate, too, thats what youre saying?Hannity asked.Yes, the candidate replied.Allies of Moore in Alabama attacked the women.What these women are doing is such a shame, state Rep. Ed Henry (R) said in an interview Friday with Huntsville station WVNN-AM.As a father of two daughters, they discredit when women actually are abused and taken advantage of.Theyre not using their supposed experience to find justice.Theyre just using it as a weapon, a political weapon.At the same time, more national party leaders came forward to call on Moore to leave the race.Innocent until proven guilty is for criminal convictions, not elections, said Mitt Romney, the partys 2012 presidential nominee.I believe Leigh Corfman.Her account is too serious to ignore.Moore is unfit for office and should step aside.Romney joined his former rival, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), in calling for Moore to step down immediately.Other Republican Senate leaders, including Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.), have called on Moore to quit on the condition that the reports prove to be true but they have not yet described a process for assessing the truth of the claims.[Woman says Roy Moore initiated sexual encounter when she was 14, he was 32] Strategists saw little hope for pushing Moore out of the race.They backed away from discussions for a Republican write-in campaign, which they said would be doomed if Moore stayed in the contest.That, in turn, raised the possibility that Moores scandal will remain a problem for the party into the 2018 midterm elections, as candidates are asked to take a position on the abuse of minors and intergenerational dating.Other Republicans are going to be dragged into it, said Steven Law, chief executive of the Senate Leadership Fund, a political committee affiliated with McConnell that opposed Moores nomination.Indeed, on Friday, Rep. Barbara Comstock (R-Va.) issued a blistering rebuke of Moore and his supporters some of whom, she said, had offered explanations that are beyond disturbing.Comstock represents a swing district in the Washington suburbs and is seen as highly vulnerable in next years midterms, particularly after the defeat of six GOP state lawmakers whose districts overlap with hers in this weeks Virginia elections.Back in Alabama, Democrats familiar with the campaign of their nominee, Doug Jones, said no new ad buys or investments were planned to take advantage of the story.[Democrats make significant gains in Virginia legislature; control of House in play] None of the women who said Moore pursued them sought out The Post.While reporting a story in Alabama about supporters of Moores Senate campaign, a Post reporter heard that Moore allegedly had sought relationships with teenage girls.Over the ensuing three weeks, two Post reporters contacted and interviewed the four women.All were initially reluctant to speak publicly but chose to do so after multiple interviews, saying they thought it was important for people to know about their interactions with Moore.The women say they dont know one another.In interviews since the publication of the story, state officials have either said they would investigate the claims or raised questions about the timing of the revelations, suggesting that the women were politically motivated.After a Friday event with military veterans, Gov.Kay Ivey (R) told reporters that the people of Alabama deserve to know the truth, but she didnt hint at any particular actions she could take.One reporter followed up, asking if the word of the women could be trusted.Why wouldnt it be?she asked.One possibility, floated Friday night by some Republicans, was that Ivey could delay the election if Attorney General Jeff Sessions made it known that he would leave the Trump administration to run for his old seat.Alabama State Auditor Jim Zeigler, a Republican, told the Washington Examiner that biblical stories offered a justification for the acts Moore is accused of committing.Take Joseph and Mary, Zeigler said.Mary was a teenager, and Joseph was an adult carpenter.They became parents of Jesus.Even before the accusations became public, Senate Republicans were asked repeatedly about Moores more extreme positions on the proper role of the Christian faith in American political life.Now, party leaders expect new questions about the Moore accusations.Im prepping my candidate for what he is going to say if he is asked, said one GOP campaign manager for a top 2018 race, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to not draw attention to the race.At the very least, it is something that everyone is going to have to answer: Do you think Roy Moore at the age of 32 with a 14-year-old is like Mary and Joseph?During the 2012 elections, GOP Senate candidates in Missouri and Indiana made inaccurate or controversial comments about rape that allowed Democrats to make inroads with female voters across the country.Party leaders later said those comments helped prevent Republicans from winning the Senate majority that year.Law blamed former White House aide Stephen K. Bannon and his website Breitbart News for creating problems that could endanger Republicans in 2018.This is what Stephen K. Bannons French Revolution looks like chaos and embarrassment for the Republican Party, Law said.In the interview with Hannity, Moore described the allegations as a false attack by his political opponents.This is a completely manufactured story meant to defrock this campaign, Moore said.They dont want to acknowledge that there is a God.And we have refused to debate them because of their very liberal stance on transgenderism.Alice Crites in Washington and David Nakamura in Danang, Vietnam, contributed to this report.Read more at PowerPost
When did Congress authorize fighting in Niger? Thats an excellent question.:::::In this file photo, Myeshia Johnson (2nd R) is escorted to her seat as a Military Honor Guard carries the casket of her husband U.S. Army Sgt.La David Johnson during his burial service at the Memorial Gardens East cemetery on October 21, 2017 in Hollywood, Florida.Sgt.Johnson and three other American soldiers were killed in an ambush in Niger on Oct. 4.(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images) Its Veterans Day not a bad time to give some thought to the Authorization for the Use of Military Force (AUMF).The AUMF, which Congress passed in 2001 in response to the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, has been back in the news lately.After four U.S. soldiers were killed in Niger in October, members of Congress seemed to wake up, asking: Niger?When did we authorize fighting in Niger?Thats an excellent question.What is the AUMF?The 2001 AUMF (Public Law 107-40) was adopted by huge margins with only one dissenting vote in the House and none in the Senate just three days after the Sept. 11 attacks.Since it was not yet clear who had carried out the attacks, the law gave the president broad power to know, and to do.He was to determine who planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks, and was then authorized to use all necessary and appropriate force against those nations, organizations, or persons or those that harbored such organizations or persons, in order to prevent any future acts of international terrorism against the United States by such nations, organizations or persons.For good measure, the AUMF also stated that the President has authority under the Constitution to take action to deter and prevent acts of international terrorism against the United States though this was in a list of whereas clauses early in the resolution rather than in the authorization itself.[With fewer veterans in Congress, its less likely to rein in the presidents use of force] The AUMF authorized and still authorizes U.S. military action against al-Qaeda and the Taliban in Afghanistan.In the 2004 case Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, the Supreme Court found that the AUMF also allowed for the detention of those captured as a result of such action.This included American citizens held as unlawful enemy combatants, though such detainees had to receive some measure of due process.(What that meant, for U.S. citizens and others, has been the subject of many other court cases.)Why revisit the AUMF?As the New York Times Charlie Savage puts it, distance has grown between the text of the 2001 authorization and the combat waged in its name.In the past fifteen years the war against al-Qaeda has spread far beyond Afghanistan, and to many groups that are not al-Qaeda.In 2014 the Obama administration, seeking legal justification for what became Operation Inherent Resolve (OIR) against ISIS in Iraq, Syria, and elsewhere, argued that even though ISIS formed after the 9/11 attacks and had been repudiated by al-Qaeda it was still that groups associated or successor force.Therefore, the 2001 AUMF applied to OIR.And therefore, the requirements of the 1973 War Powers Resolution that Congress grant specific authorization for the long-term use of American force were met.Many observers argued this stretched the AUMF too far.In 2001 those voting for the AUMF had sworn it was not a blank check.Still, Congress did not push back.But presidential claims about the AUMFs scope keep growing, as the Niger ambush brought home.U.S. troops are active in at least 19 countries.The blanket of the AUMF was spread even over the use of force against the Syrian government which has perpetrated many evils, but not the 9/11 attacks.When an American jet shot down a Syrian bomber in June, the Trump administration argued that American forces would not be in Syria if not for the ISIS threat, and that therefore the use of a necessary and appropriate measure in support of counter-ISIS operations was warranted.By this logic, Sen. Ben Cardin (D-Md.)suggested at a recent Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing on the topic, the AUMF and the 2002 Iraq War authorization are mere authorities of convenience for presidents to conduct military activities anywhere in the world.And Senate Foreign Relations Chair Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) who in the past dismissed the need for new legislation recently argued that though the 2001 law is technically sufficient, we should update the AUMF to reflect the current conflict and reassert Congress constitutional role.What would a new AUMF look like?Thats the problem.Some in Congress want to simply empower the president.Others want to limit his autonomy.Compare, for instance, two proposed replacement AUMFs, one sponsored by Sen. Todd Young (R-Ind.), and one by Sens.Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) and Tim Kaine (D-Va.).Youngs version highlights the horrific acts of violence committed by ISIS, and grants the president power to use all necessary and appropriate force against al-Qaeda, the Taliban, ISIS, and unspecified successor organizations, and associated forces.It also grants explicit authority to detain such combatants and those who support them.It has no expiration date.By contrast, the Flake/Kaine version starts with more legalistic whereas-es that say things like the United States should take action against non-state, transnational actors in a disciplined way that meets the current threat environment.It authorizes the president to use force against al-Qaeda, the Taliban, ISIS, and associated persons or forces.But in doing so, it specifies a handful of such forces (e.g., al-Shabab and the a-Nusra Front).The president has to report on any others he thinks are included, and must justify the use of force in countries other than Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Somalia, Libya, or Yemen.Those determinations can be reversed by congressional vote.And while this authorization can be renewed, it expires after five years.Third Way has charted still other competing proposals, which differ on such things as how long what kind of force is authorized, and where and against which groups it applies.Would a new version pass?In September, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) forced a roll-call vote on repealing the AUMF within six months.It failed, 61-36.Still, some of the Senate no voters stressed that while they were against simple repeal, they would be happy to, er, repeal and replace.And over the summer a House subcommittee working on a defense bill surprised Capitol Hill by adopting an amendment sunsetting the AUMF after 240 days.Even Defense Secretary James Mattis sympathizes.He testified in March that a new resolution would be a statement of the American peoples resolve [I] have not understood why the Congress hasnt come forward with this, at least to debate.[Congress keeps quiet on U.S. drone policy and thats a big problem.]Earlier this year, the D.C.Circuit Court of Appeals rejected civilian victims of drone strikes effort to win judicial oversight over such tactics, ruling (I think correctly) that the foreign target of a military strike cannot challenge in court the wisdom of [that] military action taken by the United States.Congress is where the U.S. should hold such debates, not the courtroom.But the ruling also commented caustically that congressional oversight is a joke and a bad one at that.I fear thats correct, too.Passing a new AUMF might be a good punchline.
New York Times photographer tweets photo of black box to protest White House coverage blackout:::::President Trump arrives to speak on the final day of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation leaders' summit in Danang, Vietnam.(Associated Press) DANANG, Vietnam News photographers and reporters traveling with President Trump are protesting a lack of access provided by the White House to his events here at a regional economic conference.On Saturday, New York Times photographer Doug Mills, a member of the White House Correspondents' Association board, tweeted a photo of a black box, framed with a decorative border, to illustrate the group's frustration.In the tweet, Mills said the 13-member travel pool of reporters, photographers and camera operators that provides reports for the rest of the news media would have no access at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit.This what our APEC Summit photo coverage looks today in Da Nang Vietnam.Blank.No coverage by the White House Travel Pool

Washington Post, joined Trump in several vans in his motorcade, as is customary when a U.S. president travels domestically or internationally.But the group was kept waiting in the vans and then, later, a fitness room away from the summit as Trump participated in meetings and an official group portrait.At an APEC welcome dinner Friday night that Trump participated in, the travel pool also had been mostly shut out.The White House Press Corps stands on the side of the road outside the Intercontinental Danang Sun Peninsula Resort after being denied access to cover President Trumps APEC regional economic conference events.pic.twitter.com/AYQs8ojr5O Jim Watson (@JimWatson_AFP) November 11, 2017 Michelle Meadows, a White House official who is helping organize Trump's five-nation Asia trip, said Friday that the summit organizers provided limited access for reporters, offering the U.S. delegation only two passes for an official photographer and videographer and none for the news media.She said the White House chose to give the videographer pass to the news media, allowing Fox News, which was pool television network for Trump's stop in Danang, to enter the dinner.But Fox also was not allowed in after officials abruptly canceled the photo op without explanation.We have been negotiating since the pre-advance and have made progress on almost every event for this swing, Meadows said in a written statement Friday that was provided to the pool.We ALWAYS ask for the full Pool to have access but we do not always get what we want.Each administration negotiates for access for presidential trips abroad on bilateral visits or multilateral summits, and access often varies by country.For instance, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping did not take questions from reporters in Beijing this week because the Chinese had objected to allowing it.China has state-run media, and while American reporters shouted out questions to Trump during a joint appearance with Xi, the U.S. president did not answer.The Freedom House rights group calls China's media environment one of the worlds most restrictive and Vietnam's one of the harshest in Asia.In its Freedom of the Press score, it gave China a score of 87 out of 100, and Vietnam 85 out of 100.(Higher scores indicate a less free environment.)By comparison, the United States got a score of 23 out of 100.Your traveling White House press corps has been kept out of the APEC summit.We await word on Trump-Putin stmnt from US side.Russians have spoken to their press.We Americans are still waiting.Steven Portnoy (@stevenportnoy) November 11, 2017 The White House has provided full pool coverage to numerous events on Trump's stops in Hawaii, Tokyo, Seoul and Beijing, as well as opportunities for the rest of the dozens of reporters who have traveled in a charter plane and by commercial airline to cover some events.Trump participated in a formal news conference with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe that included two questions from American reporters and two from Japanese reporters.But the limits have rankled reporters and photographers.Trump has, on numerous occasions, referred to the media as fake news and suggested that limits be placed on news outlets whose coverage he has found unflattering.Mills, in an email sent from the van in which he and the others were waiting, said the pool was objecting to the limits placed on it by both the Trump White House and the APEC summit organizers.Clearly not fair at all, he wrote.Referring to news photographers, known colloquially as stills, Mills added: There are 4 stills traveling with [the president] and none of us have had access to Trump with other foreign leaders.Two days in a row.The news photographers, as a group, agreed not to accept handouts provided by the White House of pictures taken by the official White House photographer.After the summit, Trump flew on Air Force One to Hanoi for bilateral meetings with Vietnamese leaders.During the flight, Trump visited the press cabin, where he answered questions and allowed photographers, including Mills, to take his picture..@realDonaldTrump speaks to reporters aboard Air Force One while traveling to Hanoi, Vietnam.pic.twitter.com/faNx30rnEl Doug Mills (@dougmillsnyt) November 11, 2017 Sanders said Trump visited the press cabin after he had heard from aides about the reporters' concerns over access and pledged the White House would push more aggressively for better access at a pair of regional summits Trump plans to attend Monday and Tuesday in the Philippines.That was little solace, however, for the hours of waiting around without seeing anything inside APEC.As they waited on the side of the road, the press pool decided to re-create the "family photo" the APEC leaders, including Trump, posed for.
Trump says U.S. wont be taken advantage of anymore. Hours later, Pacific Rim nations reach deal on trade without America.:::::President Trump said the U.S. would "no longer tolerate chronic trade abuses" during his remarks at the APEC summit in Vietnam on Nov. 10.(Amber Ferguson/The Washington Post) DANANG, Vietnam President Trump delivered a fiery speech on trade here Friday, declaring that he would not allow the United States to be taken advantage of anymore and planned to place America first.And then, less than 24 hours later, 11 Pacific Rim countries collectively shrugged and moved on without the U.S. On Saturday, the countries announced they had reached a deal to move ahead with the Trans-Pacific Partnership free-trade pact that Trump threw into question when he withdrew from it earlier this year.The agreement represents something of a rebuke of Trump, coming near the end of his five-country, 12-day swing through Asia, and reflects the willingness of other nations to proceed without the buy-in of the United States.A statement early Saturday trumpeted a breakthrough on the core elements of the trade agreement.Ministers are pleased to announce that they have agreed on the core elements of the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, it read.The deal was originally expected to be announced Friday the same day Trump addressed business leaders at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit here, in a speech heavy on tough talk and protectionist rhetoric but was delayed after Canada raised concerns.The decision to move ahead with the TPP agreement, minus the United States, reflects how Trumps decision to withdraw from the deal created a vacuum other nations are now moving to fill, with or without the president.President Trump arrives to speak at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation leaders' summit in Danang, Vietnam, on Friday.(Associated Press) In his speech Friday, Trump struck an aggressive note, saying he believed the United States had for too long been the victim of poor trade deals.We are not going to let the United States be taken advantage of anymore, he said.I am always going to put America first, the same way that I expect all of you in this room to put your countries first.Instead, he said the U.S. was still a willing trade partner, but only for deals based on mutual respect and mutual benefit.I will make bilateral trade agreements with any Indo-Pacific nation that wants to be our partner and that will abide by the principles of fair and reciprocal trade, he said.What we will no longer do is enter into large agreements that tie our hands, surrender our sovereignty, and make meaningful enforcement practically impossible.A senior administration official, asked if the new trade announcement foreshadowed the United States being left behind in the region, rejected the notion, pointing out that the president is here visiting and is part of the dialogue, and has already spent a significant portion of time talking to his allies and like-minded partners in Japan and South Korea.We'll continue that conversation with many parties here, the official said.So we absolutely are engaged on the economic side, and well continue to be so."
EPA is taking more advice from industry  and ignoring its own scientists:::::Then-presidential candidate Donald Trump shakes hands at a campaign appearance at Fitzgerald Peterbilt in Glade Spring, Va., in August 2016.The company is affiliated with Fitzgerald Glider Kits, which has pushed the Trump administration to repeal tighter emission standards for some freight trucks.(Evan Vucci/AP) When the Environmental Protection Agency this week proposed repealing tighter emissions standards for a type of freight trucks, it cited research conducted by Tennessee Tech University but underwritten by the biggest truck manufacturer challenging the rule.Fitzgerald Glider Kits which makes new truck bodies, called gliders, that house refurbished engines had questioned both the legality and data underpinning the Obama-era rule.Its products would have been required to meet the tougher pollution standards starting in January.The companys recent petition to the EPA included a letter signed by Tennessee Techs president and the head of the schools Center for Intelligent Mobility, soon to be housed in a new facility built by Fitzgerald.EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt, who two months earlier had met with company officials, quickly agreed their arguments had merit.It was the latest example of a profound shift unfolding in the EPA under President Trump, in which the agency has reassessed its own data and analyses at the prompting of corporations.On pesticides, chemical solvents and air pollutants, Pruitt and his deputies are using industry figures to challenge past findings and recommendations of the agencys own scientists.Such change has drawn praise from longtime EPA critics, such as House Science Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Tex.).Throughout the Obama administration, Science Committee hearings repeatedly revealed faulty, one-sided science as the underpinnings of EPA regulations.Administrator Pruitt has taken a different approach, Smith said in a statement.His actions make clear that he is working to unburden American families and to ensure this administrations policies are based on sound, transparent science.But environmentalists contend Pruitt is sidelining agency scientists on key decisions.What stands out in this administration is the overt way in which career staff, especially scientists, are viewed as unfriendly or on the other side, said Ken Cook, president of the nonprofit Environmental Working Group.Hes just stiff-arming the entire scientific process.During his confirmation hearing before Congress in January, Pruitt testified at length about the need for credible science to guide the EPAs decision-making.If confirmed, it will be my privilege to work with EPA scientists, he wrote in response to questions from Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.).Independent peer review is critical to ensuring the integrity of scientific research, and sound, objective science must serve as the backbone of EPA actions.Detractors say his actions tell a different story.Pruitt has questioned the legitimacy of the agencys work on climate science, and continued pressing for the White House to create a red team-blue team effort to debate the expert consensus on climate change.One idea would be to publicly scrutinize a massive new federal climate report, complied by scientists at 13 different agencies, affirming that human activity is driving recent global warming and could produce dire consequences in the coming decades.Last month, Pruitt moved to change the makeup of EPA advisory boards including panels that help prioritize the agencys research and provide recommendations on federal air-pollution and chemical exposure limits reflecting his broader effort to shift the way the agency evaluates science.He cut any researchers currently receiving EPA grants from the committees, on the grounds that this funding poses a conflict of interest, while bringing in advisers whose work is funded by industry.Several new appointees have blasted the EPA in the past for the science it used to justify tougher limits on pollutants and chemicals.The new chairman of the Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee, consultant Louis Anthony Tony Cox Jr., argued in 2015 the agency had erred in concluding that stricter smog limits would protect public health.What were trying to do is ensure that the process and that the methodology were using is something folks have confidence in, and I think that this is a step toward that, he told reporters.Pruitts public schedule shows dozens of meetings with industry trade group officials and top executives from chemical, agricultural and fossil fuel companies yet only holds periodic meetings with his own staff members about policy issues.EPA reviews all comments, research and data submitted to the agency, as part of understanding the issue, so that the agency can make informed decisions, spokeswoman Liz Bowman said.Yet the question of which studies should guide the EPAs decision-making has cropped up repeatedly since the former Oklahoma attorney general came to Washington.One of the most polarizing cases emerged in March, when he put the brakes on banning the pesticide chlorpyrifos, which has been used by farmers for a half-century to kill pests on a range of crops.The EPA prohibited its spraying indoors to combat household bugs more than a decade ago.But in 2015, the agency proposed revoking all uses of chlorpyrifos on food in response to a petition filed by the Natural Resources Defense Council and Pesticide Action Network North America.The two groups cited scientific evidence about the potential health risks to fetal neurological development.In March, facing a deadline to decide on the petition, Pruitt changed gears and withdrew the proposed ban.He said he wanted to provide regulatory certainty to the thousands of American farms that rely on chlorpyrifos and that reversing the previous administrations decision amounted to returning to using sound science ...rather than predetermined results.The scientific arguments Pruitt chose to rely on came in part from the chemical industry itself.Dow AgroSciences, which manufactures chlorpyrifos, questioned epidemiological studies using data from human subjects rather than lab animals and said the EPAs assessment of the chemicals safety lacks scientific rigor.The Agriculture Department also raised concerns about the EPAs methodology, and Pruitt cited those divergent views in his decision.The EPA might not formally revisit questions about the safety of chlorpyrifos until 2022, when the agency is mandated to reevaluate the pesticide.Other industry groups are now pushing for review of the EPAs scientific assessment of chloroprene, a chemical the agency identified as a likely carcinogen in 2010.Smith and the chair of his panels environment subcommittee, Rep. Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.), wrote Pruitt on Oct. 12 asking for a briefing and documents related to the analysis underpinning the assessment.They questioned why the EPA ignored the conclusion of the highest quality study cited by a consultant for Denka Performance Elastomer, the Japanese company that operates the sole U.S. chloroprene manufacturing plant.That consultant, Kenneth Mundt, said Friday that he and several other researchers believe the EPA erroneously calculated the high cancer-risk levels it attributed to chloroprene.The research he had referenced, which did not find an elevated risk, was funded in part by U.S. and French chloroprene manufacturers.Mundt, Denka officials and some of the firms other consultants met on Oct. 30 with seven EPA officials to discuss the science surrounding chloroprene.In the past, it was difficult to get our perspectives considered at EPA ...if you had some relationship with industry, because the door would be closed, he said.But thats easing, and theres an increasing sense of cooperation, at least on the part of the scientists.Pruitt is now giving the EPA data behind the 2016 truck emissions rule another look, as the agency moves forward with its repeal.The aim of the rule was to apply the stricter pollution controls that already existed for other types of trucks to gliders.EPA modeling, which assumed that most gliders use pre-2002 engines, found that they emit anywhere from 20 to 40 times as much nitrogen oxides and soot as trucks with new engines.But the petition filed by Fitzgerald cited Tennessee Tech testing that concluded gliders performed equally as well and in some instances out-performed vehicles with newer engines.The document, which the company submitted with Harrison Truck Centers and Indiana Phoenix, did not include specific results from those tests.Tennessee Tech spokesman Dewayne Wright said via email that one of the schools engineering professors went with graduate students to a Fitzgerald facility to conduct independent research on the EPA rule.The discussion of housing the schools Center for Intelligent Mobility in the Fitzgerald Technology Complex took place after the first tests were completed, he added.Tennessee Tech continually looks for ways to expose students to real-world situations and problem solving, and this was an excellent opportunity for our students, under the guidance of a Tech faculty member, to conduct such research, Wright said.EPA staff members are doing their own round of emissions testing on a glider kit in an agency lab.But Pruitt has already proposed the rule rescinding the Obama-era standards that Fitzgerald wants gone before the tests are finished.Read more: Let us do our job: Anger erupts over EPAs apparent muzzling of scientists EPA now requires political aides sign-off for agency awards, grant applications
Business groups typically allied with Republicans not all on board fast tax train:::::One powerful group was noticeably scarce from the flurry of activity inside the congressional committee room where Republicans recently took a big step toward passing their sweeping tax overhaul.The lobbyists who three decades ago swarmed 1100 Longworth the House Ways and Means panel room where lawmakers last tackled a tax code rewrite had thinned to a relative trickle.The K Street crowd chalked up their absence to new modes of communicating with lawmakers and aides.But lobbyists also point to another big factor that could jeopardize the signature domestic push by President Trump and the GOP: Republicans are moving at such a breakneck pace that corporations with billions of dollars to gain or lose from the revamp still havent determined their fate.That leaves them without a clear plan of action to strike out against the loss of breaks they cherish or complicated new taxes on their operations or a game plan to rally behind changes that benefit them.Its very hard to keep up with the House process and the changes in some of the most complex provisions, said Cathy Koch, Americas tax policy leader at EY.The ground keeps shifting.Many companies are still struggling to calculate the net impact on their business, their markets, their workers, and their consumers.The House and Senate tax measures share a focus on slashing the burden on business.But many businesses arent yet sold on the proposals, fracturing the traditional Republican coalition that has helped send major legislation over the finish line during previous high-profile fights.The lack of unity among would-be corporate allies could spell trouble for the tax effort at a time when Republicans, and Trump, are desperate for a legislative accomplishment they can tout on the campaign trail next year.[Senate GOP plan would delay corporate tax cut, protect mortgage interest deduction] The GOP timeline is aggressive the Ways and Means Committee approved its bill Thursday after it was introduced a week ago and plans to vote on the proposal next week.Senators unveiled their draft this week and say they want to pass it by the end of the year.Trouble was evident from the start as the National Association of Home Builders and the National Association of Realtors declared their instant opposition to the House bill.The groups argue that the proposal removes incentives for owning a home in part by capping the write-off for mortgage interest and limiting the deduction for state and local taxes.The NAHB is planning to fly more than 100 of its members to Washington next week to make its case.We want members of Congress to look their friends in the eyes and tell them why they cant support housing and homeownership, NAHB President Jerry Howard said.[Republicans, desperate for a win, aleady face setbacks as they unveil their proposal] But the GOP scored a coup when the National Federation of Independent Business, the potent small-business lobby that initially lined up against the House bill, decided to back the version that emerged from the Ways and Means Committee on Thursday.Chairman Kevin Brady (R-Tex.)tweaked the treatment of businesses that file on the individual side of the code to make more small firms eligible for a lower rate.We are very grateful to Chairman Brady for listening to our concerns and working with NFIB to ensure that tax reform benefits the greatest possible number of American small business owners, NFIB President and CEO Juanita Duggan said in a statement.Other big-business behemoths including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the Business Roundtable and the National Association of Manufacturers are backing the rewrite, despite some reservations.We never said the bill was perfect and couldnt be improved, Neil Bradley, the chambers chief policy officer, said.But because it meets our threshold principles and is pro-growth, weve been very supportive.This is an all-hands-on-deck push.The headlong rush to passage has sidelined, for now, much of what would otherwise be and may yet become the bills corporate cheering section.Youve got Republican majorities in Congress and a Republican president that all came together on a framework to reform the tax code, and nobody wants to be against that, said one lobbyist who spoke on the condition of anonymity to offer a candid assessment.The problem is the process has really backed everybody into a corner.Lobbyists close to the process also note a striking lack of coordination with the administration, which under Republican control has typically played a more assertive role in rallying business community support for key initiatives.The office of House Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.)has instead stepped in, conducting briefings before major steps in the rollout of the plan and hosting an 8:45 a.m. daily conference call with representatives from allied conservative groups and business lobbyists.For his part, Bradley said he doesnt have a ton of sympathy for those who complain about the speed.Weve been waiting on this for 31 years....This is game time, and youve got to step it up.The chamber also has said that it intends to use its considerable political muscle to reward or punish individual Republican lawmakers based on how they line up.This is pretty much a litmus test for whether or not when you have the opportunity you can deliver on pro-growth policy....Failure is not an option, and well hold people accountable.[Lobbying battle begins over GOP tax bill] The House and Senate bills approach the $1.5 trillion limit for adding to the deficit over the next decade, a red line they cant blow through without breaking Senate budget rules allowing the upper chamber to approve the measure without Democratic support.That equals the cost alone of slashing the corporate rate from 35 to 20 percent which both versions, do, though the Senate plan saves $100 billion by delaying the cut for a year meaning tax writers have had to scour the code for new sources of revenue to pay for the rest of their wish-list of cuts for other businesses and individuals.The hunt for that money has led lawmakers into uncharted territory.The original House Republican bill included a new excise tax on payments between certain subsidiaries of multinational corporations.It raised an estimated $154.5 billion, and GOP tax writers said it would discourage globe-spanning companies from sending their U.S. profits abroad.But an array of U.S. and foreign-based companies with extensive U.S. operations cried foul, arguing that the move would discourage investment here and probably violate international tax treaties to boot.Republicans on the tax-writing panel tweaked the provision twice over the course of the week.But not enough to satisfy many stakeholders, who still remain opposed to the bill.The way the amendment was written still violates tax treaties and reaches into global profits that other jurisdictions feel is their prerogative, said Nancy McLernon, who heads the Organization for International Investment, which represents firms headquartered abroad with major U.S. footprints, including Anheuser-Busch, GlaxoSmithKline, Siemens and Unilever.The process, McLernon said, is moving way too quickly.Other industry groups are publicly holding their fire.Many applaud the chopped corporate rate while laboring behind the scenes to preserve favored deductions.Consumer bankers, for example, are protesting the elimination of certain write-offs, including for premiums that banks pay to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., and life insurers are working to defeat a move to raise taxes on their reserves.In a characteristic statement Thursday, American Council of Life Insurers President and CEO Dirk Kempthorne thanked Republican leaders for committing to address unintended consequences for the life insurance industry and its policyholders and said his group would continue to work with them.Mike DeBonis contributed to this report.Read more at PowerPost
At the end of the day, perhaps typography will be Trumps downfall:::::President Trump holds up a paper with text on it next to Vice President Pence and Brook Park Mayor Thomas J. Coyne Jr. in Brook Park, Ohio, on September 5, 2016.(Mike Segar/Reuters) Consider the following blocks of text.Each says the same thing, lifted from an article about the Alabama Senate race.One, we suspect, you found easier to read.Namely, the lower one.Why?For some specific reasons.The first is whats called leading, the space between the lines of text vertically.(Pronounced like led, the term is a reference to a time when lead was used to space out the lines of text in a printing press.)The second block also includes a paragraph break, making it easier to separate out the ideas it includes, as you might list a phone number as 555-3226 instead of 5553226 to make it easier to remember.That block also uses a typeface with serifs, the little ticks at the ends of the letters, like on this K. Why are they there?Because the serifs create a visual sense of a consistent line across the page (or, in this case, screen).Its like writing on a sheet of lined notebook paper; the serifs act like lines in the background keeping your eye moving along the line.The Posts designers found a balance of leading and type that they think makes it easier to read the text in our articles.This is the art of typography, and its an important design consideration.After all, if you were faced with a Post article that looked like the Block 1, the odds are good that you wouldnt actually read the thing.So lets now talk about the president.On Friday morning, Nate Silver made an interesting point on Twitter.Trump's 280-character Twitter is totally unreadable.It's completely neutralized his Twitter game.https://t.co/7OGSeN0mii Nate Silver (@NateSilver538) November 10, 2017 Silver was referring to this tweet, which uses Twitters recently expanded 280-character limit to share more text.Throughout my travels, I've had the pleasure of sharing the good news from America.I've had the honor of sharing our vision for a free & open Indo-Pacific a place where sovereign & independent nations, w/diverse cultures & many different dreams, can all prosper side-by-side.pic.twitter.com/qBOCY3u7YV Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 10, 2017 That tweet was one of a series from the president coupling a video of his speech in Vietnam with an excerpt of that speech.It is, indeed, a dull, uninspired tweet which, we can be confident, Trump himself did not write.(Why?Well, first of all, its not very interesting.Second, the inclusion of a video from his speech is not the sort of thing that Trumps pre-late-campaign tweets ever manifested.)Silvers tacit point is that not very many people were into that speech tweet.Getting 7,700 retweets (as of writing) is, for Trump, a bad tweet.(Before he ran for office, that would have been a lot of tweets for him; this one about Diet Coke from October 2012 got only 1,700 retweets.)This one seems more like Trump, but is still awfully long.I dont blame China, I blame the incompetence of past Admins for allowing China to take advantage of the U.S. on trade leading up to a point where the U.S. is losing $100's of billions.How can you blame China for taking advantage of people that had no clue?I would've done same!Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 9, 2017 Getting 25,000 retweets is more on par for Trump, but still not great.Contrast it with this one, from before the 280-character expansion.NYC terrorist was happy as he asked to hang ISIS flag in his hospital room.He killed 8 people, badly injured 12.SHOULD GET DEATH PENALTY!Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 2, 2017 Granted, the subject matter of the latter is a bit more controversial, but Trump saying that it was all right to take advantage of Americans that had no clue is the sort of thing that, once upon a time, might have been a blockbuster.Youve already figured out where this is going.The 280-character tweets from Trump look a lot more like Block 1 in our example than Block 2.Viewed in a timeline in a browser, its hard to read in a different way: long lines of text in smaller type.We are not typography experts.Brendan Griffiths, director of the MPS Communications Design program at the Parsons School of Design in New York, is specifically in the context of designing for interactive platforms.To get his assessment of the typography of the new, bulkier tweets, we asked him to consider this tweet from Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey.We expected (and !)all the snark & critique for #280characters.Comes with the job.What matters now is we clearly show why this change is important, and prove to you all its better.Give us some time to learn and confirm (or challenge!)our ideas.https://t.co/qJrzzIluMw jack (@jack) September 27, 2017 Griffiths wasnt too hard on Twitters designers.Certainly I think that this is less legible than the historic iterations of the platform, he said.It could be probably a bit looser in the leading and it would become more legible.Part of this is specific to the expectations Twitter users have.Griffiths expressed his wish that the platform would return to an older iteration in which it was solely short blocks of text, making it easy to skim a lot of information at once.When Twitter introduced photos and videos and began including images with article links, that reduced the number of tweets that you could see on your screen without scrolling a trade-off made in favor of more compelling content.This new change results in big blocks of text that eat up more space and are less compelling.Even the workaround that users developed for including more text embedding screenshots of articles is better in one sense than the block of text in a 280-character tweet.After all, those images use text that, like our Block 2 above was designed by professional designers to be legible on the screen which is being captured and then shared.Griffiths identified a more critical problem than leading: Lack of editing.This idea that now people have more space to write, so theyre spending less time chopping down what they would have written, he said.That editing includes things like adding line breaks (the dash in the 555 -3226) to make it easier to skim.But it also means cutting out words.Whose woods these are I think I know/His house is in the village though vs.The guy who owns these woods has about 200 acres in the area, but he actually lives down in Port Chester, on Main Street.John Smith.Works at the grocery.Of course theres that kind of human nature any larger chunk of information is going to be more difficult to digest than something pithy, Griffiths said.Thats a reality for us and always has been.In the case of Twitter, the platform necessitates brevity, and when you take that away, it actually does become more and more difficult to parse whats being said by an individual user.The way in which people read Twitter scrolling quickly through it means that short blocks of text are more likely to be grasped as they zip by.It was probably the case, he said, that bigger blocks of text were cutting down on the extent to which those tweets were being read.In other words, that Trump may actually be undercutting the effectiveness of his preferred platform.Griffiths had a question for us, too.I mean, with all the stuff thats going on right now, especially on a platform like Twitter, he asked, isnt the typography the least of your worries?Well, yes, but it is a Friday on a holiday weekend and its an interesting question and, just: come on, man.

Thinking the unthinkable: Could Roy Moore actually lose?:::::Alabama Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore has made many righteous comments about morality, God and sex in his past as a jurist and politician.(Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post) In the 110 years from 1871 to 1981, Alabama never elected anyone to serve the state in the U.S. Senate who wasnt a Democrat.For much of that period, that was true throughout the South, a Democratic bastion stronger than either party has seen in any other region over the course of U.S. history.After the civil rights movement, the region flipped, and the once solid-blue South became a deep hue of red.It happened quickly.In Alabama, Sen. Richard C. Shelby switched parties to Republican in 1994; Jeff Sessions, now attorney general, won election in 1996.Since, both senators in the state have been Republican, and there was every reason to think that those two senators would continue to be Republicans into the indefinite future.Until Thursday.To be clear, its still very likely that the man who will win the upcoming special election in Alabama to replace Sessions will be the Republican, Roy Moore.But with a report by The Washington Post that Moore allegedly sought sexual contact with a 14-year-old girl in 1979, it seems worth reevaluating that assumption.Could Doug Jones be the first Democratic senator from Alabama in two decades?On Twitter on Friday, Charles Franklin of the Marquette Law School Poll noted some interesting data.Moore has twice won election to statewide office in Alabama, being elected chief justice of the state Supreme Court in 2000 and 2012.In both cases, he left office after being censured for his behavior: In 2003, he was removed from office after refusing to take a Ten Commandments monument out of a state building, and in 2016, he was suspended for demanding that the states ban on same-sex marriages be maintained contrary to a U.S. Supreme Court decision.What Franklin noted was a sharp downturn in Moores performance between his two races, suggesting that his having left in disgrace the first time tamped down his support the second time.Heres a visual version of what Franklin noted, with the bars scaled to the number of votes.In 2000, Moore won about 55 percent of the vote in his race, a bit less than George W. Bush won in the presidential race in Alabama that year.Moore got fewer votes than Bush, by about 63,000 votes.In 2012, the gap between Mitt Romney and Moore was much wider.Moore got about 52 percent of the vote, down about three points from 2000.Romney, though, outperformed Bush in 2000 by more than four points.The margin of Moores victory in 2000 was 5.5 points lower than Bushs; in 2012, his margin of victory was almost 19 points worse than Romneys.Moore won by only 3.5 points in 2012 and received 343,000 fewer votes than Romney.Notice that Moores Democratic opponents did better than the Democratic presidential candidates, Al Gore and Barack Obama, both in terms of percentages and raw vote totals.The suggestion is that, perhaps, a national Democrat is perceived less positively than an Alabama Democrat.In 2016, Donald Trump won Alabama by a wider margin than even Romney, 27.7 points.At the same time, Democratic Senate candidate Ron Crumpton, taking on Shelby, lost by a wide margin, even though he got more votes than Hillary Clinton in the state.(He got 749,000; she got 730,000.)There are two ways to interpret this.One is that Moore is more vulnerable than one might have originally thought, particularly given: The newly reported revelations, which led, among other things, to endorsements being reconsidered and party funding shut off.The results of Tuesdays elections, in which the Democratic candidate for governor in Virginia (a state Clinton won) ended up seeing a groundswell of Democratic support that helped him perform significantly better than polling in the race predicted.A poll conducted in the wake of the new reports shows the Alabama race as essentially even though there are good reasons to be skeptical of what it found.Moores lead in the polling average has been about six points, narrower than the lead he enjoyed in the runoff for his partys nomination.Alabama residents have mixed reactions about the sexual misconduct allegations against Republican Senate nominee Roy Moore.(Arik Sokol,Melissa Macaya/The Washington Post) The other way to look at this is that the fundamental structure of the race hasnt changed.This is an election in December of an off year, the sort of election that tends to reward the candidate supported by voters who turn out more often, which generally means voters who are older and wealthier.That generally means Republican voters.Thats the caveat to the comparisons to 2000 and 2012 that Franklin himself notes: A Democrat coming within four points of a Republican in statewide race in a high-turnout presidential election doesnt mean another Democrat would come similarly close this December.There will likely be Republican voters who are discouraged from heading to the polls by the idea of having to cast a ballot for either a scandal-clouded Republican or, worse, a Democrat.But how many will be so discouraged is hard to say.Its also hard to say how many Democrats are planning on flooding the polls next month, as they did in Virginia.As a percentage of the states population, there just arent as many Democrats in Alabama to do that flooding.Were the Alabama contest between Jones and any other Republican, it would be very hard to make the case that Jones might win.(Such a case would lean heavily on the second bullet point above.)A race against Moore, though?Lets just say that its not a gimme for the Republicans.This may be about as close to a non-solidly-red Deep South as were likely to see for a while.
Rep. Andy Harris of Md. and Corey Stewart of Va. endorsed Roy Moore. Now what?:::::Maryland and Virginia Republicans who endorsed Roy Moores candidacy for U.S. Senate were silent Friday morning after accusations that Moore initiated sexual contact with minors while he was in his 30s.The Washington Post reported allegations that Moore initiated contact with a 14-year-old girl when he was a 32-year-old assistant district attorney in Alabama and pursued three other females between the ages of 16 and 18.Moore denies any wrongdoing.In September, Rep. Andy Harris, the only Republican representing Maryland in Congress, endorsed Moore in a bitter GOP runoff election in Alabama that gripped national politics.Washington needs to be shaken up, and I cant think of a better man to do that than Judge Roy Moore, Harris said in a statement at the time.He will bring not only principle to the Senate, but also a backbone of steel.I am proud to endorse him.Republican Senate candidate Corey Stewart, chairman of the Prince William Board of County Supervisors, also endorsed Moore.(Jahi Chikwendiu/The Washington Post) Harriss congressional office referred questions to his political staff.His reelection campaign did not return a call or two emails seeking comment Friday.Congressman Andy Harris owes it to his constituents and all decent Marylanders to withdraw his endorsement of Roy Moore, Fabion Seaton, a spokesman for the Maryland Democratic Party, said in a statement.Moore faces the Democratic nominee, Doug Jones, in a Dec. 12 special election.President Trump, Vice President Pence, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and others, most of whom opposed Moore in the GOP runoff election, have said he should withdraw from the Senate race if the allegations are true.Republicans in Alabama, meanwhile, have mostly rallied around him.Virginians who endorsed Moore include Prince William Board of County Supervisors Chairman Corey A. Stewart, who is running for the Republican nomination to challenge Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) and has declared himself leader of the anti-establishment wing of the state GOP.In a fundraising email in September, Stewart called Moore exactly the kind of leader we need in Washington, D.C., to advance President Trumps agenda and reverse the disastrous policies of the Obama-Clinton Democrats.Stewart did not respond to calls seeking comment Friday morning.Kaines campaign spokesman, Ian Sams, said, any person of conscience should be willing to condemn child sex abuse, and the fact Corey hasnt speaks volumes about him.Former Virginia attorney general and 2013 gubernatorial nominee Ken Cuccinelli also endorsed Moore, according to a list of endorsements listed on Moores website.Alie Hassan, a spokeswoman for Cuccinelli, said he was unavailable for comment Friday morning.She said the endorsement was from the Senate Conservatives Fund, of which Cuccinelli is president, and not a personal endorsement from Cuccinelli himself.

How unusual are Trumps not qualified judicial nominations?:::::President Trump signs an executive order on health care at the White House on Oct. 12.(Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) As of writing, four of the people nominated by President Trump to serve on a bench have been judged by the standing committee of the American Bar Association to be not qualified.Two of those proposed judges were found to be not qualified by a majority of the committee; two were given that designation by a unanimous vote.To a layperson, this sounds ...bad.But, in one sense, it may not be as bad as you think.The ABA has its ratings since the 101st Congress 1989, the first term of George H.W.Bush on its website.We pulled out all of those ratings and divvied them up into five categories: those unanimously determined to be well-qualified, qualified or not-qualified and those who received a rating that included a substantial minority opinion between those three groupings.(So the two non-unanimous Trump picks above would land in the split category between qualified and not qualified.)Trump, of course, has made fewer nominations over the course of his less-than-one-year-old term than did his predecessors over the course of the first two years of theirs.The circles below are scaled to the percentage of nominees in each group.We can look at the data by president, collapsing the split groups into the two extremes.That gives us the following pattern.Trump has made fewer picks but a higher percentage of them were determined to be not qualified or received a substantial minority of the standing committee who believed that they were not qualified.Again, though, theres a possible reason.The ABA Journal, a magazine that covers the ABA, explains how its process works, noting that most presidents submit their possible nominees to the ABA for its assessment before making a public nomination.Most.Not all presidential administrations welcome the ABA committees ratings, the ABA Journals Lee Rawles writes.Since the Eisenhower administration, the norm was for the committee to complete its evaluation before the official nomination.The exception to this was during President George W. Bushs tenure, when he chose to announce his judicial nominees before the standing committee had evaluated them.And on March 17, the White House alerted the ABA that President Trump had also decided not to submit his judicial candidates for evaluation before nomination.In other words, most presidents know how the ABA views their picks before those picks are publicly identified.They can then choose to move forward with the nominations or not.From the ABA: When the White House participates in the pre-nomination process, the president can choose not to officially nominate that candidate before a not qualified rating can go public.President Bill Clinton chose to advance four nominees who received such a rating, three of whom were confirmed by the Senate.Although no official nominee under President Barack Obama had a not qualified rating, the New York Times reported in 2011 that the ABA gave a not qualified rating to 14 of about 185 potential candidates the Obama administration asked the ABA to evaluate.In other words, Barack Obama had a number of potential nominees who were rated as not qualified who he then didnt actually nominate.Trumps decision to skip the ABA vetting process means that hes then nominating people who the ABA doesnt feel are qualified, and that view becomes public.It seems like Trumps had more poorly reviewed nominees than Obama because Obama didnt actually nominate his poorly reviewed candidates.Of course, that doesnt exactly absolve Trump.Obama possibly chose not to nominate those candidates not because he wanted to avoid the black mark of a poor rating, but because they were poorly rated.Trump pressed forward anyway.While its possible that other presidents have advanced more people who were rated as not qualified, by actually nominating his picks, Trump is more likely to have not qualified people actually confirmed by the Senate.This article was corrected to identify the ABA Journal as independent of the ABA.
Boris Johnson under renewed fire over Iran comments:::::Boris Johnson has come under renewed fire over his handling of the Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe case after a senior official accused him of trying to "protect himself" rather than focusing on "getting this poor woman home".Dave Penman, general secretary of the civil servants' union FDA, issued a stinging rebuke to the Foreign Secretary over reports suggesting it was Foreign Office officials who were responsible for Mr Johnson's mistakenly saying the jailed mother had been training journalists in Iran."It's difficult to imagine such a mistake being made by an FCO official but, even if it were, the buck stops with the Foreign Secretary," said Mr Penman."He should be focusing on getting this poor woman home to her family, not looking to protect himself with anonymous briefings to journalists.Video: 'I'm here!'Johnson avoids sacking question "It's very disappointing that these accusations are being thrown around, safe in the knowledge that civil servants are unable to defend themselves or respond."Mr Johnson's gaffe has prompted fears that the 38-year-old charity administrator is facing an additional five years in jail and prompted calls for the Foreign Secretary's resignation.Allies of Mr Johnson have reportedly said he was given an incorrect briefing by Foreign Office officials ahead of a committee hearing at which the comments were made.The Iranian judiciary and media seized upon Mr Johnson's statement as proof of her guilt and she is now facing a new trial for "propaganda against the regime", which could see her face an additional time in jail.Video: Husband of jailed Brit addresses Boris remarks Sources close to the Foreign Secretary have told Sky News it is "totally untrue" that Mr Johnson is seeking to blame Foreign Office officials, or their briefing, for his comments.But the stinging criticism from Mr Penman piles further pressure on the Foreign Secretary, who has faced calls for his resignation in recent days from across the political spectrum.Tory backbencher Anna Soubry said "in 'normal' times Boris Johnson would have been sacked long ago".Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's family has also stepped up the pressure in recent days as the mother-of-one's plight hit the national airwaves.Her husband Richard told Sky News he was now in contact with senior politicians over the case.Video: The Pledge: Boris Johnson - a step too far?Foreign Office minister Alistair Burt told Mr Ratcliffe on Friday "serious consideration" was being given to allowing him to travel to Iran with Mr Johnson.The pair are due to have a conversation on Sunday - the first direct contact between the two since Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was first incarcerated in April 2016 while on holiday in Iran visiting her family with her two-year-old daughter Gabriella.She was separated from her daughter and spent the first eight months in solitary confinement as she was interrogated by Revolutionary Guards.Mr Johnson has apologised for causing any anxiety by mistakenly telling MPs that Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe had been training journalists at the time she was arrested in Tehran.
EU gives UK two-week deadline on Brexit divorce bill:::::The UK must clarify or concede more in the next two weeks or face failing to move Brexit talks on to trade in December, the EU's chief negotiator has said.Michel Barnier imposed the deadline in a move likely to heap more pressure on Theresa May over progress of the discussions.The PM said previously she hoped and had a "degree of confidence" that phase-two Brexit talks could start before Christmas.But speaking at a news conference after the sixth round of negotiations ended in Brussels, Mr Barnier issued a new warning.:: Set your watches: Official Brexit time revealed Video: May on Brexit: Still some way to go Asked to confirm reports that the EU needed clarifications or more concessions from the UK in the next two weeks to move discussions on next month, he gave a one word answer: "Yes."Mr Barnier said only "real and sincere progress" on the sticking points of citizens' rights, the Irish border and exit bill would be enough.Failing that, he warned, negotiations on Britain's future relationship with the EU "will be put back".In a news conference light on new announcements, Mr Davis called for Brussels to show "flexibility, creativity and imagination".:: Article 50 architect says Brexit can be reversed Image: David Davis called for 'flexibility and creativity' He said the UK was "ready and willing to engage as often and as quickly as is needed to secure this outcome over the weeks remaining ahead of the December European Council".The Council meeting where EU27 leaders will decide if "sufficient progress" has been made begins on 14 December.Some in the Conservative party will ask why the two-week deadline has been imposed with the summit still over four weeks off.Tory MP Iain Duncan Smith suggested giving Mr Barnier a reciprocal ultimatum.He told Sky News: "We should tell him he has two weeks to sort out an FTA (Free Trade Agreement)."Image: Mrs May left the October summit without trade talks secured Sky's Tamara Cohen said: "A one-word answer from Michel Barnier - 'yes -' has set the two-week timer ticking on the Brexit divorce bill."The reaction from Brexiteers in the Conservative to the idea of paying billions to Brussels in a divorce settlement is more muted than it was a year ago when the Government was riding high."Theresa May is their biggest hope of delivering Brexit and they know it would be detrimental to their interests to undermine her, amid all her other woes."Ahead of the 14 December summit, she'll need to sound out what they'll accept.And if Britain is to up its offer, what concessions may be on the table for trade or the transition period."
Irish PM: Northern Ireland must stick with single market rules:::::Northern Ireland must continue to apply EU single market and customs union rules to avoid a hard border, Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar has said.The Taoiseach said the UK or Northern Ireland would not necessarily have to remain members of either as a "bespoke" arrangement could be reached.James Brokenshire, the Northern Ireland secretary, said the UK Government is ready to be "pragmatic" in acquiring a solution to the "unique circumstances" facing the nation, regarding its currently open border with the EU.Mr Varadkar's suggestion came after a leaked European Commission document said the Republic is making a big push for firm reassurance on the border question before the crucial EU summit in December when Theresa May is hoping to get the go-ahead for trade talks to begin.The paper, obtained by the Daily Telegraph, said to preserve the Good Friday Agreement peace deal the Brexit deal must respect "the integrity of the internal market and the customs union".Image: The border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland in the village of Bridgend, Co Donegal Northern Ireland's border is one of the three key initial Brexit issues, along with expat citizens' rights and the divorce bill.EU leaders have said "sufficient progress" must be made on all three topics before the remaining 27 leaders will give the go-ahead for trade talks.:: Government wants no physical changes to Irish border arrangements Mr Varadkar told the British-Irish Council summit in Jersey he was "loath to comment in too much detail on papers that have been leaked to the media".He added: "When it comes to the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland, what we have all agreed to is that there shouldn't be a hard border, there should be no physical infrastructure along that border and that there should be no return to the borders of the past.Image: James Brokenshire says the UK will no longer be part of the single market "It is our view, and has been our view for a very long time, that the only way that can be achieved is if the United Kingdom as a whole, or Northern Ireland, continues to apply the rules of the customs union and the single market."That doesn't mean that they have to be members of it, but it would mean continuing to apply the rules of the single market and the customs union."That's the position that we hold and the best way to achieve our common objectives."Mr Brokenshire said Mrs May had been clear the UK will no longer be a member of the single market and the customs union when Britain leaves the EU in March 2019.Mr Varadkar added: "We are looking for a bespoke solution here that achieves the objective that we all share, which is no hard border, no return to the borders of the past and no physical infrastructure along that border."During another speech later on Friday, the first to his party since becoming Taoiseach, he vowed to safeguard the rights of border communities.He said he was certain Ireland will remain at the heart of Europe.
'Fund us fairly': Schools put pressure on Chancellor over cash:::::More than 4,000 headteachers have backed a letter to the Chancellor asking him not to cut school budgets.Teachers from primary, special and secondary schools from 25 different counties have joined a campaign concerned about the Government's new National Funding Formula.The formula is meant to make the allocation of school budgets fairer.But the Worth Less?campaign says it won't work.The group is led by headteacher Jules White, whose own school, Tanbridge House in West Sussex, is one of the country's lowest funded.Mr White admits his budget is so tight they've cut teachers and can't afford to properly use cleaners."Day to day it's desperate," he said.Image: The letter will be delivered to Number 11 ahead of the Budget "If I lose a teacher I can't afford to replace them.Our children most crucially are being disadvantaged as well.They're all going to sit the same GCSE yet they're in class sizes of 35, they don't get one-to-one support that they want."I'm really proud of the school, we're doing great, but think how well we could do if we were just funded adequately."Even under the new formula Mr White reckons his school won't receive enough extra money.He claims the Government's own figures highlight the imbalance.Under the new formula, in 2018-19 an average funded primary school in Devon will receive 407,200 less than the same size school in the London borough of Greenwich.An average secondary school in Oxford will get 4,050,200 less than the same size school in Hackney.That's the equivalent of 133 teachers.Image: Headteacher Jules White leads the Worth Less?campaign group We met year ten students during a maths lesson.They agreed the school's budget sums seem unfair.One pupil said: "It's very unexpected, when you're at school you just think that you're the same as everyone else.We just feel a bit less worth.Like we're worth less than all those other schools."Schools Minister Nick Gibb said: "The introduction of the National Funding Formula from 2018-19, backed by 1.3bn of additional investment, has been widely welcomed and will put an end to historic disparities in the system."There are no cuts in funding, every school will see an increase in funding through the formula from 2018."But many dispute the notion of additional investment.Mr White believes in real terms, schools' budgets are still being cut by 1.7bn.This is why on Tuesday representatives will deliver a letter to the Chancellor, Philip Hammond, ahead of this month's Budget.Video: Millions of families warned their schools are going 'bankrupt' Parents have been throwing their support behind the move too.Dad David Gabriel said he's worried the next generation will suffer."As class sizes grow then my son's education and all the kids' here and in West Sussex are going to have a substandard education," he said."And he is actually, in the Government's eyes, worth less than children in other parts of the country."Mr White says the support behind his campaign couldn't be stronger.As he prepares to head to Number 11 Downing Street he said the message is simple: "All we're asking is he funds us fairly."
Carl Sargeant's family criticise Carwyn Jones over inquiry 'independence':::::The family of Carl Sargeant has criticised Carwyn Jones' call for an independent inquiry to examine his own "actions and decisions" in the lead up to the death of his colleague.A spokesman for Wales' First Minister said he believed a senior QC should look into his handling of allegations against the former assembly member, who was found dead on Tuesday, but said it will not take place before an inquest.However, the family of Mr Sargeant, 49, said asking the Permanent Secretary to start preparations for a probe meant it would not be truly independent.In a statement they said: "The inquiry must be established by a body that is fully independent of Welsh Government."The Permanent Secretary reports directly to the First Minister and is therefore not independent.Image: Carwyn Jones said the inquiry would not take place before an inquest "We believe that a truly independent body must also be responsible for agreeing the terms of reference and appointing the chair and secretariat for the inquiry."Mr Sargeant is believed to have killed himself four days after being suspended from the Labour Party and removed from his role as cabinet secretary for communities and children following claims of "unwanted attention, inappropriate touching or groping".A spokesman for Mr Jones said: "Further to the First Minister's comments yesterday about the need for independent scrutiny of his actions and decisions in relation to Carl Sargeant, he agrees that there should be an independent inquiry and it would be proper to ask a senior QC to lead that work."To ensure this happens separately from his office, the First Minister has asked the Permanent Secretary to begin preparatory work for this inquiry."But Mr Sargeant's family said there were "serious failings" with the handling of the case.They also said a coroner's inquest would not be able to unveil the complete picture.Video: Wales FM under pressure over Sargeant death They said: "An independent inquiry will ask all the questions that need to be asked and have not been answered and will determine the reasons for the serious failings in following the correct procedures, practices and protocols, and the reasons for the complete abdication of responsibility and duty of care that was owed to Carl."It comes after former minister Leighton Andrews claimed Mr Jones knew his colleague was "fragile" before sacking him.He also spoke of a "toxic" atmosphere in government rife with "minor bullying, mind-games, power-games and favouritism".Friday's announcement comes following pressure from Welsh Tory leader Andrew Davies, who also called for an inquiry into the culture within government.
Bercow: 'Predictable' Westminster harassment scandal would lead to deaths:::::John Bercow has warned it was "predictable" that the Westminster harassment scandal would result in deaths, as he called for greater protection of those facing accusations.The House of Commons Speaker said the attitude toward MPs facing claims of sexual harassment is "analogous to the way we behave in relation to terrorists".He was speaking just days after the death of Welsh Government minister Carl Sargeant, who faced allegations of groping and is understood to have taken his own life.Asked about the death, HuffPost reported Mr Bercow saying: "In terms of protection of the frailties of the accused, I think that's incredibly important in light of what has happened in Wales, but it was predictable.Image: Carl Sargeant died after being sacked as a minister "Even if people are suspected of wrongdoing, they may well need, and should be given help, understanding and support."He added any under-fire politician may have "problems" in their personal life, and need "support" in "living with" or "managing" them."That is part of our responsibility," he said.Mr Bercow added that if MPs were sacked or suspended from the party whip then "for god's sake that member is entitled to know of what he or she is accused".Suspended Tory backbencher Charlie Elphike spoke out on the same day to reveal he still does not know what he has been accused of - despite being referred to police last Friday for "serious allegations".Image: Charlie Elphicke was suspended over allegations Mr Bercow claimed treatment of accused politicians was "a bit like our attitude to terrorists"."We have certain standards and, I hope, insist on upholding our standards."The fact a terrorist or would-be dictator doesn't care about human rights and is willing to slaughter innocent people in pursuit of his or her prejudices, doesn't mean we should operate in the same way."We believe in a fair trial.We believe innocent until proven guilty.We believe in due process."Image: Westminster has been gripped by a sleaze scandal He added the comparison was "on a different scale" but clarified: "The principle is we give people due process.We have an obligation behind it.It's absolutely unarguable."It comes after a former colleague of deceased Mr Sergeant said the Welsh First Minister knew he was "fragile" before sacking him from the Assembly's cabinet last week.Leighton Andrews told Newsnight Carwyn Jones was "worried about Carl's frame of mine".Mr Jones insisted he acted "by the book" and had "no alternative" but to take the action that he did against his "friend" of 14 years.
MP Kerry McCarthy says Kelvin Hopkins 'dreamt about her in upsetting letter':::::Kerry McCarthy says she suffered unwanted attention from fellow Labour MP Kelvin Hopkins spanning 20 years and found it "upsetting".The former shadow environment secretary is the first MP to make specific claims of inappropriate behaviour since the Westminster scandal erupted.Ms McCarthy said the Luton North MP sent her a series of letters and cards about her appearance, including one in which he described having a dream about her.But Mr Hopkins said Ms McCarthy's complaint had caused him "immense personal hurt and utter dismay" from someone he counted as a friend.Image: A card and note that Kelvin Hopkins allegedly sent to Kerry McCarthy He added: "I cannot understand why a Parliamentarian of such experience and standing, who is also such a long term friend, would not have told me that she was unhappy with any aspect of our friendship rather than going straight to the national press."At a minimum I would have expected a Parliamentary colleague to raise any complaint through normal channels, allowing me due process and a fair chance to defend myself, if necessary."Ms McCarthy said she decided to go public after activist Ava Etemadzadeh complained last week about the behaviour of Mr Hopkins.He was suspended by Labour after Ms Etemadzadeh contacted the party again with fresh information following an initial complaint over dealings with the MP in 2014 and 2015.Video: Jeremy Corbyn defends promotion of MP disciplined for alleged sexual harassment Mr Hopkins was reprimanded at the time by the-then chief whip Dame Rosie Winterton but was appointed shadow culture secretary in 2016.He "categorically denies" any inappropriate conduct in relation to Ms Etemadzadeh.Ms McCarthy, 52, first met Mr Hopkins, 76, when she was in her late 20s and they were both involved in Labour politics in her home town of Luton.In 1994, when she was chairwoman of Luton North constituency Labour Party (CLP) and he chaired Luton South CLP, they went out for lunch, with Ms McCarthy believing it was to discuss political issues.He later sent her a card saying he had invited her "because you are attractive, intelligent and charming" before urging her to "dispose" of the note, she said.Video: Labour suspend and investigate veteran MP Kelvin Hopkins over 'allegations' In a second note, Mr Hopkins enclosed a photo of Ms McCarthy and described her as "pretty" before again asking her to dispose of it, she claimed.He also sent a postcard, which appears to be dated 1996, in an envelope to her place of work, asking whether her employer specialised in "pretty, petite brunettes".Ms McCarthy said she went to another lunch with Mr Hopkins because she found it awkward to say no to the invitation.He sent a card afterwards suggesting it "would be nice to meet again".On another occasion, also believed to be in 1996, Ms McCarthy said Mr Hopkins placed his hand on hers when she was not looking as she was getting out of a car.A note sent in the run-up to the 1997 general election said: "You know I think you are lovely ... but I never see enough of you ... after May 1st perhaps ... K x."The letters then stopped until her 50th birthday, when Mr Hopkins sent a note on parliamentary writing paper to mark the occasion.By this time Ms McCarthy was an MP.A final letter was sent some time in 2015/16 but it is not clear if it was written after he was reprimanded for the incident involving Ms Etemadzadeh.In it, he described having a dream about Ms McCarthy and said she remained a "very attractive woman", according to Ms McCarthy.
Brexit day: Divorce will happen at 11pm to make separation 'crystal clear':::::Brexit will officially happen at 11pm on the day Article 50 runs out, the Government has signalled.The move means Britain's historic divorce will fall at midnight, Brussels time, on 29 March 2019.It will be officially enshrined in the EU Withdrawal Bill, after the Government announced it was amending the key legislation to make the issue "crystal clear".Brexit Secretary David Davis said the change was being made to "remove any confusion or concern about what 'exit day' means"."This important step demonstrates our pragmatic approach to the vital piece of legislation," he declared.Image: The Government wants to win over Brexit bill opponents It comes as the Government wades through hundreds of amendments to its key Brexit law, attempting to solve changes backed by some of its own MPs before letting it progress further through Parliament.Sky News understands ministers are doing so to acknowledge an opposition amendment and avert further hold-up of the crucial bill.But it is the only concession being offered at comimttee stage.Prime Minister Theresa May said she would not "tolerate" any attempts to use proposed alterations as a "mechanism" to "block" Brexit.But she admitted in an article for the Daily Telegraph: "As we seek to bring our country together, Members on all sides should come together in scrutinising this Bill.""That parliamentary process is important and I am clear that where MPs think they can improve the Bill, this Government will listen to them."Labour MP Frank Field tweeted that the Government had "accepted" the first of four of his amendments to make the Brexit Bill "slimline" and "Lords-proof".Video: May in September: Still some way to go on Brexit Sky's Robert Nisbet said: "This is the Government throwing some red meat to Brexit-supporting MPs on both sides of the house."It's the Government sounding tough with those who would frustrate the process: Britain is going to leave the EU, and even a little earlier than expected, taking the time difference into account."They'll be hoping that will placate the Brexiteers when the Government is expected to back down over several controversial measures in the bill, which have attracted hundreds of amendments."Those include using so-called 'Henry VIII' clauses to make changes to the bill without going back to Parliament.":: Why isn't the UK just getting on with Brexit?:: 350m promise must be honoured - NHS boss Prime Minister Theresa May had declared in her Brussels speech that Brexit would officially happen on 29 March 2019 - two years from the date when she triggered Article 50.But when her spokesman was asked earlier in the year for the exact divorce timing, they replied: "It's when Big Ben bongs at midnight" during the first second of 30 March 2019 in Europe.
Sturgeon's withering verdict on Alex Salmond's Russian TV show:::::Nicola Sturgeon has slapped down Alex Salmond for launching a talk show on state-funded Russian TV.The Scottish First Minister revealed she was not consulted about her predecessor's plan, but warned that if she had been: "I would have advised against RT."She was facing calls to speak out after Mr Salmond announced a weekly current affairs programme to air on RT, formerly known as Russia Today.Image: Drinks were in full flow at the launch party for Salmond's RT show The former SNP leader, who lost his seat at the 2017 General Election, had already faced anger and mockery from other politicians for the decision.An MSP from his own party reportedly asked "what the f*** is he thinking?", while the Conservative MP who unseated him from the Gordon constituency in June said the move "will suit his politics".Scottish Tories leader Ruth Davidson also accused him of "taking the Kremlin's rouble".Ms Sturgeon joined the fray in a statement on Friday, saying while she was sure the programme would be interesting viewing, "his choice of channel would not have been my choice".Image: Nicola Sturgeon refused to 'shy away' from criticising Russia She cautioned: "Of course, Alex is not currently an elected politician and is free to do as he wishes - but had I been asked, I would have advised against RT and suggested he seek a different channel to air what I am sure will be an entertaining show."Neither myself nor the SNP will shy away from criticising Russian policy when we believe it is merited."Mr Salmond has promised he will not bow to Russian editorial interference, saying he is simply making the show and selling it on to RT.He claims it is up to the broadcaster whether they run the shows or not."This programme will give people with something to say a platform to say it, and we intend to find out something about the personalities behind the public figures," Mr Salmond said.
Article 50 architect says Brexit can be reversed:::::The British people are in danger of being "misled" by Government claims that Brexit cannot be reversed, the architect of Article 50 will warn.Lord Kerr, the former UK ambassador to the European Union, will say during a speech in London later: "We can change our minds at any stage of the process."Lord Kerr played a key role in drafting Article 50, the legal mechanism for a country to withdraw from the EU.He will contradict the Government's view that the process is irreversible now that it has begun."We are not required to withdraw just because Mrs May sent her letter," the crossbench peer will say.Video: May: Concrete progress has been made on Brexit "The fact is that a political decision has been made, in this country, to maintain that there can be no going back."Actually, the country still has a free choice about whether to proceed.As new facts emerge, people are entitled to take a different view."And there's nothing in Article 50 to stop them."I think the British people have the right to know this - they should not be misled."Brexit Secretary David Davis and the EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier will meet in Brussels later on the second day of the latest round of talks before a crunch summit of European leaders next month.Before his meeting with the Brexit Secretary, Mr Barnier said the moment was approaching for a "real clarification" of Britain's position on issues like citizens' rights, the Irish border and the UK's financial settlement.Video: Brexit talks sealed with a kiss?If the EU27 agree next month that sufficient progress has been made on these issues, they will give a green light for negotiations to move on to the questions of trade and transition to a new post-Brexit negotiation.Mr Barnier said close economic ties would depend on a "level playing field" and questioned whether the UK intended to break away from the European model of standards and regulation.In a speech in Rome, he said: "Of course, the UK remains in Europe.But the British must tell us if they still adhere to the European model."Their answer is important because it will set the direction for the discussion of our future partnership and the conditions for its ratification."
Senate passes measure requiring sexual harassment training for senators, aides:::::"Everyone deserves to feel safe and comfortable at work, and the passage of this official Senate policy is an important measure to ensure thats the case in these halls," Sen. Amy Klobuchar, a lead sponsor of the legislation, said in a statement.| Andrew Harnik/AP Photo Senate passes measure requiring sexual harassment training for senators, aides The Senate unanimously approved legislation late Thursday that institutes mandatory sexual harassment training for senators and aides a potentially meaningful shift amid calls for overhauling Capitol Hill's system for handling harassment complaints.Bipartisan talks on a plan to require sexual harassment training, as first reported by POLITICO, began as current and former female lawmakers and aides publicly shared their stories of sexual harassment on the job in Congress.Awareness of workplace harassment on the Hill is spiking as sexual assault allegations shake the Hollywood establishment and Republicans grappled Thursday with a report that Alabama Senate nominee Roy Moore initiated a sexual encounter with a minor while in his 30s.Story Continued Below The legislation approved Thursday, co-sponsored by both Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), would require harassment training that also covers discrimination based on race, religion, disability and other criteria.Sexual and workplace harassment is a widespread problem that affects too many women and men in too many places, professions, and industries," Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), a lead sponsor of the legislation, said in a statement."Everyone deserves to feel safe and comfortable at work, and the passage of this official Senate policy is an important measure to ensure thats the case in these halls.One of the measure's co-sponsors, Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), said Wednesday that senators also discussed changing the current guidelines for handling Hill harassment complaints, but the version that ultimately passed did not go beyond requiring training that is now voluntary.Sign up here for POLITICO Huddle A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.You can unsubscribe at any time.More than 1,000 former congressional aides from the two parties have lent their voices to call for a bigger shakeup of the current protocol for handling congressional harassment cases, which requires victims to undergo mandatory counseling and mediation before filing a complaint.
Bradbury wins Collins vote amid debate over torture memos:::::Liberal groups have fought fiercely to derail Stephen Bradbury's nomination, citing his authorship of memos providing legal authorization for harsh treatment of prisoners suspected of terrorism.| Cliff Owen/AP Photo Bradbury wins Collins vote amid debate over torture memos Stephen Bradbury, who helped write the so-called torture memos endorsing brutal interrogation tactics under the George W. Bush administration, has locked up a key swing vote on his nomination to join the Trump administration.Human rights and other liberal groups have fought fiercely to derail Bradbury's nomination as general counsel of the Department of Transportation, citing his authorship of memos providing legal authorization for harsh treatment of prisoners suspected of terrorism.Story Continued Below But although Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) sent a strong signal this week that he would oppose Bradbury, another swing vote Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) said Thursday that she would back him in the Senate's vote next week."His role was not developing the policy," Collins told POLITICO, noting that she has "taken a close look at" Bradbury's background."His role was as an attorney within the Justice Department, and he's obviously not going to have anything to do with this issue at DOT."Bradbury, who wrote several legal memos approving the use of harsh interrogation tactics after joining the Bush administration's Department of Justice in 2005, saw his bid to become Bush's assistant attorney general in 2008 run aground amid opposition from Senate Democrats.Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.) has already placed a hold on his nomination to join the Trump administration.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) filed a procedural motion on Thursday that sets up a final confirmation vote on Bradbury next week.Sign up here for POLITICO Huddle A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.You can unsubscribe at any time.Activists working to derail the Bradbury nomination had viewed Collins as a potential "no" vote, given her support in 2014 for the public release of the Senate Intelligence Committee's report on brutal treatment, seen as tantamount to torture, that certain prisoners received while detained by the CIA.With Collins in the "yes" camp, however, human rights groups would have to peel off two more Republican opponents by next week in order to defeat the nomination.A spokesman for Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), a former Judge Advocate General in the Air Force, said Thursday he is leaning toward voting for Bradbury.The office of Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), seen as another potential swing vote, did not return a request for comment.Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), an Intelligence Committee member seen as a potential Bradbury supporter, remains undecided on the nomination, according to a spokesman.McCain appears solidly opposed, telling POLITICO on Wednesday that he would oppose "any nominee who in any way has supported the use of enhanced interrogation."The Arizona Republican this week opposed the nomination of Steven Engel, who reviewed a draft 2007 memo on enhanced interrogation, to the senior Department of Justice position for which Bradbury previously served in an acting capacity.McCain's comments gave some hope to human rights groups, who escalated their campaign to defeat Bradbury.Approving the DOT nominee "would send a terribly cruel message to the million-plus refugee torture survivors living in the United States, and the millions more across the globe," the leaders of the nonprofit Center for the Victims of Torture wrote in a Wednesday letter to senators."There must be accountability for those who champion repugnant and immoral misuses of government authority."
Republicans might be stuck with Roy Moore:::::GOP leaders desperately want Roy Moore off the ballot.But they have neither the legal nor the political leverage to force the defiant ex-judge out of the race.The White House, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and a host of other Republican senators called on Moore to drop out of the race Thursday if there were truth to the accounts of four women who told The Washington Post that Moore pursued relationships with them while they were teens and he was in his 30s.The news sent Republican operatives scrambling to parse the dusty sections of Alabama state law that deal with replacing candidates on the ballot.Story Continued Below But some absentee ballots have already been sent to voters, which appears to make it impossible to install someone in place of Moore on the Republican Party line.The election is on Dec. 12.Apart from the legal considerations, Moore owes no loyalty to Republican leaders in Washington, who backed another candidate in the primary and spent millions of super PAC dollars to defeat him while Moore won the nomination on an anti-McConnell platform.Moores campaign lashed out as condemnation rained upon him Thursday, calling the story a baseless political attack.Judge Roy Moore has endured the most outlandish attacks on any candidate in the modern political arena, but this story in todays Washington Post alleging sexual impropriety takes the cake, Moore campaign chairman Bill Armistead said in a statement.National liberal organizations know their chosen candidate Doug Jones is in a death spiral, and this is their last ditch Hail Mary.Sebastian Kitchen, a spokesman for Doug Jones, the Democratic candidate, said simply: "Roy Moore needs to answer these serious charges."Though Republicans have begun looking into options to replace Moore, Alabama law requires the candidate roster on the ballot to be set 74 days before an election.If Moore does withdraw, however, any votes cast for him would not count.Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) and other Republicans have suggested that GOP Sen. Luther Strange, the appointed senator who lost to Moore in the special primary, could put himself forward as a write-in candidate.State law bars a candidate who lost in a primary from appearing on the general election ballot as an independent, but it does not appear to forbid a write-in campaign.Of course its possible!said Murkowski, who lost her Republican primary in 2010 but won reelection as a write-in candidate, when asked about the feasibility of such a plan.White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, in a gaggle aboard Air Force One, said President Donald Trump believes that "if these allegations are true, Judge Moore will do the right thing and step aside."Through his press secretary, Vice President Pence echoed those remarks."The Vice President found the allegations in the story disturbing and believes, if true, this would disqualify anyone from serving in office," Alyssa Farah said.Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas) said senior Republicans are still examining what, if any, options they have ahead of the special election.Cornyn and a host of other congressional Republicans had recently endorsed Moore after his primary win, when Moore defeated Strange and a field of other Republicans in the race to complete Attorney General Jeff Sessions term in the Senate."This troubling news is so recent that people are trying to understand what hit us," Cornyn told reporters."I think people are trying to sort it out and figure out what the appropriate response is, including Sen.Strange."The Washington Post reported that Moore, then age 32, initiated a sexual encounter with a 14-year-old girl in 1979.The Post quoted the woman, Leigh Corfman, as well as three other women who said in multiple interviews that Moore pursued relationships with them while they were teenagers.Cornyn said Corfman's willingness to go on the record about the sexual contact does not yet prove Moore's guilt."If it is true, I don't think his candidacy is sustainable," Cornyn said."But we believe in a presumption of innocence until proven guilty.And so I think it's important for the facts to come out."Pressed by reporters on the further proof he would want to view the allegations against Moore as true, Cornyn added: "I'm interested in seeing what substantiation there is for the story."Morning Score newsletter Your guide to the permanent campaign weekday mornings, in your inbox.Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.You can unsubscribe at any time.Earlier in the day, White House legislative affairs director Marc Short said on CNN that "there's no path forward" for Moore if the allegations were true."But lets be cautious here of allegations that arise 38 years later and actually arise a month before Election Day," Short said."So I think we need to let the facts come out and find out what the truth is and go from there before we jump to conclusions."Short raised the possibility of legal action to get a new candidate in the race if Moore drops out."Remember that the president supported Luther Strange in that primary," Short said."I think whatll happen is that theres options for write-in candidates and theres also options for lawsuits I think will arise about [the] path forward.But I dont think we should begin going down that pathway until we give Roy Moore the chance to defend himself and defend his character.Other Senate Republicans had the same reaction as McConnell and Cornyn, with denunciations flying in swiftly but often with an if true caveat.If thats true, he doesnt belong in the Senate," said Sen. Richard Shelby, Alabamas senior senator."The allegations against Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore are deeply troubling," Sen. Cory Gardner, chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, said in a statement."If these allegations are found to be true, Roy Moore must drop out of the Alabama special Senate election."As Senate Republicans grappled with a politically challenging tax bill rollout, several sidestepped questions about Moore by noting that they have not yet delved into the details of the allegations against him.I have seen the headlines, but I have not had the opportunity to review the specifics, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), who endorsed Moore, told POLITICO.Sen. John Hoeven (R-N.D.) told reporters that obviously this is a real concern, but before I would comment further I have to see what the facts are.But Murkowski was unequivocal.Im horrified, and if this is true he needs to step down immediately, she told reporters.Alabama Gov.Kay Ivey, a Republican, called the story "deeply disturbing.""These allegations are deeply disturbing.I will hold judgment until we know the facts," Ivey said in a statement."The people of Alabama deserve to know the truth and will make their own decisions."Both Republicans and Democrats stepped around the one other scenario that would end the GOPs Moore problem: the chance that he could now lose the Senate race in deep-red Alabama.Moore faces a well-funded Democratic opponent, former U.S. attorney Doug Jones, but the Republican has led in most polling, and Alabama has not elected a Democratic senator in decades."I don't think it has anything to do with Doug Jones or the Doug Jones campaign," said Alabama-based Democratic pollster Zac McCrary."I don't think Doug Jones or the Doug Jones campaign has any relevance to this piece of this [race] for the next month.It's all about Roy Moore."
Senate GOPs tax bill points to nasty fight ahead:::::From left, Sen. Mitch McConnell, Sen. Orrin Hatch, Steven Mnuchin and Gary Cohn speak with reporters Thursday as work gets underway on the Senate's version of the GOP tax reform bill.| J. Scott Applewhite/AP Photo Senate GOPs tax bill points to nasty fight ahead There are dramatic differences between the House and Senate versions of the tax overhaul, imperiling Trump's desire to sign legislation by year end.Yawning divisions have emerged between the House, Senate and White House over tax reform, raising doubts about whether Republicans will be able to achieve their most important political and policy priority before the end of the year.The Senate and House are split on some key issues, including the top tax rate and the timing of the corporate tax cut, and also at odds with President Donald Trump in many areas.Hard bargaining, battles between GOP factions and an onslaught of lobbying are the gauntlets Republicans will have to run to get legislation to Trump's desk by the end of the year and into their mailers and ads for the 2018 elections.Story Continued Below If one thing unifies Republicans and makes the job easier than it might appear, it's the fear that they will have nothing to take into those contests after the failure of another marquee effort, repealing and replacing Obamacare.House Speaker Paul Ryan and other GOP leaders used the drubbing the party took in Tuesday's election in Virginia as a warning to the rank and file: Pass tax reform or face the wrath of Republican voters."We are going to conference," Ryan told reporters Thursday, after the Senate unveiled its long-awaited plan and House tax writers advanced theirs to the House floor."Yes, the Senate bill is going to be different than the House bill because that's the legislative process."The House Ways and Means Committee approved its bill on a party-line 24-16 vote, and House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy said the full House would vote on it next week.The Senate Finance Committee will start working on its bill next week, maybe as early as Monday.The most reliable politics newsletter.Sign up for POLITICO Playbook and get the latest news, every morning in your inbox.Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.You can unsubscribe at any time.One of the first differences to emerge was the Senate's plan to delay slashing the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent until 2019.The House wants to cut the tax immediately, and has the White House on its side.Cutting the corporate rate is the centerpiece of the GOP plan to lower tax rates and spur faster economic growth.But the Senate is trying to limit the revenue impact to allow a bill to pass with just 51 votes and avoid a possible Democratic filibuster.In another break with Trump, neither the Senate bill or the House bill includes a repeal of the Obamacare individual mandate requiring Americans to have health insurance.But Senate Republicans are still considering a repeal to help cover the cost of making some tax cuts permanent.GOP leaders are talking with rank-and-file members to assess whether they have the necessary 50 votes to scrap the least popular part of Obamacare."I'd sure like to do that," said Sen. Roger Wicker (R-Miss.)"I think we're counting votes.It sure gives us a lot more flexibility."Trump has pushed for repealing the mandate, along with conservative senators and House members.But many lawmakers said reopening the health care debate would just make passing the tax bill harder.The Senate plan would set a top individual tax rate of 38.5 percent, compared to the House's 39.6 percent for annual income above $1 million, and keep deductions for people with high medical bills and for student loan interest that the House wants to discard.It would completely eliminate a federal deduction for state and local taxes, while the House had to mollify a group of GOP lawmakers from high-tax blue states by keeping the deduction for property taxes, up to $10,000.The Senate kept the maximum mortgage deduction at the interest on loans up to $1 million.The House would cut it to $500,000.The House targeted the estate tax a favorite foil of conservative Republicans for elimination in 2025, after doubling the current exemptions to about $11 million for individuals and $22 million for married couples.The Senate is proposing only to double the exemptions.The House proposed expanding the child tax credit to $1,600 per child from $1,000.The Senate set the increase at $1,650.But that is still too low for some senators who want a $2,000-per-child credit because they worry some middle-income people could otherwise see their taxes go up under the plan and they have an ally in Ivanka Trump."While we are glad to see an increase to the child tax credit, like the House bill, it is simply not enough for working families," Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and Mike Lee (R-Utah), the main champions of the issue in the Senate, said in a joint statement.On another hot-button issue, the treatment of "pass-through" businesses that pay individual tax rates, the Senate would set a top rate of 30 percent, while owners of those businesses have been clamoring for parity with corporations.The House is offering a super-low 9 percent rate on the first $75,000 those businesses earn, which attracted praise from the powerful National Federation of Independent Business, which had panned the House bill last week.Both bills would shift the U.S. to a "territorial" tax system that would largely shield offshore corporate income from U.S. taxation.But they parted ways on a mechanism to discourage more companies from moving abroad to take advantage of the change.As the first details were trickling out about the Senate plan, Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady (R-Texas) unveiled a new round of changes to the House GOP's plan.Their tax plan had ballooned beyond their budget, allowing them to cut taxes by no more than $1.5 trillion, after Republicans earlier this week gutted a plan to crack down on international tax avoidance hated by the Koch brothers and a number of multinational corporations.The revisions include hundreds of billions of dollars in new revenue aimed at filling that budget hole.Republicans did it in part by taking back much of the money $87 billion they had lost when they watered down those overseas tax avoidance provisions.Another $70 billion would come from charging companies more in a one-time tax on their overseas earnings.Under the new plan, they'd pay 14 percent on their liquid assets and 7 percent on illiquid ones like factories overseas.That's up from 12 percent and 5 percent, respectively, under the previous proposal.House lawmakers want to raise another $20 billion by requiring people claiming the popular child tax credit to provide a Social Security number for their child, a provision long sought by Republicans aimed at preventing undocumented immigrants from taking the break.Delaying their plans to repeal the estate tax by another year saved them $21.5 billion.They'd raise another $109 billion from companies tapping a long-standing break for research and development expenses.Other House provisions would expand a tax on private university endowments and impose a surtax on life insurance companies.The plan also would allow organizations such as charities and churches to engage in political speech without risking their tax-exempt status, and it restored a tax break for adopting children that had been on the chopping block.Senate Finance Committee aides said the panel was still working to make its bill compliant with the chamber's budget rules, which don't allow the tax bill to add to deficits outside the 10-year budget window.Given the GOP's slim majority in the Senate and the danger of a repeat of their Obamacare fiasco, some House Republicans were resigned to more or less having to defer to the Senate."I look at it more as a priority of process and procedure over substance," said Rep. Dennis Ross (R-Fla.)."While there are some very good things, don't get me wrong, substantively in our bill, I think the canvas will probably be painted in its final stage in the Senate once we give them the vehicle."Ben White, Josh Dawsey, Colin Wilhelm, Seung Min Kim, Elana Schor and Jennifer Haberkorn contributed to this report.
Goodlatte to retire after 2018:::::Rep. Bob Goodlatte's district has long been a safe seat for Republicans.| Drew Angerer/Getty Images Goodlatte to retire after 2018 Rep. Bob Goodlatte, the term-limited chairman of the powerful House Judiciary Committee, said on Thursday that he will not seek reelection in 2018.With my time as Chairman of the Judiciary Committee ending in December 2018, this is a natural stepping-off point and an opportunity to begin a new chapter of my career and spend more time with my family, particularly my granddaughters, the Virginia Republican said in a statement.Story Continued Below Goodlatte, a 13-term incumbent, is the latest in a string of Republicans opting against running for reelection.In the last week, three Texas congressman Jeb Hensarling, Ted Poe and Lamar Smith also left safely conservative seats behind.Hensarling and Smith were also term-limited as committee chairmen.As recently as July, Goodlattes staff sought to squash rumors that the 65-year-old congressman planned to retire.Goodlattes decision opens a Republican-leaning seat, nestled in the Shenandoah Valley, which backed President Donald Trump by a 24-point margin.
Ex-ethics chief Shaub asks Congress to strengthen oversight office:::::Walter Shaub announced his resignation as head of OGE in July, telling The New York Times that there wasnt much he could do at OGE anymore.| J. Scott Applewhite/AP Ex-ethics chief Shaub asks Congress to strengthen oversight office Walter Shaub said he felt almost powerless as head of the Office of Government Ethics to serve as a check on President Donald Trumps administration, but he's pushing Congress to empower his successors.Shaub, now the senior director for ethics at the nonpartisan Campaign Legal Center, sent a letter to House Oversight Committee Chairman Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) and ranking member Elijah Cummings (D-Md.)and met with them Thursday morning to recommend more than a dozen legislative proposals to strengthen OGE.Story Continued Below My goal was specifically, and I emphasized this to the congressmen, was to find some reasonable, noncontroversial middle-of-the-road proposals that would definitely have some discernible impact, Shaub told POLITICO in an interview Thursday.Nothing in here is designed to focus on the current president or embarrass him.Instead, it focuses on logical things that would be good regardless of whos president next.Shaub said that before he voluntarily left office in July, he felt vulnerable raising questions about Trump's appointees' financial arrangements and pushing back on what he viewed as conflicts of interest for an administration full of wealthy business executives.He reported to the president and was required to go through White House budget director Mick Mulvaneys office to communicate with Congress.The most reliable politics newsletter.Sign up for POLITICO Playbook and get the latest news, every morning in your inbox.Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.You can unsubscribe at any time.Shaub joined the Campaign Legal Center this summer to pursue reforms to strengthen OGE.The White House has dismissed many of his criticisms and said he politicized the agency as its leader.Shaub's recommendations on Thursday include insulating the OGE director from retaliation by establishing new procedural or substantive requirements for removal and authorizing OGE to communicate with Congress on issues ranging from its budget and legislative proposals to its oversight of the executive branch ethics program.He includes 30 pages of proposals.To improve oversight, Shaub suggests allowing the OGE director to stay in office for up to a year beyond the terms expiration or until replaced.He said the post has been vacant for more than five years over the last 14, but carryover authority would enhance the continuity of OGEs operations following the end of a directors term.He also proposes amending the Ethics in Government Act to clarify that OGE oversees the entire executive branch ethics program, a change he said would only require replacing references to executive agency with executive branch in sections 402 and 403.Shaub also recommends strengthening OGEs ability to collect ethics information and records and establishing an inspector general with regular jurisdiction over small agencies and limited special jurisdiction to conduct ethics investigations throughout the executive branch.For the sake of transparency, Shaub proposes requiring OGE and agency ethics officials to post public records online, including unclassified reports of senior official travel on government aircraft and requiring the agency to collect and post written plans for how candidates would prepare for a Presidential transition and resolve their conflicts of interest.Shaubs recommendations for substantive ethics requirements include ending the use of special government employees for more than 130 days by automatically designating such a person as a regular employee on the 131st day of work and barring political appointees from working on particular matters affecting employers who make discretionary payments to them.His letter notably makes no mention of Trump.He told POLITICO hes focused on improving the process going forward, not relitigating the past, though he still believes Trump should address his conflicts of interest.Asked whether the lawmakers expressed any concern that a more powerful OGE could clash with the House Oversight Committee, Shaub said: It does the opposite.It harmonizes it.As to whether a Republican-controlled Congress would consider his proposals, Shaub wouldnt speculate.The legislative process is long and messy, he said.I dont think I can make any predictions.

Paul was vigorously assaulted by someone in his neighborhood.This is a serious criminal matter involving serious injury, and is being handled by local and federal authorities.As to reports of a longstanding dispute with the attacker, the Pauls have had no conversations with him in many years," Doug Stafford said in a statement."The first 'conversation' with the attacker came after Sen. Paul's ribs were broken.This was not a 'fight,' it was a blindside, violent attack by a disturbed person.Anyone claiming otherwise is simply uninformed or seeking media attention."Story Continued Below Paul was attacked last week at his Bowling Green, Kentucky, home.Pauls attacker, his neighbor, 59-year-old retired doctor Rene Boucher, allegedly tackled the senator as he was mowing his lawn and has been charged with misdemeanor assault.The Courier-Journal, Louisvilles newspaper, reported earlier this week that the two men had feuded regularly over landscaping issues.But Paul (R-Ky.) appeared to dispute that notion with a pair of posts to Twitter on Wednesday, linking to a Breitbart News story headlined Rand Pauls neighbors say reports blaming savage assault on landscaping dispute are fake news and one from The Washington Examiner headlined Rand Paul's neighbors rip media 'landscaping dispute' reports.In its report, the Examiner said Bouchers social media accounts were peppered with posts critical of President Donald Trump and of Republicans, although it stopped short of suggesting that the attack was politically motivated.Boucher, charged with fourth-degree assault, entered a not guilty plea during his arraignment in court in Bowling Green on Thursday, according to The Associated Press.The charges were unchanged.Sign up here for POLITICO Huddle A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.You can unsubscribe at any time.On Wednesday, Paul had offered an update on his condition, telling his Twitter followers that he had six broken ribs and pleural effusion, a buildup of fluid between the chest and the lungs.Kelley and I appreciate the overwhelming support after Fridays unfortunate event.Thank you for your thoughts and prayers, Paul (R-Ky.) wrote on Twitter.I appreciate all of the support from everyone.A medical update: final report indicates six broken ribs & new X-ray shows a pleural effusion.Cristiano Lima contributed to this report.
Democrats emboldened after elections  but still wary of shutdown talk:::::Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) told reporters Wednesday that staff-level funding talks among leaders in both parties have been going along quite well."| Andrew Harnik/AP Photo Democrats emboldened after elections but still wary of shutdown talk Leadership wants to get a deal done for Dreamers, but is wary of promoting brinkmanship ahead of government funding negotiations.There are two words never to be uttered in the Democratic Caucus: government shutdown.Thats true even after Democrats were emboldened by their sweeping election victories this week.Story Continued Below Democratic leaders are preaching caution to their caucus as they head into year-end funding negotiations with increased political momentum, even as the partys left flank vows to withhold votes from any must-pass spending bill without a legislative fix for Dreamers.Courting a shutdown over young undocumented immigrants risks playing into the GOPs hands with final funding talks still weeks away, senior Democrats warn.It has always been the Republicans who shut the government down, Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) said in an interview.Weve got to fix DACA, weve got to do a lot of things but shutting down the government of this country is not a leverage point.President Donald Trump has threatened to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.Democrats know Republicans will almost certainly need their votes in the House and Senate to pass a spending bill when current funding runs out Dec. 8.But Democratic leaders fear that staking out a hard-line position now threatening to withhold votes if certain conditions arent met on an issue as divisive as immigration might only unite Republicans around a much more conservative bill.And Democrats keenly remember the blowback faced by Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and other conservatives who forced a shutdown in 2013 over repealing Obamacare.Democrats are particularly wary of being seen as obstructionists with the midterms less than a year away and the House and maybe even the Senate on the line.The most reliable politics newsletter.Sign up for POLITICO Playbook and get the latest news, every morning in your inbox.Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.You can unsubscribe at any time.Still, that hasnt stopped some in the minority from drawing a line in the sand now.Four liberal Senate Democrats weighing a challenge to Trump in 2020 have already declared theyll vote against any funding bill that doesnt include protections for undocumented immigrants enrolled in the DACA program.More than two dozen House Democrats similarly used a Wednesday op-ed piece to vow they would oppose any year-end deal that doesnt address Dreamers.Congressional Hispanic Caucus Chairwoman Michelle Lujan Grisham (D-N.M.) and members of House Democratic leadership notably did not sign the opinion piece.Lujan Grisham told POLITICO she supports the overall idea Im not going home for the holidays without a Dreamer fix, she said but didnt sign on because of the timing of the op-ed and the language used.House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has privately cautioned against using the words government shutdown, and, so far, most members, even those publicly vowing to withhold their votes, are falling in line.Aside from the public relations nightmare of being deemed responsible if the government were actually to shut down, Democratic leaders see the strategy as a last resort.Its not that they wont withhold votes for a funding deal if needed, aides say.But they think telegraphing that publicly to Republicans right now does them no good.Even Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), one of the prominent liberals who last week promised to oppose any funding bill that doesn't include help for Dreamers, made clear Wednesday that his statement wasnt designed to bring fellow Democrats closer to a shutdown standoff.Protections for Dreamers should be at the top of our priority list, Booker said in an interview, but I would not put it into this idea of shutting down the government.Thats something that Republicans do and have done.Republicans, meanwhile, remain divided about how to handle Dreamers at risk for deportation as soon as March if Trump follows through with plans to end the DACA program.Conservatives have largely put demands for a border wall on the back burner but are likely to call for other changes that are equally unacceptable to Democrats, including proposals to mandate a worker verification system known as E-Verify and reduce chain migration.Further complicating talks, Trump told GOP senators last week he doesnt support a DACA fix in a year-end spending bill after agreeing to that with Democratic leaders in September.Even so, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) told reporters Wednesday that staff-level funding talks among leaders in both parties have been going along quite well, and were before this election, and I think will continue to.While Trump has pushed publicly for a down payment on the border wall as part of the next government spending package, Schumer declared that there is very little enthusiasm for the wall on both sides of the aisle.Despite Schumers optimism, top appropriators now think negotiations over a long-term spending bill could go weeks if not months past the current December deadline.As Republicans dig in on taxes, discussions about topline funding levels have fallen weeks behind schedule, and negotiators on both sides think theyll need a stopgap extension in December.Democrats say they have leverage now more than ever after decisive victories up and down the ticket in races across the country Tuesday night.Democrats are using the wins to implore vulnerable Republicans to join them in pressuring GOP leaders to begin negotiations in earnest on a Dreamer deal.Yesterday we heard something very clear: Trump and Trumpism is a loser, Rep. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.) told reporters Wednesday.If you are a Republican and you are in a swing district and you want to have any fighting chance next year, join us in helping us pass the DREAM Act.Washington Sen. Patty Murray, No.3 in Democratic leadership, noted that the funding bill doesnt necessarily have to be the vehicle for a deal that helps Dreamers.Theres a number of ways to get it done between now and the end of the year, Murray said in a brief interview, and we expect [Republicans] to do it.Republicans close to the spending process are eyeing a monthslong extension, possibly into February, but Democrats have said theyll agree to a one-week stopgap in December at most.Defense hawks, both in Congress and the administration, have strongly warned against any stopgap spending bill that goes past December, which they say would be detrimental for military operations planning.Sarah Ferris contributed to this report.
GOP election drubbing scrambles tax reform outlook:::::Virginia Republican Rep. Barbara Comstock (pictured) was named checked by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer as a Republican who could be in trouble in 2018.| J. Scott Applewhite/AP Photo GOP election drubbing scrambles tax reform outlook Will the results stiffen the spines of undecided lawmakers or cause them to flee from a Trump-sanctioned tax plan?Top Republicans in Congress had an urgent message to lawmakers after the partys drubbing in Tuesdays elections: Pass tax reform or were toast in 2018.I think it simply means weve got to deliver, Speaker Paul Ryan said Wednesday.Story Continued Below And given the partys epic collapse on repealing Obamacare earlier this year, theres a pervasive anxiety among lawmakers that theyd better do something big before voters sour on them for good.Oh yeah.If we face-plant on health care and taxes, said Rep. Dave Brat (R-Va.), I dont want to see it.But amid the exhortations to be productive and notch a win, theres a creeping concern that vulnerable House Republicans might also take another lesson from Tuesdays Democratic romp: tying yourself too closely to a Trump-branded tax reform bill that ends popular tax breaks could be an unpalatable risk.No Republicans specifically cited the election results as a factor in their thinking on tax reform during the day Wednesday.But Democrats spent the day ratcheting up pressure on Republicans whose districts include many of the people who might lose tax benefits, such as state and local tax deductions, mortgage interest credits and more.It should be a giant stop sign for their tax bill, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said.If you continue to try and eliminate the state and local [tax] deduction, you are going to kill suburban legislators because the suburbs dont seem to like Donald Trump.The most reliable politics newsletter.Sign up for POLITICO Playbook and get the latest news, every morning in your inbox.Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.You can unsubscribe at any time.Its those suburban House districts that Democrats are hoping to capture to propel them back to the House majority next year.Schumer name-checked Rep. Barbara Comstock (R-Va.), whose district went heavily Democratic in Tuesdays gubernatorial election, and noted that nearly half of her districts residents get a popular state and local tax deduction that is marked to be slashed or eliminated in pending GOP tax proposals.Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) sent up an early flare this week when he publicly declared himself a no on tax reform without changes.Tax reform should lower taxes for all Americans, regardless where they live, he tweeted Tuesday.Two New York Republicans, Reps. Lee Zeldin and Peter King, have also opposed the current versions of the House GOP tax reform plan.Most Republicans, though, aligned with their partys leaders on the meaning of Tuesdays elections, emphasizing the need to pass a big-ticket legislative priority and soon to counter the perception of Congress futility.It clearly is a do-or-die moment in my view in terms of holding the majority, said Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.).It doesnt guarantee you success, but its a precondition for success.Rep. Tom Reed (R-N.Y.), who backs the tax plan, said he views the election results as a motivating force for Republicans to pass tax reform.What I saw was more of a frustration with not getting something done, Reed said.He questioned the notion that vulnerable Republicans might back away from controversial legislation like the GOP tax bill as inside-the-D.C. Beltway political theater.I think the lesson is, lets get some things done, said Sen.Rob Portman (R-Ohio).I think what people want, whether theyre Republicans or Democrats, is to see progress here in Washington and I think thats some of the frustration, certainly among people who didnt show up to vote and some who did show up to vote."Still, a broader anxiety in the GOP ranks was palpable a day after they watched dozens of veteran Republicans in statehouses and local governments booted from office.And it had some lawmakers calling for some introspection from their party leader, President Donald Trump.I do believe it was a referendum on the president, said Rep. Scott Taylor (R-Va.), whose district narrowly voted for Democrat Ralph Northam in the Virginia governor's race.Some people, starting at the top because thats what leadership does we need some self-reflection in our own party, our own rhetoric.I think that the divisive rhetoric absolutely contributed to stoking emotions, which helped draw turnout, he said.Other Republicans similarly pointed to Trumps ability to stoke controversy and draw out his opponents as a driver behind Tuesdays losses.And thats a perilous dynamic as vulnerable Republicans in the House consider whether to tie themselves to Trumps top legislative priority, a rewrite of the nations tax code thats already packed with provisions that Democrats are painting as a giveaway to the rich or a burden to middle income families.Cole emphasized that the bill is still being changed and that some of the pieces that may be political headaches could be adjusted to make them more palatable to undecided members.This bills not coming down from Mount Sinai on stone tablets, he said.A lot of these things tend to get worked out during the course of the legislative process.But Cole added individual provisions arent likely to dictate whether the bill is popular or not.In the end, he said.I think its the mega impact.Unlike the House, where two dozen Republicans will be defending turf won by Hillary Clinton last year, Senate Republicans face a different calculus.Instead of stemming a surge of anti-Trump fervor in suburban areas, GOP senators are mostly on offense in conservative territory next November.Ten Senate Democrats are running for reelection in states Trump won last year, including five in deeply red states such as North Dakota and West Virginia.Because of their vastly different map, Senate Republicans werent too concerned at least publicly about the GOP rout on Tuesday spreading to their battle to keep their narrow majority.It means people want us to get things done, South Dakota Sen. John Thune, the third-ranking Senate Republican, said of the election outcome.I think people want results and we got to start delivering results or were going to have more election results like that.Senate Republicans on Thursday will unveil their long-awaited tax plan.They can lose only two Republican votes, assuming all Democrats line up against the bill.Leaders will have to balance demands from influential moderates, deficit hawks and conservatives in cobbling together 50 votes.Passing a tax plan that spurs the economy and helps middle-class families, said Sen.

Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV) said of the sexual harassment policy she is working on with her colleagues.| Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Top senators crafting plan to strengthen sexual harassment protections Two GOP senators are working with a senior Democrat on a bipartisan proposal to update the chamber's sexual harassment policy, with buy-in from Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.).The resolution is being crafted by both parties' leaders on the Senate Rules Committee and would go beyond requiring sexual harassment training, which a bipartisan group of senators proposed earlier this week, Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) said Wednesday.Capito, a member of the Rules panel, is working on the harassment measure with committee chairman Sen. Richard Shelby (R-Ala.) and top Democrat Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota.Story Continued Below The forthcoming harassment resolution "has a lot of the elements" in the training measure that Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) introduced, while also touching on "some of the protocols, some of the measures that should move forward if you have an issue with sexual harassment," Capito said in an interview."It goes a little further but it's a little tighter in terms of how the rules would change to meet the demands of where we are now," Capito added.Negotiators are aiming to win the support of all Rules Committee members, she said, and McConnell "is fully on board."Sign up here for POLITICO Huddle A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.You can unsubscribe at any time.Shelby said in an interview that he and the majority leader thought tapping Klobuchar and Capito to take a leading role on harassment legislation, as two female senators from both sides of the aisle, would provide valuable perspective.Klobuchar is expected to take the lead on the legislation when it's formally introduced, Senate sources said.Calls for reform of the system for handling congressional harassment complaints have grown as current and former female lawmakers as well as aides share their stories of workplace harassment while serving on Capitol Hill.Current rules require victims of alleged harassment on the Hill to undergo mandatory counseling and mediation before filing a complaint a waiting period that can last months and, critics say, deter congressional employees from reporting problems in their offices.A letter organized by former congressional aides urging House and Senate leaders in both parties to revamp sexual harassment policy has attracted more than 1,000 signatures as of late Wednesday.
Red state lawmakers find blue state piggy bank:::::Red states are using blue states as their new piggy bank in the GOP Congress.On big legislative issues such as tax reform and ObamaCare repeal, Republicans in the Senate have sought to redistribute federal funds from New York, New Jersey and other blue states dominated by Democrats to the red states in the South, Midwest and Great Plains that are mostly represented by the GOP.The most recent example is a GOP tax plan that would limit local and state sales, income and property tax deductions which would hurt suburban taxpayers in blue states with high property taxes.ADVERTISEMENT Republicans are doing away with the deduction because they need to lower the cost of their tax bill, which reduces the corporate tax rate to 20 percent.It just so happens that the major deduction getting the axe delivers big benefits to blue-state taxpayers.I think my observation would be yes, House Democratic Caucus Chairman Joe Crowley Joseph (Joe) CrowleyRed state lawmakers find blue state piggy bank Live coverage: Day two of the Ways and Means GOP tax bill markup Dem rep: Trump has underestimated Americans MORE (D-N.Y.) said in response to a question about whether he thought Republicans were targeting blue states.It is unfortunately a further attempt to divide America when we should be trying to bring it together.The president is dividing America.The Republican Congress and the Ryan-McConnell tax scam bill is going to further divide America if enacted, he added, referring to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Addison (Mitch) Mitchell McConnellMcConnell expects Paul to return to Senate next week Former Hill staff calls for mandatory harassment training Gaming the odds of any GOP tax bill getting signed into law MORE (R-Ky.) and Speaker of the House Paul Ryan Paul RyanGOP rep: Virginia defeat 'a referendum' on Trump administration After Texas shooting, lawmakers question whether military has systemic reporting problem Pence: Praying 'takes nothing away' from trying to figure out causes behind mass shooting MORE (R-Wis.).While the House bill preserves a maximum $10,000 property tax deduction, the Senate tax bill would go even further by completely eliminating the deduction.The more stringent Senate bill reflects a political reality: There are no Republican senators from the states of California, New York and New Jersey, while in the House, blue-state Republicans won a concession.Six states claim more than half of the value of the deduction nationwide, according to the Tax Foundation, and four voted for Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonGOP rushes to cut ties to Moore Papadopoulos was in regular contact with Stephen Miller, helped edit Trump speech: report Bannon jokes Clinton got her ass kicked in 2016 election MORE in last years presidential election: California, New York, New Jersey and Illinois.Republicans whose districts would be hurt by the elimination of the tax deduction have been vocal in opposing it.I look at the idea of eliminating the state and local tax deduction as a geographic redistribution of wealth because youre taking money from a place like New York to provide deeper tax cuts elsewhere, Rep. Lee Zeldin (R-N.Y.), one of a handful of GOP opponents to the House bill, said on Fox News last week.A few other Republicans have questioned the wisdom of the strategy, even if their own states might not be hurt by the changes.There are some taxpayers who are losing exemptions, particularly in high-tax states like New York or California, that could conceivably be paying higher taxes.I think thats a mistake, Sen.

Rand Paul Randal (Rand) Howard PaulGOP senator asks to be taken off Moore fundraising appeals Red state lawmakers find blue state piggy bank Prosecutors tell Paul to expect federal charges against attacker: report MORE (Ky.) said in September, adding that its a game of Republicans sticking it to Democrats.Elections have consequences, and its hardly unusual for a Republican government to enact policies that deliver benefits to their constituents.Dan Holler, vice president of Heritage Action for America, a conservative advocacy group in Washington, D.C., said sometimes policies disproportionately hurt states because Republicans and Democrats have different views of government.It's not surprising that those come in conflict with state policies that are run by the opposing party, he said.To the extent any of these blue states rely more heavily on certain facets of current law, then I guess I understand why those blue states feel this way.They built their model of government around the federal code, but bad provisions of the federal code.He also noted the Obama administration's policies on coal that had a negative impact on red states like West Virginia.The Obama administration's crusades to get rid of fossil fuels had a massive impact on red states.I don't think they were trying to punish red states.They were just trying to get rid of fossil fuel usage.The impact on that was disproportionate on red states, he said.Jacob Leibenluft, a senior adviser with the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said the GOP tactics have a political logic.The ideological argument Republicans have against Medicaid and Medicaid expansion, that Republicans have against [the state and local tax deduction] they can marry that ideological argument with policies that are going to disproportionately hurt states more represented by Democrats than Republicans, he said, But the confluence of the health-care and tax bills strike some observers as being something new.It feels to me like it's a new strategy, certainly at the national level.I cant think of previous reform efforts that had such a wide distributional effect across the states, said Topher Spiro, the vice president for health policy and a senior fellow for economic policy at the liberal-leaning Center for American Progress in D.C.
Alabama state rep: Moores accusers should be prosecuted:::::An Alabama GOP state representative said Friday that he thinks legal action should be taken against the women who accused Roy Moore of sexual misconduct with a minor.State Rep. Ed Henry told The Cullman Times that he is not buying the Washington Post report, which was published with accounts from four women and backed up by 30 sources.The report accused Moore of kissing and sexually touching a 14-year-old girl when he was 32.ADVERTISEMENT If they believe this man is predatory, they are guilty of allowing him to exist for 40 years, Henry said.I think someone should prosecute and go after them.You cant be a victim 40 years later, in my opinion.Moore responded to the allegations by calling them fake news and saying that he would soldier on, despite calls from GOP senators for him to drop out of the race.Moore is the favorite to win Attorney General Jeff Sessions Jefferson (Jeff) Beauregard SessionsCurtis wins Chaffetz's former Utah House seat Overnight Cybersecurity: What we learned from Carter Page's House Intel testimony | House to mark up foreign intel reform law | FBI can't access Texas shooter's phone | Sessions to testify at hearing amid Russia scrutiny FBI cant unlock Texas shooters phone MOREs Senate seat, going up against Democratic challenger Doug Jones.The idea that accusations like this would stop his campaign is ludicrous, Henry said.You cannot tell me there hasnt been an opportunity through the years to make these accusations with as many times as hes run and been in the news.
Mueller investigation involves member of Congress for the first time: report:::::Special counsel Robert Mueller's team is investigating a meeting between President Trump's former national security adviser Michael Flynn and Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Calif.), who has expressed pro-Russia views on a number of policies, according to NBC News.Mueller's team is reportedly looking at emails sent from Flynn's lobbying group to Rohrabacher thanking the congressman for his role in the meeting.ADVERTISEMENT NBC reports the meeting between Flynn and the congressman took place in Washington, D.C., on Sept. 20, 2016, while Flynn was working as an adviser to the Trump campaign.The meeting was reportedly organized by Flynn's lobbying group the Flynn Intel Group, and was also attended by Flynn's son Michael G. Flynn, as well as his business partners Bijan Kian and Brian McCauley.The congressman discussed U.S. sanctions against Russia in response to human rights abuses with Veselnitskaya.Veselnitskaya lobbied against the punitive measure, known as the Magnitsky Act.Flynn and his son are currently under investigation in Mueller's probe into alleged ties between the Trump campaign and Russian election meddling.Updated at 1:51 p.m.

Ben Ray Lujn (D-N.M.), chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, released a strategy memo on Thursday announcing that the national party had expanded its list of targeted House seats from 80 Republican-held districts to 91 in the wake of Tuesdays elections.Democrats need to flip 24 seats to win back the majority in the House.Lujn cited the rapid pace of GOP retirements in his memo.He pointed to a Sabatos Crystal Ball study that found the presidents party has historically shed 22 points in races for open seats that take place in midterm years.In general, eliminating the power of incumbency creates a great deal of advantage for House Democratic challengers, Lujn wrote.The DCCC outraised the National Republican Congressional Committee by $9 million in the most recent quarter, although the NRCC still has about $12 million more in cash on hand.But perhaps the most startling fundraising trend was uncovered by a Brookings Institution study.Analyst Michael Malbin found that nearly 100 Democrats running in GOP-held districts in 2018 had already raised at least $50,000.The last comparable election cycle was the 2010 GOP wave election, when 60 Republicans running in Democrat-held district had raised the same amount at this point.House GOP leaders arent publicly panicking over retirements just yet.Its a lot of good talent that were going to lose.Its tough, Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.), the GOPs chief vote-counter, told The Hill.But he joked: I told [retiring colleagues] to stop talking to one another because somebody else might want to join them.The sad thing is they start smiling more and more after they make the announcement.We just have to tamp that down.National Republicans say the retirements are being overplayed, noting that theyre happening for a variety of reasons.Goodlatte, Poe and Rep.

Monopoly critics decry Amazon amendment:::::Lawmakers put the finishing touches this week on military funding legislation that contains a provision that stands to significantly benefit Amazon.The amendment, Section 801 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), would help Amazon establish a tight grip on the lucrative, $53 billion government acquisitions market, experts say.The provision, dubbed the Amazon amendment by experts, according to an article in The Intercept, would allow for the creation of an online portal that government employees could use to purchase everyday items such as office supplies or furniture.ADVERTISEMENT This government-only version of Amazon, which could potentially include a few other websites, would give participating companies direct access to the $53 billion market for government acquisitions of commercial products.It hands an enormous amount of power over to Amazon, said Stacy Mitchell of the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, a research group that advocates for local businesses.Mitchell said that the provision could allow Amazon to gain a monopoly or duopoly on the profitable world of commercial government purchases, leaving smaller businesses behind and further consolidating the behemoth tech firms power.Amazon declined to comment to The Hill on Section 801.The Seattle-based tech giant spent the second and third quarters of 2017 lobbying on the NDAA and government procurement, according to disclosures that the company filed this year.Amazon has also recruited outside firms to help it influence policymakers on the matter.Disclosure filings made by lobbying firm TwinLogic Strategies, made on behalf of Amazon as its client, do not specify the exact legislation that they tried to influence, but note that they focused on the modernization of the procurement process.The Internet Association, a trade group representing the political interests of major tech firms like Amazon, Google and Facebook, also pushed lawmakers on the matter.Dozens of acquisition reform proposals over the years have highlighted the need to inject greater innovation and disruption into federal procurement, the group's President Michael Beckerman wrote in an Oct. 12 letter addressed to Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCainJohn Sidney McCainGOP rushes to cut ties to Moore GOP strategist: 'There needs to be a repudiation' of Roy Moore by Republicans World leaders reach agreement on trade deal without United States: report MORE (R-Ariz.) and ranking member Jack Reed John (Jack) Raymond ReedAfter Texas shooting, lawmakers question whether military has systemic reporting problem McCain pledges 'rigorous oversight' after Air Force failure to report Texas gunman's conviction Dems furious over Air Force failure to report Texas shooter's conviction MORE (D-R.I.).In his letter, Beckerman wrote that a government purchasing portal offers just that opportunity.Despite the size of the potential windfall for Amazon, Section 801 has gone unnoticed by some lawmakers on the House and Senate Armed Services committees, which are responsible for drafting and finalizing the NDAA.Many legislators in the House and Senate whom The Hill asked about the bill were not immediately familiar with the provision, though some expressed interest and commented later after reviewing Section 801.Those who were familiar with the provision had mixed opinions, but many lawmakers leaned toward supporting it.Im going to seriously scrutinize it and see if well want to revise it in some way, said Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.).The Connecticut senator said he was skeptical of criticisms that the provision would allow Amazon to dominate the government procurement market.My concern is that every company have a chance to participate in the procurement process both online and traditional, Rep. Ro Khanna Rohit (Ro) KhannaVoter suppression, the blueprint to a broken democracy Calif. rep: Time for Silicon Valley to advance the common good Dems ready for rematch in Silicon Valley MORE (D-Calif.), who represents Silicon Valley, told The Hill when questioned about the amendment.Khanna said it was essential that the final version of the bill ensured transparency in input pricing and also to make sure they have multiple bids from competitors.Another member of the House Armed Services Committee, Rep. Rick Larsen Richard (Rick) Ray LarsenMonopoly critics decry Amazon amendment Trumps air traffic control overhaul would trigger spending cuts For Hill staffers, Cruzs liked porn tweet a nightmare scenario MORE (D-Wash.), offered a more pointed defense of Section 801.This isnt about Amazon, although Amazon lobbied for it.Its about trying to create online space for purchasing so that [the Department of Defense] can get something for value, Larsen argued.He explained that the provision was born out of trying to create a specific provision for Defense Department procurement only.But the committee realized that, to do that, wed have to set up a mini-[General Services Administration] inside the Defense Department.So then it became more broad, Larsen said.In a briefing on Wednesday before the bills release, senior House and Senate Armed Services committee staffers explained that, in addition to Amazon and Walmart, Staples and industrial supply company Grainger would be eligible to also provide commercial items.But Mitchell is skeptical, pointing to language in the current version of the bill that would appear to exclude Staples and Grainger.The way the language reads to me, its hard to imagine that there are any other companies who would fit the bill besides Amazon and perhaps Walmart, she said.Those are the only retailers who are operating online marketplaces who seem to be in a situation to create a government marketplace portal that this provision envisions.The House Armed Services Committee contests the idea that Section 801 will only benefit one or two companies, saying that multiple companies will have access to the government procurement market in the final version of the NDAA.[Amazons dominance of government procurement] is a myth that opponents of the provision have been shopping for a while, that we wrote the language in such a way as to exclude more specialized marketplaces, a representative from the House Armed Services Committee told The Hill over email, adding that some of Section 801s language had been changed in the latest version of the provision.House Armed Services Committee Chairman Mac Thornberry (R-Texas) has made a strong push for online marketplace reform.In addition to advocating for the amendment, he also introduced a standalone bill in May that shares similar goals with Section 801.Mitchell and other experts believe that Section 801 could have harmful impacts.Its incredibly dangerous, said Matt Stoller, an economist at the Open Markets Institute, a think tank critical of Amazons growing power.What its doing is concentrating the buying power of the country into the hands of Jeff Bezos.Rebecca Kheel contributed.

Trump thinks Scientology should lose tax-exempt status:::::President Trump has thrown his support behind removing the Church of Scientology's tax-exempt status, according to a Huffington Post report.Twitter messages from a Trump family friend and top official at the Department of Housing and Urban Development claim that Trump and his family "couldn't agree more" that the church should lose its tax-exempt status."From The moment I saw your series I told President Trump & his family we needed to revoke their tax exempt status.They couldnt agree more, but please dont publicize that yet," Lynne Patton wrote to actress Leah Remini in the messages obtained by HuffPost.This is going to get done in the next 4 years or Ill die trying.Knock on wood!Patton is a longtime friend and business associate of the Trump family who has worked with the Trumps since 2009.Last year, she spoke in support of Trump at the Republican National Convention in June.ADVERTISEMENT Remini, who starred on the hit series "King of Queens," is behind the Emmy Award-winning show Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath.The show is a documentary examining the Church of Scientology, which Remini left in 2013, and its alleged abuse of critics.I look forward to doing my part to help put an end to this ongoing nightmare and blatant misuse of our IRS rules & regulations," Patton wrote to Remini."I want to do more research on Scientologys history with the IRS, to date, so that I can better understand what tactics have been applied and where we can pick up."It is unclear if Patton ever communicated with the IRS, and a request for comment from the Huffington Post was not immediately answered.Experts told the Huffington Post that such an urging from an administration official would likely be illegal.For the White House or any administration official to try and influence who the IRS targets, for whatever reason, is wrong and could result in a violation of the law, said Larry Noble, a former general counsel of the Federal Election Commission.The IRS must make these decisions independently without any influence by the White House or administration officials.The IRS website states that the IRS may begin a church tax inquiry only if an appropriate high-level Treasury official reasonably believes, on the basis of facts and circumstances recorded in writing, that an organization claiming to be a church or convention or association of churches may not qualify for exemption.
McConnell 'misspoke' on claim that no one in middle class would get tax increase:::::Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Addison (Mitch) Mitchell McConnellMcConnell expects Paul to return to Senate next week Former Hill staff calls for mandatory harassment training Gaming the odds of any GOP tax bill getting signed into law MORE (R-Ky.) is walking back his claim that no middle class Americans will see a tax increase under the Senate GOP plan."I misspoke on that.You can't guarantee that absolutely no one sees a tax increase," McConnell told The New York Times on Friday.McConnell added that "what we are doing is targeting levels of income and looking at the average in those levels and the average will be tax relief for the average taxpayer in each of those segments."ADVERTISEMENT Democrats immediately seized on McConnell's walk-back, accusing the Kentucky Republican of lying about the Senate GOP tax plan.The only thing that Mitch McConnell can guarantee is hell stop at nothing to make sure his donors are taken care of even if it means lying about how his donor-driven policies will hurt middle class families," said David Bergstein, a spokesman for Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer Charles (Chuck) Ellis SchumerTrump is right: The visa lotto has got to go Schumer predicts bipartisan support for passing DACA fix this year No room for amnesty in our government spending bill MORE (D-N.Y.), reacting to McConnell's comments, said middle class families "would be hammered" by the Senate tax plan unveiled Thursday.The Senate bill clearly violates Leader McConnells pledge that the Republican plan wouldnt raise taxes on the middle class.Rather than distorting the facts about their plan, Republicans should turn back and work with Democrats on a bipartisan plan," Schumer said.The Senate tax plan includes several key provisions that break with the House, including eliminating the state and local tax deduction, a one-year delay in cutting the corporate tax rate and keeping the estate tax.McConnell told conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt on MSNBC earlier this month, before the Senate GOP plan was unveiled, that "at the end of the day, nobody in the middle class is going to get a tax increase."But a preliminary New York Times analysis of the Senate legislation found that while middle-class Americans would do better under the proposal compared with the House bill, millions of middle-class families would still see their taxes go up.A majority of middle class families would get a tax cut, according to the newspaper's analysis, including a savings of $1,300 in 2018 and $1,700 in 2026 on average.But a quarter of middle-class families would get a tax increase in 2018, on average by $1,000.By 2026, roughly one-third would see their taxes go up, by an average of $1,600.The Senate's bill is likely to undergo changes before it comes up for a final vote.The Senate Finance Committee will start its markup on Monday.And under the Senate's reconciliation rules which allow Republicans to avoid a Democratic filibuster lawmakers will need to go through a "vote-a-rama," an hours-long marathon where any senator can force a vote on an amendment to the tax plan.Senate Finance Committee aides told The Washington Post that they would need to make adjustments to the legislation because it doesn't currently meet the requirement that it not add to the debt after 10 years.Updated: 5:31 p.m.
Melania visits Great Wall, Beijing Zoo:::::First lady Melania Trump finished the solo portion of her trip to China on Friday with a visit to the Beijing Zoo.While President Trump continued on to Vietnam for the fourth leg of his 12-day Asia trip, the first lady spent some time at the Beijing Zoo's panda exhibit, getting the opportunity to interact behind the scenes with a panda "goodwill ambassador of the zoo" named Gu Gu, zoo director Li Xiaoguang told reporters.As she arrived at the zoo on Friday, Trump was greeted by a group of school children waving Chinese and American flags.The children later sang for the first lady.ADVERTISEMENT After leaving the zoo, Trump visited the Great Wall, where she took in the view from a watchtower."This is beautiful.This is amazing," she said, according to a pool report.In a statement issued at the conclusion of her trip to China, she thanked Chinese President Xi Jinping and his wife, Peng Liyuan, for their hospitality during the visit."This visit to China is something I will never forget, the first lady said.President Xi and Madame Peng were gracious hosts, and I was honored to participate in many cultural experiences and personal conversations.I believe both of our countries made great strides during this trip, and I look forward to future visits.President Trump said in a tweet on Friday that the first lady would next visit Alaska.
Alabama poll: Moore and Jones tied following scandal:::::Embattled Alabama GOP Senate nominee Roy Moore is tied with Democrat Doug Jones in a new poll on Friday, one day after accusations surfaced that Moore had inappropriate sexual contact with a 14-year-old girl decades ago.Moore and Jones are tied at 46 percent in the new poll by Decision Desk and Opinion Savvy, with 82 percent of respondents aware of the new allegations leveled by named accusers in The Washington Post.ADVERTISEMENT In RealClearPolitics's average of polls, which does not yet include the new poll, Moore is leading by 6 points.All of those polls were taken before the allegations of Moores sexual conduct were reported.Since the lion's share of respondents were aware of the allegations, it's likely that the new revelations are in part responsible for tightening the race.The Washington Post revealed on Thursday that an Alabama woman is accusing Moore of inappropriate sexual touching while she was 14 years old Washington Republicans have rushed to distance themselves from Moore in the wake of the allegations.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Addison (Mitch) Mitchell McConnellMcConnell expects Paul to return to Senate next week Former Hill staff calls for mandatory harassment training Gaming the odds of any GOP tax bill getting signed into law MORE (R-Ky.) has called on him to step aside if the allegations are true.And the National Republican Senatorial Committee has ended its fundraising agreement with Moore's campaign.Despite that pressure, 54 percent of voters and 73 percent of Republicans do not think Moore should step aside as the party's nominee.Moore has denied all of the allegations and insisted that he will not step down.Some Republicans have talked about the potential for a long-shot write-in campaign, but the polling data shows that a write-in candidate could give Democrats the edge.In a contest between Moore, Jones or write-in candidate Sen.

Roy Moore Again Denies Sexual Misconduct Allegations:::::Roy Moore, speaking at an event Saturday in Alabama, once again denied the allegations in a Washington Post report that he had pursued relationships with teenage girls and initiated sexual contact with a 14-year-old when he was in his thirties.I have not provided alcoholic beverages, beer or anything else, to a minor, Moore said Saturday.I have not been guilty of sexual misconduct with anyone.These allegations came only four and a half weeks before the general election on December 12.Why now?This article is a prime example of fake news, Moore added.We do not intend to let the Democrats or the established Republicans or anybody else behind this story stop this campaign.The Post published its bombshell report on Thursday, citing four women who spoke on the record about the way Moore pursued them when they were teenagers and he was in his thirties.One of the women, Leigh Corfman, said she was 14 when she met Moore with her mother outside a courthouse before a child custody hearing, and that she and Moore began seeing each other before he initiated sexual contact.Another woman, Gloria Thacker Deason told the Post that she went on dates with Moore when she was 18 and he gave her wine even though she was underage.Ive been investigated more than any person in this country, Moore added.To think that grown women would wait 40 years to come before an election to bring charges is absolutely unbelievable.Moore said investigations were underway and that the next few days would bring revelations about the motivation and content of this article.Moores campaign had already issued two statements of denial before his remarks, one on Thursday and one on Friday.Moore denied the allegations in a Friday interview with Sean Hannity, telling the Fox News anchor he dated many women after he returned from the military but doesnt remember dating anyone that young.He did say he knew Deason and another woman identified in the Posts report, Debbie Wesson Gibson, although he does not remember romantically pursuing them or going on dates with them.As he has before, Moore questioned the timing of publicizing the allegations, arguing that the Post was engaging in a smear campaign against him to benefit his Democratic opponent Doug Jones.The Post, he said, has been working to undermine him since he defeated his Republican opponent Luther Strange in the primary to become the nominee.I do not expect the Washington Post to stop, he said.I think they have a political agenda.
Roy Moore: Mike Lee and Steve Daines Withdraw Endorsement:::::Two U.S.Senators who had endorsed Roy Moores candidacy withdrew their support, one day after a Washington Post report alleging that he had pursued teenagers when he was in his thirties.Montana Senator Steve Daines and Utah Senator Mike Lee both revoked their support Friday evening.Having read the detailed description of the incidents, as well as the response from Judge Moore and his campaign, I can no longer endorse his candidacy for the US Senate, Lee wrote on Twitter at approximately 6 p.m. E.T.Daines retweeted Lees tweet, and, two minutes later, followed with his own statement.I am pulling my endorsement and support for Roy Moore for U.S. Senate, he wrote on Twitter.The Post reported Thursday that Moore had pursued relationships with four teenage girls when he was in his thirties, which included initiating sexual contact with one girl, who identified herself to the Post as Leigh Corfman, when she was 14 years old.Another woman, Gloria Thacker Deason, told the Post she had gone on dates with Moore and he had given her wine when she was 18.Moore has denied the allegations, insinuating that the paper was engaging in an attack on his character in an effort to drum up support for his Democratic opponent, Doug Jones.In an interview with Fox News Sean Hannity Friday, Moore denied the allegations, claiming he dated a lot of women after he came back from the military, but does not remember any of them being significantly younger than him.He said he knew Deason and another woman identified in the Posts report, Debbie Wesson Gibson, although he does not remember romantically pursuing them or going on dates with them.Moore denied he knew Corfman and that he had engaged in sexual contact with her, alleging that her story was politically motivated.Moore has the endorsement of four current U.S.Senators listed on his website: Lee, Texas Senators Ted Cruz and John Cornyn, and Kentucky Senator Rand Paul.Daines was never listed.Cruz and Cornyn have both condemned the allegations in the report Cruz said Moore should withdraw if the allegations are true but have not withdrawn their endorsements as of Saturday morning.
President Trump Deflects Questions on Roy Moore:::::(HANOI) President Donald Trump on Saturday deflected questions about whether Alabama Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore should drop out of the race because of sexual misconduct allegations against him.Trump, who has been traveling in Asia, said hes been too busy reading documents and hasnt had time to catch up on television news coverage about Moore.So I have not seen very much about him, about it, Trump told reporters traveling with him as Air Force One flew from Danang to Hanoi, in Vietnam.Trump referred back to a written statement that White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders read to reporters after The Washington Post report that an Alabama woman said Moore had sexual contact with her when she was 14 and he was a 32-year-old assistant district attorney.The White House statement said Trump believes Moore will do the right thing and step aside if the decades-old allegations are true.Moore, an outspoken conservative Christian and former state Supreme Court judge, said Friday during an interview with conservative radio host Sean Hannity that the alleged encounter with the 14-year-old never happened.Three other women also told the Post that Moore had sexual contact with them when they were teenagers.Asked when he would decide whether Moore did what he has been accused of, given that four women have come forward, Trump said: Honestly, Id have to look at it and I have to see.The allegations have sparked a wave of concern among GOP officials in Washington who are anxious about their slim majority in the Senate.But they have produced little more than a collective shrug from many Republicans in Alabama, which holds a special election on Dec. 12 to fill the seat formerly held by Attorney General Jeff Sessions.Moore was not Trumps preferred candidate.The Republican president had endorsed and campaigned for Sen. Luther Strange in the GOP primary.After Moore defeated Strange, Trump pledged to campaign for Moore.Republican senators, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., have said Moore should step aside if the reports are true.Trump suggested he would have more to say on the matter after he returns to the White House next week.Ill stick with my statement for now, he said.But Ill have further comment as we go down the road.I have to get back into the country to see whats happening.
Donald Trump: Vladimir Putin 'Absolutely Did Not Meddle':::::(HANOI) President Donald Trump said Russias Vladimir Putin once again vehemently denied interfering in the 2016 U.S. elections during their discussions on the sidelines of an economic summit Saturday.Trump declined to say whether he believed Putin, but made clear hes not interested in dwelling on the issue.He said he absolutely did not meddle in our election.He did not do what they are saying he did, Trump said of Putin, speaking with reporters aboard Air Force One as he traveled to Hanoi, the second-last stop of his Asia trip.Every time he sees me, he said: I didnt do that.And I believe, I really believe that when he tells me that he means it, Trump said, noting that Putin is very insulted by the accusation.Trump called the accusation an artificial barrier erected by Democrats once again casting doubt on the U.S. intelligence communitys conclusion that Russia did try to interfere in the election to help Trump win.Trump and Putin did not have a formal meeting while they were in Vietnam for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit, but the two spoke informally several times on the events sidelines and reached an agreement on a number of principles for the future of war-torn Syria.But Trump made clear that the issue of Russian meddling in the election hovers over the leaders relationship and said it jeopardized their ability to work together on issues including North Koreas escalating nuclear program and the deadly conflict in Syria.Having a good relationship with Russias a great, great thing.And this artificial Democratic hit job gets in the way, Trump told reporters.People will die because of it.Trump danced around the question of whether he believed Trumps denials, telling reporters that pressing the issue would have accomplished little.He said he didnt meddle.I asked him again.You can only ask so many times, said Trump.Well, look, I cant stand there and argue with him, he added later.Id rather have him get out of Syria, to be honest with you.Id rather have him, you know, work with him on the Ukraine than standing and arguing about whether or not cause that whole thing was set up by the Democrats.Trumps suggestion that he may believe Putin over his own nations intelligence community is certain to re-ignite the firestorm over the issue of election meddling.Meanwhile, a special counsel investigation of potential collusion between Moscow and Trump campaign aides so far has resulted in two indictments for financial and other crimes unrelated to the campaign, as well as a guilty plea.Congressional committees have also been interviewing campaign and White House staff.Earlier Saturday, the Kremlin issued a statement saying the leaders had reached agreement on a number of principles for the future of civil war-torn Syria now that the Islamic State group has largely been pushed out.Among the agreements key points, according to the Russians, were an affirmation of de-escalation zones, a system to prevent dangerous incidents between American and Russian forces, and a commitment to a peaceful solution governed by a Geneva peace process.The Kremlin quickly promoted the agreement as the White House stayed silent.Trump told reporters that the deal was reached very quickly and that it would save tremendous numbers of lives.And he praised his relationship with Putin the two seem to have a very good feeling for each other and a good relationship, considering we dont know each other well.Snippets of video of from the summit in the sea-side city of Danang showed Trump and Putin shaking hands and chatting, including during the world leaders traditional group photo.The two walked together down a path to the photo site, conversing amiably, with Trump punctuating his thoughts with hand gestures and Putin smiling.Journalists traveling with Trump were not granted access to any of the APEC events he participated in in the picturesque tropical seaside city Saturday.White House officials had worked quietly behind the scenes negotiating with the Kremlin on the prospect of a formal meeting.The Russians raised expectations for such a session and Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One en route to Asia that it was expected well meet with Putin to discuss issues including ramping up pressure on North Korea to halt its nuclear and ballistic weapons program.As speculation built, the two sides tried to craft the framework of a deal on the future of Syria that Trump and Putin could announce in a formal bilateral meeting, according to two administration officials not authorized to speak publicly about private discussions.Though North Korea and the Ukraine had been discussed, the two sides focused on trying to strike an agreement about a path to resolve Syrias civil war once the Islamic State group is defeated, according to officials.But the talks stalled and, minutes before Air Force One touched down in Vietnam, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters the meeting was off.Trump will be attending a state dinner in Hanoi Saturday night.On Sunday, hell meet with the countrys president and prime minister before heading to his last stop: The Philippines.
Bible Scholars Disagree With the 'Jesus, Mary and Joseph' Defense of Roy Moore:::::(WASHINGTON) An Alabama state official is citing the Bible to defend the Republican U.S. Senate candidate accused of sexual advances on girls.State auditor Jim Ziegler says Mary was a teenager and Joseph was an adult carpenter, suggesting that Roy Moore acted in a divine tradition if he in fact made sexual advances toward a 14-year-old girl.Theologians and pastors, among others, expressed revulsion that Mary and Joseph would be used to counter allegations of sexual misbehavior with a minor.They also said Ziegler got the facts wrong and ignored the cultural context of the time in which Jesus lived.If this is evangelicalism, Im on the wrong team, the evangelical commentator Ed Stetzer wrote in Christianity Today.But it is not.Christians dont use Joseph and Mary to explain child molesting accusations.Moore, a 70-year-old former state Supreme Court justice, flatly denied allegations of decades-old sexual advances on girls, published Thursday in a Washington Post story.The accounts by multiple women prompted Republican lawmakers to say he should end his candidacy for the Dec. 12 special election if the allegations are true.I have never engaged in sexual misconduct, Moore said Friday.But Ziegler was dismissive about the fuss.Theres just nothing immoral or illegal here, he told the Washington Examiner.Maybe just a little bit unusual.Rev.Jim Martin, editor at large of the Jesuit magazine America, tweeted Friday that comparing the allegations against Roy Moore in any way to Joseph and Mary is disgusting.Martin said: We have no idea about the exact ages of either the Virgin Mary or St. Joseph at the time of their betrothal or marriage.The Bible does not state the ages of Joseph and Mary, agrees Margaret M. Mitchell, a professor of early Christian literature and the New Testament at the University of Chicago Divinity School.Under ancient norms and apparently under first century Roman and Jewish law, she said, it was apparently common for girls 12 and older to be betrothed, though practice varied by region, social class and more.She said the earliest text to mention Marys age is The Infancy Gospel of James, which she describes as a clearly legendary text that is trying to expand on the gospel accounts.That non-authoritative text placed Marys age at 12 when she conceived and it cited supposed evidence of her enduring virginity to demonstrate she conceived Jesus without sexual intercourse.Similarly, Mitchell said by email, We have no idea how old the historical Joseph was, though a tradition that he was very old developed in the second century and beyond.The point of that, too, was to support the idea of the virgin birth Joseph perhaps being too old to impregnate Mary.Such theories were fanciful expansions on the Gospel narratives, Mitchell said.But they add a veneer of solemnity that may allow a modern Christian like Mr Z (Ziegler) to gloss over what it means for a 12 or 14 year old girl to be viewed as and used as a sexual vessel.Martin, in tweets, said: Joseph is often depicted in art as older than Mary, in fact, considerably older, so as to make him seem less sexualized, and to emphasize Marys virginity.But, in fact, both Mary and Joseph could have been the same age.Leigh Corfman told the Post she was 14 when Moore first approached her and took her to his home twice, the second time touching her over her bra and panties and having her touch him over his underwear.The Post quoted three other women who said he pursued them when they were 16 to 18 and he was in his early 30s.He denies the womens reports and says he wont quit the race.If the Bible is not clear on the subject, the law is: Alabamas legal age of consent then and now is 16 and adults cannot touch children sexually or entice them into a home for that purpose.
Roy Moore Says He Doesn't Remember Dating Teenagers:::::Responding to allegations that he engaged in sexual misconduct with teenagers, Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore categorically denied the reports but was inconsistent in his defense.Moore began his appearance on conservative pundit Sean Hannitys radio show by saying, These allegations are completely false and misleading.He then said, After my return from the military I dated a lot of young ladies.Four women have accused him of pursuing them when he was in his 30s and they ranged in age from 14 to 18.But Moore then changed his tune, saying I dont remember dating women that much younger than him, and, I dont remember ever dating any girl without the permission of her mother.And later he said it would have been out of my customary behavior to date women that young when he was in his thirties.This never happened, they know it never happened, and obviously you dont wait 40 years to bring up something like this, he said.He was similarly contradictory talking about the specific allegation from Gloria Thacker Deason, who told the Washington Post she was 18 when she went on dates with Moore and he gave her Mateus Ros wine.The legal drinking age in Alabama at the time was 19.He said he didnt remember going on dates with Deason, though he acknowledged he knew her.Then, he said, As I recall, she was 19 or older, that just never happened, I never provided alcohol, beer or intoxicating liquors to a minor I seem to remember her as a good girl.He also said he remembered knowing Debbie Wesson Gibson, though does not remember speaking to her high school civics class, as she claimed.I seem to remember knowing her parents, he said.I remember her as a good girl.He said he does not remember going on dates with her.But Moore categorically denied engaging in sexual behavior with then 14-year-old Leigh Corfman.I dont know Ms. Corfman from anybody, Moore said.Ive never talked to her, never had any contact with her.He claimed her accusations are politically motivated.If you abuse a 14 year old, you shouldnt be a Senate candidate, Moore said.But I did not do that.
Roy Moore Is a Predator Whose Candidacy Proves Our Moral Decline:::::IDEAS Elise Jordan is an NBC News/MSNBC political analyst.She has worked for the Department of State and the National Security Council.We are living through a time of stunning cultural divide, an imploding political moment pitting the defense of values against the preservation of symbols.Consider that 14 years ago, a certain Republican Congressman from Florida championed Roy Moores fight to keep a granite monument inscribed with the Ten Commandments.Gods name is on our currency, in our Pledge of Allegiance and mentioned throughout the very Constitution that is protecting Mr. Moore from a liberal activist judge, the Florida Congressman argued.Turns out that Moores supporter, Mark Foley, who resigned three years later when exposed as a predator of underage interns, cared more about protecting a symbol of Christianity than he cared about practicing Christian behavior.President George W. Bush condemned Foleys actions as disgusting and said he was dismayed and shocked.(Bush did still back Speaker of the House Dennis Hastert after Hastert who years later went to prison for his past molestation of teenage boys failed to take quick measures to punish Foley.)Can you imagine if Republicans had stuck by Mark Foley in 2006 and Foley had remained a player in Republican politics?There was no question that Foley was in the wrong, that he had to go.The young men he preyed on might have had evidence in the form of instant messages, but there was no vocal contingent impugning their motives and calling them partisan attention-seekers who were asking for it.Id like to think the unanimous condemnation in both of those travesties wasnt because the victims were males, but because it was an era of slightly finer moral clarity.As a woman, though, several incidents in Republican politics over the past year make me wonder.Contrast the handling of the Foley scandal with that of the allegations against Alabama Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore.A man who dedicated his life to judging the sins of others is now facing his personal day of judgment, accused of sexual solicitation of an underage girl.(Moore would later write that revelations of homosexuality were the reasons for his backing of Foleys resignation, conveniently ignoring the charges of preying on the underage.)A champion of preserving Gods words in the public space, Moores warped and convenient Christianity a brand he exploited for a six-figure salary at his tax-exempt private foundation that employed his wife and son was a cover for the evil lurking underneath for many years.As recounted by the victim, Moore, as a 32-year-old assistant district attorney, offered to watch a mothers 14-year-old daughter to spare the teenager the trauma of witnessing a nasty divorce proceeding.He would then sexually pursue the young girl, appearing in front of her in his underwear in an attempt to have her touch his erect penis.I felt responsible, Leigh Corfman, now 53, said.I felt like I had done something bad.And it kind of set the course for me doing other things that were bad.At age 16, Corfman tried to kill herself.Its not a new concept in the United States that men of a certain age should not be pursuing sex with teenage girls.Though there was plenty of room for growth, expansion and improvement of the law, the age of consent has been 16 or 18 years old in 22 states since since before the turn of the century as in 1900, not 2000 with the exception of five Southern states that kept it at age 10.The age of consent in Alabama has been 16 years old since at least 1920.But to those who support Moore for the Senate, the accusations thoroughly sourced and reported by the Washington Post are mainstream media news designed to discredit a Christian man.Moore himself waited only a few hours before he started fundraising off the charges.The Bezos Amazon Washington Post that dropped that dime on Donald Trump is the same Bezos Amazon Washington Post that dropped the dime this afternoon on Judge Roy Moore, Steve Bannon said.The link here isnt the opposition media that Bannon decries; its two men who are accused of grave sexual misconduct that Bannon and his followers want us to tolerate.I agree with Bannon that yes, this is the politics of personal destruction but the real perpetrators are men like Moore and Trump, who only have themselves to blame.And as a nation of conscience, we only have ourselves to blame if we let this continue unchecked.If we accept it, we accept that this kind of behavior can happen to our own innocents whom we seek to love and protect.Its a trade-off made by brave women like Leigh Corfman and the men and women who have come out in force to recount terror that they refuse to accept as inevitable for the next generation.They are a force of moral courage that is rare and real and that we are privileged to encounter in our lifetime.Doug Jones, Moores Democratic opponent, avenged the deaths of four little girls killed by the Ku Klux Klan; Moore preyed on little girls.This is the choice the people of Alabama have to make, and it matters that we take a stand on the side of protectors and against predators.
'Beyond Disturbing.' Republican Rep. Barbara Comstock Denounces Roy Moore:::::As she fights her own re-election battle, Virginia GOP Rep. Barbara Comstock said that Alabama candidate Roy Moore should not serve in the Senate.To date Roy Moore has not provided any credible explanation or response to the detailed allegations, Comstock said in a statement.The defense from some of his supporters is beyond disturbing Roy Moore should not serve in the U.S. Senate.Four women have accused Moore of sexual misconduct when they were teenagers ranging from ages 14 to 18 and he was in his 30s.Comstocks statement comes as her own bid for re-election has potentially gotten trickier.Shes running as a Republican in a Virginia district that voted this week for a Democratic candidate for governor by a 12 point margin, Business Insider reports.
Republicans Are Stuck With Roy Moore. Here's What Could Happen Next:::::Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore has been accused of sexual misconduct with teenagers just one month before a special election fill the seat left open by Attorney General Jeff Sessions.The allegations published by The Washington Post that Moore initiated sexual contact with four women between the ages of 14 and 18 when he was in his 30s are explosive.National Republicans have largely condemned the actions and called for Moore to step aside if theyre true, although Republican Party faithful in Alabama have come to his defense.But with the special election against Democratic nominee Doug Jones scheduled for Dec. 12, its too late for Moores name to be removed from the ballot.Here are five ways this could play out.Roy Moore stays on the ballot in Alabama Alabama law says a candidates name cant be removed from the ballot within 76 days of the election.This is true even if Moore decides to drop out of the race: His name would stay on the ballot, and any votes cast for him would not count.But the Alabama Secretary of States office told TIME that if Moore withdraws, the election would be voided if he still won or if no other candidate got more than 50%or a plurality of the vote.Put another way, even if Moore withdraws from the race, the Democratic candidate Doug Jones (or a write-in candidate) would still need to crack 50% of the vote to win.Some legal experts are also positing that even without getting 50% of the vote, the runner-up in the contest could win.Republicans launch a write-in candidate against Moore Republicans cant add a new name to the ballot.But they could launch a campaign for a write-in candidate.Alaska Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski has already spoken to Alabama Republican Sen. Luther Strange about throwing his hat in the ring, the Hill reports.Strange, who was appointed to the seat after Sessions become Attorney General, lost to Moore in the primary.Alabama has a sore loser rule that prevents candidates who lost the primary from appearing on the general election ballot.But that wouldnt bar Strange from simply running as a write-in.As Alabamas secretary of state office wrote in a news release, All votes for write-in candidates will be counted in the event that the candidate is qualified to hold the office and not a fictional character.There are no existing stipulations that prohibit a candidate from being elected despite having unsuccessfully run for a partys nomination, which would normally apply due to Alabamas sore loser law.Murkowski won as a write-in candidate in 2010.The last senator to do it successfully before her?South Carolinas Strom Thurmond in 1954.Moore stays in the race and no one new enters Voters then are faced with the same choice theyve already been considering: Moore vs. Jones.Moore wins the Senate race Moore could very well win and head to the Senate, where hell meet a host of Republicans who had already called on him to drop out.The Senate would have the power to kick Moore out: Article I, Section 5, of the Constitution says that Each House [of Congress] may determine the Rules of its proceedings, punish its members for disorderly behavior, and, with the concurrence of two-thirds, expel a member.But according to Senate history, the body has only expelled 15 senators since 1789.And 14 of those were charged with support of the Confederacy during the Civil War.If Moore wins, the far more likely scenario is that hell stay in the Senate and become a perpetual thorn in party leader Mitch McConnells side.McConnell backed Strange during the primary and said of Moore now, If these allegations are true, he must step aside.Moore repeatedly bashed McConnell during his primary run.Democrat Doug Jones wins Jones has been trailing Moore by double digits in the polls.But this bombshell could help his candidacy in multiple ways: If Republicans launch a write-in campaign, that could split the GOP vote and help him come out ahead.Or, with four weeks still until the election, Democrats could throw money and support behind Jones if they suddenly begin to see this as a winnable contest.If Jones does win, Republicans will have just a razor thin majority, putting much of the partys major legislative priorities in jeopardy.-With additional reporting by Alana Abramson
The GOP Reaction to Roy Moore Allegations Is a Problem:::::When allegations of sexual misconduct about Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore surfaced, many Republican lawmakers offered a variation on this line: If the story is true, he should step aside.If these allegations are true, he must step aside, said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.If they are true, Judge Moore should immediately withdraw, said Texas Sen. Ted Cruz.If there is any shred of truth to the allegations against Roy Moore, he should step aside immediately, said Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake.Theres a reason that so many lawmakers relied on the same phrase to respond to the news.Its a well-worn response to allegations of misconduct that keeps the elected officials options open if the scandal either blows over or turns into a career-ender.(Moore has denied the allegations and so far has indicated he intends to keep running.)But in light of a spate of recent revelations of sexual harassment, sexual misconduct and sexual assault, the phrase may no longer be the right response for politicians seeking to avoid looking tone deaf on the issue.Heres a look at seven reasons why if true, he should step aside is problematic.It takes no stand on the truth of the allegations The Washington Post story which revealed the allegations involves interviews with more than 30 people, court records which backed up key details from the accounts and four women who independently volunteered their stories.Saying if these allegations are true begs the question of what more evidence the elected official would need to make a determination.To be fair, elected officials had only a single news story to go on when they gave that response and many had not had time to read it thoroughly and carefully and nothing has been proven in a court of law.But politicians are called on to make decisions based on incomplete information all the time, as former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney noted in his response.It implicitly doubts the victims testimony As other scandals have shown, many victims of harassment and assault fear that they wont be believed.Responding to four separate womens accounts of improper behavior by saying if true has unfortunate echoes of that disbelief and furthers the sense among other victims of other misconduct that they also wont be believed.Again, its understandable that politicians might want to hedge on a story thats just broken, but there are other ways to phrase this, such as by calling for further investigation into the accusations.If true feels too much like a shrug, even if its not intended that way.It offers no solace to the victims Elected officials are going to be asked about the accused, so its natural that is how they respond.But if true, he should step aside also offers nothing aimed at the victims.(To be fair, some officials have made remarks along those lines.)A better response would include some words of support for those who suffered the harm.It implicitly leaves the truth up to the accused The other side effect of if true is that it puts the responsibility for determining whether the events in question on the accused.If they admit that they did what they are accused of, then its true.But it leaves open the possibility that they could deny everything, call their accusers liars and still be accepted at a later date.Of course, theres a reason why elected officials might want to leave the question open.For one, they dont have all the facts yet.Further reporting or investigation might reveal more to the story.But in many cases, its more a test of whether the accused can weather the storm and still get elected.If so, then the allegations will be implicitly treated as though they were not true.Not all politicians treated the allegations this way, it should be noted.Sen. John McCain was blunt.It leaves the punishment at the discretion of the accused The second half of the formulation, he should step aside, also leaves the power in the hands of the accused.Even in cases where the candidate alone can determine if they continue a campaign, its the least active response.For example, an elected official could urge voters to pick their opponent or write-in someone else or they could refuse to work with a candidate even if they are elected.It keeps the focus on the politics of the situation, rather than the harm To be fair, the question that elected officials face is what should happen politically.But again, the focus of if true, he should step aside is the narrow question of the accuseds political fate.Its far different than saying that the accused should seek professional help or apologize to the victims or even make amends in some way.It might make the accused less likely to step aside By putting the truth up for grabs and leaving the punishment to the discretion of the accused, the remark also ironically makes it less likely that the candidate would actually step aside because doing so would essentially be admitting guilt.That makes it more likely the candidate will deny the accusations and stay in the race.In summary, there are a lot of reasons why politicians from both parties have often relied on this well-worn phrase to respond to allegations of sexual misconduct.But the political environment has changed in the past year.It might be time for politicians to develop a new stock answer.
McCain: 'Sad' Trump Didn't Address Human Rights Issues in Vietnam:::::President Donald Trump failed to address human rights during his visit in Da Nang, Vietnam, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., tweeted Saturday..@POTUS in #Danang & no mention of human rights - Sad John McCain (@SenJohnMcCain) November 11, 2017 Human Rights Watch describes Vietnam as dire in all areas of human rights.The government has jailed and convicted a number of bloggers and activists for dissent, and is holding others without trial.McCain was captured and tortured by the North Vietnamese during the Vietnam War.A bipartisan group of 20 House members earlier this week urged Trump to discuss Vietnams human rights record, according to a report in The New York Times.But the president told reporters he is also focusing on addressing many other things during his 12-day, five nation whirlwind tour of Asia.Well, I do.But I also raise issues on many other things.I mean, I have an obligation we lost, last year, with China, depending on the way you do your numbers, because you can do them a [number of ways] anywhere from $350 [billion] to $504 billion.That's with one country.Im going to fix that, he said.And I've got to fix what we have with Mexico, who was there today too, who I also have a very good relationship with, the president added.
Frm. Moore Colleague: 'Common Knowledge' GOP Senate Candidate Dated High School Girls:::::Theresa Jones, a former colleague of GOP Senate candidate Roy Moores, told CNN Saturday that it was common knowledge he dated high school girls when he worked as the assistant district attorney for Etowah County in Alabama in the late 1970s and early 80s.Fmr Dep.DA Theresa Jones, who worked alongside Roy Moore, tells CNN: It was common knowledge that Roy dated high school girls, everyone we knew thought it was weird...We wondered why someone his age would hang out at high school football games and the mall..." Alexander Marquardt (@MarquardtA) November 11, 2017 The Washington Post on Thursday published a report stating the Alabama Republican engaged in inappropriate sexual conduct four decades ago with teenage girls, a claim the 70-year-old Moore vehemently denied."It was common knowledge that Roy Moore dated high school girls, everyone we knew thought it was weird," Jones told CNN."We wondered why someone his age would hang out at high school football games and the mall ... but you really wouldn't say anything to someone like that."One of Moores accusers, Leigh Corfman, told the Post Moore initiated a sexual encounter with her in 1979 when she was just 14.Moore, who later went on to serve as the Alabama Supreme Court chief justice, was 32 then.
Moore Accuser Was a Sign Language Interpreter for Clinton Campaign:::::One of the women accusing GOP Senate candidate Roy Moore of sexual impropriety reportedly worked as a sign language interpreter for Hillary Clintons presidential campaign.Deborah Wesson Gibson, who told The Washington Post she briefly dated Moore when she was 17 and he was 34, is founder of Signs of Excellence and has worked for a number of Democratic campaigns, according to AL.com.The companys Facebook page shows Gibson working for and posing with several Democrats at political rallies including 2016 presidential nominee Clinton, former Vice President Joe Biden, former Sen. Patrick Murphy, D-Fla., and Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla. She didnt respond to requests for comment, according to AL.com.Gibson told the Post she first met the former Alabama Chief Justice in 1981 when he spoke to her high school civics class, and that they dated for two or three months.She said they only shared kisses.She said her mother told her she'd be the "luckiest girl in the world" to date Moore."He was a hometown boy made good," Gibson said."West Point and so forth."Looking back, however, Gibson said she's glad "nothing bad happened.""As a mother of daughters, I realize that our age difference at that time made our dating inappropriate, she told the Post.Moore denies sexual misconduct allegations, calling them completely false and misleading.
WashPost: Republicans Have a Dilemma with Trump in Office:::::The Republican Party is having a tough time with President Donald Trump in office, and recent political races indicate his presidency could pose a bigger problem down the line for depending on whether candidates choose to embrace him or cross him, The Washington Post reports.Trump dominates the GOP base 83 percent of Republicans approve of the job hes doing according to the most recent Gallup Poll but a September CNN poll found that fewer than three in 10 Americans hold a favorable view of the party, an all-time low mark.The outcome in last weeks Virginia gubernatorial campaign could be a cautionary tale of how the GOP handles future elections.Republican Ed Gillespie had taken up similar positions on issues as Trump had, including the NFL national anthem, Confederate monuments and immigration, but not once did the president campaign for Gillespie.He lost to Democrat Ralph Northam by nine points and Trump later said it was because Gillespie didnt embrace the president.Ed Gillespie worked hard but did not embrace me or what I stand for.Dont forget, Republicans won 4 out of 4 House seats, and with the economy doing record numbers, we will continue to win, even bigger than before!Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 8, 2017 Virginia is not the nation, writes the Post.But as the principal data point staring at Republicans this weekend, Virginia illustrates why the debate about the partys fate under Trump will accelerate.There are no easy answers.
Brokaw: 'Where is GOP Outrage' Over Trump's 'Hack' Comments?:::::Republicans should be outraged over President Donald Trump's insistence that he believes Russian Vladimir Putin when he denies interfering in the 2016 election, while calling three U.S. intelligence professionals "political hacks," veteran NBC News correspondent Tom Brokaw tweeted Saturday.pres trump on foreign soil calling 3 u.s. intel professionals political hacks while praising Putin and believing his denial of Russian elect interference.where is GOP outrage?Tom Brokaw (@tombrokaw) November 11, 2017 Trump Saturday lashed out at former CIA Director John Brennan, former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, and former FBI Director James Comey, accusing them of being "political hacks" while speaking with reporters aboard Air Force One, on the way to Hanoi, Vietnam, reports Newsweek."Comey is proven now to be a liar and he is proven now to be a leaker," Trump said.Brokaw, a frequent critic of Trump's, posted his tweet after the president told reporters Saturday, that he'd asked Putin again about whether state agents had interfered in the election, and "he says he didn't meddle.I asked him again.You can only ask so many times."Trump continued that "every time" Putin sees him, he denies the accusations, and that when the Russian leader said that, he believes that "he means it."He also complained that Putin is "insulted" by the accusation, before lashing out at "Every time he sees me, he said: 'I didn't do that.'And I believe, I really believe that when he tells me that he means it."Trump also accused Democrats of focusing on the accusation of meddling in hopes of creating a barrier between Russia and the United States while they work on the dual crises in Ukraine and Syria.Meanwhile, CIA Director Mike Pompeo continues to stand by the intelligence community's' report concluding Russia meddled in the 2016 election with an influence campaign launched to help President Donald Trump defeat Democratic challenger Hillary Clinton, an agency spokesperson said Saturday."The director stands by and has always stood by the January 2017 intelligence community assessment entitled: 'Assessing Russian Activities and Intentions in Recent U.S.Elections,'" the spokesperson said in a statement, "The intelligence assessment with regard to Russian election meddling has not changed."
Corker: Nominating Roy Moore 'A Bridge Too Far' for GOP:::::Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., said nominating Senate candidate Roy Moore was "a bridge too far" for the Republican party, explaining he felt that way even before accusations surfaced Thursday that the Alabama Republican engaged in inappropriate sexual contact four decades ago with teenage girls, The Hill reported Saturday."Look, I'm sorry, but even before these reports surfaced, Roy Moore's nomination was a bridge too far," Corker tweeted Saturday.Look, I'm sorry, but even before these reports surfaced, Roy Moore's nomination was a bridge too far.Senator Bob Corker (@SenBobCorker) November 11, 2017 Moore has denied the allegations and on Saturday told a group at a Veterans Day campaign event that the charges were "completely false and untrue," labeling those who sought to attack him as "desperate."Corker, who announced he was retiring in September, has been a vocal critic of President Donald Trump as well as several fellow Republicans.
Trump: Veterans 'This Country's Greatest National Treasure':::::President Donald Trump called veterans "this country's greatest national treasure" in a special Veterans Day message he posted on Twitter Saturday.On this wonderful Veterans Day, I want to express the incredible gratitude of the entire American Nation to our GREAT VETERANS.Thank you!pic.twitter.com/GhQbCA7yII Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 11, 2017 "America's veterans are this country's greatest national treasure," Trump said."There's nothing close.You are the best role models for our youngest citizens, and you are a constant reminder of all that is decent, good, and brave."Trump thanked veterans and their families for their service to the country."On this wonderful Veterans Day, I want to express the incredible gratitude of the entire American nation to the millions and millions of veterans that bravely defended our nation in uniform, and the strong families whose unwavering love and support allowed you to answer the call of duty," Trump said."We applaud your service, salute your sacrifice ...and pay tribute to your profound patriotism and love of our country," he added.Trump also called on lawmakers to "ensure that our veterans are getting the care and support they so richly deserve."
Pence Helps Give Vietnam Veterans Memorial a Holiday Washing:::::Vice President Mike and his wife, Karen, joined several dozen volunteers to give the Vietnam Veterans Memorial a holiday cleaning.Carrying orange buckets with the message "Let's Do This," the Pences spent about 40 minutes Saturday wiping down the face of the famous wall on the National Mall engraved with the names of fallen soldiers.The vice president shook hands and posed for photos with the volunteers in subfreezing temperatures just after dawn, declaring: "This is a great way to start Veterans Day!"The cleanup was sponsored by the New Day USA, a mortgage companies specializing in loans to veterans.The group was joined by James Pierce, a National Park Service ranger who lost a leg while serving with the North Carolina Army National Guard in Afghanistan.
Trump: 'Documents' Keep Me From Watching Much TV:::::President Donald Trump told reporters that when he's at the White House, or even in New York City, he doesn't watch much television, and said stories that claim he does are "fake.""People that dont know me, they like to say I watch television people with fake sources," he told reporters aboard Air Force One, reports The Hill."Believe it or not, even when Im in Washington or New York, I do not watch much television."He added to the mostly print reporters that he reads "you people" much more than he watches television.His comments came while he was responding to questions about Alabama Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore, and about whether he should remain in the special election to fill now-Attorney General Jeff Session's seat.The president said he has not "seen much about Moore" during his trip to Asia, and that he hasn't "been able to devote much time to it."On Friday, however, Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said that the president believes Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore "will do the right thing and step aside" if sexual misconduct allegations against him are true.A woman, now in her 50s, has accused Moore of engaging in inappropriate sexual conduct with her when she was 14 years old.In addition, three other women have said Moore approached them when they were between the ages of 16 and 18.But while Trump has also insisted in the past that he watches very little television because he has no time for it, he had a 60-inch flat-screen television set put in his private dining room at the White House, according to Time Magazine.He also often tweets about news reports on Fox News and CNN, particularly in the mornings, while they are on the air.
Colorado Rep. Steve Lebsock Accused of Sexual Harassment:::::A Colorado state legislator on Friday said he doesn't remember doing or saying anything inappropriate to a fellow lawmaker who accused him of making unwanted sexual advances toward her during a party in 2016.Democratic Rep. Steve Lebsock issued a statement saying he apologized to Rep.Faith Winter for offending her but added he had done nothing wrong that could be described as criminal.He said any complaint by Winter should be submitted formally through a process at the Capitol that handles such complaints."I will honestly and thoughtfully submit my response to any allegation," said Lebsock, who represents suburban Adams County and is running for state treasurer in 2018."I have done nothing that can be described as criminal.Nothing."Lebsock's statement followed a report by Rocky Mountain Community Radio in which Winter, who also is an Adams County Democrat, said Lebsock suggested they engage in sexual acts and acted aggressively toward her when she refused during an end-of-session party in 2016.She said he grabbed her elbow and that she felt threatened."Steve Lebsock's behavior is egregious," Winter said.Colorado is the latest statehouse with reports of misconduct in the wake of sexual harassment and assault allegations against movie producer Harvey Weinstein.Colorado's Democratic House speaker, Rep. Crisanta Duran, removed Lebsock as chairman of the Local Government Committee after the report and called on him to resign, as did fellow Democrats Donna Lynne, the lieutenant governor, and U.S. Rep. Jared Polis.Lynne and Polis are running for governor.Winter said she told legislative leaders about the incident but didn't file a formal complaint, fearing that her reputation would be hurt and it would make it harder for her to do her work.She said that Lebsock eventually apologized and, later, promised to get therapy.She said she went public after hearing of other alleged incidents involving Lebsock in the midst of the national uproar over harassment and abuse that erupted after the Weinstein allegations."At the time I told Representative Lebsock that if I ever heard of him harassing another woman, I would be the first to go public," she told Rocky Mountain Community Radio.Lebsock initially told the news outlet that he didn't know what Winter was referring to.Then he expressed support for the "#metoo" social media movement in which victims of sexual harassment and abuse have come forward worldwide.Democratic Rep. Alex Garnett, the assistant House majority leader, said Friday that he saw Lebsock talking to Winter at the 2016 party with his hand on her elbow.Garnett said Winter asked him if he could help get Lebsock home.Lebsock responded angrily when Garnett offered to arrange an Uber ride for him, Garnett said.He said Winter then told him what had happened."It backed up everything I saw," Garnett said, adding it was important to stand by Winter at this difficult time."Sunshine on these types of issues is the only way to ensure that we have clean culture where everyone is rewarded on our work ethic and our ability to legislate well," he said.The report said nine people in all, including Winter, legislative staff and lobbyists, complained privately about Lebsock's behavior.Four lobbyists, who refused to be identified, said they considered filing formal complaints against Lebsock over inappropriate behavior in the past three years but feared doing so would harm their careers.That and Winter's allegation prompted the Senate minority leader, Democrat Lucia Guzman, to say that the Legislature's "process for reporting and addressing sexual harassment is in urgent need of review and improvement."Lebsock urged any accusers to file formal complaints "and not just through the media."Dean Toda, a spokesman for House Democrats, said legislative leaders would not be able to confirm if a formal investigation involving Lebsock is underway.Under current policy, formal complaints are handled confidentially.The workplace policy covers lawmakers, government staff, lobbyists, news media and others working at the Capitol.Lawmakers in Arizona, Kentucky, Minnesota and elsewhere have come under fire after being accused of sexual harassment.In Alabama, Republican U.S. Senate candidate Roy Moore denies allegations of sexual misconduct with minors decades ago.
Acting DHS Chief Denies WH Pressured Her Over Immigration Program:::::Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Elaine Duke on Friday denied reports that White House Chief of Staff John Kelly pressured her to end protections for tens of thousands of immigrants, and said she plans to remain in the Trump administration.The Washington Post reported on Thursday that Kelly pressured Duke to end what is called temporary protected status for tens of thousands of Hondurans living in the United States.The newspaper also reported that Duke has informed Kelly that she plans to resign.The New York Times later reported that Kelly "made an 11th-hour plea" to Duke that she end the protections."The recent media reports regarding the TPS decision-making process are seriously flawed," Duke said in a statement late on Friday evening.She said she had conversations with Kelly, the former secretary of homeland security, leading up to her decision, but that he "consistently reiterated that, as the Acting Secretary, the current decisions were mine to make and should be done in accordance with the existing law.""At no time did he pressure me to terminate TPS for Nicaragua, Honduras or El Salvador: any reports otherwise are false," she added.In the end, Duke extended the benefits for Honduran immigrants until July 2018, though officials said it could then be terminated.Duke decided to end the special status for Nicaraguan immigrants, however, and it will expire in January 2019.Duke said it was "a tremendous honor" to serve at DHS, and said she planned to continue in the department's second-highest position, deputy secretary, once Kirstjen Nielsen, the nominee for DHS secretary, wins Senate confirmation."I have no plans to go anywhere and reports to the contrary are untrue," Duke said.Thousands from both Nicaragua and Honduras were given the special status in 1999 after Hurricane Mitch devastated Central America.In all, temporary protected status protects more than 300,000 people living in the United States.
Dem Rep Slams Cruz for Refusing to Pull Moore Endorsement:::::Democratic Rep. Beto O'Rourke, who is running against Republican Sen. Ted Cruz for the Senate in Texas, is fundraising off Cruz's failure to pull his endorsement from Senate candidate Roy Moore, the Washington Examiner reported Friday."Ted Cruz has endorsed Roy Moore, and since this news broke yesterday, Cruz has called the allegations 'troubling' but he has not pulled his endorsement," O'Rourke wrote in a fundraising email Friday."It's not that complicated, Ted Cruz: we're talking about potentially elevating a man who preyed on young girls to the U.S.Senate."The fallout has been massive since Moore, Republican candidate from Alabama, was hit on Thursday with accusations published in The Washington Post that claimed he made inappropriate sexual advances toward girls decades ago when he was in his early 30s.One accuser said she was 14 years old when he sexually assaulted her.Following the revelation, Cruz called the allegations "troubling," but warned against jumping to conclusions."These are serious and troubling allegations," Cruz said."If they are true, Judge Moore should immediately withdraw.However, we need to know the truth, and Judge Moore has the right to respond to these accusations."Moore, a former state Supreme Court Justice, has vehemently denied the accusations, telling Sean Hannity on his radio show on Friday, "These allegations are completely false and misleading."A number of Republicans have distanced themselves from Moore since the accusations were leveled.Republican Sens.Mike Lee of Utah and Steve Daines of Montana have pulled their endorsement of Moore.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said if the allegations were true, Moore "must step aside."Other prominent Republicans aren't waiting to find out whether or not the charges are valid and have called for Moore to step down.Former presidential candidate Mitt Romney and Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., have said Moore should resign.Cruz and Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., are the only remaining top Republican lawmakers yet to pull their endorsement of Moore.
Rep. Henry: GOP 'Cowards' for Ditching Moore, a Political 'Victim':::::Calling accused sexual predator Roy Moore "the victim of a political hack job," Alabama State Rep. Ed Henry, a staunch Moore campaign supporter, lashed out at Republicans in Washington as "cowards" for pulling their endorsements for the Alabama GOP Senate candidate."It's sad that we have that many cowards in Washington, D.C.," Henry told CNN's "Anderson Cooper 360" on Friday night."Maybe they don't know Roy Moore well enough, and if that's the case, they shouldn't have ever endorsed him to begin with, or considered to endorse him."But if you really believe that this is a good man, and you're going to allow simply the allegation no evidence, no corroboration then, and you're gonna withdraw your support, and you're an elected official, then I feel you're a coward."A flurry of Republicans have come out to denounce Moore's candidacy for U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions' Senate seat on what the White House also called a "mere allegation" Friday.Some have even pulled their endorsements, including Sens.Mike Lee, R-Utah, and Steve Daines, R-Mont., and Moore has lost GOP campaign funding, too."These allegations are completely false and misleading," Moore told Fox News' Sean Hannity in a radio interview Friday."I believe they are politically motivated."I believe they are brought only to stop a very successful campaign, and that's what they are doing.I've never known this woman."Story continues below this video.Alabama state Rep. Ed Henry: "I believe that in this instance that Roy Moore is the victim.I believe he is the victim of a political hack job."https://t.co/pAM8bab5QQ pic.twitter.com/BejtOvMu0W CNN (@CNN) November 11, 2017 Henry has been ridiculed the past 36 hours for his public defense of Moore, who has been accused of sexual misconduct with an underage girl, 14, 38 years ago when he was a 32-year-old."You have an accuser and the accused," Henry told CNN's Cooper."More often than not the accuser is the victim, but I do believe occasionally the accused is the victim."And I believe in this instance, Roy Moore is the victim.I believe he is the victim of a political hack job, and who's behind it?I don't know."I have no idea who paid for all of this and who will be paid for it in weeks to come."The timing of the allegations are certainly precarious.Not only did the alleged sexual misconduct occur in 1979, but just recently the Alabama Senate ballot has been locked in by state law, as The New York Times reported."It is disingenuous, in my opinion, for 50-something-year-old women to come forward four weeks prior to a major senatorial election," Henry told Cooper."One of the 100 most powerful people in the world we're going to elect in four weeks and four weeks out we have these allegations that no one in Alabama has heard about.It surfaces."It just reeks of politics."Even President Donald Trump, untimely accused by multiple women of sexual harassment and misconduct during the 2016 presidential election which he, too, rebuked as political campaigns to discredit him "believes that if these allegations are true, Judge Moore will do the right thing and step aside," White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Friday.Story continues below this video.Alabama state Rep.

600K Signed Up for Obamacare in First Week of Enrollment:::::Despite President Donald Trump's efforts to take down Obamacare, more than 600,000 people signed up for coverage the first week of open enrollment, the government said Thursday.With only four days of data, experts said it is hard to discern a trend.If anything sign-ups for 2018 are on track with previous years."It's quite clear that the ACA is still functioning, and functioning reasonably well," said Larry Levitt of the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation.Sign-ups on a daily basis are up, he added, "but these numbers don't necessarily tell you whether enrollment is going to end up higher or lower."Figures from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services showed 601,462 people signed up Nov. 1-4 in the 39 states served by the federal HealthCare.gov website.Of those consumers, about 77 percent were renewing their coverage, and about 23 percent were new customers, a split that mirrors previous years.Because sign-ups for states running their own health insurance markets are not included in the early data, overall national enrollment is guaranteed to be higher.Enacted under former President Barack Obama, the healthcare law offers subsidized private insurance to people who do not have coverage on the job.This year's enrollment numbers are being closely watched because of the Trump administration's disdain for the program.Trump has repeatedly tweeted Obamacare is collapsing or imploding.He abruptly stopped payments that reimburse insurers for providing lower copays and deductibles to low-income people, contributing to a spike in premiums.His administration cut the sign-up season in half, slashed the advertising budget, and dialed back on counselors who help consumers enroll.But all the political turmoil has not had a dramatic impact on enrollment, at least not yet."If there was sabotage, you would expect to see these numbers substantially lower in the beginning of the year, because people wouldn't know it was open enrollment season," said Chris Sloan, a senior manager with the health industry consulting firm Avalere Health.The numbers do not seem to indicate a surge in consumer interest either, he added."If there was a surge, you would expect these numbers to be substantially higher," Sloan said.Separately, a study of the federal HealthCare.gov website for The Associated Press by the technology firm Catchpoint found it running smoothly from Nov. 1-9.Catchpoint monitors consumer experience with major business websites.Administration spokesman Johnathan Monroe said when it comes to consumer service, the aim is "a seamless open enrollment experience."The seemingly drama-free start to sign-ups does not mean an end to concerns about the Trump administration's stewardship.Open enrollment will end much earlier this time, Dec. 15.Since there is usually a surge of procrastinators at the end, what happens in the last week of sign-up season will be critical.The Obama administration allowed consumers in the queue by a deadline on the last day to finish later.It is unclear if the Trump administration will stick with that.Separately, acting counter to Trump's efforts to unravel Obamacare, millions of consumers eligible for income-based financial assistance will have access to basic "bronze" plans for no monthly premium.Some experts say that quirk this year could increase enrollment.The Kaiser foundation estimates 4.5 million uninsured people are eligible for subsidies that would allow them to get a free bronze plan for 2018.
DOJ Pledges to Prosecute Activists Who Damage Pipelines:::::The U.S. Department of Justice on Friday pledged to prosecute protesters who damage oil pipelines and other energy infrastructure, a move that could escalate tensions between climate activists and the administration of President Donald Trump.The DOJ said it was committed to vigorously prosecuting those who damage "critical energy infrastructure in violation of federal law."Attempts to "damage or shut down" pipelines deprive communities of services and can put lives at risk, cost taxpayers millions of dollars, and threaten the environment, a department official said in a statement sent to Reuters.The statement was in response to a letter sent last month to Attorney General Jeff Sessions by 84 U.S. representatives asking whether domestic terrorism law covers activists who shut oil pipelines in October 2016.The DOJ said it was reviewing the letter.The DOJ did not say whether it would investigate or prosecute the protesters who broke fences in four states last year and twisted shut valves on several pipelines importing crude oil from Canada that carry the equivalent of as much as 15 percent of U.S. daily oil consumption.The group Climate Direct Action said at the time the action was in support of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, which has protested Energy Transfer Partners LP's Dakota Access Pipeline.Last month's letter to Sessions, spearheaded by Representative Ken Buck, a Republican, and signed by at least two Democrats, said that when a protester burns a hole in an operating pipeline it risks igniting the contents and "killing not only the perpetrator but other innocent victims."The letter had no details on any protesters who had ever actually taken a blowtorch to a live pipeline.Five of the protesters, who say they only turned off valves on the pipelines, responded to Buck this week in a letter saying that their actions were nonviolent and were the "last resort in a desperate and necessary effort to avert catastrophic climate change."States brought charges against the protesters.Ken Ward, who closed an emergency valve on a Kinder Morgan pipeline in Washington state that transports oil sands crude from Canada, was sentenced to 32 days with most of it to be spent in community service.The DOJ's statement on the protesters is an escalation of the department's stance from the days of the administration of former President Barack Obama, a Democrat.In 2016, the DOJ along with the Army Corps of Engineers gave a temporary victory to the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe by refusing to approve an easement for Dakota Access.Trump moved to open Dakota Access early in his presidency.Andrew Black, head of the Association of Oil Pipe Lines, applauded the DOJ's move, saying that closing a valve without simultaneously controlling pumps along the pipeline could cause a dangerous rupture and a spill.But Ward said the Justice Department was going after the wrong parties."In a sane world, the DOJ would be using its discretion to prosecute pipeline and fossil fuel companies for causing irreparable harm to the planet," he said.Divisions over another pipeline project that has galvanized environmentalists but which Trump supports could widen later this month.Nebraska regulators are set to decide then whether TransCanada Corp's Keystone XL pipeline, which would also ship crude from the Canadian oil sands, should go forward.
Rep. Kinzinger: GOP Should 'Disown Every Aspect' of Moore:::::Rep. Adam Kinzinger, R-Ill., told CNN he believed the allegations of sexual misconduct against Alabama GOP Senate candidate Roy Moore and called on the Republican Party to "disown every aspect of him," The Hill reported Friday."This is a bridge too far," he said "The Republican Party should disown every aspect of him."Kinzinger called upon Moore to step aside and, should he remain in the race and win, he said the Senate should work immediately to oust him."I think Roy Moore needs to step aside now, these allegations are disgusting and I believe them," Kinzinger said."There's no way to defend this.And second, I think the Senate should say that they will refuse to seat him, or, in fact, expel him if he is the senator from Alabama."Look, Alabama has the right to pick their senators, but this is beyond the pale, to have this kind of contact with somebody when they were 14 years old.I don't care how long ago it was.He was an adult and there could be more information coming forward.Who knows?"he added.Moore has vehemently denied recent claims that four decades ago, when he was in his early 30s, he made inappropriate sexual advances against younger women.One accuser said she was 14 years old when the incident took place.

Election Back, Despite Votes Cast:::::Alabama law restricts the removal of GOP Senate candidate Roy Moore from the ballot this close to the Dec. 12 election, particularly with some ballots already cast, but Republicans are looking into moving the special election back to early 2018, The New York Times reported Friday.Moore has been accused of sexual misconduct with an underage female 38 years ago, and denied the allegations Friday as "politically motivated," although not denying he has dated teenagers.A group of Republicans have pulled their endorsement of Moore, despite the denials.The potential move of the Alabama special election from Dec. 12 to January 2018 might be something Republicans lobby for with Gov.Kay Ivey, R-Ala., although it is unclear if she has that power, the Times reported.Gov.Ivey had already moved the special election after then-Gov.Robert Bentley, R-Ala., was himself forced to resign amid a sex scandal, and would consider moving it again, if allowed and backed by the White House, according to the Times.State Secretary John Merrill, R-Alabama, told The Hill a change is unlikely, considering some have already voted by absentee ballot."It's almost like saying: Let's play a football game with four quarters, but after the third quarter, let's suspend," Merrill told the Hill on Friday."I think the scenario you are introducing for me to comment on is highly improbable for this reason: We have people who have already voted in this election.Military servicemen and women have voted, absentee voters have already voted.There are hundreds of people who have expressed their preference on the race."
GOP Sens. Lee, Daines Join Chorus Denouncing the Accused Moore:::::A Libertarian-leaning Republican senator has joined in the growing campaign against Alabama GOP Senate candidate Roy Moore, who is facing allegations of sexual misconduct with an underage girl 38 years ago.Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, announced via Twitter he has pulled his endorsement of Moore, who has claimed Friday "these allegations are completely false."Having read the detailed description of the incidents, as well as the response from Judge Moore and his campaign, I can no longer endorse his candidacy for the US Senate.Mike Lee (@SenMikeLee) November 10, 2017 Sen. Steve Daines, R-Mont., followed Sen. Lee's lead, retweeting the above and following up with his own announcement one minute later Friday evening.I am pulling my endorsement and support for Roy Moore for U.S. Senate.Steve Daines (@SteveDaines) November 10, 2017 The senators join a chorus of Republicans denouncing Moore amid the allegations, including Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz.; potential Utah Senate candidate Mitt Romney; Rep. Barbara Comstock, R-Va.; Rep. Pete King, R-N.Y.; and even President Donald Trump, who himself faced allegations of sexual misconduct amid his campaign in 2016.Despite the allegations and calls to resign, Moore has rejected both and is still listed as being in a virtual tie in the Alabama Senate race against Democrat Doug Jones, according to the latest Opinion Savvy poll, which was conducted after the Moore report came out Thursday in The Washington Post.
Sen. Flake: Come on GOP, 'This Cannot Be Who We Are':::::A frequent critic of President Donald Trump who has subsequently elected to retire, Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., took to Twitter to continue his line in the sand against the Trump-led Republican Party, calling out apologists of accused GOP Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore.Come on, Republicans.Is this who we are?This cannot be who we are.https://t.co/Fp0xnwOdqz Jeff Flake (@JeffFlake) November 10, 2017 Moore has been accused of a sexual encounter with an underage female 38 years ago amid his campaign to succeed U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions' Alabama Senate seat, allegations Moore has called "completely false."Flake added a tweet for Moore to remove himself from the Alabama Senate race.If there is any shred of truth to the allegations against Roy Moore, he should step aside immediately.Jeff Flake (@JeffFlake) November 9, 2017 Sen. Flake, who has elected to retire from the Senate after his term ends, admitted he could not win re-election without backing the president he rejects, President Trump.Flake has recently released a book denouncing the path of the Trump-led GOP, "Conscience of a Conservative: A Rejection of Destructive Politics and a Return to Principle."Through White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, President Trump maintained "if these allegations are true, Judge Moore will do the right thing and step aside."President Trump himself was subject to sexual misconduct allegations during his own campaign in 2016, added through Sanders, a "mere allegation" from many years ago should not be allowed to destroy a person's life.The allegations against Moore have already cost him campaign funding, according to reports, if not the Dec. 12 special election.The National Republican Senate Committee has cut it fundraising ties with Moore, The Daily Beast reported.
Tax Foundation Analysis Praises Senate's Tax Reform Plan:::::The Senate's tax reform plan is "pro-growth" and will save all Americans money in taxes, according to an analysis released Friday.The Tax Foundation report claims the tax reform legislation will increase the nation's GDP, will cause wages to rise, and will add jobs to the economy."According to the Tax Foundation's Taxes and Growth Model, the plan would significantly lower marginal tax rates and the cost of capital, which would lead to a 3.7 percent increase in GDP over the long term, 2.9 percent higher wages, and an additional 925,000 full-time equivalent jobs," the report reads, adding that economic growth from the plan will lead to an additional $1.26 trillion in federal revenues."On a static basis, the plan would lead to 1.2 percent higher after-tax income on average for all taxpayers and 4.5 percent higher after-tax income on average for the top 1 percent in 2027.When accounting for the increased GDP, after-tax incomes of all taxpayers would increase by 4.4 percent in the long run."The House released the original version of the tax reform plan, called the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, on Nov. 2.On Thursday, the Senate made public its version of the legislation.Democrats have vowed not to support the GOP tax plans, saying they will hurt the middle class.The Tax Foundation calls itself "the nation's leading independent tax policy nonprofit."
The 29 most eye-popping lines from Donald Trump's press gaggle in Vietnam:::::(CNN) Flying between Da Nang and Hanoi, Vietnam, on Saturday, President Donald Trump decided to talk to the press corps.And man did he talk.I went through the transcript of the reporters' questions and Trump's answers (a huge thanks to CNN's Lauren Holt and Lauren Sennet for transcribing) and picked out the most newsworthy ones below.There are some real eyebrow raisers.The quotes are listed in the order Trump said them.1."Prime Minister Abe came up to me just at the end and he said that since you left South Korea and Japan then those two countries are now getting along much much better."Trump spent two days in Japan and a day-and-a-half in South Korea.And yet, he somehow improved relations between the two countries in those 60 hours.So we're off to a good start!2."There's been a real bonding between South Korea and Japan.""Real bonding."In two and a half days.3."But they say in the history of people coming to China, there's been nothing like that and I believe it."4."He's for China, I'm for USA.You know, it's one of those things but we have a great feeling."5."He said he didn't meddle, he said he didn't meddle.I asked him again.You can only ask so many times."Trump said he asked Russian President Vladimir Putin during their meeting whether Russia meddled in the 2016 election.And, this is what Putin told him.I'm satis-- wait.The US intelligence community has, unanimously, agreed that not only did Russia actively interfere in the election but that they did so to help Trump and hurt Hillary Clinton.6."Well, look, I can't stand there and argue with him."This is Trump's response to whether he believes Putin's claim of not meddling.Imagine if Trump had simply said: "No, I don't believe him because the intelligence community in our country is very clear that Russia did actively interfere in our election."7."I would rather have (Putin), you know, work with him on the Ukraine than standing and arguing about whether or not... because that whole thing was set up by the Democrats."Um, no.Again, at the risk of sounding like a broken record, the US intelligence community has unanimously said that Russia worked to meddle in the 2016 election with the express goal of helping Trump and hurting Clinton.Trump's reference to the Democrats here, I think, is about the dossier put together by ex-British spy Christopher Steele that Clinton and the Democratic National Committee paid for .Steele did talk to Russians in the information-gathering process.Of course, that has zero to do with Russia's active measures to interfere in the election.8."But Putin said he did not do what they said he did.And you know, there are those that say if he did do it, he wouldn't have gotten caught."So, the evidence that Russia didn't meddle in the US election is that had they done so, they wouldn't have been caught?Got it!Have I mentioned that US intelligence community has unanimously said that Russia worked to meddle in the 2016 election with the express goal of helping Trump and hurting Clinton?I can't remember if I have.9."And because of the lack of the relationship that we have with Russia, because of this artificial thing that's happening with this Democratic-inspired thing."Trump seems to believe that the reason we have a poor relationship with Russia is solely to do with "this Democratic-inspired thing."There was also the Cold War, Russia's unlawful seizure of the Crimea and their effort to meddle in our election but, yeah, "this Democratic-inspired thing" is probably it.10."He just, he just, every time he sees me he says I didn't do that and I believe, I really believe that when he tells me that, he means it."Trump here says that he believes that Putin means it when he says Russia didn't meddle in the election.That's not the same thing as saying that he believes that Russia didn't attempt to meddle in the election but it's pretty damn close.11."I think he's very insulted by it which is not a good thing for our country."Putin is bothered by the allegation that his government actively sought to interfere in a US election.An allegation that the entire US intelligence community stands behind.But, it bothers him so we should stop saying it?Or something?12."Hillary had her stupid reset button that she spelled the word wrong, but she doesn't have what it takes to have that kind of a relationship where you could call or you could do something and they would pull back from North Korea, or they would pull back from Syria or maybe pull back from Ukraine."The 2016 election ended 368 days ago.Hillary Clinton lost.13."But this is really an artificial barrier that's put in front of us for solving problems with Russia, and he says that very strongly that he really seems to be insulted by it, and he says he didn't do it."Trump here describes aggressive efforts by Russia to meddle in a presidential election an "artificial barrier" to the US having a better relationship with Russia.Also, Putin is annoyed we say he did it.Also, he didn't do it.14."I think, he is very, very strong in the fact that he didn't do it."Very, very strong, eh?Does the US intelligence committee know about that second "very"?15."Then you hear it's 17 agencies, whoa, it's three.And one is (former CIA Director John) Brennan, and one is whatever.I mean give me a break, they're political hacks."This is Donald Trump actively taking on the intelligence community -- pure and simple.And calling at least some of them "hacks."That will go over well!16."So you look at that and you have President Putin very strongly, vehemently says he had nothing to do with that."This is stunning stuff.Trump is saying that the former CIA director, the former FBI director and the former Director of National Intelligence are, essentially, liars and political hacks.Meanwhile, he is reasserting -- for about the eighth time -- that Putin says he didn't do it.Amazing.17."China likes me.China likes me."18."It's the biggest state entrance and the biggest state dinner they've ever had.By far."Trump is talking about his state dinner in China.And, yes, he is totally obsessed with everything he is involved with being the biggest and the best.Many people are already saying this press gaggle is among the best ever, in fact.19."We're actually getting very good marks having to do with foreign affairs.There's nobody that I can think of that I don't have a very good relationship with."Good marks.Great relationships.The best.Believe me.20."This artificial Democratic hit job gets in the way.It gets in the way.And that's a shame.Because people will die because of it, and it's a pure hit job, and it's artificially induced and it's a shame."Trump seems to believe -- or he is at least saying -- that the entire idea of Russia meddling in our election is an "artificial Democratic hit job" and is at the sole reason why Russia has so far been unwilling to help the US isolate North Korea as much as he would like.I'm not sure if you've run across this information, but the US intelligence committee has said that Russia actively interfered in the 2016 election to help Trump and hurt Clinton.21."Believe it or not even, when I am in Washington and New York, I do not watch much television."22."I don't get to watch much television, primarily because of documents I am reading ... documents a lot and different things."Same.I am always reading documents -- documents of "a lot and different things."23."Well a lot of people said it is almost physically impossible for someone to go through 12 days, what I didn't want to do was come back, because I would of had to come back, and we would have been on this plane again in five weeks from now exactly, to do four days, we were going to do four days."Many people said no man could go on a 12-day foreign trip.But, there was one man they didn't count on.One man named Donald John Trump.24."He's representing his people, he's strong, he's very strong."Trump on Xi.And remember that, for Trump, strength -- or at least the projection of strength and toughness -- is the most important thing.25."He's one of the greatest gymnasts."Trump on Abe following the Japanese Prime Minister's fall into a sand trap during a round of golf with Trump earlier in the trip.26."There was no collusion.Everybody knows there was no collusion."Neither the congressional committees investigating Russian meddling in the election nor Justice Department special counsel Robert Mueller's office have ruled the possibility of collusion in or out.27."Democrats wanted to have a good relationship with Russia but they couldn't do it because they didn't have the talent, they didn't have the chemistry to do it, they didn't have what it takes."Trump seems to be suggesting that Democrats, because they lack his chemistry and natural abilities to build relationships, are sabotaging the Russia relationship by suggesting Russia sought to interfere in our election.But the congressional committees looking into the election are controlled by Republicans.And it was Trump's Justice Department that decided to appoint Mueller as special counsel.28."She hit that reset button, it was a joke.But she tried and she failed."The election ended 368 days ago.29."I do feel you should have as many news outlets as you can -- especially since so many are fake."Trump, making clear he opposes media consolidation -- in the context of a question about whether he opposes the AT&T merger with Time Warner.(Time Warner owns CNN.)
Podesta Group on the verge of shuttering amid ties to Mueller probe:::::Story highlights Podesta CEO told employees firm would cease to exist at end of the year Developments come after firm was tied to Mueller's indictments of Manafort and Gates (CNN) One of Washington's most prominent lobbying firms is on the verge of shuttering after becoming ensnared by special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation.Kimberley Fritts, the chief executive of the Podesta Group, told employees during a Thursday staff meeting that the firm would cease to exist at the end of the year, according to two sources.Employees were asked to clear out their desks and were told they may not be paid beyond November 15, multiple sources said.Fritts told the employees the Podesta Group may try to provide health care through the end of the year, according to two people in the meeting.The developments come after the Podesta Group was tied last week to Mueller's indictments of Paul Manafort and Rick Gates, who pleaded not guilty after being charged with failing to file as foreign agents relating to a decade of work they did for the Party of Regions, a pro-Russia political party in the Ukraine.Read More
There is a wave of Republicans leaving Congress:::::(CNN) Republicans are leaving office at a higher rate than in recent congresses, suggesting Democrats could pick up seats in the 2018 midterm elections.On Thursday it was Virginia Republican Bob Goodlatte, the influential chairman of the House judiciary committee.Already, at least 25 Republicans have announced they are retiring, running for another office or resigning outright.They're leaving from all over the map, from southern New Jersey to southern New Mexico.Democrats need to pick up 24 seats to retake the majority from Republicans, who've had control of the House since 2011.Republican leadership has acknowledged the issue."We've got to find better ways to empower people where they feel like this is worth their time," Rep. Pete Sessions of Texas, a former two-term National Republican Congressional Committee chair who met with several members to discuss retirements, told the National Journal in September.But more retirements came shortly after -- and then more after that.While midterm elections are historically tough for the party of the President in power, it's too early to tell how things will unfold next year.But seats are opening up all over the map.A few seats will be filled by Special Elections before next November.But most won't.The location of some of these seats has been pivotal during the push for health care reform and tax reform in 2017.Reps. Frank LoBiondo of New Jersey and Charlie Dent of Pennsylvania were courted during the health care debates for their votes.Both members have high numbers of Medicaid enrollees in their districts.Property taxes are high in New Jersey, and LoBiondo objected to the repeal of the state and local tax (SALT) deduction during the tax reform debates.Some states are seeing higher numbers of open seats.And not all of the vacancies are coming from Republicans.Several seats have opened in Texas, including the blue 16th Congressional District, won by Democrat Beto O'Rourke in 2016.He announced that he plans to run for Senate in 2018.The campaign committees on both sides of the political aisle are eying the 23 Republicans defending districts that Hillary Clinton won and the 12 held by Democrats in districts that President Donald Trump won.These are seen as vulnerable seats to flip.But many of the Republican retirements are occurring in congressional districts where Trump narrowly carried the vote, like New Jersey's 2nd or Michigan's 11th.Members from these districts could have faced tough reelections in 2018, when Democrats are expected to be strong performers, potentially regaining control of the House.Republicans who say they will run for another office are more likely to come from districts where Trump performed well.These members vote in alignment with Trump at a high rate.They may count on continued support from his base supporters to propel them into higher office.With few exceptions, Republicans and Democrats retiring largely vote along party lines.As parties, they have similar levels of support for the President's agenda.Past research has found the emergence of "strategic retirement" by politicians when they think reelection is less likely.The recent results in Virginia and subsequent Republican departure suggest this phenomenon may be in effect.Here is the full list of representatives who have so far announced that they plan to leave office, broken down by whether they said they will resign, retire or run for another office.Some members resigned before their terms ended.While the number of Democrats and Republicans planning to run for another office is close in number, the number of House Republican retirements dwarfs those announced by Democrats.Members from either party planning to run for another office tend to run for Senate seats or governorships.
Republicans have a retirement problem. And it's only going to get worse.:::::Washington (CNN) In the last 10 days, four Republican House members have announced they won't be running again in 2018.One of those four was Rep. Frank LoBiondo, who leaves behind a very competitive district in southern New Jersey."As some of my closest colleagues have also come to realize, those of us who came to Congress to change Washington for the better through good governance are now the outliers," LoBiondo said in his retirement statement ."In legislating, we previously fought against allowing the perfect to become the enemy of the good.Today, a vocal and obstinate minority within both parties has hijacked good legislation in pursuit of no legislation."LoBiondo, in short, wasn't having fun anymore.The Congress -- and its agenda -- is being wagged by the tail of the dog, aka the 40 (or so) most conservative members who oppose any measures that seek to build compromise with the other side.As a result, nothing gets done.And people who came to Washington to get something done get frustrated and leave.Now consider what happened on Tuesday night across the country .Republican candidates were swamped -- particularly in the suburbs -- by Democrats thanks, in large part, to President Donald Trump's dismal poll numbers.Democrats turned out in large numbers to send a message to Trump while Republicans, broadly speaking, were less enthused to go vote.No fun.Not getting anything done.Energized Democratic base.Unenthused Republican base.That's a toxic mix if you are a Republican member of Congress -- especially one in a competitive district or someone who has been around Washington long enough to have watched the idea of legislating slowly but surely die.Given the political environment inside and outside of Washington, it doesn't take a genius to imagine that there are going to be more retirements from the Republican side before 2018 is all said and done.And, already, the number of GOP members leaving office in 2018 or having already left in 2017 is running ahead of historic norms -- as this amazing chart by CNN's Sam Petulla shows.The short version of that chart is that two-and-a-half times more Republicans are retiring than Democrats, as of today.And that the rate of Republican retirements at this point in the election cycle is higher than it has been in recent elections.What's also critically important is not just the raw number of retirements but the kinds of seats that are being left behind.And, in that regard, too, things look bad for Republicans -- with the likelihood they will get worse.In addition to LoBiondo, Reps. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen of Florida, Dave Reichert of Washington, Charlie Dent of Pennsylvania and Dave Trott of Michigan have also announced they won't run for re-election in 2018.All hail from districts that are either competitive or potentially competitive.Hillary Clinton carried Ros-Lehtinen and Reichert's districts.Trump carried LoBiondo's seat by four points.Same with Trott's district.All of those members just retired.They didn't decide to run for another office or get some sort of cushy, high-paying job.They just left.And, in the case of LoBiondo and Dent, we know their decisions were heavily influence by the current tribalism in American politics.We know because they said so.And each of their districts will be targets for Democrats in search of the 24 seats they need to regain the majority in Congress.History suggests that open seats are easier to win than seats in which an incumbent is seeking re-election.It stands to reason, then, that the more retirements, the more danger for Republicans -- and the more margin for error in Democrats' effort to retake the House.If you are a Republican House member today, that's a very sobering set of facts.And it's not all that hard to see why retiring as a winner rather than spending the next year of your life slogging through a nasty race you still might lose might start to look very appealing.
US investigating reports from locals that slain soldier in Niger was found with hands tied:::::(CNN) US officials are investigating local eyewitness reports that one of the US soldiers killed in an ISIS-linked ambush in Niger last month, Sgt.La David Johnson, was found with his hands tied, a defense official tells CNN, though the US military has not confirmed those accounts.What happened to Johnson and how he became separated from the rest of the Green Beret-led team after it was attacked is one of the key mysteries surrounding the incident.Johnson was found nearly a mile away from the central scene of the ambush in Niger that killed him and three other US soldiers.The Post quoted a local farmer and trader saying some children tending cattle found Johnson's remains with his hands tied behind his back and talked to a village chief confirming it.Authorities, according to the official, are also investigating whether local villagers may have taken his body at some point before it was turned over to Nigerien forces.Johnson's body was recovered in a remote area of the northwestern African country by Nigerien troops nearly 48 hours after he was discovered to be missing in the wake of the attack, according to US officials.Col. Mark Cheadle, a spokesman for Africa Command, declined to comment on the reports until the investigation is complete, out of respect for the families of the fallen soldiers.Meanwhile, military investigators looking at the mission are aiming to determine whether the team had proper authorization and the most current intelligence about ISIS in the area before they went to a deserted camp to look for evidence of extremist activity, two US officials told CNN.As CNN has previously reported, the day before the team was ambushed, they were ordered to go to a deserted ISIS camp to gather intelligence on ISIS operatives who the US believed had recently crossed over the border into Mali.But the critical question is whether the mission to go to the camp was approved at the appropriate senior level, or if approvals were bypassed in order to get intelligence from the camp site quickly and get the team back to the relative safety of its own base.Special operations missions in Niger are subject to the approval of more senior commanders who may be located in another area of Niger, in neighboring Chad, or even in Europe -- complicating the mission approval process and intelligence distribution.Investigators believe that answering these questions will help explain how the team became vulnerable to attack and establish if they had appropriate orders and approvals or decided to take on the reconnaissance task without all the required approvals.The conclusions reached could lead to changes in the way missions are authorized and the way intelligence is quickly assessed and distributed to forces in the field.Investigators are also examining if the team had the most up to date intelligence on ISIS before going to the camp.Both officials emphasized that recent intelligence about the growth of ISIS in the Niger-Mali border region had provoked discussions inside the military about whether the troops should have been in the area and so lightly armed.It's also believed the US soldiers may have died in the first hours of the firefight.Investigators are looking into reports the US troops tried unsuccessfully to send the Nigerien forces they were accompanying around in a flanking maneuver to counterattack from the side and rear.Four US troops -- all believed to be those killed -- may have gotten out of their trucks and separated from the other personnel to attempt an attack on another front.But officials stress until the investigation is completed they cannot be certain how the firefight precisely unfolded.The US military investigators from US Africa Command headquartered in Stuttgart, Germany, are now conducting interviews that will eventually range across Africa, the US and France, which provided military aircraft overhead during the ambush, before the tentative deadline to complete their report in January.The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Joseph Dunford, has indicated the question of the troops' preparation for the mission is being examined, saying in an October 23 press conference, "The questions include, did the mission of US forces change during the operation?Did our forces have adequate intelligence, equipment and training?Was there a pre-mission assessment of the threat in the area accurate?"
Trump says he believes Putin's election meddling denials:::::Da Nang, Vietnam (CNN) President Donald Trump suggested on Saturday he's done confronting Russian President Vladimir Putin over his country's election meddling since it's insulting to the Russian leader.Trump said he took Putin at his word that Russia did not seek to interfere in the US presidential election last year, despite a finding from US intelligence agencies that it did .The fraught relations between the two leaders was underscored anew when Putin's spokesman said election meddling did not come up when they spoke, even though Trump said it did.And he stressed that bigger issues persist between the United States and Russia that require the two leaders to move on."He said he didn't meddle.He said he didn't meddle.I asked him again.You can only ask so many times," Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One as he flew from Da Nang to Hanoi in Vietnam.Trump spoke to Putin three times on the sidelines of summit here , where the Russia meddling issue arose."Every time he sees me, he says, 'I didn't do that,'" Trump said."And I believe, I really believe, that when he tells me that, he means it.""I think he is very insulted by it," Trump added.His remarks, which came near the end of Trump's marathon swing through Asia, amounted to the clearest statement yet of Trump's views about last year's election meddling issue.As Trump has traveled abroad, the special counsel investigation looking into possible collusion between his campaign aides and Russia has crept close to Trump's inner circle 'There was no collusion' Jetting from Tokyo to Seoul to Beijing, Trump has largely remained quiet about the Russia investigation back home.But on his flight, which departed Da Nang in the early evening Saturday, Trump's simmering anger over the Russia matter burst forth."There was no collusion.Everybody knows there was no collusion," Trump insisted."I think it's a shame that something like that could destroy a very important potential relationship between two countries that are really important countries."He added he thought that Putin and he could "have the potential to have a very, very good relationship."Trump's acceptance of Putin's denial that Russia sought to sway the election in his favor runs counter to assessments by US intelligence agencies.While describing his relationship with Putin and the ongoing investigations into 2016 meddling, Trump seemed to indicate on Saturday that he trusts Putin's denials more than the comments of former intelligence officials, like former high-ranking intelligence officials James Comey, John Brennan and James Clapper."I mean, give me a break, they are political hacks," Trump said."So you look at it, I mean, you have Brennan, you have Clapper and you have Comey.Comey is proven now to be a liar and he is proven now to be a leaker.So you look at that and you have President Putin very strongly, vehemently says he had nothing to do with them."When asked for comment about the President's comments, the CIA said in a statement that the man Trump picked to lead the agency, Mike Pompeo, reiterated his support for US intelligence findings and that the "assessment with regard to Russian election meddling has not changed."The agency declined to comment further.Trump said the discrepancies between Putin and American officials weren't worth debating when other security issues require the two men's attention "You are not going to get into an argument, you are going to start talking about Syria and the Ukraine," he said."I can't stand there and argue with him," he added."I'd rather have him get out of Syria, to be honest with you.I'd rather have him, you know, work with him on the Ukraine than standing and arguing."Conspiracy invented by Democrats Trump repeated his claims that Russian interference in the US election is a conspiracy invented by Democrats to distract from their electoral losses.And he implied that investigators looking into his campaign aides' ties to Moscow were better off probing elsewhere."That whole thing was set up by the Democrats," Trump declared.Trump's comments, which came after a two-day stay at this seaside resort, reflected ongoing frustration at his inability to warm ties with Moscow, which he pledged to do on the campaign trail.While attending meetings for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit, the question loomed whether he would meet with Putin, either formally or in a casual pull-aside chat.Ahead of Trump's arrival, his aides indicated that a meeting was possible.The Kremlin indicated the same.But as the summit wore on, US and Russian officials diverged in their public statements, with American officials saying a meeting wasn't happening and Russian officials indicating it still might.Trump and Putin did speak at various occasions throughout the summit, and agreed to release a joint statement on Syria.But they did not sit for formal talks.Trump has met his Russian counterpart only one for such a face-to-face bilateral session, at the G20 summit in Germany in July.Following those talks, Trump's aides insisted he raised the election meddling issue with Putin and expressed concerns about the issue.But Putin, speaking to reporters in Hamburg, said Trump had accepted his denials.After Trump departed Da Nang on Saturday, Putin similarly spoke during an on-camera press briefing.He said US-Russia ties remained in a precarious condition."The relations between Russia and the US have not come out of the crisis state yet," he said."As you know, and I often talk about it, we are prepared to turn the page and go forward to look into the future to solve the problems that are of interest to people of the United States and people of the Russian Federation."Peskov told CNN's Matthew Chance earlier Saturday that, as far as he knew, Putin and Trump did not discuss meddling in the elections, though he later said it was discussed between the two leaders."Putin told Trump these reports have no ground and categorically rejected even the hypothetical possibility that Russia could somehow interfere in the election process," Peskov said, according to state news agency RIA.
CIA director stands by intel community assessment Russia meddled in election:::::Story highlights Trump has been on a marathon trip through Asia He met with Putin three times during recent summit Washington (CNN) CIA Director Mike Pompeo stands by US intelligence assessments that Russia meddled in the 2016 election, the agency said Saturday, despite President Donald Trump saying he believes Russian President Vladimir Putin when he says his country didn't interfere."The Director stands by and has always stood by the January 2017 Intelligence Community Assessment entitled: Assessing Russian Activities and Intentions in Recent U.S.Elections," the CIA said in a statement when asked for reaction to the president's remarks."The intelligence assessment with regard to Russian election meddling has not changed."The agency said it would have no further comment.While describing his relationship with Putin and the ongoing investigations into 2016 meddling, Trump seemed to indicate to reporters aboard Air Force One on Saturday that he trusts Putin's denials more than the comments of former intelligence officials, like former high-ranking intelligence officials James Comey, John Brennan and James Clapper."I mean, give me a break, they are political hacks," Trump said."So you look at it, I mean, you have Brennan, you have Clapper and you have Comey.Comey is proven now to be a liar and he is proven now to be a leaker.So you look at that and you have President Putin very strongly, vehemently says he had nothing to do with them."Read More
Roy Moore: Allegations are 'desperate attempt to stop my political campaign':::::Washington (CNN) Alabama Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore reiterated his denials Saturday against what he said were allegations of sexual misconduct, adding that "revelations" regarding the charges will surface over the coming days.Moore, who was speaking at a Veterans Day event at the Mid-Alabama Republican Club in Birmingham, called the allegations surfaced in a Washington Post report "yet another attack on my character and reputation in a desperate attempt to stop my political campaign for the United States Senate.""My opponent is 11 points behind ...This article is a prime example of fake news.An attempt to divert attention from the true issues that effect the country like health care, military readiness, tax reform or national debt," Moore said.He added that the alleged incidents happened nearly 40 years ago and called them "very hurtful to me personally -- I have the highest regard for the protection of young children," before adding that he has never provided alcohol to a minor and has "not been guilty of sexual misconduct with anyone."Moore added that there were ongoing "investigations" looking into the motivations behind the Post article, and promised "revelations" about the story to come in the next few days, though he did not provide further specifics.Read More
Democratic women won big on election night:::::Instead, one year after the Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton lost the election, Democrats celebrated on Tuesday -- in large part because of the women voters who helped propel their nominees into office and the record number of female candidates who themselves were elected.In Virginia, Democrat Ralph Northam won the governor's race, a feat that wouldn't have been accomplished without women.He led women by a broad 21 percentage points, according to exit polls a larger spread than when Democrats like Clinton won women by 17 points in 2016, Mark Warner won women by 12 points in his 2014 Senate re-election and Terry McAuliffe won women by nine points in his 2013 race for governor.Northam also more than doubled Clinton's lead among white college-educated women: He won them by a broad 15 points over Clinton's slim six-point lead.Another of the biggest forces in the Virginia races was Planned Parenthood, which helped Democrats defeat a Republican lieutenant governor nominee, Jill Vogel, who as a state senator had pushed a bill requiring women seeking abortions to undergo vaginal ultrasounds.Elsewhere in the state, a handful of first-time female candidates made history in races for the House of Delegates.Kathy Tran is one of the first Asian-American women to win a seat in Virginia.Danica Roem, once she takes office, will be the first openly transgender candidate ever to be elected and serve in a state legislature in the country.Tran said she was inspired to run after President Donald Trump was elected, realizing "the moment to stand up is now.""I realized i couldn't sit on the sidelines," she told CNN in a phone interview."I never thought I would run for office.It was something not in my wildest dreams -- partly because nobody ever looked like me that was elected to office.I think what we saw on Tuesday is that people are hungry for their government to reflect the diversity of their communities....I'm just really honored to break that barrier and to show that we can run, and we can win, and we can be a strong voice for our communities."Democrat Alison Kiehl Friedman, who is running for Republican Rep. Barbara Comstock's seat in Virginia's 10th Congressional District race next year, spent significant portions of her time knocking on doors for female candidates, including Tran."I think these delegate races are where the change happens," she told CNN before Tuesday's election."The field of delegate candidates that I'm knocking on doors for make me so proud to be engaged in a political process at a time when you turn on the news, there's not a whole lot that inspires pride.These are good people who care deeply, who despite all the demands are choosing to invest now because they love their country and their neighbors.Those are the kinds of voices that we'll need."'#2018WeGotYou' The Center for American Women and Politics, a unit of the Eagleton Institute of Politics at Rutgers University-New Brunswick, said in a release that this week's election entailed "a number of landmarks for women."Across the country, Michelle Kaufusi became the first woman elected mayor in the 157-year history of Provo, the third-largest city in Utah; New Jersey elected Sheila Oliver to be the nation's first black Democratic woman to serve as a lieutenant governor; and Jenny Durkan became the first lesbian mayor in Seattle's history, as well as the city's first woman mayor since the 1920s.Seattle mayoral candidate Jenny Durkan poses for photos with supporters at an election night party Tuesday, Nov. 7, 2017, in Seattle.Such wins sparked excitement -- and optimism among liberals -- for 2018.Some credit the organizers of last January's Women's March , who tweeted images and celebratory messages this week from the Women's March official account for each of the wins, as one of the main reasons why women were such a powerful force on Tuesday."Repeat after us: TOGETHER, WE ARE UNSTOPPABLE," the account tweeted , using the hashtag "#2018WeGotYou."This is for the women who made history Tuesday night, and for the women who will make history in 2018.We're just getting started.This is only the beginning.Stay focused.: quietcreature pic.twitter.com/PZJ6Fa4ckS Women's March (@womensmarch) November 9, 2017 "I think the Women's March momentum did two things that were really important," Jennifer Lawless, co-author of the book, "Women on the Run: Gender, Media, and Political Campaigns in a Polarized Era," told CNN in a phone interview Wednesday."It generated this widespread activism to push back against Donald Trump's agenda.And it made women who ordinarily wouldn't participate in politics, or do much more than vote during a general election, become politically activated.We've seen a heightened level of activism that translated into Democratic victories last night.And ... some of those women who were activated threw their hats in the ring to run."'Standing up and standing together' The march also helped elevate grass-roots organizations whose sole purpose has been to help women run for office.Emerge America, founded in 2002 to train women to run for office, said 85 of the organization's 129 women on ballots in nine states Tuesday won their races for local and state office.In Virginia, of the 15 seats that flipped from red to blue, nine were won by Emerge alumnae.Michelle Kaufusi will become the first female mayor of Provo, Utah."Is it any surprise that women are so energized both running for office and coming out to vote?I don't think so," Andrea Dew Steele, founder and president of Emerge America, told CNN."I think this is really a repudiation of Donald Trump and everything he stands for....I don't think that should be a shock to anybody.Women are really still feeling it; they are still pissed off."Emily's List president Stephanie Schriock said that 20,000 women across the nation contacted the organization after the 2016 election expressing an interest in some level of activism, whether that meant running for their local city councils or Congress.This is up 2,000% from the 920 women who contacted the nonprofit after the previous year's election cycle."We've never seen (these numbers) at Emily's List," Schriock said in an interview with CNN."I can't even find the words to explain how inspirational and shocking this is.We've spent 30 years sitting at women's kitchen tables saying, 'You should run.'" Following the night of victories, the National Organization for Women issued a release with a headline that seemed to sum up the sentiment of many: "Women Win on Election Night 2017.""It is just wonderful to have these victories," NOW President Toni Van Pelt told CNN in a phone interview."It's a warning to everybody in the country that women are standing up and they are standing together."
North Korea: Trump 'begged for nuclear war' during Asia trip:::::Story highlights Trump is in Vietnam as part of a nearly two-week tour of Asia He urged nations to stop trading with North Korea (CNN) North Korea lashed out at US President Donald Trump again Saturday, describing him as a "destroyer" who "begged for nuclear war" during his tour of Asia."His current trip to our surrounding region is a warmonger's visit for confrontation to rid the DPRK (Democratic People's Republic of Korea) of its self-defensive nuclear deterrence," North Korea's Foreign Ministry said in a statement published on state media, Korean Central News Agency."The weapons you are acquiring are not making you safer, they are putting your regime in grave danger," Trump said about North Korea during an address at South Korea's National Assembly in Seoul."Every step you take down this dark path increases the peril you face."JUST WATCHED Defector: Sanctions could cost Kim Jong Un Replay More Videos ...

Trump, Putin issue joint statement on fighting ISIS in Syria:::::Da Nang, Vietnam (CNN) President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin informally met on the sidelines of a regional economic summit in Vietnam Saturday and agreed to an extensive statement on the conflict in Syria.The statement, which reaffirms the leaders' commitment to defeat ISIS in the country, stresses the need to keep existing military communications open and agrees that the bloody conflict does not have a military solution."President Trump and President Putin today, meeting on the margins of the APEC conference in Da Nang, Vietnam, confirmed their determination to defeat ISIS in Syria," the statement reads, adding later that Trump felt he had a "good meeting with President Putin."While the statement mostly addresses long-accepted areas of agreement between the United States and Russia, it comes after Trump and Putin spoke casually at least three times at the ocean-side summit in Da Nang on Friday and Saturday.A senior State Department official told reporters they were optimistic the US-Russian diplomacy would be met with more success than the past because of the changing landscape in Syria."Russia got themselves involved back when it was a civil war.In some respects, the effort to defeat ISIS changed priorities for some," the official said."Certainly, for us, the priority was defeating ISIS.I think for Russia, it's a question of how long do they want to continue to support conflict.""What the joint statement indicates is a commitment to get this to a political reconciliation and peace process.That serves their interest, it serves our interest," the official said.Asked if Russia has enough influence to bring Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad to the table, the official said: "We're going to be testing that, we're going to find out."The White House said Trump and Putin spoke for about five minutes in between events at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit.The most extensive conversation observed by reporters came as the two leaders shared a friendly, yet brief, walk to a photo op in between meetings on Saturday.The two leaders looked comfortable together and smiled as they talked.Trump, speaking with reporters aboard Air Force One on Saturday, said the agreement is "going to save tremendous numbers of lives."Describing his interactions with Putin, Trump said that they got along well and agreed to the joint statement "very quickly.""We seem to have a very good feeling for each other, a good relationship considering we don't know each other well," Trump said."I think it's a very good relationship."According to the joint statement, Trump and Putin "agreed to maintain open military channels of communication" between the two countries on Syria and said their efforts would continue "until the final defeat of ISIS is achieved.""The Presidents agreed that there is no military solution to the conflict in Syria," the statement said, adding that the two agreed to find an "ultimate political solution" to the conflict.Senior State Department officials later told reporters that the statement was the product of "intense, difficult" negotiations over the past several months, led by Secretary of State Rex Tillerson along with Pentagon officials.The officials said that the defeat of ISIS and reduction of the terror group's caliphate was going well and that the de-escalation zones implemented in gradual phases had resulted in a significant reduction in the violence and helped save many lives.The officials said the agreement marked Russia's firmest commitment yet to a new constitution and free elections in Syria through a UN-led process.The results of the Trump-Putin meeting in Vietnam mirror what happened when the two world leaders met for the first time in Germany earlier this year.Though Russia's interference in the 2016 election was discussed, the two leaders also agreed to a ceasefire in southwest Syria, too."This is our first indication of the US and Russia being able to work together in Syria," Tillerson said at the time.
The unholy excuses of Roy Moore's allies:::::(CNN) Almost every religion asks a version of the question, "What would Jesus do?"Buddhists look to the Buddha, Muslims to the Prophet Mohammed, Sikhs to Guru Nanak, observant Jews to Moses, and the list goes on.Emulating holy men and women from the distant past is hard -- what would the Buddha do with Facebook?-- but the effort has helped faiths keep their founders' missions alive, even as they amble across centuries and continents.Still, there is a shadow side to this devotion: the use, or misuse, of sacred stories to condone bad behavior.The latest and perhaps oddest example came this week, when an Alabama official i nvoked Christianity's Holy Family to defend Senate GOP candidate Roy Moore from accusations that he sexually assaulted a 14-year-old girl decades ago."Take Joseph and Mary," Alabama State Auditor Jim Zeigler told the Washington Examiner."Mary was a teenager and Joseph was an adult carpenter.They became parents of Jesus.There's just nothing immoral or illegal here.Maybe just a little bit unusual."Moore, for his part, has vigorously denied the accusations.In keeping with his hardcore Christian image, the Senate candidate said he is engaged in a "spiritual battle" with "those who want to silence our message."The Obama-Clinton Machine's liberal media lapdogs just launched the most vicious and nasty round of attacks against me I've EVER faced!We are are in the midst of a spiritual battle with those who want to silence our message.(1/4) #ALSen Judge Roy Moore (@MooreSenate) November 9, 2017 But few Christians have risen to voice support for Zeiglers' interpretation of Scripture.In fact, quite the opposite.The invocation of the Holy Family was "ridiculous and blasphemous," said Ed Stetzer in a Christianity Today column."As Christians, this should provoke anger," said Stetzer, who heads the Billy Graham Center at Wheaton College in Illinois."We should be angered, first, that politicians think they can lie to us so easily by appealing to biblical language and characters.Second, that we so easily fall for such tactics.For the past decade, evangelicals have been easy marks, and I hope that people won't fall for these things."For what it's worth, the Bible doesn't tell us how old Mary and Joseph were.The gospels refer to Mary as a "parthenos," which can be translated as "young woman" or "virgin," said the Rev.James Martin, a Jesuit priest and author of a recent book on the life of Jesus.In biblical art, Joseph is often depicted as elderly and Mary as maidenly, but the purpose is to desexualize their relationship, Martin said, not to normalize liaisons between older men and younger women."Using the relationship of Mary and Joseph to, in any way, excuse or legitimize the sexual abuse or sexual harassment of a minor, or anyone, is monstrous," Martin tweeted.Again, using the relationship of Mary and Joseph to, in any way, excuse or legitimize the sexual abuse or sexual harassment of a minor, or anyone, is monstrous./5 James Martin, SJ (@JamesMartinSJ) November 10, 2017 Zeigler's comparison is bizarre for another reason, Christians said.Joseph didn't prey on Mary, according to the Bible.He protected her.As the Nativity story recounts every Advent, Jesus was not conceived through relations between Joseph and Mary.In fact, when Joseph heard that Mary was pregnant, he considered divorce, Scripture says, until an angel told him about Jesus' divine father.After that, Joseph remained betrothed to Mary and raised Jesus as a son.Another unappreciated comparison Friday, as news spread about the allegations against Moore, another of his allies compared the Senate candidate not to Joseph and Mary but to Jesus himself.Jerry Moore, Roy Moore's brother, told CNN's Martin Savidge that the women who say Roy Moore pursued them as teenagers decades ago "will have to answer to God for these false allegations," Savidge said.Jerry Moore then said that his brother is "being persecuted ... like Jesus Christ was," according to Savidge.Again, the comparison was not appreciated by many Christians."A wall of separation between politicians and sacrilegious comparisons to Christ ought to exist," said Philip Wegmann i n the Washington Examiner ."To do otherwise is neither politically safe nor spiritually right."In some ways, it makes sense for Moore's allies to draw on religious examples when defending him.The longtime Alabama Supreme Court judge has made Christianity and the Bible central to his political identity.He has insisted on displaying a monument to the Ten Commandments in the courthouse, even after he was told to remove it, and earned a suspension for refusing to follow the Supreme Court's legalization of gay marriage.But you don't need to be a Bible-thumping Southerner to earn biblical comparisons these days.During the 2016 presidential campaign, many of Donald Trump's evangelical backers compared the brash and unorthodox businessman to the morally flawed kings in ancient Israel."God called King David a man after God's own heart even though he was an adulterer and a murderer," said Jerry Falwell Jr. , the president of evangelical Liberty College and a staunch Trump supporter.Other evangelicals compared Trump to Saul, the first ruler of the unified kingdoms; to Nehemiah, who built the walls around Jerusalem; and even Esther, who rose from obscurity to become a Persian queen.There grew to be so many biblical analogies that the Washington Post made a game of it.(Meanwhile, a growing number of white evangelicals decided to be more accepting of politicians who commit immoral acts in their personal life.)What does Christian Scripture say about comparing ourselves to faith's founding families?One indication comes in a letter written by St. Paul.
Trump, Putin shake hands, chat multiple times at Asia-Pacific summit:::::Da Nang, Vietnam (CNN) President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin will not hold a formal meeting at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit here in Vietnam, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders has told reporters.But the two world leaders did informally speak a couple times during the two-day meeting.Trump and Putin were seen casually talking while walking to a photo-op at the Asian-Pacific Rim summit on Saturday.Flanked by sizable entourages, the two spoke for much of the walk down to a vista and stood next to each other for a photo.The chat, while brief, looked friendly, with both leaders speaking with their hands.Any interaction between the two world leaders is closely watched given the swirl of investigations into Russia's meddling in the 2016 election, an issue that has plagued the Trump administration for months.Special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation issued his first indictments last week, bringing charges against former top Trump campaign aides Paul Manafort and Rick Gates , who have pleaded not guilty.Trump and Putin also shook hands and spoke briefly before an APEC plenary session on Saturday and the two world leaders briefly met during a so-called class photo on Friday night, where all the heads of state come together to take a photo before the summit officially starts.The two shook hands and briefly spoke before the photo was snapped.Both wore the oversized, blue traditional-style Vietnamese shirt provided by the host country and stood next to one another for the picture.US President Donald Trump shakes hands with Russia's President Vladimir Putin as they pose for a group photo ahead of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Summit leaders gala dinner in the central Vietnamese city of Danang on November 10, 2017.Citing "scheduling conflicts on both sides," though, Sanders said Friday no formal meeting will take place during the two-day gathering.She did leave the door open to informal interactions between the two, a notion reinforced by her Russian counterparts."Regarding a Putin meeting, there was never a meeting confirmed, and there will not be one that takes place due to scheduling conflicts on both sides," Sanders said Friday."There is no formal meeting or anything scheduled for them."She added: "Now, they're going to be in the same place.Are they going to bump into each other and say hello?Certainly possible, and likely.But in terms of a scheduled, formal meeting, there's not one on the calendar and we don't anticipate that there will be one."Sanders' statement contradicted what the Russian side told reporters for the last two days, adding to the drama around how Trump and Putin will interact at the international summit."The meeting will take place on the sidelines," Putin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Friday after Sanders' statement, adding that some encounter will take place "one way or another."The possibility of a formal Trump-Putin meeting hung over the economic summit.Trump has long denied any collusion between his campaign and Russian operatives during the 2016 election.But US intelligence agencies concluded in a report released earlier this year that Russia ordered an "influence campaign" to harm Hillary Clinton's chances of winning the election.The delicateness of the Putin-Trump meeting was laid bare on Thursday -- before Sanders' statement -- when the two sides gave dramatically different accounts on whether the two leaders would even meet in the first place.Russian presidential aide Yuri Ushakov told state-run news organization Itar Tass that Putin and Trump would meet on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific summit on Friday, adding that the two sides had already agreed to the time and place.While briefing reporters in China, though, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson declined to say whether Putin and Trump would meet in Vietnam, telling reporters that officials are working to determine whether the two world leaders have sufficient areas of substance to discuss."When the two leaders meet, is there something sufficiently substantive?"Tillerson said."No conclusion has been made on that."Given the intense focus on any interactions between Trump, his associates and Russian operatives, the meeting -- particularly what is said and not said -- could overshadow the focus of Trump's trip to Vietnam, where the President is set to discuss business, trade and security with an array of Asian leaders.One cause for concern on the American side is how Trump and Putin's first meeting on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Germany caused a diplomatic dust-up over whether Trump accepted Putin's assurances there was no Russian involvement in the 2016 American election.Trump opened his first sessions with Putin by "raising the concerns of the American people regarding Russian interference in the 2016 election," Tillerson told reporters after the bilateral meeting."The President pressed President Putin on more than one occasion regarding Russian involvement.President Putin denied such involvement, as I think he has in the past."Tillerson didn't say whether Trump accepted his denial.But while Tillerson was briefing US media, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told reporters that Trump accepted Putin's denial.The charge was immediately denied by a senior Trump administration official, but the turnabout signaled that any diplomatic engagement between the two countries would be complicated and fraught.Aboard Air Force One as he kicked off his five-country, 13-day trip throughout Asia, Trump told reporters that he "expected" to meet with Putin on the visit because the United States hopes to enlist Russia in the fight against North Korea."We want Putin's help on North Korea," he said.The first half of Trump's trip through Asia has primarily focused on how to deal with the rogue nation.Trump gave a direct and bellicose speech in South Korea about Pyongyang, at one point speaking directly to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un."North Korea is not the paradise your grandfather envisioned," he said."It is a hell that no person deserves."Trump will continue to focus on North Korea in Vietnam, senior White House officials tell CNN, but his time at the summit will primarily focus on free trade."The President's engagements at APEC will reinforce the US commitment to an equitable, sustainable and rules-based international economic system based on market principles," one official said.
McConnell to NYT: I 'misspoke' on tax increase for middle class in Senate plan:::::Washington (CNN) Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Friday that he "misspoke" when he had previously said nobody in the middle class would get a tax increase under the new GOP plan, according to The New York Times."You can't guarantee that absolutely no one sees a tax increase, but what we are doing is targeting levels of income and looking at the average in those levels and the average will be tax relief for the average taxpayer in each of those segments," McConnell told the Times on Friday The Kentucky Republican initially said "nobody in the middle class is going to get a tax increase" under the Senate bill that was unveiled on Thursday, according to The New York Times.
Roy Moore can still win:::::Washington (CNN) Senate Republicans face a dire reality in Alabama following sexual misconduct accusations about Roy Moore, their Senate nominee in Alabama: They want Moore gone from the race but are largely powerless to make that happen."I think if he does what he should do, does the right thing and steps aside, I don't think it will hurt the Republican Party," said South Dakota Sen. John Thune, a member of the GOP leadership team, on Thursday afternoon.The problem, as readily became apparent from Moore's defiant statements, is that he isn't going to step aside.Moore sent four tweets Thursday night making that abundantly clear; "Our children and grandchildren's futures are on the line," read Moore's final tweet."So rest assured I will NEVER GIVE UP the fight!In the face of that stand-and-fight mentality by Moore, Republicans in Washington are left with a handful of bad -- and likely ineffective -- options."Not a ton of great options and even fewer if he insists on staying put," acknowledged one senior Republican Senate strategist granted anonymity to speak candidly about the Moore situation.Republican could move from their current "if true" caveat regarding the allegations to something more like what Arizona Sen. John McCain said of the situation on Thursday night; "The allegations against Roy Moore are deeply disturbing and disqualifying.He should immediately step aside and allow the people of Alabama to elect a candidate they can be proud of," McCain tweeted But those are just words.And words from people who Moore ran aggressively against during his primary and runoff wins over appointed Republican Sen. Luther Strange.The likes of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell endorsed Strange and warned that nominating the already-controversial Moore would create a host of problems for the party if and when he came to Washington.That dynamic means that Moore has zero incentive to listen to calls from official Washington for him to leave the race.In fact, the louder those calls get, the more likely it is that Moore digs in even further.Then there is the fact that the widespread condemnation of Moore among GOP senators is not entirely shared by Alabama Republicans."Take the Bible.Zachariah and Elizabeth for instance.Zachariah was extremely old to marry Elizabeth and they became the parents of John the Baptist.Also take Joseph and Mary.Mary was a teenager and Joseph was an adult carpenter.They became parents of Jesus.There's just nothing immoral or illegal here.Maybe just a little bit unusual."Then there was Alabama Marion County GOP chair David Hall, who told the Toronto Star's Daniel Dale this : "It was 40 years ago.I really don't see the relevance of it.He was 32.She was supposedly 14.She's not saying that anything happened other than they kissed."In the Post report, however, the accuser also says Moore sexually assaulted her.She says Moore touched her and forced her to touch him.The reality on the ground in Alabama is that Moore could still win the special election race on December 12 over Democrat Doug Jones.Lots of Alabamians don't trust the national news media.They feel as though they know Moore -- he has been around Alabama politics for decades -- and they don't want to vote for a Democrat.If Republicans in Washington think Moore's decision to remain in the race amid these allegations is bad, imagine how they will feel if he actually wins and is seated in Congress.(If Moore wins -- and the state GOP doesn't withdraw his nomination -- the Senate will have no choice but to seat him.)Every day Moore remains in the race is a day where Republicans -- already reeling from across-the-board losses in the 2017 election that can be directly traced back to President Donald Trump's unpopularity -- watch their brand further deteriorate.And, that brand isn't in terribly good shape as it is.In a new CNN poll , just 30% of people have a favorable view of the GOP while 61% have an unfavorable one.Every day between now and December 12 -- assuming Moore doesn't drop out -- every Republican Senator will face questions about him.Should he leave the race?Should the state party withdraw his nomination?Should state law be changed to keep Moore from the Senate?Should a write-in candidacy be staged?Is Moore someone who does -- or should -- represent the Republican Party?If Moore actually makes it to Washington, those questions will only redouble.Should Moore be removed by the vote of two-thirds of the Senate?Is that a end-run on the democratic process?If he stays, how can Senate GOPers deal with him on a day-to-day basis?Moore, even before The Post story on Thursday, was going to be a problem that McConnell and the rest of the governing wing of the Republican Party in Washington was going to have to deal with.That problem turned into a crisis Thursday.And it's a crisis without any obvious or good options to solve.Some Republicans are so fed up with Moore's behavior that they'd rather lose the seat -- which would make the possibility of a Democratic Senate in 2019 more likely -- than have to deal with him any more."Best case scenario is for him to step aside which seems unlikely," said a veteran Republican Senate operative."Next best case is for the Alabama electorate to beat his ass like a drum and make it clear that regardless of party affiliation the GOP does not tolerate child predators."
Alabama state Rep.: Moore allegations are disingenuous:::::(CNN) Alabama state Rep. Ed Henry, a Roy Moore supporter, said Friday he doesn't believe the women accusing the US Senate candidate of sexual misconduct, calling their claim "disingenuous.""It is disingenuous in my opinion for 50-something-year-old women to come forward four weeks prior to a major senatorial election," Henry told CNN's Anderson Cooper on "AC360."An explosive Thursday in The Washington Post , based on interviews with more than 30 people, detailed allegations that the Republican Senate candidate from Alabama pursued sexual relationships with several girls when they were between 14 and 18 years old and he was in his 30s, including alleged sexual contact with a 14-year-old.Alabama state Rep. Ed Henry: "I believe that in this instance that Roy Moore is the victim.He is the victim of a political hack job" https://t.co/3vySIsMFSe Anderson Cooper 360 (@AC360) November 11, 2017 "If he had anything like this in his past, it would've come out by now," Henry said."And here we are right before a huge election with national implications between a Republican and a Democrat.All of sudden this is headline news.I am not buying it.It is political.It is political at every level."The Alabama state legislator came under fire for suggesting the accusers should be prosecuted.Read More
Sessions rebuffing Sen. Franken, will appear before House intelligence:::::(CNN) Attorney General Jeff Sessions is not expected to respond Friday to Sen. Al Franken's most recent demand for additional information on any Trump campaign contacts with Russian officials, according to a Justice Department source.Last week, unsealed court documents in Justice Department special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation revealed new details on a March 2016 campaign meeting with then-presidential candidate Donald Trump, Sessions, foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos, and others where the possibility of setting up a meeting between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin was discussed.Franken, a Minnesota Democrat, gave Sessions until Friday to answer a number of questions about this new information in an eight-page letter .It's unclear whether Sessions will respond at a later date.Sessions has continued to steadfastly deny any improper contacts with the Russians since he recused himself from any existing or future investigations related to President Trump's 2016 presidential campaign back in March."Let me state this clearly: I have never met with or had any conversations with any Russians or any foreign officials concerning any type of interference with any campaign or election," Sessions told members of the Senate intel committee in June.Read More
How GOP politicians are responding to the Moore allegations:::::Broadly speaking, their responses fit into three distinct categories: Calls for Moore to step down in the Senate race, calls for him to withdraw if the allegations are proven to be true, and continued, unwavering support for his candidacy.Here's a look at some of the most notable responses so far.Moore should leave the race: Arizona Sen. John McCain "The allegations against Roy Moore are deeply disturbing and disqualifying.He should immediately step aside and allow the people of Alabama to elect a candidate they can be proud of."Former presidential candidate Mitt Romney : "Innocent until proven guilty is for criminal convictions, not elections.I believe Leigh Corfman.Her account is too serious to ignore.Moore is unfit for office and should step aside."Florida Rep. Carlos Curbelo : "Not my state; not my chamber but this man is despicable and should step down.To call him 'unfit' is generous."New York Rep. Peter King on MSNBC: "The person is entitled to the presumption of innocence, but in this case, it's so serious and the fact it's backed up by other women and it's so hideous, I would say unless he can prove his innocence, the burden is on him within the next day or so, he should step down."Virginia Rep. Barbara Comstock : "Harvey Weinstein, Anthony Weiner, Roger Ailes, Roy Moore ...

Why Roy Moore supporters are standing by him, in their own words:::::(CNN) A number of Roy Moore's supporters in his US Senate race in Alabama have variously dismissed or downplayed the reporting in The Washington Post that Moore pursued sexual relationships with teenage girls when he was in his early 30s.In a series of tweets, Moore denied the allegations and said he would "NEVER GIVE UP the fight" for Senate."The Obama-Clinton Machine's liberal media lapdogs just launched the most vicious and nasty round of attacks against me I've EVER faced!"he wrote."We are in the midst of a spiritual battle with those who want to silence our message.""The forces of evil will lie, cheat, steal -- even inflict physical harm -- if they believe it will silence and shut up Christian conservatives like you and me," he added.CNN spoke to about a dozen Alabamians about the allegations against Moore.Here's how they said they are dealing with the bombshell accusations.Mike Allison Mike Allison, pastor of Madison Baptist Church, said he knows Moore as "a man of integrity," he told CNN."I don't even believe the allegations.There's lots of fake news going around these days," he said."They're allegations.How can he even defend himself against 40-year-old allegations?You used to be innocent until proven guilty.""I support him now more than ever," he said.Jamie Holcomb "I've known him my whole life and I've never known him to do anything inappropriate," said the Rev.Jamie Holcomb, of Young's Chapel Congregational Methodist Church.He said that he'd need to see more proof before he changed his mind."I stand behind him 100%, unless there's proof," he said."If (his accusers) are found to have been assaulted, I'll be the first to condemn it.""If true, he needs to resign," he added.Former Alabama Chief Justice and US Senate candidate Roy Moore speaks at a rally in Fairhope, Alabama.Tim Huddleston Tim Huddleston said he is a Republican who votes Republican."If they're true, that's bad (and) he needs to step out of the race, there's no question of that," he said."The problem you have is all of a sudden -- whether you're Democrat or Republican -- you can't come in 30 days before the election and say here are some unsubstantiated allegations.""It would take so much research and questioning and lie detector tests and whatever to determine whether there's validity behind it," he said.Dottie Finch "At first, I really wasn't sure how I felt about the situation," said Dottie Finch, "but then I look at it this way: I don't have the best past, and to have it be brought up after years of speculation and never anything being said about it, I don't know just because he's trying to prove himself that now people want to come out of the closet and accuse him of things."And if it has happened, I believe the good Lord has forgiven him and he has the right to continue to prove himself."She said that she stands by him "100%" and that she will continue to support him even if the allegations were true."I would power forward and keep on supporting him, just like I have with Donald Trump as our president."If the allegations are true, "I think that would just be between him and his good Lord," she added."Even if they prove to be true, I still would support Roy Moore because I feel as if that happened in the past."Bill Armistead JUST WATCHED Merrill: Disqualifying if Moore claims are true Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Merrill: Disqualifying if Moore claims are true 01:15 Moore campaign chair Bill Armistead said that The Washington Post had endorsed Moore's opponent and engaged in a "systematic campaign to distort the truth.""Judge Roy Moore is winning with a double-digit lead.So it is no surprise, with just over four weeks remaining, in a race for the US Senate with national implications, that the Democratic Party and the country's most liberal newspaper would come up with a fabrication of this kind."This garbage is the very definition of fake news and intentional defamation," he added.Jim Zeigler Alabama state auditor Jim Zeigler used Biblical examples to argue that Moore's relationships were not inappropriate."Take the Bible: Zechariah and Elizabeth, for instance," Zeigler said."Zechariah was extremely old to marry Elizabeth and they became the parents of John the Baptist.Also take Joseph and Mary.Mary was a teenager and Joseph was an adult carpenter.They became parents of Jesus.There's just nothing immoral or illegal here.Maybe just a little bit unusual."The examples don't exactly apply to Moore's situation.In the Bible, Joseph was the husband of Mary, but Jesus is conceived through the Holy Spirit.Although Joseph is often popularly depicted as an old man and Mary as a youthful virgin, the Bible does not explicitly mention their ages.Zechariah and Elizabeth, the parents of John the Baptist, are both described in Luke as "well stricken in years," according to the King James Bible Jerry Moore CNN correspondent Martin Savidge spoke to Moore's brother, Jerry Moore, over the phone.Savidge said that the brother felt Moore was "being persecuted, in his own words, like Jesus Christ was.""Very defiant and very outspoken, relying on his faith and defending his brother to the hilt," Savidge said.Alphonso Bradford "I don't think he's done nothing like that," said Alphonso Bradford, who said he plans to vote for Moore."Why didn't it come up seven to eight months ago when he was running?All of a sudden two weeks from now, all this stuff comes up.I believe it's a lot of BS.I really do.""I don't believe it's true," he added."I really don't."Bruce Jenkins Pastor Bruce Jenkins, of Young's Chapel, said he's known Moore to be a fair man."I don't know what's happened in this country where a man isn't innocent until proven guilty," he said."It's not fair to comment until it's proven or disproven.""It's a pretty convenient time for this to come out, and it has not changed my opinion and won't, unless true," he added.David Hall Marion County GOP chair David Hall told The Toronto Star that the allegations were irrelevant because of the time that has passed."It was 40 years ago," he told the Star."I really don't see the relevance of it.He was 32.She was supposedly 14.She's not saying that anything happened other than they kissed."Jerry Pow Jerry Pow, the Bibb County Republican chairman, also told The Toronto Star that he would still vote for Moore over his Democratic opponent, Doug Jones "I would vote for Judge Moore because I wouldn't want to vote for Doug.I'm not saying I support what he did," Pow said.Christopher Word Christopher Word, an attorney in Gadsden, said his opinion on Moore's candidacy hasn't changed -- but that was "more so to do with Doug Jones than Judge Moore himself.""Whatever he did 40 years ago is irrelevant to the person he is now," Word said."He could be the single most conservative in the US Senate.If anyone is going to work to clean up the mess ... it's him," he added.
If allegations against Moore are true, he should step aside, White House says:::::Story highlights Trump's statement noted the allegations against Roy Moore are decades old McConnell has also called for Moore to step aside if the allegations are true Da Nang, Vietnam (CNN) President Donald Trump thinks if the allegations of sexual misconduct with teens against an Alabama Senate candidate are true, he should withdraw from his race, the White House said Friday.But Trump's statement also couched his assertion by noting the allegations against Roy Moore are decades old.In a statement released as Trump was flying from Beijing to Da Nang, Vietnam, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said: "Like most Americans, the President believes we cannot allow a mere allegation, in this case one from many years ago, to destroy a person's life.""The President also believes that if these allegations are true, Judge Moore will do the right thing and step aside," she said.An explosive Washington Post report released Thursday based on interviews with more than 30 people detailed allegations that the Republican Senate candidate from Alabama pursued sexual relationships with several teens when they were between 14 and 18 years old and he was in his thirties, and in one instance had sexual contact with an underage teen.The news sent Republicans reeling, with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell calling for Moore to step aside if the allegations are true.Read More
Trump's ex-bodyguard nixed offer of Russian women for Trump:::::Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump's long-time confidant Keith Schiller privately testified that he rejected a Russian offer to send five women to then private-citizen Trump's hotel room during their 2013 trip to Moscow for the Miss Universe pageant, according to multiple sources from both political parties with direct knowledge of the testimony.Schiller, Trump's former bodyguard and personal aide, testified that he took the offer as a joke, two of the sources said.On their way up to Trump's hotel room that night, Schiller told the billionaire businessman about the offer and Trump laughed it off, Schiller told the House intelligence committee earlier this week.After several minutes outside of Trump's door, which was Schiller's practice as Trump's security chief, he said he left.Members of the committee raised the matter because of salacious allegations laid out in a dossier compiled by former British agent Christopher Steele, an opposition research document funded by Democrats detailing alleged ties between Trump and his associates with Russians.During this week's closed-door hearing, House lawmakers walked through a Daily Caller article, which raised some of the allegations about Trump's Moscow trip from the dossier and discussed an alternative story involving Schiller's role in rejecting the Russian offer of sending prostitutes to Trump's room.The dossier's claims about Trump's activities in Moscow are some of the most incendiary claims in the memos compiled by Steele, which claimed that Russia obtained "kompromat," or dirt, on Trump to use as blackmail.Trump has long denounced the dossier and flatly denied its assertions.Stuart Sears, an attorney for Schiller, said the chairman and ranking member of the committee should investigate individuals leaking "misleading versions" of Schiller's testimony, calling the conduct "indefensible" and questioning the credibility of the House inquiry."We are appalled by the leaks that are coming from partisan insiders from the House Intelligence Committee," Sears said in a statement."It is outrageous that the very Committee that is conducting an investigation into leaks - purportedly in the public interest - is itself leaking information and defaming cooperative witnesses like Mr.Schiller."During the testimony with the House investigators, Schiller denied knowing about the salacious allegations contained in the dossier.He was also asked about a wide-range of issues, including meetings between Trump associates and Russians, and he denied having knowledge of many of those interactions, sources said.Moreover, he denied knowing about the deliberations around the firing of FBI Director James Comey, saying he was only called into deliver a letter with the news to the FBI.White House officials declined to comment.While Trump and the White House have long rejected the dossier as an attempt to discredit the presidency, the FBI has corroborated some information in the dossier and used it as justification to obtain a surveillance warrant on Trump campaign foreign policy adviser Carter Page, CNN has reported.But federal investigators have not verified the most salacious allegations regarding Trump's activities on his 2013 trip for the Miss Universe Pageant in Moscow.Schiller was asked about the Daily Caller article, and he confirmed a Russian made the offer to send the women to Trump's room which was raised around lunch-time, sources said.He was asked who made the offer, but he could not recall the identity of the individual, sources said.Multiple sources said the offer to send women to Trump's room came from a Russian who was accompanying Emin Agalarov, a pop star whose father is a billionaire oligarch close to Russian President Vladimir Putin and who worked with Trump to bring the pageant to Moscow.But Schiller said the offer did not come from Agalarov himself, the sources said, disputing the Daily Caller report on that matter."Emin has no knowledge of that ever happening," said Scott Balber, an attorney for Agalarov.Dossier subject of controversy Trump has vehemently denied the allegations in the dossier since it was made public in January.At a press conference weeks before taking office, Trump said that he tells his staff before overseas trips, including to Russia, to "be very careful" in their hotel rooms because "you're gonna probably have cameras," and that they could end up on the news if they weren't cautious.Trump has also ramped up his attacks after it became public that the Hillary Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee, through the law firm Perkins Coie, paid opposition research firm Fusion GPS to compile the material that led to the dossier."Clinton campaign & DNC paid for research that led to the anti-Trump Fake News Dossier.The victim here is the President," Trump tweeted last month.Yet before Trump was inaugurated, Comey briefed Trump and outgoing President Barack Obama about the existence of the dossier.Additionally, Comey testified that Trump personally denied to him, on two occasions, that he participated in the salacious activities alleged in the dossier.This all came before Trump fired Comey in May."The President returned to the salacious material I had briefed him about on January 6, and, as he had done previously, expressed his disgust for the allegations and strongly denied them," Comey said about a dinner with Trump in late January."He said he was considering ordering me to investigate the alleged incident to prove it didn't happen."Comey said Trump gave a more explicit denial in a March phone call."He said he had nothing to do with Russia, had not been involved with hookers in Russia, and had always assumed he was being recorded when in Russia," Comey testified.A fateful Moscow trip Investigators probing potential Russia collusion asked Schiller to detail what happened during the 2013 Moscow trip when Trump was in charge of the Miss Universe pageant there.Trump brought the pageant to Moscow with the help of Aras and Emin Agalarov, the Azerbaijani-Russian billionaire oligarch and his pop-star son.The November 2013 event was held at one of their properties in Moscow.Video obtained by CNN in July shows Trump, Schiller, the Agalarovs and music publicist Rob Goldstone attending a July 2013 dinner in Las Vegas.The day after that gathering, the Trump Organization announced it would bring Miss Universe to Moscow.In June 2016, Goldstone connected with the President's eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., at the request of Aras Agalarov to set up the meeting at Trump Tower with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya.Close confidant to Trump Schiller, who is one of Trump's closest confidants, left the White House in September after serving as director of Oval Office operations.As a longtime adviser to Trump, Schiller has been present for some of the most controversial moments of Trump's political career.Trump dispatched Schiller in May to hand-deliver a letter to the FBI headquarters informing Comey of his termination, although Comey was in Los Angeles at the time.UPDATE: This story has been updated with comment from Emin Agalarov's attorney.
Papadopoulos represented Trump campaign at international meetings:::::Washington (CNN) He's been dismissed as a "low-level volunteer" and just a "coffee boy," but former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos represented the Trump campaign at various meetings with foreign officials up until Inauguration Day.In October, Papadopoulos pleaded guilty to making a false statement to the FBI "about the timing, extent and nature of his relationships and interactions with certain foreign nationals whom he understood to have close connections with senior Russian government officials," according to court filings.The former adviser pushed to set up a meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and then-candidate Donald Trump, and had a meeting in April 2016 with a professor who told him that "the Russians" possessed "dirt" on Hillary Clinton in the form of "thousands of emails," according to court filings.Ever since the charges were unsealed last week, Trump's allies have dismissed the former adviser's influence.The President called Papadopoulos a "young, low-level volunteer" on Twitter.Former Trump campaign aide Michael Caputo said he was nothing but a " coffee boy " for the campaign.And White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said he was on a "volunteer advisory council that met one time over the course of a year."But reports show he has acted as a representative for Trump's presidential campaign in a working capacity and as an expert with insight to campaign operations around the world up until January 2017.Meeting regarding Israel A video obtained by The Jerusalem Post shows that he met with Israeli settlers around Inauguration Day in Washington."We had an excellent meeting with (Yossi Dagan, a leader of a West Bank settler group) and we hope that the people of Judea and Samaria will have a great 2017," Papadopoulos said."We are looking forward to ushering in a new relationship with all of Israel, including the historic Judea and Samaria."Judea and Samaria are the biblical names used by some in Israeli government and some pro-Israel groups to argue that the West Bank territory is Jewish land.AJC panel At the time of the 2016 Republican National Convention in Cleveland, Papadopoulos spoke at a foreign policy panel hosted by the American Jewish Committee.Other program panelists included Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tennessee and Reps. Tom Marino, R-Pennsylvania, and Ted Yoho, R-Florida.Based on a review of event video, he was not introduced as a campaign adviser.But in remarks, Papadopoulos referenced at least once working for the campaign.He did not discuss issues connected to Russia.The AJC, in a statement last week, described his participation as part of a broader effort by the group to maintain contacts "among advisers to both parties' 2016 presidential candidates and in the two parties' national committees.""Among the panelists in our 2016 Republican National Convention program -- in a session titled 'Defining America's Role in Global Affairs' -- was George Papadopoulos, then a Trump campaign foreign policy adviser," the statement continued.Meeting with British government official Two months before the presidential election, a British government official met with Papadopoulos for a "working level meeting," a British foreign office spokesperson said in a statement."As you would expect in the run-up to an election, we seek to build links with figures in both the Democratic and Republican presidential campaigns.This type of outreach is normal diplomatic business," the foreign office spokesperson said.The statement said that such meetings are "merely about building links" and added that "representatives of presidential campaigns are treated as private citizens and we would not share confidential information with them."
Trump's abroad but the headlines are at home:::::Da Nang, Vietnam (CNN) When President Donald Trump awoke on his first day in Asia to news that a gunman had massacred more than two dozen people at a church in Texas , it presaged a week of events back home that -- in a well-worn pattern -- have overshadowed his attempts at diplomacy abroad.Like presidents before him, Trump is discovering here that foreign travel can prove an exhausting, scripted exercise that is easily obscured by developments elsewhere in the world.In Japan, South Korea, and China, Trump has dutifully stuck to his talking points about trade fairness and isolating North Korea, while political controversies that would ordinarily spur an outsized response have gone largely unmentioned.Even his eyebrow-raising comment blaming his predecessors -- and not China -- for unfair trade practices was read from a set of prepared remarks.Despite Secretary of State Rex Tillerson's insistence the comment was "tongue-in-cheek," Trump repeated it twice on Friday.The scripted sessions have eased concerns -- both among his Asian counterparts and his own advisers -- that Trump would employ his trademark bombast during intensive talks about delicate subjects.But they have also allowed other stories to eclipse his message.As it turned out, the Texas shooting was only the first interruption.Domestic interruptions An hour before he was due to deliver the centerpiece speech of the trip in Seoul on Wednesday, television networks back home began announcing a wave of Democratic wins in local and state elections -- the first electoral rebuke of Trump since he took office.Three days later, as he prepared to depart Beijing for Vietnam, news emerged that the Alabama Republican Senate candidate, Roy Moore, was accused of making sexual or romantic advances toward teenagers.Throughout the trip, the Russia investigation has crept closer to Trump's inner circle.News emerged Thursday that his top policy aide Stephen Miller , who is traveling with Trump this week and drafted most of his formal remarks, was interviewed by investigators working with special counsel Robert Mueller.And Trump's aide-de-camp Keith Schiller testified behind closed doors at the House Intelligence Committee.Compared to some prior political pitfalls, Trump's response to the wave of Democratic wins on Tuesday was muted.He tweeted the Republican candidate for governor in Virginia, Ed Gillespie, "worked hard but did not embrace me or what I stand for."He left it at that.And news of Moore's alleged sexual improprieties ahead of Alabama's senate election spurred a statement from Trump's spokeswoman, but not from the President himself."The President must and will remain focused on representing our country on his historic trip to Asia, where he has been treated with great respect and made unprecedented progress in further strengthening alliances and promoting America's interest above all else," Sarah Sanders said Yet it may be perfect timing for a president, easily prone to distraction, to be out of town.The constant stream of distractions may outwardly appear to diminish Trump's message in Asia.But some officials traveling with Trump privately say the stream of damaging headlines in the US come at a convenient time.Some said they were relieved the trip has proceeded without any self-inflicted dust-ups, either in Trump's meetings or in the hours he's spending in foreign hotel rooms.Congratulations to all of the "DEPLORABLES" and the millions of people who gave us a MASSIVE (304-227) Electoral College landslide victory!pic.twitter.com/7ifv5gT7Ur Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 8, 2017 The President and aides traveling with him have spent their downtime reminiscing about his election victory a year ago, according to people familiar with the sessions.Trump posted a photo on Twitter Wednesday aboard Air Force One, surrounded by former campaign operatives who are now jetting around Asia representing the United States.They all flashed thumbs-up.The anniversary, paired with a time change and busy schedule that have kept Trump from viewing hours of cable television, has buffered some of his frustrations at GOP election losses this week, which included the Virginia and New Jersey governor's races, according to one official.Presidents abroad In distant time zones, discussing issues that rarely make headlines in the United States, Presidents abroad often find their messages crowded out by unforeseen events or acts of violence, which they're forced to respond to, often belatedly, from the road.Their response then generates its own headlines, and the message of the day -- on trade, security, or human rights -- becomes secondary.On Trump's first foreign trip, a suicide bomber detonated at an Ariana Grande concert in Manchester, England -- Trump's first brush at responding to a crisis while on foreign soil.After learning of the attack inside his Jerusalem hotel room, Trump followed the standard script for a traveling President: secure briefing, phone calls to Washington and a solemn statement delivered before the traveling press corps.It's a cycle President Barack Obama repeated again and again during his foreign travels.In capitals in Asia, Europe and Latin America, Obama often woke up to news of violent incidents in another corner of the globe, either back on US soil or on another continent.When terrorists attacked the airport in Brussels, he was midway through a history-making trip to Cuba.When the Bataclan nightclub in Paris was attacked by gunman, he was hours from departing for security and trade talks in Turkey, the Philippines and Malaysia.And when five police officers were shot in Dallas, Obama was attending NATO talks in Poland -- and cut short a planned visit to Spain to return home.

APEC 2017: Trump delivers 'America first' speech:::::Story highlights "We are not going to let the United States be taken advantage of anymore," Trump said It was a familiar message from Trump Da Nang, Vietnam (CNN) President Donald Trump brought his hard-line economic nationalism to a summit of Pacific Rim leaders here Friday, issuing a stern rebuke of trade practices that have harmed American workers.But the President also continued to insist his US predecessors are to blame."We are not going to let the United States be taken advantage of anymore," Trump said in a speech at the start of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit."I am always going to put America first, the same way I expect all of you in this room to put your countries first."It was a familiar message delivered to an audience that's still coming to grips with Trump's protectionist views.Even as Trump makes his debut appearance at this yearly set of meetings, other leaders are hoping to announce a revamped Trans-Pacific Partnership -- the landmark trade accord negotiated by the Obama administration but scrapped by Trump -- that doesn't included the United States.It's a show of defiance against a US president who has issued a harsh line on trade during his tour of Asia -- but not necessarily against the countries engaging in unfair practices.He renewed his criticism of past US administrations on Friday, saying they ignored the imbalances in trading practices that allowed other countries to take advantage of the US.Read More
Meeting of the strongmen: How did Trump measure up against Xi?:::::Hong Kong (CNN) US President Donald Trump's visit to China caps a month of grand political theater for Beijing, as Chinese President Xi Jinping seeks to position himself as a supremely powerful world leader.At the Chinese Communist Party Congress two weeks ago, Xi shored up his absolute control over Chinese politics and pledged to oversee the country's rejuvenation and return to great power status.Trump's visit gave Xi the chance to demonstrate Chinese power and prestige like never before.Unlike previous stops in Japan and South Korea -- where Trump boasted of US military strength, instructed the country's leaders how many weapons they were to buy, and received ebullient praise from them in return -- the China trip was much more a meeting of equals.The country that Trump once accused of " raping " the US rolled out the reddest of red carpets for him during his stay in Beijing, treating Trump to an exceptionally rare official dinner in the Forbidden City , cultural events, and a grand welcoming ceremony featuring hundreds of cheering children in front of the Great Hall of the People, the seat of China's parliament.Trump was clearly impressed, effusively thanking Xi on Twitter for "an unforgettable afternoon and evening at the Forbidden City in Beijing," his gratitude overriding the potential faux pas of using a social media site banned by China while in the country US President Donald Trump's Twitter displays a photo of him and Chinese President Xi Jinping at the Forbidden City in Beijing, China.The US President even updated his Twitter profile page to prominently feature a photo of him and Xi at the Forbidden City.At a joint speech with Xi, Trump heaped further praise on the Chinese leader, saying his people were "very proud" of him and hailing the "very good chemistry between the two of us."Xi was less generous in his praise, thanking Trump but stopping short of personal compliments.While the greeting laid on for him obviously impressed Trump, he was also able to charm Xi and his wife, showing them videos of his granddaughter, Arabella, singing in Mandarin.The same video was played at a state dinner on Thursday and was shared widely on Chinese social media.Exclusive: #DonaldTrump's granddaughter #Arabella singing in mandarin, reciting part of Three-Character Classic and ancient Chinese poems pic.twitter.com/KwOyVeK6ZW China Xinhua News (@XHNews) November 8, 2017 Positive reception Unlike both of President Obama's trips to China, Trump's went without major incident.Obama's relationship to China was focused around his "pivot to Asia," as well as strong opposition from Washington to Chinese expansion in the South China Sea.The South China Sea was barely mentioned by Trump or Xi, with the Chinese President only appearing to reference the matter obliquely, highlighting the importance of respect for "territorial sovereignty.""The Pacific Ocean is big enough to accommodate both China and the US," Xi added.Later, US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson told reporters Trump and Xi had "frank, open and productive" discussions behind closed doors which covered disputes in the South China Sea.In the coming months and years ahead I look forward to building an even STRONGER relationship between the United States and China.pic.twitter.com/mK3SB7t3EV Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 9, 2017 The Chinese media was delighted with Trump's trip, with an analyst on state-run broadcaster CCTV saying the US President "has given China what China wants, which is that respect on the global stage, as the other preeminent nation."Global Times, a state-run tabloid known for nationalistic editorials, said Trump "seems to be pragmatic on his Beijing policy, and has no interest in ideological diplomacy.""He hasn't used the issue of human rights to make trouble for China so far, and this means the Sino-US relationship can focus on substantive matters," the paper said It criticized the US media, a frequent target for Trump himself, for "absurd reports (which) deeply influenced Chinese public opinion," adding "it wasn't until his election victory that the Chinese public realized they had been cheated by the American media."JUST WATCHED Trump: Can't blame China for taking advantage Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Trump: Can't blame China for taking advantage 01:05 Limited gains The US President's language about China is a far cry from that of candidate Trump, who was highly critical of Beijing's trade and economic policies.Promises to label China a currency manipulator or impose double-digit tariffs on imports have not borne out, despite preliminary work by US investigators into Chinese steel and aluminum trade and alleged theft of US intellectual property.Trump had played up his experience in deal making and promised to deliver economic wins from China.While he did succeed in signing more than $250 billion in trade agreements, analysts were skeptical of the gains made."President Trump got a number of tweetable concessions, but none of which significantly changed the nature of the relationship," said Nick Marro, China analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU)."Presidential visits have historically secured policy changes, and so this visit was somewhat of a missed opportunity.China was able to resist further market access openings, which is disappointing for the foreign business community."He added it was unclear how much of the $250 billion in deals "were a result of the visit, or repackaged as part of the outcomes for political purposes."I don't blame China, I blame the incompetence of past Admins for allowing China to take advantage of the U.S. on trade leading up to a point where the U.S. is losing $100's of billions.How can you blame China for taking advantage of people that had no clue?I would've done same!Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 9, 2017 Jacob Parker, Beijing-based vice president of the US-China Business Council, said he was "encouraged to see (Trump's) focus on leveling the playing field for foreign companies here.""Unfortunately, we've heard this rhetoric before (from both sides)," he added."Only in the next couple of months will we be able to determine what the follow up actions might be."What criticism Trump did have for China on trade imbalances was undercut by his highlighting the cause as US policy, not Chinese."I don't blame China, who can blame a country for being able to take advantage of another country for the benefit of its citizens," he said."I give China great credit."JUST WATCHED N.

Korea responds to Trump's personal attack 02:12 Korea crisis The ongoing North Korea crisis has dominated Trump's Asia trip, with the President harshly criticizing Pyongyang repeatedly.But once tough language on China's role in the crisis -- Beijing remains Pyongyang's only real ally and multiple US administrations have called on it to do more to rein in its neighbor -- has been replaced by a more conciliatory, bridge-building approach.At a press conference with South Korean President Moon Jae-in, Trump said Xi "has been very helpful" on the North Korean issue.Speaking alongside Xi Thursday, Trump said "China can fix (the North Korea) problem easily and quickly.""I am calling on China and your great President to hopefully work on it very hard," he added."I know one thing about your President, if he works on it hard, he will make it happen."Marro, the EIU analyst, said the "most significant Chinese concession on North Korea would have been a pledge for China to end its crude oil exports to the regime, but so far this remains unlikely.""The fact that both leaders only vaguely agreed that a 'solution exists' indicates that they have not yet been able to come to a strategic consensus," he said.Xie Tao, a professor of political science at the Beijing Foreign Studies University, said Trump "seems to have been putting almost all his eggs in one Chinese basket when it comes to North Korea.""Finally maybe the idea has dawned on him that there is only so much that China can do and is willing to do," he said.But while a relaxing of US pressure on China to act against North Korea could be seen as a win for Beijing, Xie warned it could result in Washington being more forceful on other issues it may be holding back currently."If Trump decides China is no longer such a pivotal player in resolving the North Korea issue then that relationship could have a downturn," he said.JUST WATCHED The cult of Xi Jinping Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH The cult of Xi Jinping 02:46 Great power relations Prior to the trip, much attention had been paid to Xi's apparent consolidation of power in the wake of China's Party Congress.In contrast, Trump landed in Beijing amid historically low approval ratings and under the shadow of the Russia probe.Not that the US leader is ready to step aside as the world's most powerful man.When the President was asked by reporters prior to his trip what he thought about the remarkable run Xi is currently enjoying, he offered a quick retort."Excuse me, so am I," Trump said , citing the "highest stock market in history, lowest unemployment in 17 years, a military that's rapidly rebuilding, ISIS is virtually defeated in the Middle East.We are coming off some of the strongest numbers we've ever had," Trump said."He respects that, and he's a friend of mine.We're friends."This narrative also ignores the difference between Xi's hyper-controlled public image and Trump's far more open one , which also has to contend with an increasingly aggressive US press corp and opposition politicians in both major US parties."At this moment it's very tempting to see the two leaders in a very dramatically different position, both domestically and internationally," said Xie Tao of Beijing Foreign Studies University, adding that he advised against reading too much into public statements.Regardless of their individual power, the two Presidents' relationship does seem to be genuinely strong: Trump's tone on China softened significantly after he established regular contact with Xi."Every time we've seen the leaders meet, the relationship has rebounded into positive territory," Marro said."But personal relationships have their limits, and there's enough tension with trade investigations and North Korea that there's still a risk that relations will deteriorate."Xie agreed, saying "what we're seeing now is more a sign of personal rapport.""But I would not really put a lot of bets on significant improvement of (the US-China) relationship," he added."There are many structural factors that put the relationship under very strong stress."
Donald Trump trades barbs for flattery to win over China:::::Beijing (CNN) Outside the Great Hall of the People here on Thursday, President Donald Trump watched with an unmistakable air of satisfaction as cordons of Chinese troops marched stiff-legged in his honor, an eight-cannon salute preceding their parade.It was just the latest display of elaborate pageantry put on by his Chinese hosts, and inside the cavernous state edifice two hours later, the outsized display of flattery appeared to pay off.Instead of lashing China for trade practices he once compared to rape and theft , he praised the country and its powerful leader, Xi Jinping , for cunningly exploiting the US to benefit his own citizens -- and harm American workers."Who can blame a country for being able taking advantage of another country for the benefit of its citizens?"Trump said as Xi watched on from a few feet away .Nervous laughter rippled through the crowd of Chinese and American business executives, whose firms are inking new deals here in a spectacle meant to demonstrate Trump's negotiating prowess."I give China great credit," he added."In actuality, I do blame past administrations for allowing this trade deficit to take place and grow."Trump reaffirmed his position Friday morning, tweeting: "I don't blame China, I blame the incompetence of past Admins for allowing China to take advantage of the U.S. on trade leading up to a point where the U.S. is losing $100's of billions.How can you blame China for taking advantage of people that had no clue?I would've done same!"I don't blame China, I blame the incompetence of past Admins for allowing China to take advantage of the U.S. on trade leading up to a point where the U.S. is losing $100's of billions.How can you blame China for taking advantage of people that had no clue?I would've done same!Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 9, 2017 It was a remarkable show of deference to Xi, who emerged from last month's Communist Party Congress the most powerful Chinese leader in a generation.And while US officials downplayed the significance of the remark, it nevertheless laid bare the lengths to which Trump is prioritizing his personal chemistry with his counterparts here as he seeks to advance an agenda of isolating North Korea and brokering new trade deals.Trump's praise for his Chinese counterpart wasn't limited to the remarks at the signing ceremony for the $250 billion in US-Chinese business deals.At the top of a bilateral meeting, the accolades dripped from Trump's mouth as he expressed his gratitude for the welcome mat Xi had laid out.They had an "absolutely terrific" dinner.It was a "very, very great honor" to be together.The military display was "magnificent."And their relationship?"A great one."Trump did not avoid pointing out China's "unfair trade practices" and its "theft of intellectual property," but his conclusion that the imbalance in the US-Chinese trade relationship was the fault of his predecessors ignored the role of China's system of state-run enterprises and limiting market access policies.'Tongue in cheek' Trump's discussions with Xi yielded no immediate signs that the structural changes needed to rebalance the relationship were coming."There was a little bit of tongue in cheek in that characterization, but there was also a lot of truth to it," Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said in explaining Trump's remark."I think what the President was just reflecting on is, look, we are where we are because previous administrations, whether through benign neglect -- which is my own characterization of it -- or for whatever reasons allowed this to happen."Trump's absolution of Chinese blame on trade matters, a day after the anniversary of his election, were a stunning statement from the man who vilified China at every turn during the presidential campaign, accusing the country of having "raped" the US and branding it as an "economic enemy."Trump has held few consistent positions on policy issues during his decades of flirtation with a presidential run, but his stance on China has long been a notable exception.His long-held view of China as an economic boogeyman became a central part of his "Make America Great Again" campaign platform that promised a rebirth of US manufacturing."We can't continue to allow China to rape our country and that's what they're doing.It's the greatest theft in the history of the world," Trump told a campaign crowd in May 2016.But Trump's heavy-handed criticism of China was often also mixed with a similar dose of criticism for US officials, whom he accused of getting outmaneuvered by Chinese negotiators."You can win against China if you're smart.But our people don't have a clue.We give state dinners to the heads of China.I said why are you doing state dinners for them?They're ripping us left and right.Just take them to McDonald's and go back to the negotiating table," Trump told a crowd in the first summer of his presidential campaign.While Trump publicly took a more conciliatory approach to China, several thousand miles away in Michigan, his former chief strategist, Steve Bannon, carried forward the mantle of Trump's past criticism, warning that the country is a "dictatorship that sees us as an enemy to be defeated."With that backdrop, it remains unclear how Trump's more measured approach to his old campaign trail villain will go over with his base, including those blue-collar voters in Michigan who are counting on Trump to take a hardline against China -- and are still listening to Bannon.Trump's formula So far, it appears Trump's formula for winning against China amounts to excessive praise and, at least publicly, absolving China of blame for its role in crafting policies that have disadvantaged the US.Trump also avoided putting his host in an uncomfortable position, making none of the demands his past three predecessors have made that Xi take questions alongside him from independent journalists.Touring Asia this week for the first time, Trump has found plenty of leaders willing to satisfy his craving for praise.Facing political headwinds back home -- including sagging approval ratings, an investigation into his campaign's ties to Russia, and this week a resounding defeat for Republicans in state elections -- Trump has basked in the thrall of making new friends.In Tokyo, Trump was greeted by custom hats ordered up by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe that read "Donald and Shinzo: Make Alliance Even Greater."The two men signed them with markers as reporters looked on.Two days later in Seoul, the President's campaign slogan surfaced again."President Trump's election victory one year ago is already making America great again," President Moon Jae-in announced during a toast ahead of a state dinner.From Riyadh to Paris to Beijing, world leaders have consistently returned to Chapter 1 of the Trump textbook as they prepare for a visit from Trump: flattery will get you everywhere.Whether he's being feted by sword wielding dancers or reviewing rows of French troops, Trump has relished formal state welcomes and the importance they confer upon him as he jets aboard Air Force One to global capitals.Even before Trump took office, his eye toward a presidential reception proved unsparing.When President Barack Obama was denied a set of carpeted air-stairs from which to descend Air Force One at the start of last year's G20 talks in Hangzhou, China, Trump declared at a campaign rally that such an indignity wouldn't happen on his watch."If that were me," Trump said, "I'd say, 'You know what folks, I respect you a lot, let's close the doors, let's get out of here.'" When Trump arrived in Beijing on Wednesday, the stairs were there.
Trump's approval rating is bad. Views of the economy are good. That's weird.:::::Washington (CNN) It's the economy, stupid -- at least, until it isn't.A new CNN poll conducted by SSRS released on Wednesday has some good news for the American economy: More people have a positive view of economic conditions now than at any point since before the 9/11 terror attacks in 2001.But for Trump, that hasn't translated into any kind of a boost in his approval ratings.That's right: Despite economic optimism soaring to a broad, bipartisan 68% positive rating, Trump's approval rating keeps sinking -- now at a new low of 36% this week in a new CNN poll.And that's a little weird.In fact, that gap between the strong economy and Trump's low approval rating -- 32 points -- is the largest negative split in more than two decades of polls from CNN and Gallup.Read More

Trump Calls Putin Sincere, Ex-US Intelligence Heads 'Hacks':::::The German government released a video of world leaders shaking hands at the G-20 summit in Hamburg, Germany, on July 7, 2017, including the first meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin.(Published Friday, July 7, 2017) Days before returning home from a whirlwind trip to Asia, President Donald Trump was back on the defensive over Russian election meddling, saying he considers President Vladimir Putin's denials sincere, dismissing former U.S. intelligence officials as "hacks" and accusing Democrats of trying to sabotage relations between the two countries.Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One, Trump said Russian President Vladimir Putin had again vehemently insisted this time on the sidelines of an economic summit in Vietnam that Moscow had not interfered in the 2016 U.S. elections.Trump declined to say whether he believed Putin, but he made clear he wasn't interested in dwelling on the issue."He said he absolutely did not meddle in our election.He did not do what they are saying he did," Trump said as he traveled to Hanoi, the second-to-last stop of his Asia trip."Every time he sees me, he said: 'I didn't do that.'And I believe I really believe that when he tells me that, he means it," Trump said.He called the accusation an "artificial barrier" erected by Democrats once again casting doubt on the U.S. intelligence community's conclusion that Russia tried to interfere in the election to help the Republican Trump beat Democrat Hillary Clinton.Trump, Putin Discuss 'Very Good' First Sit-Down Meeting U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin addressed the media during their first in-person meeting.The talks took place during the G-20 summit in Germany.(Published Friday, July 7, 2017) Trump is in Hanoi for a brief state visit.He'll depart for the Philippines later Sunday for a pair of summits that will close out his trip.Trump and Putin did not have a formal meeting while they were in Vietnam for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit, but the two spoke informally several times and reached an agreement on a number of principles for the future of war-torn Syria.Trump made clear that the issue of Russian meddling in the election hovers over the leaders' relationship and said it jeopardized their ability to work together on issues including North Korea's escalating nuclear program and the deadly conflict in Syria."Having a good relationship with Russia's a great, great thing.And this artificial Democratic hit job gets in the way," Trump told reporters."People will die because of it."Trump danced around the question of whether he believed Putin's denials, telling reporters that pressing the issue would have accomplished little."Well, look, I can't stand there and argue with him," Trump said."I'd rather have him get out of Syria, to be honest with you.I'd rather have him, you know, work with him on the Ukraine than standing and arguing about whether or not 'cause that whole thing was set up by the Democrats."Trump Tweets Syrian Cease-Fire Negotiations With Russia President Donald Trump called for expanded cooperation with Russia on Sunday, as a cease-fire brokered by the two powers and Jordan for southern Syria went into effect.(Published Sunday, July 9, 2017) Multiple U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that Moscow meddled in the 2016 election to try to help Trump win.But Trump called the former heads of those agencies "political hacks" and argued there's plenty of reason to be suspicious of their findings.The comments made clear that Trump still does not take the meddling seriously and sees little benefit in punishing a nation accused of undermining the most fundamental tenet of American democracy: free and fair elections.They also suggest that Trump is unlikely to work aggressively to try to prevent future meddling despite repeated warnings from senior intelligence officials that Russia is likely to try to interfere again.Meanwhile, a special counsel investigation of potential collusion between Moscow and Trump campaign aides so far has resulted in two indictments for financial and other crimes unrelated to the campaign, as well as a guilty plea.Congressional committees have also been interviewing campaign and White House staff."Trump really raised the topic of so-called interference in US elections," Putin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, was quoted by Russian news agencies as telling reporters."Putin categorically rejected even the hypothetical possibility that Russia could have in some way interfered in the U.S. electoral process."Earlier Saturday, the Kremlin issued a statement saying the leaders had reached agreement on a number of principles for the future of civil war-torn Syria now that the Islamic State group has largely been pushed out.Among the agreements' key points, according to the Russians, were an affirmation of de-escalation zones, a system to prevent dangerous incidents between American and Russian forces, and a commitment to a peaceful solution governed by a Geneva peace process.The Kremlin quickly promoted the agreement as the White House stayed silent.Trump told reporters that the deal was reached "very quickly" and that it would save "tremendous numbers of lives."And he praised his relationship with Putin, saying the two "seem to have a very good feeling for each other and a good relationship, considering we don't know each other well."Trump Delivers 'America First' Speech at APEC CEO Summit President Trump delivered a speech at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation CEO Summit 2017, saying he does not blame China for "taking advantage of" the U.S. when it comes to

group photo.The two walked together down a path to the photo site, conversing amiably, with Trump punctuating his thoughts with hand gestures and Putin smiling.Journalists traveling with Trump were not granted access to any of the APEC events he participated in Saturday.Trump's visit to Hanoi began with a state diner during which he showered the country with praise, saying it has "truly become one of the great miracles of the world."On Sunday, he'll meet with the country's president and prime minister before heading to his last stop: the Philippines.

There Was Another Winner Tuesday  Obamacares Medicaid Expansion:::::Democrat Ralph Northam handily won the hard fought Virginia governor's race over Republican Ed Gillespie, a contest watched across the country as an early referendum on President Donald Trump, NBC News reports.New4's Justin Finch spoke to voters about why they went to the polls Tuesday.(Published Wednesday, Nov. 8, 2017) Barack Obama may not be running for anything these days, but his signature health care law was a big winner in Tuesdays elections, as voters rebelled against Republican lawmakers who have blocked Obamacare's Medicaid expansion.Democrats are hopeful their victories are a harbinger of further gains as they look to capitalize on the law's rising popularity in polls and repeal legislation's deep unpopularity with more ballot initiatives, legislative efforts and campaign messages.In Maine, voters passed a ballot initiative that would expand Medicaid to an estimated 70,000 residents by a margin of 18 points, 59-to-41, doing an end run around Gov.Paul LePage, a Republican who has vetoed five bills to do so.LePage is already threatening to block the measure unless legislators can find a way to finance it without raising taxes, saying in a statement that "this fiscally irresponsible Medicaid expansion will be ruinous to Maines budget."

Democrats' Victories Give a 'Formula for Success': Analysis:::::Democrat Ralph Northam won the hard fought Virginia governor's race over Republican Ed Gillespie, and Democrats also won Virginia's lieutenant governor and attorney general offices.News4's Julie Carey and David Culver report.Democrats had blow-out victories in Virginia and across the country Tuesday, leaving party officials in the unfamiliar position winning as they prepare for next year's midterm elections, NBC News reported.The party had come up short in every special congressional election this year, much of which was spent in-fighting.But President Donald Trump's unpopularity is starting to pay off at the ballot box."The America that Donald Trump left when he went to South Korea bares little resemblance to the America that he will return to because he has gotten a shot across the bow," Democratic National Committee Chair Tom Perez told NBC News."The formula for success (Tuesday night) is the formula for success we're using everywhere."Now, the party is drawing lessons from what the outgoing Virginia governor, a former DNC chair himself, called a "jet takeoff" of a lift for the party: Ride the wave, compete in more districts, rock the suburbs and more.Trump Delivers 'America First' Speech at APEC CEO Summit

Rev. Al Sharpton: President Trump Is the Same Blowhard I Knew in New York:::::Taking the stage to chants of USA!USA!Donald Trump addressed both his supporters and the nation as the president-elect of the United States, noting that he received a call from Secretary Clinton conceding the race to him.He said she has worked very hard and long."We owe her a major debt of gratitude for her service to our country," Trump said of Clinton."I mean that very sincerely.Now its time for America to bind the wounds of division."(Published Wednesday, Nov. 9, 2016) A year after Donald Trump was elected president, activist and MSNBC host Rev.Al Sharpton took stock of Trump's tenure in an essay for NBC News' THINK opinion section: As a native New Yorker, I have watched Donald Trumps star rise and fall over the past 30 years.Over my long career as both an advocate and politician, I have spoken with, argued against, and counseled the last four U.S. presidents.I have, to varying degrees, marched, fought and celebrated with the Bushs, Clintons and Obamas.And the conclusion I have come to is that Donald Trumps temperament, intellect and emotional health make him wholly unqualified to serve as President of the United States of America.This is not a new argument, I realize.Many people before me have said similar things.But now we have something approaching definite proof that not only is nothing going to change, this is a man incapable of change.Whether vehemently disagreeing with President George W. Bush during the start of the Iraq war or pushing back against President Bill Clintons welfare reform policy, our arguments were based in subject matter, but never character.It was professional, not personal.In the Trump era, however, the opposite is true.
Roy Moore blasted by woman's lawyer: 'He knows full well' why the women kept quiet:::::Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore on Saturday again adamantly denied sexual misconduct allegations and promised that "revelations about the motivations" behind the news report of his alleged behavior will come out in a few days.Interested in Roy Moore?Add Roy Moore as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Roy Moore news, video, and analysis from ABC News.Add Interest His Democratic opponent, Doug Jones, meanwhile said Moore needs "to answer to the people of Alabama" about the "very serious allegations."And the lawyer for a woman who says Moore dated her when she was 18 and he was in his 30s and supplied her with alcohol before she was of legal drinking age responded later Saturday to the candidate's comments.Paula Cobia, lawyer for Gloria Deason, blasted Moore for making what she called "defamatory statements" about "4 brave women.""He knows full well why these women did not tell what he did to them before this week," Cobia wrote in a statement posted on Facebook on Saturday."As young teenage girls in the late 1970s in a small, rural southern town, they had no way of knowing their rights, especially against him considering that he was a district attorney at the time."Cobia was reacting to Moore's speech at a Veterans Day event in the Birmingham area, where he questioned why allegations about his behavior 40 years ago are coming out at this time.The Republican former judge slammed the claims as politically motivated "fake news."Why now?"Moore said."For 40 years I have been closely scrutinized in the press and the public media."The answer, he suggested, is that "Democrats and the Republican establishment know the importance of this election.In fact, most people in America know the importance of this election.They see it as a prelude of the elections coming in 2018.It may very well determine the future of our country."Moore, who is running to fill the Alabama seat vacated by Jeff Sessions when he became attorney general, faces allegations first reported by the Washington Post that he engaged in sexual activity with a 14-year-old when he was 32 and pursued other girls, including Gloria Deason, when they were between the ages of 16 and 18 and he was in his 30s.He said Saturday that "revelations" will be coming out on the motivations behind the article.In the next few days, there will be revelations about the motivations and the content of this article," Moore said."They will be brought to the public.We fully expect the people of Alabama to see through this charade."The Senate candidate received a standing ovation from the crowd.The lawyer for Deason in her statement on Facebook countered that the women who told their stories to the Washington Post did not seek the media attention."Why did the women speak out now?Because someone (The Post reporters) finally showed up at their doors and asked them to tell what he did to them," Cobia wrote.Moore's Democratic rival, Jones, on Saturday told ABC News affiliate in Birmingham, WBMA-TV, that the claims against Moore are "very serious allegations.I think he does need to do more than just simply deny them."Asked if he had anything to do with the allegations against Moore coming to light, Jones said, "Absolutely not.That's just another in a continuing pattern of absurd statements that Moore and his campaign made ....It's just absurd."
Walmart shopper hurt while buying melon wins $7.5M verdict:::::An Alabama man who said he tripped and broke his hip while buying a watermelon at a Walmart store has won a $7.5 million verdict in his lawsuit against the retailer.Henry Walker on Wednesday was awarded the damages after a jury trial in Phenix City, Alabama, just west of the Georgia state line, court records show.Walker had sued Arkansas-based Wal-Mart Stores Inc., saying his foot became trapped in a pallet beneath the watermelons as he reached for one of the fruits at a Phenix City Walmart on June 25, 2015."We are disappointed in the verdict," Walmart spokesman Randy Hargrove said Thursday."We appreciate the jury's service, however we believe that the damages awarded were excessive in light of the facts in this case.We plan to appeal."Walmart should have covered the pallet so that it could not entangle a shopper's foot, Charles Gower, one of Walker's attorneys, told The Columbus Ledger-Enquirer .In court records and in testimony, Walmart has maintained that the display was not dangerous, and that any negligence was Walker's fault.In fact, the same displays are still used, it said."Walmart continues to display watermelons in the same manner as it did on June 25, 2015," the company in a court filing on Wednesday."These displays come to the store from the producer already packaged and ready to be dropped and displayed."
Major differences in House, Senate tax proposals:::::The House and Senate tax overhaul plans are broadly similar, but crucial differences are creating headaches for Republican leaders determined to keep myriad interest groups and factions of the GOP satisfied.And then there's the ambitious timetable they've set of finishing in time to get legislation to President Donald Trump by Christmas.The most politically challenging decisions involve dealing with popular and widely used tax deductions, structuring tax cuts for business and balancing personal income tax rates between middle-class families and the rich.All of these decisions come against a generous but firm 10-year, $1.5 trillion cap on the measure's cost to the federal deficit.Both House and Senate have adopted accounting gimmicks to squeeze tax cuts that appear larger down to fit that restraint.Trump's enormously expensive demand for a cut in the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from the current 35 percent is a big complication, as is unrest among House Republicans hailing from affluent suburban districts who are upset over the proposed loss of the deduction for state income taxes.A rundown on the major differences between the House and Senate bills: INDIVIDUAL TAX RATES The Senate measure keeps the current number of personal income tax brackets, seven, though it changes the rates to 10, 12, 22.5, 25, 32.5, 35 and 38.5 percent.That last top bracket for the wealthiest earners carries a higher rate of 39.6 percent under current law.The House bill goes further toward simplifying the tax system.It shrinks the number of brackets from seven to four, with rates of 12, 25, 35 and 39.6 percent.Lots of numbers here for congressional negotiators to play with, to move up or down.The inheritance tax on multimillion dollar estates, called the estate tax, is an especially hot-button issue.Democrats point to the proposed GOP changes as proof that the Republicans are out to help wealthy people like Trump and his family.Currently, when someone dies, the person inheriting the estate must pay taxes on its value above $5.5 million for individuals, $11 million for couples.The House bill initially doubles those limits and then repeals the whole tax after 2023.The Senate version doubles those exemption amounts but doesn't repeal the tax.To repeal or not to repeal?That may be the class-warfare question.DEDUCTIONS The Senate bill would eliminate a taxpayer's ability to deduct state income taxes and local property taxes.But the final bill may have to closely track a House compromise that provides a property tax deduction of up to $10,000 or else risk a revolt from GOP lawmakers from New York, New Jersey, and California.The Senate bill preserves popular individual tax breaks for large medical expenses, mortgage interest, electric vehicles and college costs that were targeted by the House.The House limits deductibility of mortgage interest to the first $500,000 of a loan, riling the real estate and housing industries, and eliminates a deduction for medical expenses that's often taken by families facing crippling nursing home costs.BUSINESS Both the House and Senate versions slash the tax rate for corporations to 20 percent from the current 35 percent.But there's a big twist: The Senate bill delays the rate cut for a year.The delay was put in to reduce the bill's cost by $100 billion or so but it's opposed by the White House and House Republicans.Wall Street hates it too.U.S. stock markets sold off Thursday in response to news of the proposed deferral, with industrial and technology stocks leading the decline, before recouping some of the losses by the close of trading.Might the implementation delay be traded for a smaller corporate tax cut, something above 20 percent?Trump actually had been demanding 15 percent and reportedly was initially furious at the 20 percent figure.The issue is setting the corporate rate at a level that experts and tax writers believe would bring the U.S. closer to its overseas competitors.The electric car industry notably makers Tesla and Chevrolet and producers of wind power for generating electricity are losers under the House bill.The tax credit of up to $7,500 for plug-in electric vehicles would be repealed, and the credit for wind energy would be reduced.But the Senate version retains the incentives.The loss of tax credits for renewable energy would free billions to help pay for the corporate tax cuts in the legislation.But in addition to environmentalists' objections, the prospect also angers some Republican senators, including powerful Chuck Grassley of Iowa, who has vowed to defend the credit.There's a special rate for businesses whose profits are counted in the owners' personal tax returns.Millions of U.S. businesses use this "pass-through" format.The House bill taxes many of them at a maximum 25 percent, down from 39.6 percent currently, and adds a lower minimum rate.The Senate version would set a new 17.4 percent deduction for "pass-through" income, aimed to help smaller businesses.
State Department offers buyouts as critics charge Trump administration with destroying diplomatic corps:::::A State Department official confirms to ABC News that the department is offering "voluntary buyouts and early retirement incentives" as part of its effort to reduce its own ranks.Interested in Trump Administration?Add Trump Administration as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Trump Administration news, video, and analysis from ABC News.Add Interest The Trump administration wants to get rid of 641 employees -- in addition to "normal attrition" -- by the end of 2018, in particular "to reduce unnecessary supervisory levels and organizational layering," the official said."The Department's goal is to meet its workforce reduction targets through the use of voluntary measures such as buyouts rather than involuntary measures, such as furloughs or ... layoffs," the official added.The federal government's Office of Personnel Management and Office of Management and Budget both approved the buyouts -- which can reach a maximum of $25,000 before taxes, depending on the employee's level.The agency has also frozen all new hiring and any promotions in an effort to limit the number of employees.The news comes after a scathing letter from the Foreign Service union's president, questioning why the administration was depleting the diplomatic corps' ranks at a "dizzying speed" and raising red flags about "plummeting" interest in Foreign Service careers.The State Department pushed back against that report, by ABC News and others, providing different numbers than the American Foreign Service Association -- even though both said they got their numbers from the State Department's Human Resources bureau.But Friday night's news is being taken as another sign that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and the Trump administration are hollowing out the agency.Richard Haass, the president of the Council on Foreign Relations and a close adviser to George W. Bush's Secretary of State, Colin Powell, tweeted a link to the New York Times, which first reported the buyouts, and said Tillerson's "focus on cutting staff, spending [is] misguided given need for diplomacy & Trump admin acute lack of experience."SecState focus on cutting staff, spending misguided given need for diplomacy & Trump admin acute lack of experience https://t.co/6ExdQGfqA7 Richard N.

Roy Moore's supporters still 'believe in him' as GOP senators withdraw endorsements:::::Two Republican senators who initially backed Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore have rescinded their endorsements in response to allegations of sexual misconduct.Interested in Roy Moore?Add Roy Moore as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Roy Moore news, video, and analysis from ABC News.Add Interest Sens.Mike Lee of Utah and Steven Daines of Montana have withdrawn their support.GOP Sen. John McCain of Arizona, meanwhile, has said Moore should "immediately step aside" from the election on Dec. 12, and Bob Corker of Tennessee tweeted Saturday that he had never supported the controversial former judge.Look, I'm sorry, but even before these reports surfaced, Roy Moore's nomination was a bridge too far.Senator Bob Corker (@SenBobCorker) November 11, 2017 But at least some supporters of Moore in Alabama are standing by him, saying they don't believe the allegations.I think most conservative Christians are going to vote for him because they believe in him, Nancy Fluker of Wilsonville, Alabama, about 32 miles southeast of Birmingham, told ABC affiliate WBMA-TV in Birmingham.They believe in his reputation.They believe in his record."Moore, who is running to fill the Alabama Senate seat vacated by Jeff Sessions when he became attorney general, faces allegations first reported by the Washington Post that he engaged in sexual activity with a 14-year-old when he was 32 and pursued other girls when they were between the ages of 16 and 18 and he was in his 30s.Some political observers in Alabama said they think fallout from the allegations against Moore may depress turnout at the polls and that many Republicans may choose to write in another name rather than vote for the former judge."I imagine there are going to be certain people who will not want to vote for the Democrat, but who will not want to vote for [Moore] and I imagine that there will be a write-in," said former Alabama Supreme Court Justice Gorman Houston who ran as a Republican but now considers himself an independent."A lot of people will write in" candidates, he said.But in Shelby County, Alabama, on the outskirts of Birmingham, many who spoke to WBMA-TV said they are sticking by Moore.Nancy Fluker and her husband, Gordon, said they believe Moore's denial of having had a sexual encounter with a 14-year-old when he was 32.I believe him that he didn't do it, Gordon Fluker said.I think it's something someone waited until an opportune moment to put on the news across the world, to downgrade him.Similarly, Susan Conn, who owns Main Street Florist in downtown Columbiana, Alabama, told WBMA-TV, she is suspicious of the timing of the allegations.I just don't see how he could be guilty now and not be guilty in all these other elections in which he ran, Conn said.Conn said she voted for Moore's Republican rival in the primary runoff, Luther Strange, but will now vote for Moore in the general election.Him being a Christian, I would hate to know he's guilty of anything like that, said Conn.He really does seem like he does what he thinks he's supposed to do.I just don't believe he's guilty.Houston, the former Alabama Supreme Court justice, said Moore has a group of loyal supporters who are unlikely to abandon him.Houston served on the state's high court during a battle over Moore's monument to the Ten Commandments that he placed in the state judicial building in Montgomery.Moore was elected chief justice of the state Supreme Court in 1999 but was removed in 2003 by the Alabama Court of the Judiciary for willfully and publicly defying a federal court's orders to remove the monument.Houston said that when he disagreed with Moore about the appropriateness of the monument, he received hate mail from supporters of his fellow judge."Just the hate that they had for those of that did not go along with Roy Moore.It was really something," Houston said.
Trump, Putin meet 1-on-1 on sidelines of APEC Summit, discuss Russian meddling in election:::::President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin met on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit (APEC) in Vietnam Saturday, according to the White House.Interested in Russia Investigation?Add Russia Investigation as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Russia Investigation news, video, and analysis from ABC News.Add Interest During the brief meeting, which lasted less than five minutes, the White House said the two leaders discussed a joint statement on Syria, as well as alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 election.Trump spoke to reporters on Air Force One before landing in Hanoi, Vietnam on Saturday evening local time, reiterating that Putin said he did not meddle in the election."He said he didn't meddle," Trump told reporters."He said he didn't meddle.I asked him again.You can only ask so many times.I just asked him again.He said he absolutely did not meddle in our election.He did not do what they are saying he did."WHITE HOUSE Asked if he believed Putins denial, the president didnt directly answer but suggested he didnt directly counter Putins denial.Well look I cant stand there and argue with him, Trump said.Id rather have him get out of Syria to be honest with you.Id rather have him, you know, work with him on the Ukraine than standing and arguing about whether or not [Russia meddled in the election], because that whole thing was set up by the Democrats.I mean they ought to look at [former Hillary Clinton campaign chairman John] Podesta.They ought to look at all of the things theyve done with the phony dossier."Trump went on to say that he believes Putin "means it" when he denies meddling in the election."Every time he sees me he says, 'I didn't do that,' and I really believe that when he tells me that, he means it.But he says, 'I didn't do that.'I think he is very insulted by it, which is not a good thing for our country," Trump said.He also suggested that the issue of North Korea would be a lot more easily resolved "if we had relationship with Russia....It would be helped a lot."The White House confirmed that the meeting took place on Saturday after having ruled out a formal meeting would occur just a day prior, citing scheduling conflicts on both sides, after weeks of speculation on the topic.Per a statement from Russia, the two leaders "agreed that there is no military solution to the conflict in Syria" and that a political solution must come through the Geneva process.Russia also also "expressed their satisfaction with successful U.S.-Russia enhanced de-confliction efforts" and agreed to keep open lines of communication between the U.S. and Russia military.The White House released a joint statement later, after Trump landed in Hanoi, echoing those sentiments.Trump said the two leaders "agreed very quickly" to the statement."The two Presidents discussed the ongoing need to reduce human suffering in Syria and called on all U.N. member states to increase their contributions to address these humanitarian needs over the coming months," the statement released by the State Department said."In addition, President Trump noted that he had a good meeting with President Putin," it continued."He further noted that the successful implementation of the agreements announced today will save thousands of lives."In addition to the one-on-one meeting, Trump and Putin were spotted shaking hands and carrying on conversation on at least three separate occasions over the course of two days at the economic summit.The Associated Press Trump had previously told reporters that he expected to meet with Putin at some point during his trip."I think it's expected we'll meet with Putin, yeah," Trump told reporters on Air Force One, as he kicked off his tour of Asia.Though the White House never confirmed that the meeting would occur, the Kremlin had previously said the likelihood is great for a one-on-one meeting between the two leaders and that the matter was in the works for weeks.The White House has been vocal in its criticism of Russia over its support of the Syrian regime of Bashar al Assad, directly calling on the Kremlin to cease its egregious support of the Syrian leader as a years-long civil war drags on in the country.While the topic of Syria appears to have dominated the meeting, there are strained tensions between the two countries on a range of other issues, including the nuclear standoff with North Korea, fresh U.S. sanctions against Russia and the ongoing investigations into Russias meddling in the 2016 presidential election and questions of potential collusion between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin.The two leaders previously crossed paths at the G-20 Summit in Germany this summer, where their first official bilateral meeting lasted for more than two hours.The two men also had another involved interaction at a meeting during the summit.

Michael Flynn's lawyer blasts media reports of alleged kidnapping plot:::::In a rare public statement, attorneys for Lt. General Michael Flynn lashed out Friday at news reports that the federal investigation into the former top adviser to President Trump is looking into allegations he helped plot a kidnapping for the Turkish government.Interested in Trump Administration?Add Trump Administration as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Trump Administration news, video, and analysis from ABC News.Add Interest Today's news cycle has brought allegations about General Flynn, ranging from kidnapping to bribery, that are so outrageous and prejudicial that we are making an exception to our usual rule, Flynns top attorney Robert Kelner said in a statement.They are false.The statement came after the Wall Street Journal reported federal investigators working for Special Counsel Robert Mueller had interviewed participants in two meetings between Flynn and representatives of Turkey.During those meetings, the report said, Flynn discussed a plot to forcibly remove a Muslim cleric living in the U.S. and deliver him to Turkey in return for as much as $15 million dollars.ABC News reported on those meetings in September, citing allegations by former CIA director James Woolsey, who said he attended a meeting in which Flynn allegedly raised the idea of an operation to capture a Turkish dissident, cleric Fethullah Gulen, who is living in exile in rural Pennsylvania.The Asahi Shimbun via Getty Images Turkish officials have accused the cleric of involvement in a failed coup attempt against Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.Gulen, who has denied involvement, has lived legally in the Pennsylvanias Pocono Mountains since 1999, and the Turkish government has been financing efforts to persuade the U.S. government to return Gulen to Turkey for years.It became clear to me that, they were seriously considering a kidnapping operation for Gulen, and I told them then that it was a bad idea, it was illegal, Woolsey said of the meeting.I won't say that they had firmly decided to do that.But they were seriously considering it.Woolsey has been interviewed multiple times by federal agents working on the Mueller team, according to Nancye Miller, his wife and business partner.Flynns lawyer said at the time there was no such discussion, calling the allegation categorically false.At a press conference in July, the Turkish ambassador to the U.S. also denied the notion of a kidnapping plot.There's no truth to that, he said, adding that the government was following traditional procedures to have Gulen extradited through the legal channels.Fridays statement was a rare move by Flynns lawyers, who, like their client, have remained largely silent in the months since Flynn was removed as Trumps national security adviser.Out of respect for the process of the various investigations regarding the 2016 campaign, we have intentionally avoided responding to every rumor or allegation raised in the media, Kelners statement Friday said.Charles Dharapak/AP Photo There have been repeated reports in recent weeks that Muellers team is looking closely at Flynns activities during and after the 2016 presidential campaign, where he served as a top adviser to Trump.Of particular interest is Flynns visit to Russia, where he was paid to attend a dinner honoring the Russian television network RT and was seated next to Russian President Vladimir Putin.Investigators have also been looking at his consulting work for a Turkish businessman, which he only belatedly reported in federal disclosure filings.Sen. Ben Cardin, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told ABC News he found disturbing the mere suggestion that there were discussions about attempting to remove Gulen from the U.S. without a formal extradition process.I think theres a lot of information about General Flynn, that we dont know, Cardin said.And I think its going to be very interesting as the investigation continues, as to whether we learn more information about contacts that he made, or other individuals that may be involved with him.And thats why the Mueller investigation is particularly important.
How to feed 800 million: The battle over the future of US food aid:::::Cornell economist Chris Barrett sometimes shows audiences a photo he took in 2003 of a mother in Kenya holding her thin child.He's so undernourished, said Barrett, whose field research has spanned sub-Saharan Africa.Roughly 815 million people around the world suffered from chronic malnourishment last year alone, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.The way the U.S. helps the worlds hungry could be impacted by potential changes to provisions in the upcoming 2018 Farm Bill, particularly those regarding international food assistance programs.Christopher Barrett Food for Peace Title II aid connects farmers, truckers and others in the agricultural industry to programs that ship food to the worlds hungry.Another effort, the Emergency Food Security Program, helps provide cash-based assistance for food to be bought in the region it will be consumed.Because the 2014 Farm Bill is set to expire next year, lawmakers could soon debate which type of assistance the U.S. should best provide.It is a disagreement that has roiled academics, lobbyists and politicians.Same goal, different methods The United States is by far the most generous contributor to international food aid.Every year for the past decade, the U.S. gave between two and five times more funding to the U.N.s World Food Program than the next largest donor.But American food aid is bound by restrictions that dont apply to other major donor nations.For example, at least 50 percent of food aid sent abroad must be delivered by U.S.-flagged vessels, even though they typically cost more than foreign alternatives.In 2015, the Government Accountability Office found the added expense of this policy, known as cargo preference, was more than $107 million - thats three times what the U.S. spent on food assistance to the African nation of Chad in 2017.Barrett suggests that current maritime restrictions on shipping food aid should be eliminated.Rep. John Garamendi, a Democrat from California, who sits on the House Transportation and Infrastructure committee, disagrees."Well I suspect that the opponents of cargo preference generally believe that if you send cash, it is better, cheaper and provides more support, said Garamendi, the ranking member of the Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation subcommittee.For the most part, those who advocate that have never spent much time in the chaos of a refugee or a famine camp.Hunger is an issue that has shaped his lifes work.He has worked for decades on the issue, including a stint in Ethiopia with the Peace Corps in the early 1960s.In the late 1990s, he returned to Ethiopia with his wife, Patti, who then ran food programs across Africa for the U.S. Department of Agriculture.John Garamendi An alternative model Most countries have turned away from shipping home-grown commodities to afflicted regions, opting instead to provide funds for purchasing food locally.In October, Barrett testified before the Senate Foreign Relations committee that Canada, which did away with a requirement that a percentage of food it donates must be domestically produced in 2008, is now twice as efficient as America at getting food to the needy.Garamendi fears that replacing U.S. food aid sourced from American farms and delivered by U.S. ships with monetary aid would lead to abuse and undermine the nations commitment to feed the hungry.A cash program just will not have that support, and will quickly be subject to the inevitable audits, the inevitable questions of where did the cash go?Why did they use it to buy guns?he said, adding that it wouldnt be long until American food programs would diminish and possibly disappear.The 2014 Farm Bill allowed more American food aid to be obtained outside the U.S.It was a change applauded by advocates who say shipping food from the U.S. to a nation in need is not always the most efficient way to feed people.What we've seen ... on our program side is usually that it ends up taking longer and costs significantly more," said Mary Olive, a policy adviser for the relief agency CARE, noting that modern e-vouchers used to purchase food locally are hard to abuse in the ways Garamendi suggested.CARE is lobbying Congress for more flexibility in the 2018 Farm Bill, including the ability to locally source more food and offer an increase in cash-based aid beyond the current cap of 20 percent of total food aid.But the organization does not want to eliminate the role of U.S. agriculture in global food aid altogether."There's always going to be a need for U.S. food in these programs, Olive said.We have a lot of pre-positioning sites around the world, which just brings U.S. food closer, so we have less of a wait time.She added that some countries, like Yemen, dont produce enough food to be purchased by aid groups, so it must be brought in from the outside.Patricia Garamendi High stakes For Barrett, the debate boils down to a life or death proposition.Last month, he told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, the $300 to $400 million wasted on these various restrictions effectively cost us something like 40,000 childrens lives every year.Similar to Barrett with his image of the thin child, Garamendi often refers to a photo his wife snapped of a petite woman hauling a 50 kilogram bag of wheat uphill to her family.Three blue letters are stamped on the bag: U - S - A. Garamendi believes there is a benefit to food aid requirements that goes uncounted by critics: The bags and containers bearing the stamp of the United States, which sometimes get reused and kept in villages for years, leave behind an abiding sense of goodwill toward our country.There is something extraordinarily powerful, and therefore extraordinarily important to America, when that charity, the empathy of America, is expressed in a 50-kilo bag of grain, he said.
Meet Wilmot Collins, Helena, Montana's first black mayor-elect:::::When he arrived in Helena, Montana in February 1994, Wilmot Collins was wearing layer upon layer of clothing, anticipating the freezing cold temperatures.What he was a little less prepared for was being the only black man in a majority white community.A Liberian refugee, Collins noticed no one else in this rocky city looked like him.On Tuesday, Collins, 54, was elected to lead the community hes called home for over 20 years.A man who hails from a nation founded by freed slaves from America, Collins beat the four-term incumbent Jim Smith to be elected Helena's first black mayor.African Americans make up less than 1 percent of the population in Helena, according to a U.S. census from 2010.Wilmot Collins/Facebook Collins grew up on the tire company Firestones natural rubber plantation in Liberia, one of the worlds largest.He attended the University of Liberia and met his future wife, Maddie.The young couple soon found themselves in danger as a brutal civil war broke out.They fled the country when Liberias ceasefire collapsed in 1990 and after Collins two brothers were killed by rebels and government soldiers.When my wife and I finally fled the country, I was 90 pounds.She was 87.We were dying of starvation, he said in a TEDx talk he gave back in February.They escaped to Ghana, and the couple set their sights on coming to America.Maddie suggested Helena - she had spent a year there as a high school exchange student with a kind host family which, in turn, expedited her vetting process.Two weeks before she was set to leave, Maddie found out she was pregnant.Together, they made the hard decision for Maddie to go to America first.That would be best for our kid and that would be best for you, Collins said he told his wife.Left behind in Ghana, Collins continued through the grueling vetting process for U.S. entry, with no idea how soon he would be reunited with his pregnant wife or if that would even happen.I was getting frustrated.Its not an easy thing to not be able to see your family.It was really hard, Collins recalled.Two years and seven months later, Collins finally came to the United States.It was then that he had an emotional first meeting with his daughter Jaymie, already two years old.Collins settled in Helena, later joining the U.S. Navy Reserve and traveled to Fort Carson in Colorado and South Carolina But he always felt that Montana was home.A child protection specialist with the Montana Department of Health and Human Services at the time of his campaign kickoff, Collins has always been civically involved and giving back to his community.In 2015, Collins and his wife helped another couple like themselves, Cuban refugees Adonis Antolin and Maie Lee Jones, stay on their feet and convinced them to stay in Helenaaccording to Public Radio International.He told us to be patient because here, its different.There arent that many Latino people or black people.He told me not to feel scared because people here are very nice, Antolin told PRI.Collins is also a delegate for the advocacy organization Refugee Congress and is an adjunct professor at University of Montana-Helena.With his kids grown up and a bit more downtime as he wraps up his dissertation for a Ph.D. in forensic psychology, Collins felt it was an opportunity to run for public office.Campaigning was an uphill battle, Collins told ABC News.During fundraising events, Collins was told he was wasting his time.The incumbent Smith was known to the community and a popular mayor.When I started knocking on doors, constituents didnt even know there was an alternative, didnt even know that there was someone [else] running, Collins said.But he didnt shy away.His campaign registered in May for the race and in June, Collins and his team began knocking on doors, distributing fliers, and writing letters to constituents, supporters and sponsors.Had we not gone door to door, I dont think I would be here today talking to you, Collins said.And while campaigning, he never felt that his race was a factor.He recalled one night that he and Maddie, now a registered nurse in the Army Reserve, were canvassing late and it was getting dark.My wife was getting scared.She said, Hey you know, if someone feels threatened on their property you know what could happened.I said, Im aware.Collins said.The couple continued canvassing and their fears subsided.Wilmot Collins/Facebook But we knocked on those doors when it was getting dark.And nobody seemed to mind.They opened up their homes, they offered us coffee, they gave us water.Thats what encouraged me to continue, Collins said.Collins added, I knew I lived in a community that was accepting and tolerant.As he, his family and his supporters gathered Tuesday night for their watch party at a local Mexican grill, Collins couldnt help but be nervous as the first round of vote results came in and he was narrowly leading his opponent by hundred votes.It would not be until early Wednesday morning that the final results were known.His son, Bliss, a senior at the University of Montana, who had been tracking the results on his phone, was the one to deliver the good news: Collins was going to be Helenas next mayor.Collins believes he won because his progressive message resonated with residents as he chose to focus on solving youth homelessness, providing affordable housing and pushing for more resources for emergency response.And because, Collins said, I guess the community was looking for a change.But he did not expect such a national response to his election as the first black mayor of Helena.Since his victory, Collins has been interviewed by various national outlets, name dropped during late night show monologues, and congratulated from different parts of the country."You are an inspiration to many of us Liberians.I am more confident than I was yesterday, that with hard work I can push boundaries and live the American dream," a supporter wrote on Collins' campaign page on Facebook."Not only is this huge for racial equality in our state but also how we will address the assistance of refugees," another wrote.Im happy that I can be of some assistance or can be of influence or can inspire people, Collins told ABC News.Asked how he feels with all this national attention, Collins said, Overwhelmed.
Woman political novice, 32, runs and wins against man who mocked Women's March:::::Ashley Bennett never thought that she would run for political office.Interested in Elections?Add Elections as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Elections news, video, and analysis from ABC News.Add Interest When her first bid led to her victory against a male New Jersey county official who had mocked the Women's March, she said, "I was shocked."Atlantic County Freeholder John Carman irked Bennett back in January when he shared a sexist meme on Facebook."Will the womens protest end in time for them to cook dinner?"read the meme Carman shared after the Jan. 21 march.Now Bennett, who works full-time as a crisis evaluator for a hospital, is slated to take Carman's seat on the county governing board, called the freeholders board, after winning at the polls Tuesday.Bennett said she became active in politics after Hillary Clinton lost to Donald Trump in 2016.Bennett for Freeholder When she first heard about Carman's meme on the Women's March the day after Trump's inauguration, "It was really hard to take in," she said.She wrote a letter to Carman's office but never heard back.Carman's office did not immediately respond to ABC News' request for comment.Then she took a day off work to go to the next freeholders meeting in late January."When I got there, there were lines outside to get in," she said, noting that one woman brought a box of macaroni and cheese and another brought takeout menus as ironic suggestions for how Carman could get his dinner.Bennett said Carman didn't apologize for the meme, instead saying "that the women that he surrounded himself with were strong and they weren't offended by it.""I got up and left," Bennett told ABC News.She decided to run, spurred by the results of the 2016 election as well as Carman's mocking meme."I started to take notice of things, and there are some issues going on in my county that need to be addressed," she said.For example, she said, four casinos in the county have closed, including one where her mother used to work."You become way more aware of what's happening," she said.Bennett for Freeholder Bennett isn't alone.On Oct. 28, Emily's List, a group that aims to help elect pro-choice Democratic female candidates, released a statement following a national women's convention saying that 20,000 women have reached out to the organization about running for office in the wake of the 2016 election.Bennett said she was "shocked" by her win."It was a really special moment for me because I was the youngest person running on the county ticket and, just, people were so supportive and encouraging," she said.The freeholder post is a paid part-time job with at least one weekly meeting, so she'll be doing that in addition to her full-time crisis evaluator work."It wasn't anything that I was expecting to do.I never thought I would run for office at all," she said.
Roy Moore denies sexual misconduct allegations Video:::::Transcript for Roy Moore denies sexual misconduct allegations We turn now to the political crisis back here at home.Alabama senate candidate Roy Moore, speaking out denying having a sexual encounter with a 14-year-old.ABC's Stephanie Ramos is in Washington with what Moore is saying about that accusation and others.Stephanie, good morning to you.Reporter: Dan and Sara, good morning.A lot of Roy Moore supporters and Moore himself have questioned the timing of the allegations after running a number of campaigns over the years in the state of Alabama.And no accusations of this nature.But keep in mind, this is Moore's first campaign with national exposure and with that comes a whole lot more scrutiny.Roy Moore, the Republican senate candidate is sticking to his guns saying allegations that he molested a 14-year-old girl when he was a 32-year-old assistant district attorney aren't true.These allegations are completely false and misleading.Reporter: A report by "The Washington post" Thursday details allegations that the 70-year-old Moore tried to have relationships with several women when they were just 14 to 18 years old and he was in his 30s.Lee Corfman is one of those.Now 53, Corfman tells "The Washington post" Moore took her to his home when she was 14, claiming he took off her shirt and pants and removed his clothes.And that he touched her over her bra and underpants, she says and guided her hand to touch him, as well.In an interview with Sean hannity Moore rejects that claim.I don't know miss Corfman from anybody.I never talked to her, never had any contact with her, allegations of sexual misconduct are completely false.I believe they're politically motivated.I believe they're brought own to stop a very successful campaign and that's what they're doing.Reporter: Overnight his campaign blasting out this e-mail to supporters in an effort to raise money saying, we are in the midst of spiritual battle with those who want to silence our message.But hannity asked Moore if he had ever dated underage teens.Moore did not exactly deny it.Not generally, no.If I did, you know, I'm not going to dispute anything but I don't remember anything like that.Reporter: Moore refuses to drop out of the race and some Republicans in Alabama don't want him to.You know, I just -- I just don't believe he's guilty.Reporter: But some senate Republicans are more cautious.I'm not going to be the judge and jury, but, boy, in those allegations are true there's no way he should run or serve in the United States senate.Reporter: Whether or not Moore drops out of the race at this point, his name will still be on the ballot December 12th.Alabama law states a candidate must withdraw at least 76 days before an election in order to be replaced on that ballot.Sara, Dan.Stephanie, thank you.Joining us also from Washington ace ABC news political consultant Matthew dowd.Matthew, good morning to you.I like that ace.Yes, you know, I add it in there for people I especially love.We know how some Republicans as we saw in Stephanie's piece rushing to his defense.What do you as a one-time Republican make of that?Well, I think we've devolved in our politics to a culture where winning is more important than anything else and putting party behind -- putting party ahead of country and principle seems to be what goes on today just to get the victory, just to get the win in the United States senate stow you can pass a tax bill or whatever and the crazy thing about this is here we have Republicans embracing somebody accused of pedophilia but consider it immoral two people of the same sex that fall in love with each other and marry.It's just bizarre.Matt, one of the questions for those Republicans who are disavowing Moore, what options do they have to remove him from the ballot or just ensure he's never actually seated in the senate?Reporter: There's only three options, speak out, obviously, but then if there's two on the ballot and stays the way it is, only option support the Democrat, Doug Jones in the race.The other two options are launch a write-in campaign with a Republican like the incumbent senator strange, launch that campaign, try to get him elected on the ballot or, three, there is some discussion of postponing the election by the Republican governor, postponing it till later or earlier next year and figuring out a way out of this mess.Those fundamentally are the three options.There's been talk about the historical precedent of even if he's elected they could refuse to seat him but that is very rare.Let's talk, though, about president trump's comments in Asia this morning.That he believes Vladimir Putin means it when he says he didn't med until our election.So, is trump essentially saying he trusts Putin more than America's intelligence agencies who have firmly and repeatedly asserted that Russia did, in fact, meddle?Well, it reminds me, Vladimir Putin reminds me of the famous Richard Pryor quote, are you going to believe me or your lying intelligence agencies and I think the problem I think Donald Trump has is he's -- he's compromised by all of these discussions that obviously are being investigated about his relationship with Russia in the course of this.Donald Trump seems to be the guy walking around shawshank prison saying everybody is innocent here and believes Vladimir Putin in the midst of this over nearly every single major intelligence agency in the country but as I say he's in a conflicted compromised position as regards Russia.Okay.Well, Matt, thank you very much.This transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.

Retired 4-star general and Korean War vet talks path to peace with North Korea Video:::::Transcript for Retired 4-star general and Korean War vet talks path to peace with North Korea General war thank you for joining yes we thank you really appreciated in this veterans day weekend with tensions as high as they are on the Korean Peninsula.And like you to help us understand better your experience in fighting that first war in Korea almost seventy years ago.In your oral histories said those were difficult days and worse with the north Koreans than with anybody else.We couldn't get any quarter and we weren't giving any quarter in fighting north Koreans we killed a lot of them they killed a lot of us.So we're still facing the Kim regime on the peninsula with fighters presumably as fanatical as the ones you faced.Tell us what it was like to fight the north Koreans then and what it might be like today.Well I suspect the biggest differs than fighting in north Koreans at that time.Was that we are pretty well armed with.Hand me down or work to equipment.Both weaponry and uniforms.And the north Koreans didn't seem to have any.I guess moral background as far as the heart we were concerned and in terms of how solution behave.And how you should treat prisoners.Which led to people not offering a lot of quarter.And bill we tried just for that it was hard to do.And everywhere he spent a lot of time trying to find automatic weapons.Because they felt they were tremendously outnumbered and they were.And that became even more apparent as we attack to the north and in the Chinese in the in fact I remember one.Occasion where we found two or three T 34 resident backed off into the ditch.And we also fundamentals as extensive time in the motor pool and a lot of put it in reverse and get it out.So we took the T thirty fours to be short on.Really firepower we put him in or call along with four Russian vehicles and also been captured.And we started to take them up north and we found we could move more quickly was in the to have ever column.Until we're received a call made their forces that we can no longer here do you that we will have.Pilots are going to hit you or your going to be traveling around with those tanks and we put back the ditch.So think about what the United States and South Koreans have in terms of military now that that willfully and prepared time.When the United States was caught unaware by the North Korean nation and now we have.We have stealth bombers and we have fighters and we have ships and we have you a US army did its trained and person levels.But there's still 7000.Some odd artillery tubes.A million men on the other side of the border.So what Ari are you confident in the US in South Korea's ability to quickly defeat to north Koreans.It would seem to me that the thinks that if changes in the structure of the south Korean army and also in the in the US are rare dramatic vistas a couple of examples.Instead of listening to wounded people bleed out all night long pitcher could give off the hill.We have dust off has been refined to a fair as you well where you can hear teasing Gould are usually get to guide back into a mash hospital some more.At this time we spend a lot of time trading two cartons of cigarettes is trying to get an additional aid for a six machine gun so we taped clips together everybody tried to do the best they could we picked up.Any number of Thompson submachine guns brand guns.And for were fighting for firepower we're fighting for some for rations because you're always sure corrections.It was a terrible way to fight a war.Survival from the elements became about the most interesting thing in the most difficult thing in the middle of the wonder.It's even hard to compare I think the two forces between what they are and you know what they were at that time.That this week and a congressman said that a conflict and with North Korea would result in quote a bloody protracted ground war.One writer argued that the American political class is drifting towards war in North Korea and that quote it's a matter of preventive war now or larger war later.You know we haven't fought.The US hasn't fought that kind of war in a long time where you have the conventional military against a conventional military in Korea we have a million men on either side of 160 mile.Line facing off against each other.What has the US forgotten about that kind of war and what should.We remember.I think the big thing you've forgotten about the war than that still exists.And it continues under armistice.And my personal opinion one of the best things we could do on a political note would be to go ahead and talk to North Korea.How that issue and try to formally end the war would North Korea.Obviously.As the president facts is enough to that if the worst ours we can win the war.What we have to due to do that might be unacceptable to many other countries millions of people.But I think it goes say that we can win that war the real question is whether or politically up to enough to go has to figure out how to not have them or.When you when you look at South Koreans can mean it would when I drive through Seoul if you squint your eyes you can be in Los Angeles you can be in Chicago.And you look at the pictures of Seoul in 1953.And it looks like Rocca it looks like Fallujah it was nothing.And then you have this unbelievably wealthy dynamic country.When you think back about that.Personally do you think.That the price the United States paid in blood and.Treasure.Was it worth it.Personal view.34000.Names on a wall was I price to pay me.As a soldier whether to Vietnam or anywhere else flies seawall snow with names.I have to think about could there be a better solution and you have the capability in this country to come up with a I'm I would not say is that we've done that necessarily reduce debt and South Korea I think the person strike they did that for themselves took a long period of time.What we can do much more on the positive side that we have in the past were very unified.And were terrible building.This transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.

Roy Moore's supporters still 'believe in him' as GOP senators withdraw endorsements:::::Two Republican senators who initially backed Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore have rescinded their endorsements in response to allegations of sexual misconduct.Interested in Roy Moore?Add Roy Moore as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Roy Moore news, video, and analysis from ABC News.Add Interest Sens.Mike Lee of Utah and Steven Daines of Montana have withdrawn their support.GOP Sen. John McCain of Arizona, meanwhile, has said Moore should "immediately step aside" from the election on Dec. 12, and Bob Corker of Tennessee tweeted Saturday that he had never supported the controversial former judge.Look, I'm sorry, but even before these reports surfaced, Roy Moore's nomination was a bridge too far.Senator Bob Corker (@SenBobCorker) November 11, 2017 But at least some supporters of Moore in Alabama are standing by him, saying they don't believe the allegations.I think most conservative Christians are going to vote for him because they believe in him, Nancy Fluker of Wilsonville, Alabama, about 32 miles southeast of Birmingham, told ABC affiliate WBMA-TV in Birmingham.They believe in his reputation.They believe in his record."Moore, who is running to fill the Alabama Senate seat vacated by Jeff Sessions when he became attorney general, faces allegations first reported by the Washington Post that he engaged in sexual activity with a 14-year-old when he was 32 and pursued other girls when they were between the ages of 16 and 18 and he was in his 30s.Some political observers in Alabama said they think fallout from the allegations against Moore may depress turnout at the polls and that many Republicans may choose to write in another name rather than vote for the former judge."I imagine there are going to be certain people who will not want to vote for the Democrat, but who will not want to vote for [Moore] and I imagine that there will be a write-in," said former Alabama Supreme Court Justice Gorman Houston who ran as a Republican but now considers himself an independent."A lot of people will write in" candidates, he said.But in Shelby County, Alabama, on the outskirts of Birmingham, many who spoke to WBMA-TV said they are sticking by Moore.Nancy Fluker and her husband, Gordon, said they believe Moore's denial of having had a sexual encounter with a 14-year-old when he was 32.I believe him that he didn't do it, Gordon Fluker said.I think it's something someone waited until an opportune moment to put on the news across the world, to downgrade him.Similarly, Susan Conn, who owns Main Street Florist in downtown Columbiana, Alabama, told WBMA-TV, she is suspicious of the timing of the allegations.I just don't see how he could be guilty now and not be guilty in all these other elections in which he ran, Conn said.Conn said she voted for Moore's Republican rival in the primary runoff, Luther Strange, but will now vote for Moore in the general election.Him being a Christian, I would hate to know he's guilty of anything like that, said Conn.He really does seem like he does what he thinks he's supposed to do.I just don't believe he's guilty.Houston, the former Alabama Supreme Court justice, said Moore has a group of loyal supporters who are unlikely to abandon him.Houston served on the state's high court during a battle over Moore's monument to the Ten Commandments that he placed in the state judicial building in Montgomery.Moore was elected chief justice of the state Supreme Court in 1999 but was removed in 2003 by the Alabama Court of the Judiciary for willfully and publicly defying a federal court's orders to remove the monument.Houston said that when he disagreed with Moore about the appropriateness of the monument, he received hate mail from supporters of his fellow judge."Just the hate that they had for those of that did not go along with Roy Moore.It was really something," Houston said.

Scottish Lib Dems back gender-neutral school uniforms:::::Image caption The conference backed a motion calling for girls to be allowed to wear trousers and boys skirts The Scottish Liberal Democrats have backed a motion calling for all schools to have gender-neutral uniforms for students.Jess Insall, 15, told the party conference that allowing girls to wear trousers and boys to wear skirts could result in happier students, better exam results and even better jobs.She said: "It's a small step forward but it will make a huge difference."Her call was backed by the party's UK deputy leader, Jo Swinson.Ms Swinson recalled how she had campaigned for girls to be allowed to wear trousers when she was a student at Douglas Academy in Milngavie.She said: "There is an important principle here about not segregating boys and girls according to gender."There's also practicalities.I read about a school where primary school girls were told they weren't allowed to turn cartwheels in the playground because it was 'unladylike'.As if we send our little girls to primary school to learn how to be a lady."'Harmful gender stereotypes' Party members at the conference backed a motion calling on the Scottish government to require schools to provide "inclusive, non-prescriptive gender-neutral school uniform policies".In her speech at the conference in Dunfermline, Jess hit out about the "harm that sexist uniforms are doing to young girls".The teenager said: "I'm not telling anyone to take away their skirts, I'm telling you all that pupils should have the freedom to dress appropriately for their personal identity regardless of their gender."She added: "Is it really acceptable that we dictate the way our children dress based on only their gender - or in many cases the gender that society forces them to conform to?"She argued that giving girls "more practical uniform options" could help encourage greater physical activity, and spoke out about the "harmful gender stereotypes that sexist uniform policies promote".She said: "The minute a girl walks into a primary school she is shown that the boys have more freedom to run about, she is told while she has to wear a skirt the boys don't, she is told to take inequality for granted and to respect it as the norm.""Gender-neutral uniforms will make a real impact on pupils' school lives.When pupils feel comfortably and appropriately dressed it boosts self-esteem."This in turn boosts mental health, which means pupils will be happier and more productive in schools.This leads to better exam results which can lead pupils to better jobs."'Political car crash' During his speech at the conference, the party's Scottish leader Willie Rennie said the Liberal Democrats should lead a national debate on the benefits of immigration.He said any loss of EU citizens after Brexit could have a devastating economic impact and called for politicians who "blindly back Brexit" to be sent home, rather than EU citizens.Image caption Mr Rennie used his speech to highlight the economic benefits he believes immigration brings to the UK The Liberal Democrats campaigned to keep Britain in the European Union in 2016, and now want a second referendum to be held once the terms of the Brexit deal have been negotiated.Mr Rennie told the conference that the Conservative government at Westminster would either "betray Leave voters" by back-tracking on promises to cut immigration after Brexit or "trash the economy".And he used his speech to urge people across the country to "stand up for immigration".'Lost taxes' Predicting that a "real political car crash" is on the way, he added: "If immigration is not cut with Brexit then Leavers will feel betrayed because that is what they voted for."If the Conservatives keep that promise, and immigration is cut, it will damage our economy and public services, and even more will feel betrayed because they were not told this would happen."Voters in the EU referendum were not told the price of cutting immigration, Mr Rennie said.He added: "The price is a shortage of workers to get food from British farms into the shops."The price is a shortage of carers, nurses and GPs.The price is billions of pounds of lost taxes from these jobs.They are already going home and Brexit has not even happened yet."Some say that too much immigration is a threat to our way of life.But the truth is that not enough immigration is the real threat to our way of life."It's not the workers from Poland, Romania or Bulgaria who we should fear.We should fear all those political leaders who are blindly backing Brexit.These are the people we should be sending home."
Privatised firms paid shareholders 37bn since 2010 - Labour:::::Image copyright PA Privatised companies have paid more than 37bn in dividends to shareholders since 2010 according to Labour.Shadow chancellor John McDonnell says in a speech that money could have been invested in public services.Labour says it would renationalise some services, but critics say privatised firms are more efficient.One of the firms, National Grid, said it had invested 14bn in infrastructure since 2007, as well as paying shareholders 10bn since 2010.The research, carried out by Labour in conjunction with the House of Commons Library, found BT (formerly the state-owned British Telecom) has paid out around 6.3bn in dividends since 2010.The owner of British Gas, Centrica, paid out 5.2bn.Speaking at a conference in Lincoln, Mr McDonnell will renew Labour's pledge to renationalise companies, including water and electricity providers and the railways.He will say: "These figures show what could have gone into investment in these public services in order to expand and improve them or keep their charges down."The last seven years of austerity has seen working families suffer from stagnant wages not being able to keep up with prices of items like energy bills, and underfunded public services - yet billions has gone into the hands of shareholders," he will add.Analysis Image copyright PA By BBC business correspondent, Joe Lynam We've no idea what giant public limited companies such as Centrica (British Gas), BT or even British Airways might look like if they had remained in public hands.Advocates of privatisation say that giant utilities are nearly always more efficient when run by experts in their field and driven by a profit motive than when controlled by civil servants.Critics of selling off the 'state silver' though, say that chasing earnings leads to greed, ill-advised choices and is certainly not in the public interest.Furthermore the state benefitted handsomely when the above companies (and plenty of others) were floated off in the first place - money that was used to build schools, roads and hospitals.Labour says 37bn has been paid out in dividends by privatised firms.Interestingly, that's considerably less than what taxpayers paid to bail out one very private bank in 2008: RBS.A spokeswoman for National Grid said electricity transmission costs were 30% lower since privatisation and that the company had a near-perfect reliability rating on its electricity network.She added that the energy infrastructure provider had invested 14bn in its gas and electricity infrastructure in the last 10 years.The BBC has approached Centrica and BT for comment.
EU citizens 'worth 4.42bn to Scotland':::::Image copyright Getty Images The amount added to national output by the average EU citizen working in Scotland is 34,400, according to a new study.With 128,400 EU citizens employed in Scotland, that implies a value of 4.42bn.It is estimated that, on average, each additional EU citizen working in Scotland contributes 10,400 to government revenues.The reckoning has been published in new research from the Scottish government.It has been submitted to the Migration Advisory Committee, as that body looks into the UK's future immigration policy post-Brexit.The report makes the point that Scotland is affected differently from the rest of the UK by a sudden change to immigration.The only way that the population can grow while it ages, claims the Scottish government, is through migration.Birth rate Scottish ministers are calling for Scotland to have powers for its own immigration policy, with more open access than the UK government is likely to accept.The official population forecasts for 2026 show a rise in 107,000 in net overseas migration, and 76,000 from the rest of the UK.That is while natural change - more deaths than births - will cut 8,000 from the Scottish population.In England, much of its population growth will be from births to parents already in Britain.Image copyright Getty Images The new analysis from Edinburgh covers the sectors likely to be most affected when there is an end to free movement of EU nationals into Scotland.The UK government is understood to have drawn up its own impact assessments of how Brexit could affect different economic sectors.Despite political pressure, it has refused to publish them, saying that would undermine the British negotiating position.The most affected sector in Scotland would be tourism, where more than 9% of workers (17,000) are EU citizens.That does not include those living in hotels' accommodation for staff, which may push the figure significantly higher.Creative industries While Brexit is expected to force employers to look to UK recruits to fill vacancies left when there are fewer EU citizens available, six in 10 members of the British Hospitality Association reported a lack of applications from UK citizens or lack of interest by the local population.In creative industries, the Scottish government report cited 11,000 EU citizens working in Scotland, including 35% of Scottish Ballet and 21% of the Scottish Chamber Orchestra.In 2014, the Creative Skillset Workforce Survey found more than half of those responding from the Scottish creative industries had found skill shortages - a higher share than the UK as a whole.One in twenty EU nationals working in Scotland are in food processing, representing quarter of all its employees.The Scottish Association of Meat Wholesalers reports 52% of its unskilled workforce is from outside the UK, and 44% of the skilled workforce.In seafood, 58% of the workforce in large processors are non-UK European nationals.In Grampian, it is estimated that seven in 10 of all staff in seafood processing are EU nationals.The report includes information about seasonal farm work, including the berry fields.A survey carried out last July by the Association of Labour Providers found 30% of respondents did not expect to be able to source and supply sufficient workers for the peak summer season, with 45% expecting the same for the peak of the Christmas season.The survey, from across Britain, reported half expected that position would be worse next year.Care workers In the care sector, the Scottish government points to the Camphill communities for those with learning difficulties.Of 251 short term co-workers last November, 170, were EU nationals, and 76 were from beyond the EU.Only 5 were UK citizens.In the health service, the dependence is not as great as many other areas of the UK.And despite Scotland's strength as a training centre for clinical skills, there is a claim from the Scottish government that "we will not reach a position where we are able to recruit all of the clinically regulated workforce that we need from within the UK.On any analysis it is anticipated that we will always need to recruit internationally from the EU and beyond".Among NHS clinicians, 9.4% of the UK total are from the EU, and 5.7% in Scotland That means 1140 graduates with a licence to practice.The Royal College of Nursing notes that since the referendum, there's been a 96% drop in the number of nurses from other EU countries registering to practice in the UK.Image copyright SPL Some 6% of the Scottish care workforce is made up of EU citizens and 6% from other countries, According to Alasdair Allan, Scottish minister for Europe: "The Scottish government believes that continuing free movement of people is in the best interests of Scotland and the UK as a whole.We do not believe that a restrictive model which limits free movement is in Scotland's or the UK's interests."For migration from outside the EU, it is clear that a one-size fits all approach does not meet Scotland's needs."There is a clear case for a differentiated migration system that recognises the different needs across the UK."He cited support for different immigration powers also coming from a Westminster all-party parliamentary group, and its Scottish Affairs Committee.Former Chancellor and leader of the Better Together campaign, Lord Darling, said the issue should be looked at.The UK government has said that ending free movement of EU nationals into Britain is a key part of the Brexit process, but that it will tailor policy to ensure that business still has access to the skilled workers it needs.With 3 million EU nationals living in the UK already, they will be allowed to apply for 'settled status', but the rules for that are not clear while Brexit negotiations continue.
MP to submit 'unwanted attention' letters:::::Image copyright John Stilwell/PA Wire Image caption Kerry McCarthy will hand over the letters to Labour officials on Monday Labour's Kerry McCarthy is to submit letters to the party which she says show she received "unwanted attention" from a fellow MP, the BBC understands.The member for Bristol East claims she was sent "upsetting" correspondence from Kelvin Hopkins, the MP for Luton North, over a period of about 20 years.Mr Hopkins 76, said the complaint had caused him "unbearable" stress.He is currently suspended from the party in connection with a separate allegation, which he denies.Ms McCarthy, 52, a former shadow environment secretary, will hand the file to Labour party officials on Monday, the BBC has learned.She alleges Mr Hopkins sent her a series of letters and cards commenting on her appearance, including one in which he described having a dream about her.Image copyright Labout Party Image caption Mr Hopkins said the allegations caused him "immense personal hurt" The former Labour frontbencher said she believed Mr Hopkins, who urged her in two of the notes to "dispose" of them, knew his actions were wrong."I never responded in any way, I never gave him any encouragement in any way, I tried to keep my distance as much as possible," she said."I absolutely believe he knew this behaviour was unacceptable.It made me feel uncomfortable in his presence and was quite upsetting."Image copyright PA Wire Image caption Ms McCarthy says Mr Hopkins told her he dreamt about her in a letter written of House of Commons notepaper In a statement, Mr Hopkins said her complaint had caused him "immense personal hurt and utter dismay" from someone he regarded as a friend."I cannot understand why a parliamentarian of such experience and standing, who is also such a long-term friend, would not have told me that she was unhappy with any aspect of our friendship rather than going straight to the national press," he said."At a minimum I would have expected a parliamentary colleague to raise any complaint through normal channels, allowing me due process and a fair chance to defend myself, if necessary."I do ask, on my behalf and on behalf of all other individuals and their families dealing with allegations, that these matters are dealt with by proper due process and not by unfair, humiliating one-sided trial by media."I am a 76-year old man and the stress this has caused me and my family is unbearable."Image copyright PA Wire Image caption The note Kerry McCarthy says she was sent in the run up to the 1997 general election The MPs first met when Ms McCarthy was in her late 20s and they were both involved in Labour politics in Luton.After a lunch in 1994, the purpose of which she believed was to discuss politics she said, he sent her a card saying he had invited her "because you are attractive, intelligent and charming".More notes and cards followed over the next three years, she claimed, but they then stopped until her 50th birthday.A final letter, sent some time in 2015/16, said Mr Hopkins had a dream about Ms McCarthy and she remained a "very attractive woman".She said she decided to go public after the "bravery" of a young activist, Ava Etemadzadeh, who complained last week about the behaviour of Mr Hopkins.
Brexit bill: Barnier gives UK two weeks to clarify key issues:::::Image copyright AFP The UK has two weeks to clarify key issues or make concessions if progress is to be made in Brexit talks, the bloc's chief negotiator has said.Michel Barnier was speaking after meeting the Brexit secretary for talks on citizens' rights, the Irish border, and the UK's "divorce bill".David Davis said it was time for both sides "to work to find solutions".Before the talks, Theresa May said she wanted the UK's exit date set in law, and warned MPs not to block Brexit.Speaking at a press conference in Brussels, Mr Barnier suggested Britain would have to clarify its position in the next fortnight on what it would pay to settle its obligations to the EU if the talks were to have achieved "sufficient progress" ahead of December's European Council meeting."It is just a matter of settling accounts as in any separation," Mr Barnier said.'Useful clarifications' Mr Barnier also said both sides had to work towards an "objective interpretation" of Prime Minister Theresa May's pledge that no member of the EU would lose out financially as a result of the Brexit vote.The Brexit secretary insisted good progress was being made across the board, and that the negotiations had narrowed to a "few outstanding, albeit important, issues".Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption David Davis says there cannot be a new border within the UK Mr Davis and Mr Barnier agreed there had been progress on the issue of settled status for EU citizens in the UK after Brexit.Mr Barnier said the UK had provided "useful clarifications" on guaranteeing rights, although more work needed to be done on some points including rights of families and exporting welfare payments.For the UK's part, Mr Davis said, the government had "listened carefully" to concerns and that there would be a "streamlined and straightforward" process for EU nationals to obtain settled status.'Frank discussions' But Mr Davis rejected a suggestion that Northern Ireland could remain within the European customs union.He was responding to a European Commission paper, which proposed that Northern Ireland may have to remain a member of the EU's single market or customs union, if a so-called "hard border" with the Irish Republic is to be avoided.Saying there had been "frank discussions" with Mr Barnier and his negotiators on the issue of the Irish border, Mr Davis insisted there could be "no new border" inside the UK."We respect the European Union desire to protect the legal order of the single market and the customs union, but that cannot come at cost to the constitutional and economic integrity of the United Kingdom," Mr Davis told reporters in Brussels."We recognise the need for specific solutions for the unique circumstances of Northern Ireland.But let me be clear - this cannot amount to creating a new border inside our United Kingdom," he added.Mr Barnier said the "unique situation" on the island of Ireland required "technical and regulatory solutions necessary to prevent a hard border".Analysis Image copyright Reuters By Adam Fleming, BBC Europe correspondent Michel Barnier usually says at post-negotiation press conferences that the clock is ticking.He didn't this time: he gave a specific timeframe.He wants the UK to provide more clarity in the next two weeks on its positions on the rights of EU citizens who wish to remain after Brexit, the plans for the Irish border and principles for calculating Britain's financial obligations.Although the EU doesn't want a precise figure, it wants the UK to clarify what it's willing to pay to live up to the financial commitments made as a member.On Ireland, both sides have pledged to protect the peace process but the EU has suggested that might require Northern Ireland sticking to European rules on customs and the single market - rules that the rest of Britain might not follow in future.David Davis rejected that.UK sources agree it looks like they've been set a deadline but they feel it is a logical reading of the EU's timetable, under which their officials have to begin preparations for the next summit of EU leaders in December fairly soon.Looking ahead to December's EU summit, Mr Davis pledged the UK was "ready and willing" to engage with Brussels "as often and as quickly as needed"."But we need to see flexibility, imagination and willingness to make progress on both sides if these negotiations are to succeed and we are able to realise our new deep and special partnership," he said.Friday's update came as Prime Minister Theresa May announced she wanted the date the UK leaves the EU - 29 March 2019 - enshrined in law.Image copyright PA Image caption The prime minister wrote in Friday's Daily Telegraph she would not tolerate attempts to "block" Brexit The prime minister said the decision to put the specific time of Brexit "on the front page" of the Brexit bill showed the government was determined to see the process through."Let no-one doubt our determination or question our resolve, Brexit is happening," she wrote.The draft legislation has already passed its second reading, and now faces several attempts to amend it at the next part of its parliamentary journey - the committee stage.Mrs May said the government would listen to MPs if they had ideas for improving the bill, but warned against attempts to halt the process."We will not tolerate attempts from any quarter to use the process of amendments to this bill as a mechanism to try to block the democratic wishes of the British people by attempting to slow down or stop our departure from the European Union."
Davis stands firm on Irish border issue:::::Image copyright PA Image caption The future operation of the Irish border is one of the most sensitive Brexit issues There were "frank discussions" about the Irish border in the latest round of Brexit talks, David Davis has said.The Brexit Secretary was speaking in Brussels after a meeting with chief EU negotiator Michel Barnier.Mr Davis said any solution for the border could not be at the expense of the constitutional integrity of the UK.The EU tabled a paper which suggested Northern Ireland will have to continue to follow many EU rules after Brexit if a hard border is to be avoided.The paper hinted that Northern Ireland may need to stay in the EU customs union if there are to be no checks at the border.That is something which the Conservatives and DUP have said they cannot accept as it would effectively create a border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.Meanwhile, Mr Barnier said the UK has two weeks to clarify what it will pay the EU if progress is to be made in Brexit talks.Irish position accepted?Britain and the EU say they are committed to ensuring Brexit does not undermine the Good Friday agreement.Neither want Brexit to lead to the emergence of a hard border with the Republic of Ireland."Let me be clear, we cannot have anything resulting in a new border being set up with in the UK," said Mr Davis after the sixth round of UK-EU talks on citizens' rights, the Irish border, and the UK's "divorce bill"."We remain firmly committed to avoiding any physical infrastructure."We respect the EU desires, but they cannot come at the constitutional integrity of the United Kingdom."Mr Davis said the EU and UK teams had drafted joint positions on the common travel area, as well as joint principles and commitments for the second phase of talks.The EU leaked paper stops short of saying a hard border can only be avoided by the UK or Northern Ireland staying in the single market or customs union.Image copyright Reuters Image caption Taoiseach Leo Varadkar was attending the British-Irish Council in Jersey However, it brings the commission closer to the European Parliament position which "presumes" that the UK or Northern Ireland will have to stay in the internal market and customs union.It is also the clearest indication that the commission has accepted the Irish position on Brexit and the border issue.Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar has said the only way of avoiding a hard border in Ireland after Brexit is for the whole of the UK, or Northern Ireland, to follow the rules of the customs union and single market.Speaking at a meeting of the British-Irish Council in Jersey, Mr Varadkar said his proposal would not mean the UK or Northern Ireland had to be members of the customs union and single market, but "it would mean continuing to apply the rules".Image copyright Reuters Image caption EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier has given the UK two weeks to clarify what it will pay to leave the EU DUP Parliamentary leader and North Belfast MP Nigel Dodds rejected the suggestion that a hard border can only be avoided if the UK or Northern Ireland continue to abide by the rules of the single market and customs union after Brexit.He said the paper shows the EU is unwilling to engage in negotiations on the border issue in a "meaningful fashion"."Northern Ireland will not be separated from the rest of the UK as a result of Brexit," he said."Brussels must realise this and accept that progress will not be achieved through bully-boy tactics."Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The DUP's Nigel Dodds said Brussels must accept progress will not be achieved through bully-boy tactics Meanwhile, Irish Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney said talk of individual countries vetoing a move to the next stage of Brexit negotiations is "unhelpful", but progress still had to be made on the border issue."There is a way to go between the two negotiating teams to be able to provide credible answers and sufficient progress in the context of the Irish border before we can move on to Phase Two," he told Irish state broadcaster, RTE.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Bertie Ahern tells BBC Newsnight a hard border would be a "huge setback" for the peace process Former Irish Taoiseach and Good Friday Agreement signatory Bertie Ahern told BBC Newsnight that a hard border would be a "huge setback" for the peace process and that a physical border across the island of Ireland would give a "huge incentive" to those that want to cause mischief.
PIP disability benefit: Concerns raised over NI assessments:::::Image caption Jylette Frey-Pullan has muscular dystrophy and was reassessed for PIP More than 12,000 people in Northern Ireland have challenged the Department for Communities over the outcome of their initial PIP assessment.Personal Independence Payment (PIP) is a new benefit that is gradually replacing Disability Living Allowance (DLA).It was introduced in Northern Ireland last year.PIP is harder to get than DLA because it places less importance on your diagnosis.It focuses instead on how well you can function on a a day-to-day basis.More than 125,000 people in Northern Ireland will have to be re-assessed to see if they qualify for the new benefit.BBC Spotlight has obtained figures that shows that over 35% of applicants seeking to transfer from DLA to PIP have had their benefits disallowed on the basis of their initial assessment.Many of these people have gone on to apply for what is called a mandatory reconsideration.It is the first part of the appeals process and it is where you ask the department to look at your case again.But the programme also discovered that only 20% of those who apply for a mandatory reconsideration will have their decision changed.Image caption Capita carry out PIP assessments on behalf of the department for communities Capita is the private company who won the 65m contract to deliver PIP in Northern Ireland.Simon Matchett from Bangor had been diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis and was getting high-rate DLA that allowed him to get a Motability car.Following his assessment he was awarded eight points, which was not enough to keep the car and he had to return it.Mr Matchett said when he was reading his assessment he queried a number of things that were written in it."That didn't happen, I didn't actually say that - a lot of times it could come down to a he said, she said sort of thing," he said."The title is personal independence payment and by taking away my car, they were taking away my ability to have a little bit of independence."Mr Matchett challenged the decision based on what he claimed were inaccuracies in his report.He was later awarded the extra two points during the mandatory reconsideration stage.Image caption Simon Matchett has multiple sclerosis and lost his Motability car following his assessment If you are unsuccessful at the mandatory reconsideration stage, you can ask for an appeal hearing during which you will present your case to a legal expert and a disability expert.Jylette Frey-Pullan, who has muscular dystrophy and uses an electric wheelchair, was also told that she no longer qualified for a Motability car.She said the car was her lifeline as it was able to hold her electric wheelchair and her husband was able to drive her around in it.Mrs Frey-Pullan said she was shocked when the initial decision letter arrived."I thought no, this must be some kind of mistake.They can't be talking about me, there were a lot of inaccuracies," she said.At a mandatory reconsideration, her request for a car was again turned down.Like many others in the same situation, Mrs Frey-Pullan is now waiting for a date for her appeal.Shea Ross, a tribunal representative at the Citywide Tribunal Service, has said they have seen a huge increase in demand for their services."No one that we speak to is happy with the assessments, usually what they say is that either their words were twisted, or that some of the things in the assessment were just fabricated."So far just over 1,000 people have completed the full appeals process.More than one in three have been successful.Image caption Owen McCloskey from Law Centre NI has called for audit reports to be released The main concern for claimants is that what they say during their assessments is not always being represented in the final report sent to the department.Owen McCloskey, from the Law Centre NI, said "a serious issue that we feel we have identified is the auditing of reports and potentially changes being made to the report without clients being made aware of it"."We are looking for copies of each version of the audit report, so before and after it has been edited," he said."It may have been edited multiple times."We are also looking for access to the actual audit document, so where the auditor has assessed the report, they have identified quality issues and they have made recommendations for change."It's important we see that actual document."Image caption Paul Gray believes the PIP process in Northern Ireland should be reviewed John Duffy, the president of the Appeals Tribunal, has written to Spotlight to say that tribunal members have "expressed concerns about the auditing practices" and that he had been in contact with the department about the issue.He added that if all information is not made available at a tribunal, people can "ask for the decision to be set aside and reheard".When Spotlight asked the department about this, it said arrangements were now in place to facilitate earlier versions of the report being made available.Civil servant Paul Gray was commissioned by the government to examine how the new PIP system was working in the rest of the UK.With PIP still in its early stages in Northern Ireland, Mr Gray thinks the project should be reviewed before it gets much further."Since my reviews didn't cover Northern Ireland then, yes, I think it would be a very good idea for somebody to take a look at that," he said.Justin Tomlinson MP, former minister for disabled people, said PIP is a "much, much better benefit than DLA"."Through the introduction of personal independence payments we are getting more people accessing the higher rate of benefits," he said."The PIP process is recognised to be much more thorough, much more able to identify individual challenges, it means we're spending 3bn a year more, so more money is going to some of the most vulnerable people in society but it's not a completed project."Image caption Justin Tomlinson MP, former minister for disabled people, has said PIP is a much better benefit Spotlight has also been told by the Information Commissioner that they have received a number of complaints about Capita and the department and are looking into the details.Capita said Spotlight did not provide them with enough personal information about Mr Matchett or Mrs Frey-Pullan to be able to comment on their cases.They added that they had a robust auditing process in place to ensure a high quality of assessment and said their staff are healthcare professionals who are trained and empathetic.In a statement the Department for Communities said: "Whilst it is still very early days for PIP in Northern Ireland, the recently published information shows that 29% of PIP recipients are getting the highest level of benefit compared to 15% of the working-age DLA customers prior to its introduction."The BBC Spotlight programme 'PIP: The Disability Benefit Shake-Up' is available on BBC IPlayer now.
Nicola Sturgeon questions Alex Salmond's choice of Russian TV channel:::::Image copyright PA Image caption The first episode of Mr Salmond's show will be broadcast next week Nicola Sturgeon has said she would have advised Alex Salmond against hosting a TV show on Russian state-funded broadcaster RT if she had been asked.RT has been described as a propaganda tool for Vladimir Putin's government, but Mr Salmond urged viewers to judge for themselves.Ms Sturgeon said the channel chosen by her predecessor as first minister would not have been her choice.And she said she would not shy away from criticising Russian policy.The Alex Salmond Show will be broadcast on RT - formerly known as Russia Today - every Thursday from next week.Mr Salmond, who led the SNP for a total of two decades and was Scotland's first minister for seven years, said the programme would include guests from the worlds of politics, business and entertainment.It will be produced by Mr Salmond's own Slainte Media company, which he set up with former SNP MP Tasmina Ahmed-Sheikh.In her statement, current SNP leader Ms Sturgeon said she was "sure Alex's show will make interesting viewing".But she added: "However, his choice of channel would not have been my choice."Of course, Alex is not currently an elected politician and is free to do as he wishes, but had I been asked, I would have advised against RT and suggested he seek a different channel to air what I am sure will be an entertaining show."Neither myself nor the SNP will shy away from criticising Russian policy when we believe it is merited."Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Ms Sturgeon said the channel chosen by her predecessor as first minister would not have been her choice On Thursday, RT confirmed it would be registering with authorities in the US as an "agent of the Russian state" - a description disputed by the broadcaster, which insists it has editorial independence.An assessment by US intelligence agencies in January stated that: "The Kremlin staffs RT and closely supervises RT's coverage, recruiting people who can convey Russian strategic messaging because of their ideological beliefs.'''Total editorial control' Speaking to the BBC's Newsnight programme, Mr Salmond said: "Over the last year or two, 50 Labour MPs - including the current Labour Party leader - 37 Conservative MPs and 17 SNP MPs have appeared on RT programmes."It would be a bit strange if I said, now that I'm no longer a member of parliament, that I'm refusing to make my own show with my own production company over which I have total editorial control, which is broadcast on RT."The former SNP leader added: "It would be a great idea if people watched the show, and if it is a good show and it has high production values and has interesting guests with interesting things to say then they should say it is a good show."And if it turns out to be Kremlin propaganda then people can slate me, but why don't they watch the show first?"The TV show has been inspired by Mr Salmond's recent Edinburgh Festival Fringe show, Alex Salmond Unleashed.Mr Salmond, who lost his Gordon seat to the Tories in June's general election, also hosts a radio show on the London-based LBC station, and has been linked to a potential takeover of the Johnston Press group, which includes the Scotsman and the i newspapers.Speaking a launch event in London, he said he wanted to hear from "people of ideas and answers" on his TV programme, and would give guests a platform to explain their ideas before facing questions.RT says it covers "stories overlooked by the mainstream media, provides alternative perspectives on current affairs, and acquaints international audiences with a Russian viewpoint on major global events."What has been the reaction?A spokesman for the SNP said it was "entirely a matter for Alex Salmond", and that he was free to take on any opportunities he wanted now he was no longer an elected politician.The spokesman said the SNP had "regularly expressed concern over actions by the Russian government, including reports of persecution on the grounds of race and sexuality, attacks on journalists and concerns about the integrity of the democratic process, and we will continue to pursue these concerns".SNP MP Douglas Chapman tweeted at BBC presenter Andrew Neil that Mr Salmond had "probably got fed up waiting for an offer from the UK propaganda machine... you know, the one you work for."But political opponents have criticised Mr Salmond, with Scottish Conservative deputy leader Jackson Carlaw saying: "It's clear that Alex Salmond's moral compass now points towards Vladimir Putin's corrupt regime in the Kremlin."It beggars belief that a man who led Scotland for seven years should be reduced to a puppet of Russia's deeply damaging propaganda unit."Scottish Labour leadership candidate Anas Sarwar said the move demonstrated an "astonishing lack of judgement" by Mr Salmond, and called on Ms Sturgeon to "condemn this shameful decision".Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said the former first minister "fancies himself as the Michael Parkinson of Vladimir Putin's propaganda channel".The Lib Dems have challenged Mr Salmond to interview opponents of Mr Putin, such as punk band Pussy Riot or Marina Litvinenko, the widow of murdered spy and dissident Alexander Litvinenko.And LBC presenter Iain Dale tweeted: "I try my best not to slag off @LBC colleagues but I'm going to make an exception."I accepted an invite to the launch of @AlexSalmond's new TV show.Just found out it's for RT.Be ashamed, Alex.Be very ashamed."
Carl Sargeant: Calls for Carwyn Jones to resign 'premature':::::Image caption Carl Sargeant died on Tuesday after an investigation was launched into his conduct Calls for Wales' first minister to resign following the death of Carl Sargeant four days after he was sacked from government are "premature", Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood has said.Mr Sargeant was being investigated over claims of "touching or groping" and is understood to have taken his own life.Ms Wood said people who sought to make "political capital" out of the events needed to "back off".She told ITV Wales Carwyn Jones needed a fair hearing to answer questions.Mr Sargeant, the AM for Alyn and Deeside, was found dead on Tuesday, four days after Mr Jones removed him from his post as communities secretary in the Welsh Government cabinet.On Friday, Mr Jones announced an inquiry looking into how he handled the allegations against Mr Sargeant and his subsequent actions.Ms Wood said calls for Mr Jones to resign were "somewhat premature", adding: "There are questions to be answered and he deserves to be given a fair hearing in answering those."I would say that there are some people who have sought to gain political capital out of these events and to those people I just say, 'back off, now is not the time'."She welcomed the inquiry to give answers to family, friends and colleagues of Mr Sargeant.But she said: "I think it's important that we don't forget the complainants at the beginning of this and it's vitally important that people are able and feel empowered to be able to come forward and report cases of harassment where they do arise."Ms Wood has also addressed that fact that Plaid Cymru may not have treated cases of harassment in the past "with the seriousness with which they deserve".In a post for Nation.Cymru, she issued an apology to "anyone who has complained" to the party and "didn't have appropriate or sufficient action taken"."I, too, in my younger days have experienced it.Sometimes I challenged it, on other times, I said nothing," she wrote."My message to anyone who comes forward to Plaid Cymru with concerns or disclosures about harassment is - we will take you seriously, we will support you and we will take appropriate steps to ensure that complaints are investigated thoroughly and fairly."Independence queried Meanwhile, Mr Sargeant's family have criticised a decision to use a Welsh official to set up the inquiry on how allegations against him were handled.His family want the inquiry established by a civil servant from outside Wales.The Welsh Government would not comment but stressed that "the impartiality of the civil service is a given".The first minister has suggested a senior QC should carry out the work.His family disputed the inquiry would be independent if it was established by the Welsh Government Permanent Secretary Shan Morgan.Image caption First Minister Carwyn Jones said he would try to "provide answers" for Mr Sargeant's family.They said: "In response to the statement made by the first minister and to reiterate the family's original request, the inquiry must be established by a body that is fully independent of Welsh Government."The permanent secretary reports directly to the first minister and is therefore not independent."We believe that a truly independent body must also be responsible for agreeing the terms of reference and appointing the chair and secretariat for the inquiry."It is understood the family would prefer a civil servant from the UK government to establish the inquiry.Peter Watkin-Jones, a specialist in public inquiries, told BBC Radio Wales: "The effectiveness of an inquiry will very much depend on what it is a QC is asked to do and that completely depends on the terms of reference."Clearly [the family's] wishes to see things properly investigated will be taken on board but the independence comes from the QC himself or herself."There's been a lot of discussion of the independence of the people establishing the inquiry.It's bound to be someone from government because government will end up paying for it."
MPs' sex harassment scandal 'not as big as expenses':::::Image copyright PA Image caption Mr Bercow has previously called for "zero tolerance" of sexual harassment in Parliament Fewer people will be caught up in the Westminster sex scandal than were exposed in the expenses row, Commons Speaker John Bercow has predicted.Mr Bercow said he did not expect numbers "anything like" those found to be claiming fraudulently in 2009.He added this would "probably limit the damage" but did not mean the current revelations were "insignificant".His comments came as parliamentary leaders agreed a grievance procedure for handling allegations of misconduct.A number of MPs and officials from different parties are being investigated over their behaviour.Labour activist Bex Bailey has said she was raped at a party event and discouraged from reporting the 2011 incident by a party official.Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon was the first to resign over allegations against him.He stepped down after journalist Julia Hartley-Brewer told how a senior politician - named by others as Sir Michael - repeatedly touched her knee until she explained to him she would punch him in the face if he did it again.Meanwhile Labour MPs, Kelvin Hopkins and Clive Lewis, have also faced accusations but have issued firm denials.Mr Bercow, who has previously called for zero tolerance of sexual harassment in Parliament, said he did not think the "sheer numbers" would be as great and that "might and probably will limit, not remove, not render insignificant, but limit the damage".At an event at Queen Mary University in London, he said: "I think that we will get to grips with it by acting speedily and effectively, both to ensure that people who are suspected of wrongdoing are investigated and, in particular, to ensure that a complaints mechanism is established which is characterised above all by independence."He added: "I am not diminishing the significance of this.It is a real and big challenge, but I think almost learning from past scandals will help us react to and deal with it better."
RHI inquiry: 'Conspiracy of silence' around scheme:::::Image caption There are about 2,000 biomass boilers accredited to the RHI scheme The public inquiry into a botched renewable heating scheme (RHI) has been told that there was a "conspiracy of silence" around the flawed scheme.A legal representative for the Department for the Economy (DfE) said the full lessons of what had gone wrong would only be learnt when the reasons for that conspiracy were understood.But a lack of cost controls meant it could overspend by 700m over 20 years.The inquiry into the scheme began on Tuesday.Counsel for DfE Neasa Murnaghan QC said the department wanted to repeat its apology for its own failings.These included the lack of cost controls in the original regulations and the failure to spot that application numbers and boiler usage were diverging from what had been projected.Image caption Many of the boilers on the RHI scheme create heat by burning wood pellets The department had also failed to undertake the required review; had not addressed key concerns about the scheme identified by a civil servant in 2014, and had not pushed through the eventual cost controls quickly enough.It had also been responsible for the "premature release" of information about changes in the tariff rate to the industry prior to new rates of subsidy being brought in.Image copyright RHI inquiry Image caption Sir Patrick Coghlin is chairing the RHI Inquiry, which is expected to last for several months However, the department's counsel said it had also relied on expert advice from consultants and solicitors which had "exacerbated" some of those problems.The inquiry heard that some departmental civil servants had engaged their own lawyers because they wanted to express a different view in respect of some of the evidence to the corporate view of the department.The inquiry was told there had been a high turnover of staff in the department in the lifetime of the RHI scheme.Image caption Short-term measures to control the cost of the RHI scheme are in now place Later, counsel for the Department of Finance Christine Smith QC said that had officials there been aware of advice from the regulator OFGEM at the inception of the scheme, they would not have approved the DETI business case for RHI without seeking further clarity.The advice to officials highlighted a number of concerns over the draft regulations to be brought in.Ms Smith said DETI officials could have been in no doubt that there was a cap on the funding for the RHI scheme.She said in any event the issue of whether the Treasury or the department would have to pick up the bill was irrelevant, as it was all public money and the spending needed careful scrutiny.'Jarring' outcomes A lawyer for the body which had run the scheme later said it had given DETI "robust warnings" about the weakness of its draft regulations.He said this included advice about people using multiple small boilers to earn maximum subsidy.Jason Beer QC said the advice had been offered a year before the scheme was introduced, but there was no evidence it had been followed.He said there had been much talk of "the benefit of hindsight" during the inquiry."OFGEM had the benefit of foresight and pointed out the risks," he said.Mr Beer said the energy body had warned DETI that there were big holes in their proposed scheme which left it open to abuse.It had he said "firmly advised" them not to proceed.But he said once it was up and running, OFGEM could only administer it within the regulations.Those regulations, he said, "permit outcomes that jar with common sense".
Sturgeon 'substantially in dark' over Brexit talks:::::Image copyright PA Nicola Sturgeon has accused the UK government of leaving devolved administrations "substantially in the dark" on key Brexit talks.The first minister's comments come ahead of a meeting of the British Irish Council in Jersey.She called on the UK government to make good on its promise to give the devolved administrations a "genuine role" in discussions.The UK government said there had been an unprecedented level of engagement.Ms Sturgeon will attend the British Irish Council with Scottish Brexit minster Mike Russell and External Affairs Secretary Fiona Hyslop.The First Secretary of State Damien Green will represent the UK government.'Serious economic damage' The first minister is seeking urgent clarity on what kind of transition arrangements are planned for sectors like agriculture and fisheries.Ahead of the meeting, she claimed the devolved administrations had been "cut out" of the talks.Image copyright Reuters Image caption Damien Green will represent the UK government at the meeting She said: "In less than 18 months' time, the UK will be leaving the EU, but despite reassurances that all devolved administrations will be consulted on the withdrawal negotiations, we remain substantially in the dark."The UK government assured us that the Joint Ministerial Committee (JMC) would seek to agree UK positions and discuss issues stemming from the negotiations, respecting the devolved competencies, but the UK government then allowed that process to fall short of what is required."'Securing a deal' She added that there had only been one meeting of the JMC on EU negotiations since talks began on 19 June."This is not an abstract debate about process," she said."Leaving the EU will have an enormous impact on Scottish jobs, our economy and our relationship with the world - indeed, Brexit's effects are already being felt."We know from businesses in Scotland that a hard Brexit will cause serious and long-term economic damage and it is crucial we stay in the single market and customs union."As has previously been said, the clock is ticking on Brexit and it is essential that the UK government live up to its promises to give devolved administrations a genuine role on what is by far the most important issue facing every corner of these islands."A UK government spokesman said: "These comments come just weeks after an agreement was made at a Joint Ministerial Committee between the UK government and the devolved administrations, including the Scottish government, on the principles that will underpin the process for bringing back powers from the EU to the UK."There has been an unprecedented level of engagement between ministers and officials in devolved administrations which will continue.We are committed to securing a deal that works for the entire UK, including Scotland."
House of Commons staff credit card purchases revealed:::::Football kit and a book on facial hair were among items bought by Commons staff using government credit cards, the BBC has learned.A Freedom of Information request showed 200 had been spent on the football kit and 140 had been claimed for cinema visits under "office supplies".The charge cards are used to pay for "business expenses".A Commons spokesman said the items had followed purchasing policy as "genuine business transactions".The disclosures follow a Freedom of Information request submitted by the BBC in January asking about House of Commons' government procurement cards.Beard book The reply showed that House of Commons & Parliamentary Digital Service staff had spent a total of 630,000 using the cards over the last two years.It said there were 205 cards in circulation for staff "to make quick, simple and cost-effective purchases when they are either away from their workplace, on business" or for "very low value items".A 30 book entitled Framing the Face: New perspectives on the History of Facial Hair was among the items purchased using the cards.Staff also spent 1,699 in luxury US department store Barney's - although this money was later returned.A further 200 was used to pay for football kit, the documents showed.Pub trips The papers also showed staff claimed 1,500 for pub trips for educational and parliamentary outreach, while 140 of cinema visits were claimed as "office supplies".However, a House of Commons spokesman said all the items listed had correctly followed purchasing policy as "genuine business transactions".He added that use of the cards to purchase alcohol was limited to specific circumstances."The procurement cards allow some members of the House of Commons service to pay for low value items in a cheap, secure and quick way," the spokesman said."Failure to follow the agreed procedures may result in the card being withdrawn."A separate 2016 audit report, also released to the BBC under the Freedom of Information Act, found that "most cardholders had not effectively read or understood the procurement policy, particularly with regard to prohibited purposes."It looked at a sample of 50 spends made by Commons staff and found 21 were for prohibited purposes.
UK industrial output jumps in September:::::Image copyright Getty Images The UK's industrial output grew at its fastest pace so far this year in September, according to official figures.Production rose by 0.7% compared with the month before, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said, boosted by machinery and equipment output.Separate data showed the UK's trade deficit in goods and services narrowed by more than expected in September.However, construction output fell by 1.6% in the month, the ONS said.'Mixed' outlook The increase in industrial production was better than analysts' forecasts, and the fastest growth seen since December last year.Manufacturing output - a subset of industrial output - also rose by 0.7% in September."Industrial production has risen for six consecutive months, a feat last achieved 23 years ago," said Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.However, he added that the recovery in manufacturing output could be hit by recent rises in the oil price.Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club, said the outlook for manufacturing appeared "mixed".Domestic conditions looked "challenging despite recent decent demand", he said."Increased prices for capital goods and big-ticket consumer durable goods, weakened consumer purchasing power, and economic and political uncertainty threaten to hamper manufacturers."On the export side, a very competitive pound and healthy global demand are helping UK manufacturers competing in foreign markets.The weakened pound also appears to be encouraging some companies to switch to domestic sources for supplies."Image copyright Getty Images The UK's trade deficit in goods and services narrowed by 0.7bn between August and September 2017 to 2.75bn, mainly due to trade in goods exports increasing by 1.3bn.Despite this, the UK's trade performance during the third quarter as a whole worsened, according to the ONS data.In the three months to September 2017, the total UK trade deficit widened by 3bn to 9.5bn, mainly due to a increased imports, including of machinery, non-monetary gold and fuels.The construction output data was much weaker than expected.As well as the sharp fall in September from August, output was only up 1.1% from a year earlier - the weakest annual rate since March last year.The ONS said the latest economic data did not suggest there would be any change to its initial estimate that the UK economy grew 0.4% in the third quarter of the year.
Penny Mordaunt replaces Priti Patel in cabinet reshuffle:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Watch: Penny Mordaunt at Downing Street Penny Mordaunt has been promoted to the cabinet as the new International Development Secretary, following the resignation of Priti Patel.Like Ms Patel, Ms Mordaunt was among Conservatives who backed Leave during the EU Referendum campaign.Ms Mordaunt, 44, said she was "delighted" to take on the role, as she visited her new department.Ms Patel quit on Wednesday, admitting unauthorised meetings with Israeli officials had "lacked transparency".It was the second cabinet resignation in a week.Last week Gavin Williamson replaced Sir Michael Fallon as defence secretary, after he quit saying his conduct had "fallen short" of the required standards after allegations of inappropriate sexual behaviour.Ms Mordaunt, MP for Portsmouth North, is a Royal Navy reservist and was appointed as the first female minister for the Armed Forces in 2015.It had been thought she was in the running to replace Sir Michael last week.Speaking at the Department for International Development, Ms Mordaunt said: "I'm delighted to have been appointed by the prime minister to be the new secretary of state for International Development."I'm looking forward to working with the team here to continue building a safer, more secure, more prosperous world for us all and really giving the British public pride in what we do."Analysis By Laura Kuenssberg, BBC political editor There are good reasons why Penny Mordaunt has been promoted to the Department for International Development.She has worked in humanitarian aid, she has been a minister in two different departments, former colleagues rate her abilities and she was tipped last week to be elevated to running the Ministry of Defence.But there is a lot more to her than meets the eye, and a lot more that is interesting about her than going on TV in a swimsuit.She also has a different political qualification - she was prominent campaigning Brexiteer.Read more from Laura First elected to the Commons in 2010 she had been minister for disabled people in the Department for Work and Pensions until her promotion.She is also known for appearing on the reality TV programme Splash!in 2014.BBC political correspondent Vicki Young said she thought Ms Mordaunt would be a popular appointment within the party.She said it would keep the balance within the cabinet when it came to Brexit - in terms of the numbers of ministers who supported Leave or Remain during the referendum - as well as preserving the gender balance, an issue which Theresa May was concerned about.As International Development Secretary, Ms Mordaunt will be in charge of the UK's 13bn foreign aid budget.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Penny Mordaunt relives her moment diving in to a swimming pool on TV and admits "it hurt a bit" as she hit the water Former Culture Secretary John Whittingdale told the BBC: "I think it's a good appointment.Penny is somebody who has a lot of experience, she has worked in an international department before - as armed forces minister, I have no doubt she will do an excellent job."Aid charities also welcomed the appointment.Referring to Ms Mordaunt's student work in Romanian orphanages, director of anti-poverty campaign One UK, Romilly Greenhill, said she was "well suited for her new role" while Oxfam chief executive Mark Goldring hoped Ms Mordaunt would be "a champion for Britain ensuring that aid is spent where it is most needed, helping the world's poorest people".Her Labour shadow Kate Osamor congratulated Ms Mordaunt on her appointment and said she "faces an immediate challenge of restoring integrity to British international development policy after the actions of Priti Patel".Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption What went wrong for Priti Patel?The BBC's James Landale explains She added: "That means she must unequivocally commit to the spirit, as well as the letter, of Britain's pledge to spend 0.7 per cent of national income on international development, and face down those in her party who want to merge DFID into the Foreign and Commonwealth Office."Ms Patel's difficulties began last week, when the BBC revealed she had arranged a number of meetings with business and political figures during a family holiday to Israel in August, without telling Downing Street or the Foreign Office.It later emerged that after Ms Patel's visit to Israel, she asked her officials to look into whether Britain could support humanitarian operations conducted by the Israeli army in the occupied Golan Heights area.In other appointments on Thursday, Sarah Newton has been made a minister in the Department for Work and Pensions while Victoria Atkins has become a Parliamentary Under Secretary of State at the Home Office.
Gordon Brown predicts Brexit 'crisis point':::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Gordon Brown warns of Brexit 'crisis point' The UK could remain in the EU if Leave voters could be offered a "game-changing" deal next summer, Gordon Brown has told BBC News.The former Labour prime minister told Laura Kuenssberg he was not arguing for a second EU referendum "at this stage".But he predicted a "crisis point", when Leave voters realised they were not going to get what they were promised.And they might be persuaded to change their mind if they were given "new evidence", he said.The UK is due to leave the European Union at the end of March 2019, after 2016's referendum in which 51.9% of voters backed Brexit."Is there something that we didn't get right the last time that could persuade millions of Leave voters that it was worth going Remain?"Mr Brown, who campaigned to remain in the EU, said.He predicted it would become clear by next summer that the UK was not going to get "proper control" of its borders, trade and laws, saying: "We will still be governed in many ways by the European Court of Justice."And he said the UK would not get its money back in the way the Leave campaign had claimed, "including the 350m a week for the National Health Service"."I would not try to tell people that they were wrong," he said, stressing people had voted Leave for "very real reasons" that had to be "respected".But, he said, there "may be scope for a reassessment" next summer.'Opposing extremes' Brexit negotiations are continuing but EU sources told the BBC on Thursday that the UK had only two weeks left to make progress on so-called withdrawal issues such as the so-called "divorce bill" - the amount the UK will pay to settle its financial obligations.Other sticking points include the Northern Ireland border and citizens' rights.If a deal is to be ratified by the various national and regional parliaments by March 2019 - EU negotiator Michel Barnier has suggested one will need to be agreed by October 2018.Mr Brown was not specific about what a "game-changing" offer might entail, but he said the mood was changing in the EU, which would have to agree to any new offer."You'd have to be able to say something about migration, about the courts, about money - but I think that is the point at which the nation should be given new information about what is possible.So, I'm not advocating a referendum at this stage," he said.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption In full: Laura Kuenssberg interviews Gordon Brown Mr Brown, who is promoting his new memoir, My Life, Our Times, also warned that Scotland could become the next Catalonia, with two "opposing extremes" pulling the nation apart.He argued for a "middle way" between the SNP's demand for full independence and what he said was the Conservative Party's belief in maintaining the "status quo".The answer, he said, was to move to a "federalist UK with maximum autonomy for Scotland".Mr Brown also called for more action on tax havens and hit back at claims he had agitated for then Prime Minister Tony Blair's removal when he was chancellor, insisting that any disagreements they had had been about policies rather than personalities.He added he believed political leaders had a "shelf life" of about six years and it was an "aberration" that he had been able to survive at the top for 13 years, including his time at the Treasury and Number 10.
MP Charlie Elphicke 'does not know what he is accused of':::::Image copyright PA Image caption Charlie Elphicke has denied any "criminal wrongdoing" A Conservative MP suspended by his party after "serious allegations" were made against him says he still does not know what he is accused of.Charlie Elphicke, a former party whip who has been the MP for Dover and Deal since 2010, has denied any "criminal wrongdoing".In a statement, the married 46-year-old said: "So what then is [the] explanation for what I am accused of?"The Conservative Party has not yet commented on his statement.Referring to an explanation for his suspension, Mr Elphicke said: "I cannot give one.Because I do not know what I am accused of."He claimed the process being followed by the party was "fundamentally wrong".The Conservatives have recently published a new code of conduct for MPs and other elected representatives.'Denial of justice' Mr Elphicke, who was suspended last Friday, added: "The fact is that this whole area of reporting misconduct and managing allegations of misconduct is a mess."He said he had received no further information since being told by the chief whip that serious allegations made against him had been passed to the police."I asked what the allegations were and he would not tell me," he said."He only said that he and the prime minister had decided the whip should be suspended from me."So extraordinary as it may seem, I am no wiser now than I was on Friday evening."It is not clear which police force is dealing with the allegations, but when asked for a statement the Metropolitan Police said: "The Met does not identify any person who may, or may not be, subject to an investigation."Following the receipt of any allegation, investigating officers will only make contact with potential suspects if and when it is operationally appropriate to do so."Mr Elphicke said it was "a denial of justice when people who have had allegations made against them, lose their job or their party whip without knowing what those allegations are".He said this was "fundamentally wrong" and an "injustice to those who stand accused".Everyone should be "equal before the law", and was "innocent until proven otherwise".Mr Elphicke concluded: "Whatever it turns out I stand accused of, I deny any criminal wrongdoing."
Who is Penny Mordaunt?:::::Penny Mordaunt has been promoted to be the UK's new international development secretary, in charge of a 13bn annual budget.Ms Mordaunt, who had been a junior work and pensions minister, was seen as a frontrunner to land the job of defence secretary when Michael Fallon was forced to quit last week.Her background as a naval reservist made her appear a good fit for that role and she had previously been the armed forces minister under David Cameron - the first woman to have held that role.It was not to be her day last Thursday - but the Portsmouth North MP has not had to wait long for another opportunity to get her feet under the cabinet table.The fact that she campaigned for a Leave vote in last year's EU referendum will help Theresa May preserve the cabinet's delicate Leave/Remain balance, as well as the male/female gender split.The daughter of a paratrooper and a special needs teacher, Ms Mordaunt has two brothers, Edward and James, who is her twin, and has lived in her home town of Portsmouth since the age of two.She was educated at Oaklands RC Comprehensive School and was the first member of her family to go to university.Before studying philosophy at Reading university, she worked as a magician's assistant for a local member of the Magic Circle, Will Ayling, author of The Art of Illusion and Oriental Conjuring and Magic.She says on her website that she first became interested in politics working in hospitals and orphanages in post-revolutionary Romania during her gap year.But the 44-year-old is probably best known outside Westminster for her appearance on ITV's celebrity diving show Splash!to raise money for charity.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Penny Mordaunt relives her moment diving in to a swimming pool on TV and admits "it hurt a bit" as she hit the water She exited the contest in January 2014 after twice mistiming her back somersault from the 7.5m board but earned praise from Tom Daley and the other judges for her have-a-go attitude.Later that year she was in the headlines again for a speech she gave in the Commons on poultry welfare, which turned out to be an excuse to slip some very un-parliamentary language into proceedings.She admitted she had made the speech - with its liberal use of "lay", "laid" and "cock welfare" - as a bet, after it was exposed in a front page story in the Mail on Sunday."When I was at Dartmouth doing my reservist training some of my marine training officers thought it would be a good idea to try and break the ladylike persona that I maintained throughout the whole of my course by getting me to yell particular rude words during the most gruelling part of our training, and I'm happy to say that they failed in that," she said."But during our mess dinner at the end of the course I was fined for a misdemeanour, and the fine was to say a particular word, the abbreviation of cockerel, several times during a speech on the floor of the House of Commons and mention all of the officer's names present."An MP since 2010, Ms Mordaunt is a former head of the Conservative Party's youth wing and was a press officer for William Hague when he was party leader, during which time she was seconded to work on George W Bush's election campaign in Washington."I was amazed at the similarities of the issues and tactics," she told The Daily Telegraph.She was high profile campaigner for the Leave campaign in last year's EU referendum and underlined her pro-Brexit credentials by backing Andrea Leadsom in the subsequent Conservative leadership contest.During the referendum campaign - while a defence minister - she prompted a row by telling the BBC's Andrew Marr Show that the UK could not veto Turkey joining the European Union.The then prime minister contradicted her on ITV's Peston on Sunday an hour later.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Penny Mordaunt: "We're not going to be consulted... they are going to join, it's a matter of when" Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption David Cameron: "Britain and every other country in the EU has a veto on another country joining.That is a fact" Before entering the world of Westminster politics, she was a press officer for Kensington and Chelsea Council and the Freight Transport Association, when she supported British truckers during French blockades.She has also worked in the charity sector as a director of the Big Lottery Fund and Diabetes UK, where she set up services in developing countries particularly prone to the condition.She was also involved in David Willetts' abortive campaign to be Conservative leader in 2005 as his chief of staff.
No alternative but to sack Carl Sargeant says Carwyn Jones:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Carwyn Jones said he had "no alternative" but to sack Carl Sargeant First Minister Carwyn Jones has said he had no alternative but to sack Carl Sargeant following allegations about his conduct.Mr Sargeant's body was found on Tuesday, four days after he was dismissed as communities minister and suspended from the Welsh Labour party.It is understood he took his own life but Mr Jones said he had acted "by the book" over the matter.He said he would try to provide answers which Mr Sargeant's family deserved.There has been criticism of the way Mr Sargeant was treated and his family has called for an independent inquiry.Ex-Welsh Government minister Leighton Andrews, Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies and Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood also want an inquiry, which Mr Jones suggested could take place in future.Claims about inappropriate "touching or groping" were made to the first minister's office last week and following Friday's sacking, the Alyn and Deeside AM had vowed to clear his name even though he said he did not know the details of the allegations.An inquest into Mr Sargeant's death will be opened and adjourned on Monday.Mr Jones met Labour AMs on Thursday to explain how he handled the conduct allegations against Mr Sargeant.Mr Jones then made a statement from Welsh Government headquarters in Cardiff on Thursday afternoon.He called the situation "the darkest days" any of those at the assembly could remember but were the "darkest of all for the family".Image caption A relentless drip-drip of disinformation had a strain on Mr Sargeant and others, Leighton Andrews says Despite speculation Mr Jones could have resigned on Thursday, the speech made no reference to his own political future.Speaking publicly for the first time since Mr Sargeant's death, he said: "There are a lot of inaccuracies in the press and many of you have questions to ask about what happened last week."He said precise details "will need to be properly disclosed" at the inquest."I and my team will of course be cooperating fully with any questions that are raised there," he said."The family deserve to have their questions answered and if that isn't possible through the inquest then I will endeavour to make that happen through other means."I welcome any scrutiny of my actions in the future and it is appropriate for that to be done independently."Paying tribute to Mr Sargeant, he said: "Carl was a true force of nature - he drove through more legislation than any other minister.Not just through force of argument, but through force of personality."Analysis by Vaughan Roderick, BBC Welsh Affairs editor When Carwyn Jones finally appeared in front of the cameras today to deliver a statement on the death of Carl Sargeant and the events that led up to it, there was an expectation that the first minister would attempt to answer at least some of the many questions that have been raised since the former secretary's death.Instead, while paying tribute to the man he described as a "true force of nature" he did little to answer the questions raised by Mr Sargeant's family and others.A reference to a possible independent inquiry seemed equivocal at best.The first minister's reference to "inaccuracies in the press" again raises more questions than answers.If reports are inaccurate - why not correct them and why refuse to answer questions from journalists who are trying their best to report the situation accurately?Carwyn Jones is human, of course, and I have no doubt that his grief and shock is genuine.That may explain why a statement which would have been perfectly apt in the hours following Mr Sargeant's death seems insufficient and vague when delivered two and half days later.Following the news conference, opponents rounded on Mr Jones.Mr Davies said the episode has "significantly undermined public confidence in the first minister", while Ms Wood said the statement "was not adequate".UKIP Wales said it would call for a motion of no confidence in the first minister.And Mr Sargeant's lifelong friend and Flintshire council's deputy leader Bernie Attridge, called for Mr Jones to resign saying he "had not done the decent thing".Mr Andrews said a number of people were expecting a "definite commitment to an independent inquiry" from Mr Jones' statement.Earlier on Thursday, Mr Andrews alleged Mr Sargeant had been the target of bullying in the Welsh Government.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Leighton Andrews wants answers from the first minister Former public services minister Mr Andrews - claimed there was "minor bullying" and "mind games" during his time in government - and said the atmosphere was "toxic" during the last assembly term."The undermining was of ministers, deputy ministers and special advisers," Mr Andrews said in a statement issued on Thursday.He said Mr Sargeant "was unquestionably the target of some of this behaviour.The relentless drip-drip of disinformation - and worse - had a strain on his and others' mental health."The ex-Rhondda AM said he had raised one particular issue with Mr Jones, of which he had direct evidence, but claimed due process was not followed.The Welsh Government has declined to respond to Mr Andrews' claims.
Brexit: Michel Barnier says 'time pressing' as talks resume:::::Image copyright Reuters EU negotiator Michel Barnier has told the UK "time is pressing" to get a deal on a divorce bill, as Brexit talks resumed in Brussels.Mr Barnier said "the moment for real clarity" from the UK was approaching.EU sources have told the BBC the UK has only two weeks left to make progress on so-called withdrawal issues.A major stumbling block remains the amount the UK will pay as it leaves, as well as the rights of EU citizens in the UK, and UK citizens in the EU.Without agreement in these areas, and the Northern Ireland border, EU leaders are unlikely to vote at their December summit to widen talks to include trade and transition deals as the UK wants, sources say.Mr Barnier, who is in Rome to make a speech to Italian politicians, tweeted "it's high time to clarify the essential principles" of an exit deal with the UK.He will meet UK Brexit Secretary David Davis for a sixth round of negotiations on Friday, with talks being conducted by their officials on Thursday.'Bit rich' It comes as European leaders are reportedly concerned about the instability of the UK government, as Theresa May lost a second cabinet minister in seven days.According to The Times, European Union leaders are preparing for the possible "fall of Theresa May before the new year" and either "a change of leadership or elections leading to a Labour victory".Former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith said it was "a bit rich" for EU leaders to suggest Mrs May's position was precarious, at a time when the Netherlands and Germany faced difficulties forming governments, there was "chaos" in Italy and arrests of Catalonian separatists in Spain.He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the government's lack of a Parliamentary majority meant it would be "a bit bumpy at times" but Mrs May's position was secure."I think Theresa May is the one person that can actually still unite the cabinet, unite the party, and make sure that whilst we are leaving the European Union, the party itself stays at ease with her domestic agenda," he said.Citizens' rights The UK government has, meanwhile, published updated proposals on how the rights of EU citizens in the UK will be protected, as it claimed "real progress" had been made in this area.EU citizens would be granted a statutory right of appeal if their application to stay in the UK after Brexit is rejected - and the cost of applying for settled status would be kept to "no more than that of a British passport".But the UK proposal was criticised by the European Parliament's Brexit negotiator Guy Verhofstadt, who said he wanted the application to be cost-free and near-unconditional."We don't recognise reports suggesting that a deal on citizens' rights is almost finalised.There are still major issues that have to be resolved," said Mr Verhofstadt on Wednesday.The UK is due to leave the EU at the end of March 2019 after a referendum in which 51.9% of people voted in favour of Brexit.The two sides have said they are in favour of a transitional phase lasting around two years to smooth the way to relations with the UK outside the EU, but they are also doing preparatory work in case no agreement is reached and the UK leaves without any deal in place.
End age of austerity, says Tory MP Nick Boles:::::Image caption Nick Boles says the government lacks direction Chancellor Philip Hammond should declare an end to the "age of austerity" in this month's Budget, a former Conservative minister has said.Nick Boles warned the party would lose the next election if all it had to offer voters was more spending cuts.He called on the chancellor to scrap his deficit reduction target and unveil a "massive boost" in public investment.Labour said his comments showed the Conservatives were "losing the economic argument".Mr Boles, who was a close ally of David Cameron and served in his government from 2012 to 2016, said: "The government can't, after seven or eight years, say that the policy we had eight years ago is going to be the only policy we can offer to the British public for another eight years."We can't expect to be re-elected if we have no new story to tell and no new direction."Our urgent problem in this economy is that wages aren't growing.They are not growing because productivity isn't growing and productivity isn't growing because our rate of investment is too low, both in the public sector and the private sector.That needs to be a priority now."The age of austerity is over.We now need an age of investment."His call, in his book Square Deal, echoes those being made by Labour ahead of 22 November's Budget.A Labour spokesperson: "Even Tory MPs are now openly admitting the chancellor needs to change course in this Budget, proving yet again that they are clearly losing the economic argument."The fact they have resorted to pushing extremely watered down versions of Labour policy just confirms how little faith they have in their own government's economic policy.And it further shows that Labour now represents the mainstream of British politics."'Get wages up' Mr Boles said austerity had been the right policy when the annual deficit stood at 10% of GDP, but it was "absolutely fine" for it to remain at its current level of about 2.6% indefinitely.He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "Many governments run deficits of that sort of level year on year.So long as you are spending the money on investment, there is a very good prospect that that will generate a return in the economy that enables you to pay the debt down."He said the "urgent priority now" was to "get productivity up and to get real wages up" .In October last year, Philip Hammond ditched his predecessor George Osborne's target of eliminating the deficit - the gap between government spending and tax receipts - by 2019/20.Instead, he said the new aim was to get rid of the deficit by the middle of the 2020s.But he is coming under renewed pressure to ditch that target when he delivers his Budget, with the Institute for Fiscal Studies warning the deficit could be on course to be 20bn higher than expected by 2021/22, amid predictions of sluggish economic performance.
Alex Salmond: Trump 'broke Scots investment promises':::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Trump golf course "not worth it" says Aberdeenshire Council chief Donald Trump has failed to honour his investment promises to Scotland, former First Minister Alex Salmond has said.Before his election, the US President said he would spend 1bn building a golf resort in Aberdeenshire.Ten years after the planning application was called in by the Scottish government, much of that development has yet to materialise.The Trump Organisation said it had made a long-term commitment and intends to continue building on the site.It has given BBC Scotland first sight of its plans for the next phase of development on the Menie estate, north of Aberdeen.'Long-term investment' Donald Trump was given permission to build there on the basis that any environmental damage could be justified by the scale of economic benefit being promised.It was supposed to be a 1bn investment, creating about 6,000 jobs.It was to include two championship golf courses, a 450-bedroom hotel and almost 1,500 holiday and residential homes.The development so far includes one golf course and a club house, a 16-bedroom boutique hotel and some lodges.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Alex Salmond: Trump has huge credibility problem The Trump Organisation said it had spent around 100m, which is about 10% of what was promised.It said about 500 people were involved in construction and that it employs 150 people in Aberdeenshire, including part-time and seasonal staff.Alex Salmond, who supported the Trump resort as the local MSP, thinks that's not good enough."The people who were putting it forward did not live up and honour the agreements they made to the Scottish people," he said.Asked if he'd been taken in by Donald Trump, Mr Salmond said: "To the extent that I found it difficult to believe that somebody could be so brazenly certain of an investment plan at a public local inquiry and then make very little attempt to bring it home."'Multi-phase project' The Trump Organisation's Sarah Malone is in charge of the Aberdeenshire business which is known as Trump International Golf Links Scotland."We haven't finished" she said."It's a multi-phase project and we're not stupid.This wasn't going to get built overnight."It's a long-term investment opportunity for us and that's how Mr Trump has always approached it."Even if we'd only spent 10m that should be celebrated," Ms Malone said.Image caption The Menie course was designed by Dr Martin Hawtree The golf course - which has been widely acclaimed - has also had an environmental impact at Menie, which forms part of the Foveran Links Site of Special Scientific interest.It had been given special status because it was considered one of the finest examples of a mobile sand dune system in the UK.But Scottish Natural Heritage has reported some permanent habitat loss and damage to the dune system.It has told the BBC it is now reviewing the boundary of the protected site.The leader of Aberdeenshire Council, Jim Gifford, who has always supported the development, said it was not worth the environmental trade off."For what is only there just now - no - because the economic benefit hasn't come through," he said."But in the big picture that was put in front of us 10 years ago, it was worth doing."The council leader wants the Trump Organisation to finish the job."I think they have an obligation to bring forward what they promised, that's the bottom line of it," he said."The difficulty we have is we can't force them to do that."Resort village The Trump Organisation has recently submitted a planning application for a second golf course, which has been met with environmental objections.It has also drawn up plans to build a resort village at Menie with a mixture of 550 residential homes and holiday accommodation, but no big hotel.The Trump team hope to build these different types of property at the same time, rather than in the phases set out in the original planning consent.Image caption Donald Trump renamed the building MacLeod House after his mother Sarah Malone said the phasing, which requires holiday accommodation to be built before private homes, "doesn't make any commercial sense".She said: "It never did and I think it's another illustration of why the planning system is flawed."Alex Salmond anticipates problems in getting the plans approved.He said: "I think the Trump Organisation, whoever's putting forward the proposals, will have a huge credibility problem in persuading this generation of planners and councillors in Aberdeenshire to believe the commitments they're now making given the track record of the last ten years."Donald Trump put construction on hold while he fought and lost a legal battle with the Scottish government over an offshore wind farm on the Aberdeenshire coast.In the intervening years, market conditions in north east Scotland have changed with the oil price crash hitting the local economy hard.The wind farm has now got the go ahead but despite that, the Trump Organisation is expected to bring forward its revised house building plans early in the New Year.Donald Trump: Scotland's President will be broadcast on BBC One Scotland, at 21:00 on Thursday 9 November.
We want our Brexit cash boost - NHS boss:::::Image caption NHS England's boss said trust in politics would be damaged if the NHS did not get more The health service should get the cash boost it was promised during the EU referendum, NHS England's boss says.Simon Stevens used controversial claims used by Vote Leave - that the NHS could benefit by 350m a week - to put the case for more money in a major speech.With waiting times worsening, he said trust in politics would be damaged if the NHS did not get more.He said the budget had grown modestly in recent years, but those rises would "nose-dive" in the next few years.He said if action was not taken the NHS would really start to struggle, predicting hospital waiting lists could grow by a quarter to five million by 2021.The speech by Mr Stevens at the NHS Providers' annual conference of health managers is highly political, coming just a fortnight before the Budget.Search for a health trust or postcode Search for your nearest health trusts Can't find your health trust?Browse the full list Browse the full list Go Rather search by typing?Back to search If you can't see the NHS Tracker, click or tap here.'Honour the Brexit promises' During the referendum it was claimed 350m a week was sent to the EU and that would be better spent on the NHS.The claim was widely contested at the time and ever since - it did not take into account the rebate the UK had nor the fact the UK benefited from investment from the EU.Some argued it proved highly influential in the referendum result.Mr Stevens refused to be drawn on just how much money he was after - sources close to him said he was not specifically asking for an extra 350m a week, which would work out at an extra 18bn a year.Instead, they said it just needed to be significantly more than had been promised to date if waiting times were not to worsen.It comes as three highly influential health think-tanks - the King's Fund, the Nuffield Trust and the Health Foundation - published a joint report calling for an extra 4bn to be given to health next year.That amounts to eight times more than health spending is due to rise by.He told delegates in Birmingham: "The NHS wasn't on the ballot paper, but it was on the ballot bus, 'Vote Leave for a better funded health service, 350m a week.'"Rather than our criticising these clear Brexit funding commitments to NHS patients - promises entered into by cabinet ministers and by MPs - the public want to see them honoured.Image copyright Getty Images "Trust in democratic politics will not be strengthened if anyone now tries to argue, 'You voted Brexit, partly for a better funded health service.But precisely because of Brexit, you now can't have one.'"He said the "modest" rises seen in recent years were set to "nose-drive" in the next two, with the budget growing by 0.4% next year and by less than 1% the year after once inflation was taken into account.Mr Stevens said if that continued "choking" of investment happened the NHS would have to "turn back a decade of progress".He warned a hospital waiting list of five million by 2021 was likely - meaning a 10th of the population would be waiting for treatment.Currently, just under four million people are.Targets 'being missed' NHS Providers chief executive Chris Hopson has also given his backing to extra money.He pointed out key targets for A&E, routine operations and cancer care were already being widely missed."The Budget is an important opportunity, at the beginning of this Parliament, to protect care quality for patients and service users and help the NHS break out of the downward spiral in which it is currently trapped."There isn't enough funding to cope."The government has promised the NHS front-line budget will be 8bn a year higher by 2022 - once inflation is taken into account - than it is now.But that does not take into account the whole health budget - which also includes spending on things such as training and healthy lifestyle services, like stop smoking services.Once that is factored in, the current average annual increase are running at less than 1%, but that dips in the coming years.Historically, the service has enjoyed annual rises of about 4% to cover the cost of the ageing population and new drugs.A Department of Health spokesman said: "Research shows spending on the NHS is in line with most other European countries, and the public can be reassured that the government is committed to continued investment in the health service."Read more from Nick Follow Nick on Twitter
Perplexed about Brexit? Here are six things to watch:::::Image copyright Getty Images We're now halfway between the Brexit referendum and the day the UK is supposed to leave the EU, and the entire process seems to be clouded in confusion.Don't take my word for it.I've spent the last three weeks talking to a variety of people, from Irish thoroughbred breeders to chief executives of construction companies, from nuclear scientists to taxi drivers.And everyone wants to know where on earth all this is heading.I've seen it argued that Leavers and Remainers find it difficult to have a constructive debate because the Leave side tend to focus on broad political themes (Take Back Control, anyone?)while the Remain side focus on the detail.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption On 29 March 2017, European Council President Donald Tusk received the letter which triggered the UK's withdrawal from the EU That's why some advocates of Remain still have difficulty accepting the fact that a big political decision was made in the referendum.At the same time a government that has committed itself to Brexit, but is divided about what that actually means, is trying to master the detail in record time.And if there's one thing about Brexit that does become clearer every week, it is that this is a process of unprecedented complexity.Like unstitching a blanket, or unbaking a cake: you can choose your own simile, but the inference is clear.No advanced industrial economy has ever tried to do anything quite like this before - extricating itself in an astonishingly short space of time from more than 40 years of shared sovereignty and close economic co-ordination with its nearest neighbours.. No wonder we're still a wee bit perplexed.Explaining Brexit is a bit like stapling jelly.But here, slightly at random and in no particular order, are a few things that emerged from our series, which may be worth keeping an eye on.1.Direct effect Image copyright Getty Images If a deal is to emerge soon on the issue of citizens' rights (for EU citizens here in the UK in particular) then the notion of "direct effect" is likely to loom large.It is a really important principle of the European Court of Justice, because it means individuals can invoke European law before national courts.In this case, the Brexit withdrawal agreement (with European law enshrined within it) could be written directly into UK law rather than relying on a separate piece of UK legislation to implement it.The EU thought that the UK had conceded this point; if that turns out not to be so, it will cause problems.2.Ireland Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Theresa May met Ireland's Prime Minister Leo Varadkar in Downing Street in September 2017 It's not just about the border, and the effect on Northern Ireland, critically important though that is.A total of 80% of Irish exports go to or through the UK, which is also critical for Irish energy supplies, and no other country outside the UK has nearly as much at stake in the Brexit debate as the Republic of Ireland."There is hardly any area of Irish life that won't be affected in one way or another," says Tony Connelly, author of the book Brexit and Ireland.That means Dublin needs a good deal with the UK after Brexit.But it doesn't mean Ireland won't play tough.In the Brexit negotiations it is sticking with the mantra of the unity of the EU27, and exasperation with UK politics is mounting.3.Robots Image copyright Getty Images Anna Wallace, the director of political relations at the professional services firm PricewaterhouseCoopers, told the story of a manufacturing company in Wales that has decided to replace EU migrant workers with machines, rather than with a locally hired workforce."They knew they were probably going to do that in five years' time," she says."But good businesses are now thinking about all of those things together."It is a reminder that Brexit is only one part of a much larger economic debate, as another technological revolution looms large.Automation would be changing the working lives of many people come what may (in fact, it already is).But the effect of Brexit will probably speed up things.The good thing about change?It always brings opportunity as well as risk.4.The labour market Image copyright Getty Images The end of the free movement of people from the EU could well lead to some liberalisation of UK immigration policy for the rest of the world.That may not come as a surprise to many economists who deal with immigration issues, but it may not have been what many Leave supporters thought they were voting for.The UK will still need immigrant labour to keep its economy moving.Even the pressure group Migration Watch advocates the creation of new schemes for seasonal agricultural workers from the EU, and for young people between the ages of 18 and 30 to work in the UK for up to two years.But immigration policy isn't just about the UK choosing whom it wants.They have to want to come to the UK too.The rest of the world beyond Europe may have to fill some gaps in the market.5.JET Image copyright EUROfusion Consortium The Joint European Torus in Oxfordshire can lay convincing claim to be the greatest scientific experiment in the UK.The long-term aim is to produce an unlimited supply of clean energy through nuclear fusion.But Jet is run under the auspices of Euratom, the European Atomic Energy Community.And alongside the EU, we're leaving Euratom too.The trouble is that funding for Jet runs out at the end of 2018.And until we know the future relationship between Euratom and the UK after Brexit, no one can say for certain that funding will be extended.Surely, you cry, they won't just pull the giant Torus plug?"I work in fusion research so by definition I think I'm an optimist," says Ian Chapman, the chief executive of the UK Atomic Energy Authority."But everybody is anxious, and everybody wants a resolution to this as quickly as possible."6.(Continent cut off by) fog Image copyright Getty Images You probably know this one already, but it is worth repeating.When it comes to Brexit, no one has any idea what is going to happen next."I've been following British politics professionally for almost 50 years," says the pollster Peter Kellner."Never before have I been so uncertain as to where British politics has been heading."We're looking at a mountain ahead of us shrouded in fog.We can't see the pass and we don't know what's on the other side."The battle for Brexit seems to have been around forever, but it may be that the critical phase is only just beginning.Stay tuned.Chris Morris presents Brexit: A Guide for the Perplexed on BBC Radio 4.You can listen online, or download the programme podcast.
Profile: Priti Patel:::::Image copyright PA Long seen as a rising star in the Conservative Party, Priti Patel has now resigned from the cabinet minister after it emerged she had held undisclosed meetings with Israeli officials while on holiday.Elected as an MP in 2010 the prominent Brexiteer, 45, became a Treasury minister in 2014, before becoming Employment Minister after the 2015 general election.And shortly after Theresa May became Prime Minister - following the June 2016 EU referendum - Ms Patel was promoted to Secretary of State for International Development.Born in London to Gujarati parents who fled Uganda in the 1960s, she was educated at Watford Grammar School for Girls.She went on to study at Keele and Essex universities before getting a job at Conservative Central Office, which she left to head up the press office for the Referendum Party, under Sir James Goldsmith, from 1995 to 1997.After William Hague became Conservative leader, she returned to the party to be his deputy press secretary, from 1997 to 2000.She went on to spend a number of years working with the Weber Shandwick public affairs consultancy - advising Ikea and the Meat & Livestock Commission among others - and had a spell as international public policy adviser for drinks giant Diageo.Ms Patel sought to get elected to Parliament in 2005 but lost out in Nottingham North.A year later, she was one of those selected for new leader David Cameron's A-list of candidates and went on to become MP for Witham, Essex, in 2010.Factfile Born: 29 March, 1972, in London 29 March, 1972, in London Education: Watford Grammar School; economics degree from Keele University, MSc in British government and politics from University of Essex Watford Grammar School; economics degree from Keele University, MSc in British government and politics from University of Essex Family: Born to Gujarati parents who fled Uganda in the 1960s.Married with a seven-year-old son Born to Gujarati parents who fled Uganda in the 1960s.Married with a seven-year-old son Career: Elected Witham MP in 2010.Became Treasury minister in 2014 and Minister for Employment in 2015.Appointed Secretary of State for International Development in July 2016 She is positioned on the right of the party, voted against gay marriage, campaigned against the smoking ban, and previously advocated bringing back the death penalty, before later saying she did not support it.Ms Patel, whose father stood as a UKIP councillor in 2013, cites Margaret Thatcher as her political hero.A longstanding Eurosceptic, dating back to at least her Referendum Party days, Ms Patel was a leading figure in the successful Vote Leave campaign.There was also controversy when it emerged she once called for the foreign aid department to be scrapped in its current form.She told the Daily Telegraph in 2013: "A long-term strategic assessment is required, including the consideration to replace DfID [the Department for International Development] with a Department for International Trade and Development in order to enable the UK to focus on enhancing trade with the developing world and seek out new investment opportunities in the global race."She later said she did want DfID to continue in its current form and backed Britain's legal commitment to spend 0.7% of gross national income on aid, although she insisted that it should provide better value for money.
What politicians can learn from chimps:::::Image copyright PA/Getty Image caption Prof Tilley presents Primate Politics on BBC Radio 4 The word "politics" probably conjures up an image of Theresa May facing Jeremy Corbyn over the despatch box - and despite the hooting from the backbenches we might not think that this has much to do with chimpanzees.Yet many of our fellow primates are our equal in their desire for power and ability to manoeuvre others to get hold of that power.Chimpanzees are intensely political animals.They live in social groups of about 50 with male leaders who have to engage in a variety of political manoeuvres to get to the top.Professor Frans de Waal's book Chimpanzee Politics details the shifting coalitions created among chimpanzees to take power at Arnhem Zoo in the Netherlands.He argues that it is not enough to simply be the strongest."The best alpha males in chimpanzee communities are not necessarily the biggest and strongest males," he says."You have to have supporters which means you have to keep these supporters happy.You have to be diplomatic."Building a coalition Image copyright AFP/Getty Image caption Coalitions aren't just for humans Part of this diplomacy involves forming coalitions with other males.This can be very strategic and mirrors what we see politicians within parties doing all the time."If you have three males and one of them is overwhelmingly strong then there's a tendency for the other two to gang up together against that male," says Prof de Waal."Because if they attach their political weight to the top male who is that strong male they're just an accessory to his power."The other crucial part of diplomacy is getting support from the masses.This involves being "nice" - would-be chimpanzee leaders are as keen on kissing babies as human politicians - but also distributing resources, typically meat, to build up support: "The Japanese scientist Toshisada Nishida studied one chimpanzee who ruled for 12 years," says Mr de Waal."He would appropriate the meat of other males and then selectively share with his supporters and selectively not share with his rivals.He had a whole bribery system that worked very much to his advantage."In effect, that chimpanzee leader was taxing the group and then returning those resources to selected supporters.Clearly bribing voters with their own money is not unique to human politicians.Primates at war Image copyright Getty Images Another similarity involves conflict between groups.Chimpanzees often raid and ambush other troops, brutally killing rival group members.They also face danger from other animals such as snakes.And just as in human politics, these external threats can silence internal dissent and shore up support for leaders.Marc Hetherington, a professor of political science at Vanderbilt University in Tennessee, studies how voters sometimes "rally around the flag"."George W Bush in the early 2000s went from not being a particularly popular president, especially at the beginning of his term, to having 90% approval after the September 11 2001 terrorist attacks."This is one of the textbook examples of rallying round the flag."Other primates show the same tendencies.Dr Alison Cronin is a primatologist, and director of Monkey World in Dorset."If you have an external threat that's a danger effectively to everybody, it brings the group together, you rally together," she says."And people who you might not even like on a day-to-day basis, if you're going to join up as a band of brothers to defend the realm, then all for one and one for all."Humans are primates These parallels shouldn't be too surprising.Human are primates.And for most of human evolutionary history we lived in small tight-knit groups of hunters and foragers in which coalitions of individuals vied for leadership.That history can mean that we are potentially making political decisions in a way that is often poorly suited to the modern world.Professor Michael Bang Petersen is an expert in evolutionary political psychology at Aarhus University in Denmark."We act as if we still live in a small-scale society," he says."Our brain is built to assume a small-scale environment and the solutions that we think are intuitively right are the solutions that work well in a small-scale society."Image caption Alison Cronin and James Tilley with chimpanzees at Monkey World This can make it difficult for people to hold principled political attitudes as we naturally prefer to think about things on a case-by-case basis as we did in small groups.For example, Prof Bang Petersen says, rather than considering which punishments fit which crime, we prefer to think about which punishments fit which criminal.Remarkably, these hangovers from our past even extend to basic questions about income inequality.Prof Bang Petersen argues that, on average, physically strong people prefer less income redistribution because they forget that redistribution policies are determined by factions in Parliament not whether they can enforce them physically.At the same time, our willingness to cooperate is a crucial part of why democracy works and this too can be traced back to when we lived in small groups.Think about voting.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Does our evolutionary history explain why so many of us turn out to vote?No individual vote will make any difference to the result, so why do so many people vote?Prof Bang Petersen argues that this too is part of evolutionary heritage."People feel that voting is important and that makes intuitive sense for our mind that is designed to navigate small-scale politics where each individual could indeed be decisive."That stems from high levels of cooperativeness."Of course, we should be a bit cautious about saying that we are simply products of our evolutionary history and that other primate behaviour is just a mirror of our own.There's an obvious difference between humans and other primates: language.Language, alongside greater cognitive capacity, allows us to make laws and plan ahead.Language allows us to create groups that are national, not just local, and include people we will never meet.But that can still mean that we sometimes behave as if those groups consist of 50 people on the savannah scratching a living from hunting and foraging.And next time you are watching PMQs, it is worth remembering that we are, in the end, just one political primate among many.
The case for the voting age to be lowered to 16:::::At the moment, 1.5 million 16 and 17-year-olds are too young to vote.They pay taxes, but aren't old enough to elect the men and women who decide how to spend them.Yet after a General Election where younger people turned out in numbers not seen for decades, the question of whether it's undemocratic to continue to deny 16-year-olds the vote is being asked again.Leading the teenage charge this time around is Jim McMahon, Labour MP for Oldham West and Royton.His proposal not only calls for the voting age to be lowered, but for political education to be taught in schools."The young people that I come in to contact with understand issues and they get behind campaigns," he told Newsbeat.Seventeen-year-olds Nathan Randles, Samah Khalil and Jess Consterdine, from Oldham's youth council, are a case in point."I pay tax as an apprentice and I have no say on where it goes," says Nathan."I want a say in how much my education costs," Jess chimes in."There's no test you take at 18 which means you are informed," argues Samah.And their case is backed by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn.The Scottish National Party, the Lib Dems and Green Party are all on board too - but crucially the Conservatives aren't.Speaking just before this year's General Election, Prime Minister Theresa May said: "You have to pick a point at which you think it is right for the voting age to be."I continue to think it is right for it to be 18."Some claim that position is based on a fear that not enough younger voters would vote for the Conservatives.But the PM is not alone in her thinking.Austria is the only country in the EU where 16-year-olds can vote in general elections.And although supporters for lowering the electoral age say you can get married, join the Army and work full-time at 16 - that's not entirely true.You can now vote in the Scottish parliamentary and local elections at 16.The Welsh Assembly is looking at doing the same for local elections there.Labour MP Jim McMahon believes the momentum is with his campaign to push forward a bill proposing votes at 16."If you are giving 16-year-olds the right to vote in Scotland and Wales, you ought to be doing the same for 16-year-olds in England too," he says.Find us on Instagram at BBCNewsbeat and follow us on Snapchat, search for bbc_newsbeat
Balfour Declaration: The divisive legacy of 67 words:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The Balfour Declaration: 100 years of conflict The British peer Arthur Balfour barely makes an appearance in UK schoolbooks, but many Israeli and Palestinian students could tell you about him.His Balfour Declaration, made on 2 November 1917, is taught in their respective history classes and forms a key chapter in their two very different, national narratives.It can be seen as a starting point for the Arab-Israeli conflict.The declaration by the then foreign secretary was included in a letter to Lord Walter Rothschild, a leading proponent of Zionism, a movement advocating self-determination for the Jewish people in their historical homeland - from the Mediterranean to the eastern flank of the River Jordan, an area which came to be known as Palestine.It stated that the British government supported "the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people".Image caption The key 67 words of Balfour's letter At the same time, it said that nothing should "prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities".Palestinians see this as a great betrayal, particularly given a separate promise made to enlist the political and military support of the Arabs - then ruled by the Ottoman Turks - in World War One.This suggested Britain would back their struggle for independence in most of the lands of the Ottoman Empire, which consisted of much of the Middle East.The Arabs understood this to include Palestine, though it had not been specifically mentioned."Do you think Britain committed a crime against the Palestinian people?"asks a teacher during a lesson in a Palestinian school in the West Bank city of Ramallah.Image caption Palestinians regard the declaration as an historical injustice Everyone puts up a hand."Yes," a 15-year-old girl answers."This declaration was illegitimate because Palestine was still part of the Ottoman Empire and Britain did not control it.""Britain considered the Arabs as a minority while they formed over 90% of the population."'Huge hope' Israeli children, inevitably, tend to see British involvement more positively when they study the Balfour Declaration in a lesson towards the end of their high-school years.In Balfouria, a village in northern Israel, nine-year-old Noga Yehezekeli is already proudly able to recite a Hebrew version of the text off by heart."In the moment it was given, the declaration gave huge hope and a huge push for the Zionist movement," says her father, Neve."People saw that if the British government gave such a declaration there was a chance that one day the Jewish nation would be established, which really happened later in '48" - the year the State of Israel was formed.Image caption The declaration gave Zionists huge hope, says Neve Yehezekeli (right) Residents of Balfouria - including Neve's grandfather - were part of a growing Jewish community in Palestine when Lord Balfour visited in 1925.They gave him a hero's welcome.By that time, the area was under British administration.The Balfour Declaration had been formally enshrined in the British Mandate for Palestine, which had been endorsed by the League of Nations.During the first half of the Mandate period, Britain allowed waves of Jewish immigration.But amid an Arab backlash and rising violence, Israelis remember how it later blocked many fleeing persecution, particularly during the Holocaust.Hard to deliver At the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, inaugurated by Balfour, Professor Ruth Lapidoth has studied the 67-word document.An expert on international law, Prof Lapidoth argues it was a legally binding declaration, but says Britain found it hard to deliver on its pledge.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Lord Balfour was given a hero's welcome by the Jewish community in Jerusalem in 1925 "The political situation was very bad when the Nazis came to power and then England needed the help, the friendship of the Arab countries," she says."Then they had to limit the implementation of the declaration, which is a pity."Prof Lapidoth left Germany in 1938, a year before the start of World War Two, and so has a personal interest in the pronouncement."I'm still very grateful for it," she says."It was really the source of our right to come back to Palestine, including my own."'Long-due promise' Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, describes the Balfour Declaration as "a central milestone" in the process of establishing his country.The British government has invited him to London for events to mark the centenary on Thursday.That decision, at a time of dimming hopes for Israeli-Palestinian peace, has infuriated Palestinians, who plan a day of protests.Image copyright EPA Image caption Palestinians say Britain's declaration deprived them of a state They want Britain to apologise for the Balfour Declaration."As the time passes, I think British people are forgetting about the lessons of history," says Palestinian Education Minister Sabri Saidam.He points out that Palestinians still seek the creation of a state of their own - which alongside Israel would form the basis of the so-called two-state solution to the conflict, a formula supported by the international community."The time has come for Palestine to be independent and for that long-due promise to be fulfilled," he says.
Tackling the 'boys' club' of political cartoons:::::Image copyright Ella Bucknall / WHIP Why do the UK's national newspapers' full-time cartoonists never seem to be women?Out of nearly 180 cartoons featured in last year's edition of Britain's Best Political Cartoons not one was drawn by a woman.It was flicking through a copy of the book that first highlighted the gender imbalance in the industry for Ella Bucknall, an illustrator currently studying at Camberwell College of Arts in London.This realisation prompted her to start Whip, a magazine of political cartoons by women, to give them a platform that didn't exist elsewhere."Particularly at the moment when there are so many aspects of politics affecting women's lives, from Trump to the DUP, we need to be able to have our own voice.We need to be able to argue back," she said.Image copyright Rosie O'Driscoll / WHIP The "boys' club" is a common complaint of women working as cartoonists.Nicola Jennings, whose work has been published in the Guardian, said: "Political cartoons are a sort of running joke between the boys.I wonder whether men find it too difficult to be lampooned by a woman?"Men lampooning each other is like an in-joke and they're just slapping each other on the back, whereas if it's a woman it's seen as much stronger criticism."The editorial cartoons of the national newspapers remain a distinctly male affair.Tim Benson, editor of Britain's Best Political Cartoons, defended his selection as simply a reflection of the state of the industry."My criteria is that the cartoon has to be published in a national newspaper.There are lots of female cartoonists who publish their work online or draw for the Morning Star but they are unpaid," he said, "If you want to be able to call yourself a political cartoonist you have to be able to earn your living as one.I can only pick cartoons from what is available."My view is that anyone with the perseverance and the skills will rise to the top, whatever their gender is.Personally I don't think there's a woman out there at the moment who can compete with the very best."I've got Nicola Jennings in this year's book but only because she's been published in national newspapers.I would love to have more work by female cartoonists but I'm not going to include them in my book if I don't think they're good enough.I never decide on gender lines.As far as my book is concerned there is absolutely no gender bias at all."Image copyright Ella Bucknall / WHIP To find female political cartoonists at the moment, it is necessary to look beyond the national newspapers.Nicola Streeten, an illustrator and comics scholar, has researched the history of British feminist cartoons and comics from the 1970s.What she found was that outside the national media there were a host of women drawing political cartoons, from the Suffragettes to 1960s feminist magazine Spare Rib.She is currently co-editing a collection of 250 years of female cartoonists in Britain, The Inking Woman, following an exhibition of the same name at the Cartoon Museum."The more we looked the more women we found.You just have to take the trouble to look.Some people are against having a women's-only publication or exhibition but at the moment there just aren't the platforms for women," she said.There are only six full-time political cartoonists working for national newspapers.As far as we can tell there has never been a woman among them and most of the men have held their positions for years."There was a tradition of editorial cartoonists having a job for life.Those jobs were already taken by men 50 years ago so there haven't been any open doors for women," explained Martha Richler, otherwise known as Marf, one of the few women to have worked as a political cartoonist on Fleet Street, for London's Evening Standard.Image copyright Martha Richler Ms Richler, who was made redundant from the Standard in 2008 after the recession hit, said: "As budgets were cut, cartoonists were considered a luxury.But the story's not over if you look online."She admits she misses her salary but prefers the freedom of working online."There were times at the Standard when I wasn't allowed to do a darker cartoon.Online I have total freedom and there are no prejudices about what women can draw.We can self-publish.There are amazing opportunities if only we can crack the problem of monetising it."Ms Richler also said she faced sexism in Fleet Street.In 2004 the Daily Telegraph claimed her jokes were "regularly rewritten by backbench executives".The paper later published an apology.Ms Richler said the attack suggested there was an assumption women simply couldn't be good political cartoonists.Image copyright Alice Skinner / WHIP So how do things look now?Emma Allen was recently appointed as the New Yorker's cartoon editor.The work of Ms Jennings and Kate Evans has been featured in the Guardian.Political blog The Canary has recently launched an all-female political cartoonist collective.And the second issue of Whip is due to be published next month."We're hoping to keep expanding.I hope editors will pay attention to what we are doing," Miss Bucknall said."The ultimate aim is that there will no longer be a Whip, because women are given a mainstream platform.The only reason we exist is because at the moment there isn't one."
Profile: Who is Gavin Williamson, the new defence secretary?:::::Image copyright Getty Images He's the Tory enforcer who kept a tarantula on his desk and joked about using a "sharpened carrot" to get his way.Now Gavin Williamson has been propelled into his first cabinet role in the wake of Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon's sudden resignation.So what more do we know about a politician seen as rising star but whose rapid elevation has apparently upset some of his colleagues?Theresa May's chief whip, first elected to Parliament in 2010, wasn't among the bookmakers' favourites for the Ministry of Defence vacancy.The South Staffordshire MP has no military background and had little opportunity to build up a public profile because his role in the whips office meant he did not speak in Parliament.Raised near Scarborough by Labour-supporting parents, he ran a Staffordshire pottery firm, making and selling ceramic tableware, before becoming an MP.After entering Parliament, Mr Williamson was given a role in the Northern Ireland Office in 2011, and then became David Cameron's backbench aide.He was appointed a CBE in the ex-PM's controversial resignation honours list, telling the Stourbridge News he was "extremely honoured and humbled" at the award.And he didn't fall out of favour as Theresa May took over in July 2016 - "literally walking out with one prime minister and in with the next" in the words of friend and fellow Tory MP James Wharton.Factfile Date of birth: 25 June 1976 (aged 41) Job: MP for South Staffordshire, since 2010.Chief whip from June 2016, now defence secretary Education: Went to to Raincliffe Comprehensive School and Scarborough Sixth Form College; studied social sciences at the University of Bradford Family: Married with two children.His father worked at the local council, his mother at a job centre.Both were Labour voters Married with two children.His father worked at the local council, his mother at a job centre.Both were Labour voters Honours: Awarded a CBE in 2016 in David Cameron's resignation honours for political and public service After a disappointing general election for the Conservatives, he played a key role in brokering the 1bn deal with the DUP to prop up their minority government.But until now, that tarantula might have been the most commonly-cited fact about the 41-year-old - whose successor as chief whip tweeted a picture of his desk on taking over.He has described the creature, known as Cronus, as "a perfect example of an incredibly clean, ruthless killer" - who reportedly fell foul of the strict rules about animals on the Parliamentary estate.Kate Moody, who sold it to him at his local garden centre, told BBC Radio 4 the MP had thought it would be a "great addition" to his office.She recalls Mr Williamson joking that he was having a "mid-life" crisis when he bought the red-legged Mexican tarantula, saying "it was a sports car or a tarantula and the tarantula won".Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Gavin Williamson (right) shakes hands with the DUP's Jeffrey Donaldson And spiders aren't the only animals close to his heart - he's also a patron of the World Owl Trust and has built a house for hedgehogs in his garden.He might be kind to animals, but there was a hint of a less accommodating approach in his speech to the Conservative Party conference as he described his methods in the whips office."We take a carrot and stick approach," he told delegates."Personally I don't much like the stick, but it is amazing what can be achieved with a sharpened carrot."In his own words Image copyright AFP On being appointed as chief whip: "I was absolutely flabbergasted, but I accepted immediately."On his pet tarantula: "You have to look at all different ways to persuade people to vote with the government and it's great to have Cronus as part of the team" In the Commons: "It's very important to use our gardens which are a specific habitat for hedgehogs.Just recently in my own garden I built a hedgehog house.Sadly I have no residents in it but hopefully it will encourage them and the growth of hedgehogs in South Staffordshire."What others say
Countdown to Brexit: How to divide food sold to the EU:::::Image copyright Getty Images Here's a Brexit recipe: lamb with grapes and lemon.I haven't tried it, but the recipe does exist and it looks delicious in the pictures I've seen.It also gives us the ingredients for looking at one of the food issues that comes up as the UK prepares to leave the European Union.All of them are covered by a trade arrangement that most people have spent their lives blissfully unaware of.It goes by the name of "tariff rate quotas".Now what on Earth does that mean?When countries import goods, including foods, they often impose a tariff, a tax that is applied only to traded goods.The UK does not currently have its own national tariffs.They are set by the EU for all member nations.Countries and blocs of countries such as the EU, that are members of the World Trade Organization, have made commitments to the others that the tariffs will not exceed certain levels.Many countries have agreed to import a certain quantity of some goods at a lower or even zero tariff, as a negotiated compromise between the interests of: overseas exporters domestic producers concerned about exposure to foreign competition consumers That quantity of goods that gets in on the lower tax rate is called a tariff rate quota.It is a bread and butter dish on the trade negotiating menu, routine enough to have its own acronym, which is TRQ.TRQs are often used for farm products.The EU has about 100, negotiated at the WTO on behalf of all member states, which currently have an impact on the UK.All three of our ingredients have a TRQ for imports into the EU.Image copyright Getty Images In the case of lamb, 280,340 tonnes a year can be imported at a reduced tariff.There's a quota for table grapes of 1,500 tonnes, and for lemons it's 10,000 tonnes.So how does Brexit come into this picture?The UK and the remainder of the EU have to work out how to divide the existing TRQs.The EU doesn't want to take the existing TRQs for the 28 states and use them for the remaining 27, because each EU country may end up importing more food on the low tariffs, therefore creating tougher competition for EU farmers.Image copyright Getty Images Unlike on many other Brexit issues the UK and the EU actually agreed, and told the other WTO members, in a letter, that they wanted to divide the TRQs in line with recent trade flows.That would mean, for example, the UK taking a large share of the quota for lamb because comparatively the UK has been importing more lamb than the other EU countries.But the proposal was met with a raspberry by several countries, including the United States, Canada and New Zealand.Although the UK-EU proposal would give the same total TRQs as today, they would lose flexibility.As things stand, if the price of lamb fell in the UK, they could divert some or all of it to other parts of the EU.After Brexit, that would not be possible.Image copyright Getty Images The other WTO countries feel they should be compensated with a higher combined TRQ in order to maintain the same commercial benefit they currently enjoy.In other words, they see Brexit as an opportunity to negotiate better access for their goods to Europe.There is another option.In some cases, the UK could decide to remove the tariffs altogether.Now, some economists think we should do that anyway with all tariffs, that Brexit is a glorious opportunity for unilateral free trade.This seems politically unlikely for products where there are UK producers.In our recipe, lamb is a case in point.Unrestricted tariff free access for lamb from anywhere in the world would be a problem for many British lamb producers.With lemons, that is not an issue.We are not citrus producers.There are British table grapes.It's not a big industry, but it is a new one so that might need some consultation with producer and consumer groups too.There's another complication: cross-Channel trade.British farmers can now automatically sell, for example, their lamb to France tariff free.The same applies to French cheese sold in the UK.Depending on what sort of deal there is, that might not be true after Brexit.So will the UK and the EU get some share of each other's TRQs?That's another thing to be negotiated.Read more from Reality Check Follow us on Twitter
A pint of view: What do farmers think about Brexit?:::::What do the farmers out in the field, in the dairy and in the milking parlour think about Brexit?No-one knows what's around the corner for the dairy industry.Specific negotiations over a future trade deal haven't even started.Some experts predict oblivion; others see opportunity.So let's start with what we do know: the state of the industry 20 years ago, and what it's like today.Image caption Currently the EU is UK dairy's biggest trading partner, with 80 per cent of exports going there.The number of dairy farmers has shrunk dramatically: In 1996 there were around 35,000.Now there are around 13,000 - a drop of almost two-thirds.Farms are getting bigger: The average herd size was 75 cows and now it's 140.And as for the cost of a pint: back in 1996 it was 36 pence, now it's 43 pence - and many farmers say it's too low.So how do those working in the industry feel about what the next 20 years may hold?Image caption James and Rhiannan feel that Brexit has given them - and their son Ethan - the chance of a more secure future.James and Rhiannan Lomas have a dairy farm of around 200 cows in Cheshire.They almost went out of business two years ago because of the collapse in the milk price.But now they are part of a small number of farms starting to export liquid milk (as opposed to powdered or products such as cheese) to Qatar.The Middle East nation was left without milk almost overnight after a blockade imposed by Saudi Arabia and its allies.Mr Lomas says: "It's amazing.Every day we thought of giving it all up.But hopefully now Brexit will improve our outlook and open up a lot of markets - if the politicians get it right."He adds that there have definitely been some dark times."Hopefully it will give us a chance to make us a more of a secure and better future.Certainly the fluctuation of the dairy business will always be there, but the ability to change markets might give us the chance to go elsewhere."Ms Lomas explains: "It makes you feel a lot more positive for us."Looking down at her son Ethan, she adds: "And for him."China exports Andrew Henderson is the man who secured the deal with a hypermarket chain in Qatar.He runs a dairy called Nemi, also based in Cheshire.It bottles milk from farmers in the surrounding counties and could soon be the first in the UK to export fresh milk to China.These cows are given an enriched feed so they produce milk high in selenium, which can be in short supply in the Chinese diet.A supermarket there has just placed an order.Image caption Brand GB: A prototype of the bottle that could carry the first British fresh milk to China.Note the gold Houses of Parliament and British flag."Brexit is having a very positive effect - we have farmers who are getting a much better milk price and we also have more interest from countries inside Europe and outside Europe for fresh British milk.We are trying to supply that need."He says the Chinese are interested in British milk because they see it as "pure".They also want to know exactly which farm the product is coming from."We were in China in June and we were sitting with some highly decorated officials from the Chinese government and they made a point of saying it's very easy to do a deal with one country - but very difficult to do a deal with 27."Would this be happening without the Brexit vote?"I believe not.There was no will from the major European cooperatives and organisations to deliver our fresh milk to China as they are already within those markets with dried milk and other products from Europe," says Mr Henderson.His business partner is Mark Langslow, from County Milk Products."Regarding Brexit, I think we've made the right decision.I think it makes us want to stand on our own two feet, and forces us to stand on our own two feet."Image caption Dairy farms are closing because they can't find able staff to take on the roles available.However not too far away, near Uttoxeter in Staffordshire, David Brookes has a dairy herd of 180 cows.He's a member of the West Midlands Dairy Board.He relies on his daughter to help with the business and talks of what experts have referred to as the "shocking crisis" in the dairy labour industry."There's only around 1% on jobseekers allowance in Staffordshire.Whether it's the butchery side of things and processing meat or whether it's processing dairy products we have become reliant on a migrant labour force, mainly from Eastern Europe," he says."We need the skilled labour.And at the moment they are not coming over."He says that the devaluation of the pound is largely to blame, but also the uncertainty surrounding Brexit."One of the problems is the classification of 'labour'.Because the government is very keen to get a lot of skilled labour.A lot of our processing workers (such as those that operate milking equipment) are skilled, but their skills are not clearly defined as skilled under government guidelines," Mr Brookes explains.He believes that if restrictions are imposed "it could be very difficult".Further south, in Wiltshire, Jenny Quick helps to run a small family dairy herd."People may tell you their view," she says, "But no one knows.We just have no idea yet."Follow Claire on Twitter.
Westminster sexual harassment: MPs outline claims:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Chi Onwurah: Male and female researchers left 'uncomfortable' in Westminster bar MPs have been speaking out about sexual harassment in the corridors of Westminster - including one claim that bad behaviour at a parliamentary bar was dismissed as typical "pub" talk.Commons leader Andrea Leadsom vowed to stamp out "sleazy, sexist or homophobic banter", as she faced MPs in light of allegations of sexual harassment in Parliament.One of those to speak out, Labour's Chi Onwurah, said some male and female researchers had been made to feel "deeply uncomfortable" by MPs while at a parliamentary bar, the Sports and Social club - but her complaint was ignored.The Labour MP said: "When I complained recently to an officer of Parliament who had some responsibility in this area...I was told that happens in pubs all over the country."Ms Leadsom gave her "absolute assurance" that people going to restaurants and bars in Westminster should feel safe."There should be no place here on the estate or in our constituency offices where people can be abused or allegations not taken seriously," she said.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Liz Saville Roberts says she was told "distrust is endemic" among staff of MPs Liz Saville Roberts, of Plaid Cymru, said she had been told by one employee of an MP that authorities failed to act when she reported an assault claim - leaving the woman "deeply disappointed and distrustful"."She reported being sexually assaulted to the proper authorities earlier this year, who did nothing," she said, adding: "She tells me that distrust is endemic."Ms Saville Roberts asked: "How can I assure her that her complaint will now be treated differently?"For her part, Ms Leadsom said she would be willing to take the complaint up herself.One MP already being investigated for inappropriate behaviour is international trade minister, Mark Garnier, who reportedly asked his secretary to buy sex toys and called her "sugar tits".Secret text Conservative MP Matthew Offord said he was recently sent a text message that accused a current MP of being "utterly foul" towards a woman - but he did not reveal the name of the sender or the politician.Mr Offord said the sender had described the incident as a "problem he saw in this place".He quoted the text as saying the MP was "utterly foul and I'm sure it's a pattern of behaviour on his part - but in this instance I don't think it'd be fair on the woman in question to name him."He added that the sender asked him to "do the best you can" to widen the investigation from sexual harassment claims to also address complaints about bullying and treating staff like "dirt".Monday's question-and-answer Commons session took place in response to an urgent question on plans to tackle sexual harassment in Parliament, brought by Labour MP Harriet Harman.Ms Leadsom's statement prompted "wittering about a witch hunt", according to Labour's Jess Phillips.She told the chamber: "As I walked in here, as I rushed in here today to come to this statement, I overheard two male colleagues walking through the halls wittering about a witch hunt that was going on in Parliament."Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The PM is "too weak" to tackle abuse allegations amongst her own ministers, says Labour's Lucy Powell Conservative Graham Brady, chairman of the backbench 1922 committee, confirmed that some people had expressed "anguish" that the allegations could "unfairly tarnish" innocent MPs.He insisted that Parliament was not a "den of inequity".Earlier, Labour MP Lucy Powell told the BBC that there was an "imbalance of power" in Westminster that left employees open to being abused."When you have that mix of lots of desperate people in that environment [you get] this sort of power abuse - because that's what it is," she said.
Cyber-crime: Security Minister Ben Wallace's claim about arrests unpicked:::::The Claim: Security Minister Ben Wallace told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "There is some good news which never gets reported - nine out of 10 of the latest, most serious cyber-crime attacks have resulted in arrest or charges."Reality Check verdict: The relevant figure is slightly less positive to the one Mr Wallace cited on air.Between October 2016 and May 2017, the National Crime Agency (NCA) and regional organised crime units identified suspects in nine, and made arrests in seven, of the 10 most serious cyber-incidents under investigation.No-one was charged during the relevant period.We all know a burglary when we see one.Smashed window.TV gone.But large numbers of people - and entire organisations - don't necessarily realise when they've been a target or victim of a digital smash-and-grab.That's the public awareness challenge that makes combating the growth of this 21st Century crime so difficult.Put simplest, cyber-crimes and attacks fall into three broad categories: Personal crimes - such as a fraud committed through a bogus online shop or auction - but also bank card cloning and other identity-related scams in which your personal details are taken, sold in online market places and used, ultimately, to steal money.Attacks against organisations - such as this year's huge Wannacry attack which caused major disruption within the NHS.The criminals demanded payment in an untraceable online currency before they would hand back control of computers.Attacks possibly organised by a state against another state's institutions or infrastructure.The alleged involvement of Russian agents in the US president election would be an example of this kind of cyber-attack, if proven to be true.Starting at the bottom and working up, a few years ago the Metropolitan Police estimated that the annual number of online fraud offences nationwide would overtake all types of burglary by, at the latest, autumn 2017.That already looks spot on.In the year to June 2017, the police recorded just over 423,000 burglaries across England and Wales.The Office for National Statistics says there were 653,000 frauds - and all experts in this field think there are many more unreported incidents.Separate experimental data from the Crime Survey for England and Wales, a rolling survey of our experiences, estimates there were 3.3 million frauds in the year to June - and more than half of those were "cyber-related".On top of all that, there were an additional 1.6 million incidents of "computer misuse", generally meaning hacking or virus attacks.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption GCHQ is one of the government agencies tasked with tackling cyber-crime If a hacker steals your personal data, that can be used by organised crime gangs to create fake bank cards in your name.Viruses can be used to hold machines to ransom or, without your even knowing about it, turn your PC into a "zombie" that becomes part of a global attack on a major institution.And that's where many of these individual crimes fit into a bigger picture.Since it was set up in October 2016, the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) dealt with 590 "significant" incidents.The most well-known of these was the Wannacry attack, which prompted the Home Secretary to hold the first ever Cobra meeting (a government emergency response committee) dedicated to a cyber-attack.National priority So what about the response?The Home Office says cyber-crime is a national priority and the NCA plays the lead role in pursuing suspects and building the intelligence picture.It runs some investigations itself and assists others being led by detectives inside the country's regional organised crime units.But individual police forces are also under sustained pressure to up their game.While some have well-developed units, such as the Metropolitan Police's "Operation Falcon", others are struggling to recruit because they need detectives with highly specialist skills.One of the major problems is working out who is supposed to be investigating a particular incident because the crime gang behind an attack could be anywhere in the world.It's very difficult to count how many cyber-related criminals have been successfully prosecuted.Many suspects will be charged with fraud or theft offences but there's no breakdown on how many of those were related to online swindles.Only 55 people were convicted of computer misuse offences relating to hacking last year.During his interview Mr Wallace was referring to the NCA's list of the most serious cyber-incidents between October 2016 and May 2017.These are categorised by assessing the following factors: Threat and risk Public impact Financial harm Nature of the incident Victims Mr Wallace claimed: "We are getting there."Are we?The government believes it is, arguing that the NCSC is a world-beating body, backed up by expert investigators in the National Crime Agency, MI5 and GCHQ.But Parliament's Public Accounts Committee said in February that a skills shortage and "chaotic" handling of personal data breaches were undermining confidence in the government's ability to protect the UK from cyber-attacks.The MPs said ministers had taken too long to consolidate an "alphabet soup" of agencies - although some experts said the report was unfair and failed to take into account the resources now being thrown at this very modern threat.Read more from Reality Check Follow us on Twitter
Brexit: All you need to know about the UK leaving the EU:::::Here is an easy-to-understand guide to Brexit - beginning with the basics, then a look at the negotiations, followed by a selection of answers to questions we've been sent.What's happening now?The UK has voted to leave the European Union.It is scheduled to depart on 29 March, 2019.Talks are currently taking place on three aspects of how Brexit will work - focusing on how much the UK owes the EU, what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK.The UK wants to talk about future trade relations - and a plan for a two year "transition" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations.But the EU says they will not talk about the future until enough progress has been made on the other issues.What does Brexit mean?It is a word that has become used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in a same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past.Why is Britain leaving the European Union?A referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union.Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%.The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Find the result in your area What was the breakdown across the UK?England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%.Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%.Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU.Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave.See the results in more detail.What changed in government after the referendum?Image copyright PA Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May.The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum.Like Mr Cameron, Mrs May was against Britain leaving the EU but she played only a very low-key role in the campaign and was never seen as much of an enthusiast for the EU.She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out.Where does Theresa May stand on Brexit?Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want.Her key message has been that "Brexit means Brexit" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March.She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk.She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy.How did the snap election change things?Image copyright Getty Images Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had been due in 2020).She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders.She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy.However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.What has happened to the UK economy since the Brexit vote?David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum - and remains around 10% lower against the dollar and 15% down against the euro.But predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations.The UK economy has continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017.Inflation has risen since June 2016 to stand at 3%, but unemployment has continued to fall, to stand at a 42 year low of 4.3%.Annual house price increases have fallen from 9.4% in June 2016 but were still at an inflation-beating 5% in the year to August 2017, according to official ONS figures.Brexit talks are under way They finally, officially, started on 19 June, 2017.Here's a picture from that first session: Image copyright Reuters The UK and EU negotiating teams meet face-to-face for one week each month.Their first tasks are trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called "divorce bill", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border.You can find out more about the talks here.What is the European Union?The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list).It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other.It has since grown to become a "single market" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country.It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges.Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption How does the European Union work?What is Article 50?Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU.It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009.Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure.What date will the UK will leave the EU?For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split.Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave on Friday, 29 March 2019.It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one.What's going to happen to all the EU laws in force in the UK?The Conservative government has introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament.If passed, it will end the primacy of EU law in the UK.This "Great Repeal Bill" as it has been called, is supposed to incorporate all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove.The government is facing claims from Remain supporting MPs that it is giving itself sweeping powers to change legislation without proper Parliamentary scrutiny.Read a full guide to the bill.What is the Labour Party's position on Brexit?Labour's position on Brexit was tweaked in mid-August, when the shadow Brexit secretary, Sir Keir Starmer, announced that the party now wanted to keep the UK in the single market and a customs union during a transition that could last for up to four years.Labour would also accept free movement of people, payments into the EU budget and the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice during the transition.This is a considerably "softer" version of Brexit than the one advocated by the government, but there are still divisions within the party about whether the UK should try to stay in the single market in the longer term.What do 'soft' and 'hard' Brexit mean?These terms have increasingly been used as debate focused on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU.There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, "hard" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if meant leaving the single market.At the other end of the scale, a "soft" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.What is the single market?The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place.Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market.In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country.It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it.The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices.But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a "level playing field".Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs.Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule.Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has said continued membership of the single has to be an option in negotiations with Brussels.Read more: A free trade area v EU single market What's the difference between the single market and the customs union?The customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU.It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area.In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The single market is a very different beast - it is not just about the trade in goods.It allows the free movement of people, money and services as if the EU was a single country.Who is negotiating Britain's exit from the EU?Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit.Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary.These three are each set to play roles in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although it would be Mrs May, as prime minister, who would have the final say.Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.How long will it take for Britain to leave the EU?The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019.EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member.But there is currently uncertainty about how final the break will be on that day - a number of UK and EU figures back the idea of having a "transition" period of up to three years to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc.Why might Brexit take so long?Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task.It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators will, to some extent, be making it up as they go along.The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.So why can't the UK just cut all ties in March 2019?The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a "cliff-edge" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight.They think it would harm the economy.What is the focus of negotiations between the UK and EU?The priority issues in negotiations are: 1) Agreeing what rights EU citizens already in the UK - and UK citizens living in the rest of the EU - will have after Brexit.2) Agreeing a figure for the amount of money the UK has to pay the rest of the EU "to settle its accounts", when it leaves.3) Working out what will happen on the border between Northern Ireland, when it is outside the EU, and the Republic of Ireland, which is part of the EU.The EU says it wants to make decent progress on these three issues before beginning talks about what the UK's relations with the EU will be like after Brexit.Mrs May set out her negotiating priorities in the letter officially triggering the process of leaving the EU on 29 March.Here's a guide to the key points.How are the talks going?There have been agreements on some technical points, but the chief EU negotiator, Michel Barnier, has said there had been no decisive progress on any of the main issues.The UK's Brexit Secretary, David Davis, insists progress has been made.The main sticking point at the moment is money - and the size of the bill the UK will pay to cover its outstanding obligations when it leaves.The UK wants this to be as low as possible.All the other countries in the EU want it to be as high as possible.Because when the UK leaves, there will be a hole in the EU budget and they will have to cover the shortfall.The UK government has published a series of papers setting out its position on issues such as future customs arrangements, and on the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.Government policy is now that the UK will leave the single market and the customs union on the day of Brexit, but that it will try to replicate existing customs arrangements during a time-limited transition period.What happens if there is no deal with the EU?Prime Minister Theresa May says leaving the EU with no deal whatsoever would be better than signing the UK up to a bad one.Without an agreement on trade, the UK would have to operate under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border check for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland.There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care.Here is a full explanation of what 'no deal' could mean What happens to EU citizens living in the UK?It has yet to be agreed.All EU nationals lawfully resident in the UK for at least five years will be able to apply for "settled status" and be able to bring over spouses and children, under a 15-page proposal unveiled by Theresa May.Mrs May says she wants to give reassurance and certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of the three EEA countries and Switzerland.But any deal on their future legal status and rights must be reciprocal and also give certainty to the 1.2 million British expats living on the continent after the UK leaves the EU - expected to be on 29 March 2019, she says.Michel Barnier, who is leading the Brexit negotiations for the EU, said the UK's proposals did not go far enough and he wanted the same level of protection citizens currently have under EU law.He has demanded more clarity and ambition from the UK government.The key points of the UK's proposals are: Those granted settled status will be able to live, work, study and claim benefits just as they can now The cut-off date for eligibility is undecided but will be between 29 March 2017 and 29 March 2019 Family members of EU citizens living abroad will be able to return and apply for settled status EU nationals in the UK for less than five years at the specified date will be able to continue living and working in the UK Once resident for five years, they can apply for settled status Those arriving after the cut-off point will be able to stay temporarily But there should be "no expectation" they will be granted permanent residence A period of "blanket residence permission" may apply to give officials time to process applications to stay in the UK The Home Office will no longer require evidence that EU citizens who weren't working held "comprehensive sickness insurance" Labour has said it would guarantee the rights of of EU citizens living in the UK to stay there on "day one" of a Labour government.EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit.What happens to UK citizens working in the EU?A lot depends on the kind of deal the UK agrees with the EU.If the government opted to impose work permit restrictions on EU nationals, then other countries could reciprocate, meaning Britons would have to apply for visas to work.What about EU nationals who want to work in the UK Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit.The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a "transition" phase of up to three years.However they will have to register.A permanent proposal for post-Brexit immigration is not likely to be known for a few months yet, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.What does the fall in the value of the pound mean for prices in the shops?Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Shoppers will need to keep a close eye on how much they are spending People travelling overseas from the UK have found their pounds are buying fewer euros or dollars after the Brexit vote.Even if the pound regains some of its value, currency experts expect it in the longer term to remain at least 10% below where it was when the referendum happened.This means exports should get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper, but imported goods will get more expensive - some price rises for food, clothing and homeware goods have been seen.The latest UK inflation figures have the rate at 2.6%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Will immigration be cut?Image copyright PA Prime Minister Theresa May has said one of the main messages she has taken from the Leave vote is that the British people want to see a reduction in immigration.She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a "sustainable" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year.The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed significantly since the Brexit vote.This has largely been driven by an increase in emigration from the UK by citizens of Poland and the other East and Central European countries.There were still 246,000 more people coming to live in the UK than leaving in the year to March 2017, according to the latest estimates - some way above the government's target of 100,000.Could there be a second referendum?It seems highly unlikely.Both the Conservatives and the Labour Party have ruled out another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave.Will MPs get a vote on the Brexit deal?Yes.Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process.This vote is currently proposed as a "take it or leave it" one.Labour wants the vote to have the option of sending the UK team back to renegotiate.It is worth mentioning that any deal also has to be agreed by the European Parliament - with British MEPs getting a chance to vote on it there.Will I need a visa to travel to the EU?The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals.No agreement has been reached yet, however.If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Image copyright Reuters Will I still be able to use my passport?Yes.It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same.In theory, the government could, if it wanted, decide to change the colour, which is currently standardised for EU countries, says the BBC's Europe correspondent, Chris Morris.Has any other member state ever left the EU?No nation state has ever left the EU.But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation.The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.What does this mean for Scotland?Image copyright Reuters Image caption Nicola Sturgeon says a new independence referendum in Scotland is likely Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was "democratically unacceptable" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain.Ms Sturgeon has officially asked for permission for a second referendum to be held.She had wanted the vote to be held between the autumn of 2018 and spring 2019, but after losing seats at the 2017 general election she has put her plans on hold with no referendum likely until 2021.Theresa May has said a second referendum should not be held during the Brexit process.What does it mean for Northern Ireland?The land border between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland is a key part of the Brexit talks.There is currently a common travel area between the UK and the Republic.Like Scotland, Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in last year's referendum.The result in Northern Ireland was 56% for Remain and 44% for Leave.The UK government has published a paper setting out its vision for a post-Brexit border.It wants to avoid returning to a "hard border" - that means no physical infrastructure, such as customs posts.There would be no CCTV cameras or number plate recognition technology at the border, or set back from it.Instead, the UK government is arguing for a wide-ranging exemption under which small and medium-sized businesses will not have to comply with any new customs tariffs.If the proposals are accepted, customs officials envisage using a mix of technology and physical checks to monitor the compliance of bigger businesses engaged in international trade.Critics say the proposals lack credible detail, with Labour deriding the plans for the border as "a fantasy frontier".Sinn Fein, which was part of the ruling coalition in the Northern Ireland Assembly before it was suspended, has called for a referendum on leaving the UK and joining the Republic of Ireland as soon as possible.The Conservatives have rejected Sinn Fein's call, saying there was no evidence opinion had shifted in favour of a united Ireland.How much has Brexit cost so far and how much will it cost by the end?There is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.There have been no official estimates published of the size of the bill, which covers things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments.Various figures ranging from 50bn (44bn) to 100bn (88bn) euros have been bandied about but although the UK has agreed to meet its financial obligations, Brexit secretary David Davis has said: "We will not be paying 100bn."The UK could leave without any Brexit "divorce bill" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court.If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.How will pensions, savings, investments and mortgages be affected?During the referendum campaign, David Cameron said the so-called "triple lock" for state pensions would be threatened by a UK exit.This is the agreement by which pensions increase by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest.Theresa May had proposed ditching the 2.5% part of the lock in the party's election manifesto, but as part of the post-election deal with the DUP the triple lock was again guaranteed.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low.There are few signs yet that rising inflation have worried the Bank of England enough to consider raising interest rates.But if that happened it would make mortgages and loans more expensive to repay - but would be good news for savers.Will duty-free sales on Europe journeys return?Image copyright Thinkstock Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an "upside" or "silver lining" of Brexit.As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the "customs union" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.Will EHIC cards still be valid?Image copyright Thinkstock If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more here.Will cars need new number plates?Probably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.Could MPs block an EU exit?Could the necessary legislation pass the Commons, given that a lot of MPs in the current Parliament - all SNP and Lib Dems, nearly all Labour and many Conservatives - were in favour of staying?The referendum result is not legally binding - Parliament still has to pass the laws that will get Britain out of the 28 nation bloc, starting with the repeal of the 1972 European Communities Act.The withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament - the House of Lords and/or the Commons could vote against ratification, according to a House of Commons library report.So in theory they could block the UK's EU exit.But in practice that is seen as very unlikely given that a majority of people voted for Brexit in the referendum.Will leaving the EU mean we don't have to abide by the European Court of Human Rights?The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution.It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine.So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.There have been longstanding plans to repeal the act and replace it with a British Bill of Rights.What about the European Court of Justice?The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority.It is based in Luxembourg.It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects.The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade.It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does.Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the "direct" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit.But the UK government has not ruled out remaining under its jurisdiction during the Brexit transition period that is planned after March 2019.After that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided.There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The UK has set out some ideas in a position paper, which was criticised for being too "vague".The EU is insisting that its citizens in the UK should continue to enjoy the legal protection of the ECJ even after Brexit, guaranteeing their right to work and access to benefits among other things.This is a major sticking point in the negotiations, with the UK saying EU citizens living in the UK should be subject to British law only.Will the UK be able to rejoin the EU in the future?BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU.Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining.But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands.New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.Who wanted the UK to leave the EU?The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU.They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet.A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving.What were their reasons for wanting the UK to leave?They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return.They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work.One of the main principles of EU membership is "free movement", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country.The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of "ever closer union" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a "United States of Europe".Who wanted the UK to stay in the EU?Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in.He said the deal would give Britain "special" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in.The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign.The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in.The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU, as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.What were their reasons for wanting the UK to stay?Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services.They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.What about businesses?Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world.Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU.Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound.Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU.Image copyright Reuters Image caption Boris Johnson was one of the most prominent Leave campaigners Who led the rival sides in the campaign?Britain Stronger in Europe - the main cross-party group campaigning for Britain to remain in the EU was headed by former Marks and Spencer chairman Lord Rose.It was backed by key figures from the Conservative Party, including Prime Minister David Cameron and Chancellor George Osborne, most Labour MPs, including party leader Jeremy Corbyn and Alan Johnson, who ran the Labour In for Britain campaign, the Lib Dems, Plaid Cymru, the Alliance party and the SDLP in Northern Ireland, and the Green Party.Who funded the campaign: Britain Stronger in Europe raised 6.88m, boosted by two donations totalling 2.3m from the supermarket magnate and Labour peer Lord Sainsbury.Other prominent Remain donors included hedge fund manager David Harding (750,000), businessman and Travelex founder Lloyd Dorfman (500,000) and the Tower Limited Partnership (500,000).Read a Who's Who guide.Who else campaigned to remain : The SNP ran its own remain campaign in Scotland as it did not want to share a platform with the Conservatives.Several smaller groups also registered to campaign.Britain Stronger

editor Katya Adler.There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - "much to France's chagrin", she says.Will Brexit harm product safety?Probably not, is the answer.It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards.Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this page Which MPs were for staying and which for leaving?The good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list.Click here for the latest version.How much does the UK contribute to the EU and how much do we get in return?In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out.Only France and Germany contribute more.In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.Image copyright Thinkstock Image caption The UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to 4.6bn in 2014/15.According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was 8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10.The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was 5.7bn.Read more number crunching from Reality Check.If I retire to Spain or another EU country will my healthcare costs still be covered?David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans.This is one of those issues where it is not possible to say definitively what would happen.At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS.After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment.In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.If Britain remains in the single market, or the European Economic Area as it is known, it might be able to continue with this arrangement, according to a House of Commons library research note.If Britain has to negotiate trade deals with individual member states, it may opt to continue paying for expats' healthcare through the NHS or decide that they would have to cover their own costs if they continue to live abroad, if the country where they live declines to do so.What will happen to protected species?Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.The answer is that they would remain in place, initially at least.After the Leave vote, the government will probably review all EU-derived laws in the two years leading up to the official exit date to see which ones to keep or scrap.The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied.The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.The government would want to avoid a legislative vacuum caused by the repeal of EU laws before new UK laws are in place - it would also continue to abide by other international agreements covering environmental protection.How much money will the UK save through changes to migrant child benefits and welfare payments?Martin, from Poole, in Dorset, wanted to know what taxpayers would have got back from the benefit curbs negotiated by David Cameron in Brussels.We don't exactly know because the details were never worked out.HM Revenue and Customs suggested about 20,000 EU nationals receive child benefit payments in respect of 34,000 children in their country of origin at an estimated cost of about 30m.But the total saving would have been significantly less than that because Mr Cameron did not get the blanket ban he wanted.Instead, payments would have been linked to the cost of living in the countries where the children live.David Cameron said as many as 40% of EU migrant families who come to Britain could lose an average of 6,000 a year of in-work benefits when his "emergency brake" was applied.The DWP estimated between 128,700 and 155,100 people would be affected.But the cuts would have been phased in.New arrivals would not have got tax credits and other in-work benefits straight away but would have gradually gained access to them over a four year period at a rate that had not been decided.The plan will never be implemented now.Will we be barred from the Eurovision Song Contest?Image copyright BBC/Guy Levy Image caption To participate in the Eurovision Song Contest countries need to be a member of the European Broadcasting Union, which is independent of the EU Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry.We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: "All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union.The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe.Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC."What will happen to pet passports?The answer to Alan Rippington's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws.It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: "The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU."Has Brexit made house prices fall?Image copyright PA So far, the answer is no.But there has been anecdotal evidence of house prices falling at the top of the market in Central London and the annual increase in the price of property has fallen from 9.4% at the time of the referendum to 4.9% a year later.What is the 'red tape' that opponents of the EU complain about?Ged, from Liverpool, suspects "red tape" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection.According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related.The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs 4.7bn a year, tops the list.The working time directive (4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019.Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them.Brexit may also generate "red tape" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Will Britain be party to the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership?Ste, in Bolton, asked about this.The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of 10bn a year.But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights.US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the TTIP agreement, which means it is now seen as unlikely to be agreed - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it will not be part of TTIP and will have to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.What impact will leaving the EU have on the NHS?Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS.This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was 350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead.The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses.The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as "scaremongering" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned.EU citizens working for the NHS are expected to get the right to stay in the UK, although details on EU citizens in the UK and UK citizens elsewhere in the EU are yet to be finalised (see earlier answer).Sally Miller bought a house in Spain nine years ago and plans to retire there in the next five years.She asked how Brexit will affect this.Image copyright Getty Images The BBC's Kevin Connolly says: The issue of free movement - the rights of EU citizens to live and work in the UK - was a huge issue in the Brexit referendum of course, and will be a big part of the exit negotiations.We've heard quite a bit from the British side already with the government saying that securing the status and rights of EU nationals in the UK and UK nationals in the EU is one of the government's earliest priorities, and specifically that it is looking for a reciprocal deal.So you might feel the mood music is encouraging but all we can say for sure is that, while there are no guarantees yet, it will be a big part of the Brexit negotiations to come.Jonathan Eaton is a Briton living in the Netherlands with his wife, who is Dutch.He asks what rights to benefits and housing he will have if he has to return to the UK.Image copyright Getty Images BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith says: The short answer is there is no easy access to benefits.As it stands at the moment, Brexit aside, you will have to pass what's known as a habitual residence test which was introduced in 1994 and applies to British citizens just as EU citizens.The rules have been tightened up which means for some benefits, if you have been out of the country you can't even think about applying for the test for several months.For example, when it comes to jobseeker's allowance, you cannot even take the test to apply for those benefits for three months.And that was done to stop EU citizens coming here and just getting on benefits straight away.After three months, you can take the test which looks at your English language skills, what sort of efforts you made to find work before coming to the UK.It also considers how strong a tie you have to the UK, whether you have property or family here and what your intentions are in terms of staying and working, or returning.But once you have taken the test, if you pass it then you should be eligible to apply for a range of benefits, as long as you meet the usual requirements in terms of income and showing you are looking for work.That is likely to continue when we move fully on to Universal Credit.The one sort of unknown in the whole system is what happens with Brexit negotiations, in terms of guaranteeing the rights of British nationals abroad.And we simply don't know what that will involve and whether in any way that might impact on how soon you can apply for benefits when you come back to Britain.Will I have to buy a new passport and driving licence, and will my rights to use them freely across Europe be taken away from me after Brexit, asks Francis Lee.Image copyright Getty Images Kevin Connolly says: At the moment UK passports carry the words European Union and British driving licences have the blue square with yellow flags of the EU.That will presumably change after Brexit but it seems likely that the change will be phased in so that you'll simply get documents with the new design when the old ones expire.That's what happened, I seem to remember, when the UK joined the EU.Anything else would be expensive and risk flooding the system, after all.The right to use them freely is an interesting question.When we talk about restrictions on freedom of movement we generally mean the freedom to live and work in another country.If Britain poses restrictions on the EU in that respect then it can expect some kind of response.But in terms of tourism there are plenty of non-EU countries whose citizens can visit the UK for up to 90 days without a visa.And, as part of the Brexit negotiations, you'd expect similar arrangements to be discussed for the UK.Both sides need each others' tourists and, after all, if you can drive a car in the United States on a UK licence then it doesn't seem fanciful to assume that you'll be able to do the same in Europe in future.It is very clear that the PM and the government want to leave the tyranny of the European Court of Justice.Why has leaving the European Court of Human Rights (an organisation far more hated than the ECJ) been ignored, asks Barry Fryer.Image copyright Getty Images Kevin Connolly says: Two different courts here of course, so two different bits of politics.Crucially, the European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law.So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.Adrian Wallis runs a small electronics company and wants to know about export tariffs after Brexit, and what they'd mean for his business.Kevin Connolly says: As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs.That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free.On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own.That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU.Image copyright Thinkstock One bit of good news is that the UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU.That matters because in the period when the UK is negotiating a new trade deal with the EU, and that could take years, trade would be conducted under WTO rules.At the moment, for non-food items, that implies an average tariff of about 2.3%.But suppose the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, for example.Well, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars.In theory, an economist would say that creates a situation where everyone has an incentive to sort out a better deal for their consumers.The snag is that these things take years, if not decades.They tend to be done on a country-by-country and sector-by-sector basis.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then I'm afraid he's going to have to be patient.Maybe very, very patient.What impact will leaving the European Union have on the UK's long term political influence in Europe, asks Peter Hoare.Norman Smith says: There are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.My take is that not much is probably going to change.I say that because the UK'll still be a member of significant organisations such as the UN and Nato, and will still be co-operating with EU partners.For example, there will still be close ties on defence with the French.The UK will still be the same old Britain, will still have significant military force, will still be a wealthy country and will still be a nuclear power, so I don't think people will suddenly think the UK's an entirely different country.Are other countries likely to leave the EU and if so could we start a new free trade area, asks David John.Kevin Connolly says: Funnily enough, I was discussing this question just the other day with a French politician, a conservative and a real Europhile, and he said he thought if there was a free vote in France tomorrow, as the right wing National Front would like, that the French would vote to leave.But generally speaking I can't see much prospect of a tidal wave of insurrectionist, exitism sweeping the continent.When a country like Ireland has a spat with the EU about tax, for example, it does annoy Irish politicians, but most mainstream leaders in the Europe have grown up with the idea that the EU has brought peace and prosperity for decades.Image copyright Getty Images Lots of them see plenty that irritates them about the European Union, but they mainly argue that the benefits hugely outweigh the irritations.And in countries where you do find Euroscepticism, such as Poland and Hungary, there is also a healthy awareness that there are huge financial benefits to membership.As for the future, we will see.If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, I think it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Britain could perhaps join the Free Trade Association along with Norway, Lichtenstein and Switzerland.But of course it would be joining under existing rules, so the likeliest future for a post-Brexit UK, I think, is a future where it tries to do the best deal possible with the EU and then looks around for other free trade deals.But that would fall short of creating a free trade area based on the UK itself.What will happen to the borders in Gibraltar and Northern Ireland, asks Nigel May.Kevin Connolly says: I think the question of what is going to happen to borders after Brexit is one of the most difficult of the lot.Since 1985 when Spain joined the EU, it has basically been prevented from closing the border with Gibraltar as a way of applying pressure to the British territory.In fact, 12,000 Spanish people cross into the territory to work every day and the area of Spain around Gibraltar is a pretty depressed area so they are important jobs.On the other hand, the Spanish have talked openly about this being an opportunity to get Gibraltar back.Jose Manuel Garcia-Margallo, its minister of foreign affairs, said in September the UK's vote to leave the EU was "a unique historical opportunity in more than three hundred years to get Gibraltar back".But at a minimum, as things stand, it looks to me as though they could certainly re-impose border controls if they chose to.Image copyright Getty Images The situation with Ireland's border is more complex.For those of us for whom Northern Ireland is home, the total disappearance of military check points on the border is one of the most tangible daily reminders of the end of the Troubles and no one wants a border like that back.But, when the day comes when Ireland is in the EU and the UK is not, then the Irish border of course is also going to be the UK's land border with the European Union.Conservative leader Theresa May has said we don't see a return to the borders of the past, but the reality is that if Britain leaves the common customs area, then presumably some sort of checks are going to be necessary on that border.And if the UK wants to stop Polish or Romanian migrant workers using Dublin airport as a back door into the UK, then it is going to have to do something about that too.The UK has published a paper setting out its preferred options.Of course, what it will all mean for towns and villages like Belleek and Belcoo in County Fermanagh, which more or less straddle the border, is hard to imagine.How will access to healthcare change for expats living in the EU, asks Veronique Bradley, who lives in Italy.Kevin Connolly says: Healthcare is one of those issues that remains relatively simple as long as the UK remains in the EU.It is just part of a range of citizens' rights that apply across the entire union.After Brexit, I suppose there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.What will happen to EU nationals who lived and worked in the UK and now receive a British state pension, asks Peter Barz, a German citizen living in the UK.Norman Smith says: If you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Image copyright Getty Images Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, "I paid in there", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Is it possible to be both an EU citizen and not an EU citizen, asks Declan O'Neill, who holds an Irish passport.Kevin Connolly says: I should probably declare some sort of interest here as a dual Irish and British national myself.Of course, anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.Image copyright Getty Images The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.Is there a get-out clause for Article 50, asks Gillian Coates.Norman Smith says: I think the honest answer is you would have to be a legal eagle to answer this.But my take on it is that legally it looks like once we trigger Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.Image copyright Thinkstock However, in the real world I think it is likely to be rather different, whatever the legal protocol.I think the truth is, if we were trundling along and decided it was all going to be catastrophic and we have got to pull up the handbrake pretty sharpish, a lot of other EU countries would be probably be laughing at us, but I think at the same time they would probably be quite pleased we weren't going.So I think the short answer is: legally, it doesn't look so good if you want to get out of it, but politically, it probably can be done with the support of other European leaders.Eric Degerland asks when UK passports are going to change.Kevin Connolly says: This takes us to the heart of an issue that lots of people really care about.It will be a real and palpable sign of Brexit when there is a new UK passport without the words "European Union" on the front cover.Sadly, the short answer is we don't really know when the change will come about.Image copyright Getty Images But we can say that the cheapest thing for the government to do would be to phase in the new passports as people's old ones expire.So if you're looking forward to getting back that blue hard-back passport we had in the old days, you may have a long time to wait.The BBC's Reality Check team answered some of your questions about Theresa May's plans for EU citizens living in the UK.Will Irish citizens be exempt from this five-year residency requirement, and continue to be afforded equal treatment with UK nationals?Yes, Irish citizens residing in the UK will not need to apply for settled status to protect their entitlements as the UK government is committed to protecting the Common Travel Area arrangements.Would EU citizens still be able to move to the UK in the next two years until March 2019?Yes, they would.The UK is a member of the EU until it withdraws, so the freedom of movement rules will apply until then.Why shouldn't British courts have full jurisdiction over the rights of EU citizens living in the UK?Wasn't that the whole point of Brexit?The UK government says the European Court of Justice will not have jurisdiction over EU citizens' rights.The EU demands that it does.This is an important sticking point in the Brexit negotiations.How can a lifetime stay be guaranteed?Could a future government change the law?Once the UK leaves the EU, any future government will in principle be able to propose amendments to the rules and the UK Parliament would decide on the new law.I plan to retire to France within the next two years and buy a property.Will this be possible after Brexit?You can buy property and retire anywhere in the world, subject to the rules of the country you are retiring in.So, you'll be able to do that but we don't know what your exact rights will be until the UK and EU conclude the citizens' rights negotiations.I'm an EU national living in the UK but my wife is from outside the EU.Is her status going to change?Your wife, as a family member of an eligible EU citizen who has been resident in the UK before we leave the EU, will also be eligible to apply for settled status with you, provided that she too meets the settlement criteria and has been in a genuine relationship with you while resident in the UK.

Boris Johnson Image copyright AFP Another familiar face kept his job at the Foreign Office after the election.Despite hints from some of the newspapers that Boris Johnson, 52, seeks the top job, he has categorically dismissed such claims.In the wake of June's shock election result, Mr Johnson said that while the public would be wondering about the future of the current government, Mrs May had got the biggest Conservative mandate anyone had achieved for decades."I'm going to be backing her, and absolutely everybody I'm talking to is going to be backing her as well."Home Secretary -

Guide: 2017 political party conferences:::::Autumn sees Britain's political parties gathering by the sea - or in big city conference centres - here's a round-up of this year's.Conservatives - 1-4 October in Manchester Image copyright PA The most memorable moments of the 2017 Conservative conference came at the very end, in a speech more eventful than Theresa May and her team could have imagined.The prime minister was plagued by a cough which left her relying on gulps of water - and even a cough sweet handed to her by the chancellor - to complete some lines.If that wasn't bad enough, prankster Simon Brodkin had somehow gained access to the conference floor and handed her a mocked-up P45."I was about to talk about somebody I'd like to give a P45 to, and that's Jeremy Corbyn," the PM quipped, to cheers from the party faithful.It didn't end there - some of the letters fell off the conference stage backdrop behind her, leaving it as: "Building a country that works or everyon."The speech had been billed as the PM's attempt to reassert her authority after the ill-fated snap general election and reports of splits in her cabinet over Brexit.It also contained policy pledges on social housing and a cap on standard tariff energy bills, while Home Secretary Amber Rudd announced a ban on acid sales to under 18s and a tightening of the laws on viewing terrorist content online.In his speech, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - who has been accused of undermining the PM with his interventions on Brexit strategy - said it was time to "let the British lion roar".Mrs May ended the conference being publicly supported by her MPs and ministers although there were reports of "emerging plots" among some MPs.Labour - 24-27 September in Brighton Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption In full: Jeremy Corbyn's 75 minute speech Jeremy Corbyn ended Labour's week in Brighton with a speech to delegates in which he claimed the party was "on the threshold of power".The centre ground of British politics had shifted, he argued, and his Labour Party was now in the "political mainstream" because its polices were "what most people in our country actually want".He used the speech to announce some new policies - such as rent controls and curbs on gentrification - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another election campaign, with the Tory government "hanging by a thread".His supporters in the hall loved it, although they were chanting "Oh, Jeremy Corbyn" for a full two minutes before he had even begun.This conference cemented Mr Corbyn's dominance of the party, following his better-than-expected general election result.There was a row about Brexit, with moderate MPs, who want Mr Corbyn to commit to keeping the UK in the single market and customs union, feeling they had been denied a vote on this issue and the chance to debate it more fully.And Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell caused a stir when he warned Labour must prepare for all eventualities in government, including a possible run on the pound.But delegates approved changes to the way leaders are elected, which could make it easier to elect a left-wing successor to Mr Corbyn.SNP - 8-10 October in Glasgow Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Opening her conference speech, Nicola Sturgeon says: "At the risk of tempting fate, I have come prepared" SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon insisted her party will "always make the case for independence" as she used her keynote speech to focus on domestic priorities rather than constitutional matters.Although the Scottish government has delayed plans for a second independence referendum, Ms Sturgeon said her party still had a mandate for a vote on the issue.The "essence of independence", she told activists, was being "in the driving seat and not simply at the mercy of events" as she stressed the case for leaving the UK did not merely hinge on Brexit.Her headline policy announcement was a plan to set up a publicly-owned, not-for-profit energy company by 2021.She argued the venture would give people - particularly on low incomes - more choice of which supplier to use with energy sold at "close to cost price as possible".Spending on early-years childcare in Scotland will be doubled to 840m by 2020, a move the SNP said would be "truly transformational", while there will be a new scheme to provide free sanitary products in schools, colleges and universities from next August.Liberal Democrats - 16-19 September in Bournemouth Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Liberal Democrat conference: Sir Vince Cable's full speech The Liberal Democrats gathered by the seaside having modestly increased their tally of MPs to 12 in the recent general election, following an electoral drubbing in 2015 that left them with just eight.In his keynote speech to conference, new leader Sir Vince Cable said he could lead the Lib Dems back to power by offering a mix of "hope and realism".He called for higher taxes on foreign property speculators and second home owners to help tackle inequality.And he claimed Brexit would be an act of "masochism", leaving the UK poorer.UKIP - 29-30 September in Torquay Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Mr Bolton won the UKIP leadership contest with 30% of the vote UKIP members met for a two-day conference in which new leader Henry Bolton was crowned.The former soldier, who saw off challenges from better-known candidates, told members: "Brexit is our core task.However it is not the end of the line."Controversial anti-Islam candidate Anne Marie Waters finished second.Some MEPs had threatened to quit if she had won.UKIP's share of the vote in the general election collapsed to just 1.8%, prompting the resignation of then-leader Paul Nuttall.Green Party - 7-10 October in Harrogate Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Greens told to look on the bright side after disappointing election Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley spoke of the "hurt" he and others felt at the party's loss of ground in June's election, where its vote share more than halved.While the Greens had suffered at the hands of the two-party system in England and Wales, he said it could be proud of the causes it had espoused and the influence it had had on debates around austerity and fracking.Through its national and local representation, he said the party would stick up for the "little guy" as it made the case for far-reaching economic change.He called for more public input into the funding of services, locally controlled energy schemes and bank investment in "community bonds".Plaid Cymru - 20-21 October in Caernarfon Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Leanne Wood said Plaid Cymru had "the ambition to show a new way for Wales" Leanne Wood vowed to stay on as leader of Plaid Cymru at the party's conference.She told the conference they needed to earn the trust of non-Plaid Cymru voters whilst announcing the party could back a second Brexit referendum if there was no deal with the EU by March 2019.Ms Wood also announced proposals to re-train manual workers whose jobs are threatened by automation and promised a "rail revolution".The party saw a drop in their share of the vote in June's general election, although they gained a seat.Meanwhile Plaid Cymru AM Neil McEvoy, who was suspended from the party following a row over policy on council house sales, dismissed suggestions he was planning a leadership challenge at a fringe meeting.
