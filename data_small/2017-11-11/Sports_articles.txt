Army holds off Duke 21-16, finishes unbeaten at home (Nov 11, 2017):::::WEST POINT, N.Y. (AP) Ahmad Bradshaw scored on an 18-yard run, Javhari Bourdeau returned a blocked punt for another touchdown, and Army beat mistake-prone Duke 21-16 on Saturday to finish the season unbeaten on its home turf at Michie Stadium.Army (8-2), fresh from a dominating 21-0 victory at Air Force, has won six in a row and finished 6-0 at home, the first Army team to be perfect at home in a season since 1996.Doing so on Veterans Day and two years after Duke had embarrassed the Black Knights 44-3 on their home turf made it a special moment for Army coach Jeff Monken."Just a fantastic day to be able to represent the Army and the way we did," Monken said."I think that's the best thing that we can do on this day is play like we did, with a lot of toughness and a lot of grit.It wasn't perfect, but in the end it was good enough.I'm really, really proud of our team."Duke (4-6) was 4-1 in its previous five meetings with Army, but the Blue Devils were done in by mistakes in their sixth straight loss and now have to win their final two games to become eligible to play in a bowl game."We're going to run to it," said Duke quarterback Daniel Wilson, who was 19 of 29 for 164 yards and one interception passing and scored on a 4-yard run in the second quarter."We still have an opportunity to finish strong.We'll do our best to do that."In the first half, Duke outgained Army and even held the ball a tad longer than the Black Knights, the leading rushing team in the nation.But turnovers and the blocked punt cost the Blue Devils dearly.They trailed 21-10 at halftime and couldn't rally for the victory.Jones led Duke on a 14-play drive capped by Brittain Brown's 1-yard touchdown run on the first play of the fourth quarter, but the Blue Devils failed on the 2-point conversion when Jones was stopped cold on a run.Army responded by holding the ball for over 10 minutes on an 18-play drive that was helped by a personal foul against Duke linebacker Joe Giles-Harris that gave the Black Knights a first down at the Duke 13.Then it was Army's turn to self-destruct, getting called for delay of game and a false start that forced the Black Knights to attempt a field goal.Duke defensive tackle Mike Ramsay blocked Blake Wilson's 20-yard attempt with 4:15 left, giving the Blue Devils one last shot.The Army defense made sure the seniors would celebrate one last time on their home field, stuffing the Blue Devils in their tracks.Jones was hit twice as he tried to pass and was sacked once.Duke punted with just over 2 minutes left and never got the ball back.After falling behind 3-0, Army drove 80 yards in 11 plays to gain a lead it never relinquished, with Andy Davidson rushing for 37 yards on four carries to help set up Darnell Woolfolk's 3-yard touchdown.Army then forced the Blue Devils to punt, and Davidson used his expertise on special teams to block the kick.Bourdeau, a freshman defensive back, quickly scooped it up and returned it 25 yards for a touchdown and a 14-3 lead early in the second quarter.When Duke got the ball back, the Blue Devils committed another gaffe.Jones mishandled a snap on first down and Army safety Rhyan England recovered the fumble at the Army 36.The triple option offers an element of mystery when it comes to Army, which did not attempt a pass in the win over Air Force and ranks last nationally in passing.Bradshaw stunned Duke with his only throw of the game, hitting a wide-open Kell Walker down the left side for 42 yards on a third-and-9 play.Two plays later, Bradshaw scored untouched over right tackle for what proved to be the decisive score.THE TAKEAWAY Duke: Coming off a bye week, Duke faced the first of two straight games against the triple option with Georgia Tech next on the schedule.The Blue Devils held Army to a season-low 226 yards rushing, well below its average of 365.4 yards, so that bodes well for next week."It felt good knowing that we could hold this team," Ramsay said."They've kind of dominated a lot of other teams.Being able to shut them down, get that field goal blocked, was a big momentum change for the team."Army: The Black Knights continued their impressive run, overcoming an Atlantic Coast Conference team that was desperate for a win.They can match the school record for victories in a season if they win their final two games.UP NEXT Duke: The Blue Devils host Georgia Tech next Saturday afternoon.Army: The Black Knights are at North Texas next Saturday night.-- More AP college football: http://collegefootball.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP-Top25 -- Kekis on Twitter: www.twitter.com/Greek1947

(AP) -- Otis Anderson rushed for 84 yards and two touchdowns, McKenzie Milton passed for 311 yards and No.14 Central Florida pulled away from UConn for a 49-24 victory on Saturday.Anderson had a 3-yard touchdown run in the first quarter and helped the undefeated Knights break it open with a 65-yard touchdown run, making it 35-17 with 14:11 left.UCF (9-0, 6-0 American Athletic Conference, CFP, No.18) also got a solid performance from Milton, who was 24-for-36 passing.He tossed a 6-yard TD pass to Marlon Williams in the first quarter and a 41-yarder to Tre'Quan Smith with 7:43 left in the first half, helping the Knights to a 28-10 lead at the break.After Anderson's second TD, Milton added a 4-yard touchdown run that made it 42-17 with 8:54 left.David Pindell passed for 201 yards and a touchdown and also ran for a score for UConn (3-7, 2-5), but the Huskies were unable to keep up with the high-scoring Knights.Pindell was inserted into the starting lineup in place of the injured Bryant Shirreffs.Pindell's 9-yard touchdown run made it 28-17 early in the second half.UCF failed to score in the third, just the second time this season the Knights went scoreless in a quarter.But they made up for it with a big finish.Noah Vedral's 35-yard touchdown pass to Cam Stewart made it 49-17 with 7:03 left.Pindell led the Huskies with 21 carries for 96 yards.He was 18 for 31 through the air, also throwing an interception.Smith also finished with seven catches for 120 yards for UCF.THE TAKEAWAY UConn: Pindell, a junior college transfer, was benched after starting the season opener.His dual-threat ability gave the Huskies the spark that they needed.UCF: The Knights must improve their run defense if they hope to win the AAC title and make it to a New Year's Six bowl.UP NEXT UConn: The Huskies step out of conference play to take on Boston College on Saturday.UCF: The Knights travel to Temple on Saturday for their final league road game.
Reeling Florida can't capitalize on South Carolina miscues in fifth straight loss:::::COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- Jake Bentley threw for 249 yards and ran for two touchdowns to lead South Carolina to a 28-20 win over Florida on Saturday.The Gamecocks (7-3, 5-3 Southeastern) had their best game of the season, gaining 469 yards, and needed that offense to overcome Bentley's three interceptions and a fumbled punt.But a Florida team in disarray with a fired coach and no wins since September couldn't take advantage of the help.The Gators (3-6, 3-5) will finish with a losing SEC record for only the third time since 1992.A.J.Turner ran 22 times for 136 yards and Mon Denson rushed for the first two touchdowns of his career as South Carolina will finish second in the SEC East.They have just one title and fourth second-place finishes in 25 years in the league.And in a common theme this season, South Carolina's defense came through.The Gators converted as many fourth downs (2 for 2) as third downs (2 for 15).But Florida still had one last chance before defensive back Jamyest Williams' interception on a tipped pass near midfield with just over a minute to go.For the second game in a row, Florida started Notre Dame graduate transfer Malik Zaire at quarterback.He hurt his leg is the second quarter, left for a play, then crumpled to the ground as he tried to run.Freshman Feleipe Franks went 10 of 25 for 174 yards.Florida was missing at least 20 of its 85 scholarship players because of injuries or suspensions.THE TAKEAWAY Florida: Unless the Gators pick up a game on Dec. 2 to replace the one cancelled for Hurricane Irma and win out, they won't make a bowl for only the third time in 31 seasons.Florida has lost five in a row, their longest losing streak since finishing the 2013 season with seven straight losses amid the firing of Will Muschamp, now South Carolina's second-year coach.South Carolina: Bentley, a sophomore, has 13 interceptions in his career.Five of them have come in the past two games South Carolina will finish with a winning record in the SEC for only the eight time since joining the league in 1992. .South Carolina's do-everything tight end Hayden Hurst caught five passes for 59 yards, ran once for 11 yards and forced a key fumble at the 1 as Florida defensive back CJ Henderson was a yard away from a touchdown on Bentley's first interception.UP NEXT Florida: The Gators host UAB next Saturday.South Carolina: The Gamecocks host FCS Wofford next Saturday.

Preview: Magic visit Denver aiming for third straight win:::::TV: FOX Sports Florida TIME: Pregame coverage begins at 8:30 p.m.The Denver Nuggets had a goal at the start of November -- sweep their six-game homestand and establish Pepsi Center as a tough place for visiting teams.The ultimate goal was spoiled halfway through by the defending champions, but Denver can get close to reaching it by beating the Orlando Magic on Saturday in the final game of the season-long homestand.A win over the Magic and a confident Nuggets team will head to Portland on Monday for an early season test against a Northwest Division rival.They already passed one in pulling away from Oklahoma City to win on national television Thursday night, and finishing 5-1 at home will boost that confidence even more.Orlando Magic on FOX Sports Florida Home victories are vital for a team with playoff aspirations.After Saturday's game against Orlando (8-4), Denver plays 10 of its next 14 on the road, including a six-game swing early next month.A trip like that might not be as intimidating as in past seasons.The players feel this is a different squad than the one that missed the postseason by a game last year."We're growing up," guard Will Barton said after the 102-94 win over the Thunder."It's just a different feeling.I feel like guys just want to win.I feel everyone's sacrificing for the team, and hopefully we keep it up."For the second time in five days, the Nuggets are getting a bit of a break.Orlando beat Phoenix 128-112 on Friday night and got into Denver late.It's the same scenario when Brooklyn came to town on Tuesday and the Nuggets won that game 112-104.The Magic won't be intimidated by the task.They've already posted wins at Cleveland, New Orleans and Memphis and at home against San Antonio.They've also suffered a double-digit home loss to Chicago, projected to be one of the worst teams in the NBA, so overconfidence is not an issue.Orlando is also in the midst of a tough four-game road trip that includes stops in Portland and Golden State.The Magic started well, scoring a season-high 128 points against the Suns."It's maybe the toughest stretch of our season," coach Frank Vogel told The Orlando Sentinel."It's going to be a big challenge for us."Having wins over good teams -- especially on the road -- helps build confidence for these games."It's a critical stretch," Magic center Nikola Vucevic told The Orlando Sentinel."I think it'll show us what we're made of.We're off to a good start to the season."This trip can really show how strong we are together if we hit adversity.With road trips, it can be great for a team if we win a couple of games, just build a lot of confidence."The Nuggets will see some familiar faces Saturday night.Orlando's leading scorer is Evan Fournier, their 2012 draft pick whom they traded to the Magic for Arron Afflalo.Another former Nugget, D.J.Augustin, has missed four straight games with a strained left hamstring.Afflalo was their leading scorer before coming back to Denver in 2014-15, but his role has diminished in his second tour in Orlando while Fournier has flourished.Fournier leads Orlando in scoring at 20.5 points per game going into Friday and he is gaining confidence as a passer."Experience (is helpful)," he told The Orlando Sentinel."It's my sixth year in the league now.My reads are getting better just by being on the court more.But, honestly, man, the way we play is a big part of it."
Preview: Panthers try to send Devils to fifth straight loss:::::TV: FOX Sports Florida TIME: 7 p.m.The Florida Panthers snapped a losing streak Friday evening, but they are hoping to extend one for the New Jersey Devils when the two teams meet Saturday night at the Prudential Center.After losing five in a row, the Panthers (5-8-2) beat the Buffalo Sabres 4-1 on Friday for their first win in nearly two weeks.Meanwhile, the Devils (9-4-2) lost four straight after starting the season winning nine of their first 11 games.Florida's Jonathan Huberdeau, who has 19 points in 15 games, assisted on three of the Panthers' four goals Friday.Aleksander Barkov and Evgenii Dadonov each had a goal and an assist.Florida Panthers on FOX Sports Florida It was only the third time this season the Panthers allowed two goals or fewer.They entered play Friday surrendering more than four goals per game, worst in the league.However, Roberto Luongo stopped 24 of 25 shots and passed Curtis Joseph for the fourth most wins in NHL history with 455."Luongo made some amazing saves, and it was nice to win a tight game," coach Bob Boughner told reporters after the Panthers scored a pair of empty-netters to pad the result.The Panthers won two of their first three contests this season and only have three victories since, with losing streaks of three and five games mixed in."They've got to start believing in themselves a little more," Panthers general manager Dale Tallon said to The Sun Sentinel."We've got a young team, young core, good coaches, they're learning.We just have to be more consistent."For Devils coach John Hynes, it's a simple explanation as to why his club is struggling after starting the season on fire."You can't be interested in playing the right way, you have to be committed to playing the right way, and I would say the past few games there have been times we were just interested in playing the right way," Hynes said.In each of the Devils' last three games, they started fast by scoring the game-opening goal within the first several minutes.They were unable to sustain that early momentum throughout the full 60 minutes.Their most recent loss was a 3-2 overtime defeat at the hands of the Edmonton Oilers.The Devils let a third-period lead slip away before Leon Draisaitl finished them off with an overtime winner."It's been a little slide for our group, a little adversity here early on," said Devils winger Kyle Palmieri, who returned to the lineup after a six-game injury absence on Thursday."If anything is going to give us some momentum in the month it's going to be playing well in a back-to-back this weekend."The Devils play only their second set of back-to-back games this season when they host the Panthers on Saturday and then skate in Chicago against the Blackhawks on Sunday."We built a pretty good resume the first 10 games of the season," said Devils center Brian Boyle, who scored his first goal with the team in Thursday's loss."We've got to get back to that."The Panthers are in the midst of a back-to-back this weekend, as well, of course.This is their third set of back-to-backs this season.In each of the first two, the Panthers lost the first game and won the second.This time they are in position to sweep a back-to-back.Recent history is on the Panthers' side when it comes to playing the Devils.The Panthers swept the three-game season series against the Devils in 2016-17 and won five of the last six games between the clubs.
Preview: UCF trying to get back to high-scoring ways against UConn:::::TV: ESPNU Time: Noon ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- It's one thing to have the top scoring offense in the country.But one reason UCF has managed to baffle so many defensive coordinators is all the options the 14th-ranked Knights can throw at them.UCF can put multiple playmakers on the field at the same time.Quarterback McKenzie Milton can hand the ball off to speedy running back Adrian Killins for long-distance touchdown or look to outside receivers Tre'Quan Smith and Gabriel Davis going vertical.Then there is versatile tight end Jordan Akins, a strong NFL prospect.Throw in Otis Anderson, who might lineup at running back for one play and wide receiver the next -- it's a lot for any defensive coordinator to contain."When there are five or six guys who can get the ball and make plays it's tough to defend," Milton said."It puts a lot of pressure on the defense and with our O-line doing what they've doing it's tough to stop."The Knights (8-0, 5-0 American Athletic Conference) have been nearly impossible to even slow down.In addition to leading the nation in scoring at 48.5 points per game, UCF is averaging 540.4 yards a game and nearly eight yards per play.UConn takes it turn Saturday to try and slow down the explosive Knights.Huskies defensive coordinator Billy Crocker knows the challenges ahead.It will be even tougher for the Huskies (3-6, 2-4), whose defense has made a habit of giving up big plays and ranks last in the nation in passing defense, allowing 378.6 yards passing this season."This is an opportunity," said Crocker, who runs a 3-3-5 scheme."Guess what, the game is coming on Saturday and we got to play and we're going to play it so we have to see that as an opportunity."It doesn't help that the Knights are just a little disappointed in themselves after putting up a season-high 615 yards of offense last week against SMU but only managing to score 31 points."We're supposed to have more points than we had if you have 600-plus yards of offense so we are going to go to work making sure we finish drives this week and clean some things up," said UCF coach Scott Frost.But Frost also knows he has the weapons in the offense to get back on track quickly."We have to keep mixing it up, we have to keep being fresh," Frost said."The great thing about this offense is we have five or six skilled guys on the field at all times that I feel like can make a big play."When you have that it doesn't matter who the open guy is.That guy has a chance to break something and score points for you."Some other things to watch when UConn visits No.14 UCF on Saturday: SECOND CHANCES The Huskies will be without starting quarterback Bryant Shirreffs, who is still out from the concussion he suffered during last week's loss to USF.That means junior college transfer David Pindell will be re-inserted as the starter after being benched following one start to begin the season.BALL HAWKS UCF cornerback Mike Hughes has two interceptions and nine pass breakups and he ranks 14th in the nation in passes defended with 1.4 per game.Safety Kyle Gibson leads has three picks on the season.CLIMBING THE CHARTS Wide receiver Tre'Quan Smith has nine touchdown receptions on the season, but he needs five more TD catches over the final four games to match the school's single-season record.Bret Cooper set the mark with 14 touchdown catches in 1992.TURNOVER BATTLE The Knights' +1.25 per game turnover margin ranks eighth in the nation.But for they lost the turnover battle (3-1) for the first time this season last week.WHAT CONFLICT?There has been a lot of conversation this week about the whereabouts of the ConFLiCT Trophy that was invented by former UConn coach Bob Diaco a few years ago to mark the rivalry between UCF and UConn.UCF has never recognized the game as a rivalry or the trophy as "a thing."The Knights have won the last two games in the series but Frost said this week he has no idea where the trophy is.
Preview: FSU looks for huge upset in road showdown with No. 4 Clemson:::::TV: ESPN Time: 3:30 p.m. CLEMSON, S.C. (AP) -- It's a huge game for No.4 Clemson.It might mean even more for struggling Florida State.The one-time game of the year in the Atlantic Coast Conference is now just the latest stepping stone for the Tigers (8-1, 6-1 ACC, No.4 CFP ) in their path toward the league title game and College Football Playoff.The Seminoles (3-5, 3-4), twisting through a season of injuries and underachievement , are seeking one final big splash to show they're not that far off from the powerhouse program they were projected to be when the year began."Clemson's got the hype right now.They're in the top four (in the CFP) right now," Florida State cornerback Levonta Taylor said."Just going to go out there do what we can do, play the best Florida State football we can play."And most years, that usually means problems for opponents."We'll get the very best version of Florida State this week," Clemson coach Dabo Swinney said flatly.The Tigers should at least get a version that might have some momentum.Florida State snapped a two-game losing streak with a 27-24 win over Syracuse (the only team to beat Clemson this year) a week ago.The victory didn't solve everything that's gone wrong in a season that began with Florida State projected to win the ACC and potentially play for a national title.It did, however, give the Seminoles a burst of confidence to carry into Death Valley."We'd better build on it quick, because we play a great team this week, play one of the top four teams in the country," Florida State coach Jimbo Fisher said.Clemson quarterback Kelly Bryant said he and other new offensive starters are eager to close out league play with a third straight ACC Atlantic Division, but first title with the new group on the field."Really excited for this game," Bryant said.More Florida State Seminoles news Some other things to watch for when No.4 Clemson faces Florida State: ORANGE PANTS If Clemson's playing for a title, it's wearing orange pants.It's a tradition coach Dabo Swinney saves for the most important games.The players notice, saying they feel an extra level of anticipation knowing they're playing in a game that could lead to hardware.The Tigers last wore orange pants when they defeated Alabama 35-31 to win the national championship in January."You don't just get to wear those," Clemson quarterback Kelly Bryant said."It has a special meaning to it.It means we are playing for hardware."NOVEMBER WINS Florida State has been tops in the ACC since 2010 when it comes to winning after October.The Seminoles are 33-7 in November, December and January games the past six seasons.SERIES TURN Florida State had its way with Clemson for more than 30 years, going 14-2 against the Tigers from 1970-2002.Starting with the surprise 26-10 upset in 2003 when son Tommy Bowden's Tigers dealt his father Bobby Bowden's third-ranked Seminoles a blow to their national title hopes, Clemson has won eight of the 14 matchups since including six of the last seven at Death Valley.BOWL STREAK BOOST Florida State got a boost to continuing its streak of 35 consecutive bowl games when it announced its game with Louisiana-Monroe, previously cancelled due to Hurricane Irma last September, would be played Dec. 2.That gives the Seminoles and extra chance to gain the six wins necessary to make the postseason.After Clemson, Florida State plays Delaware State and rival Florida before its rescheduled contest.Florida State has not missed a bowl since 1976.ACC ATLANTIC A Clemson win means that either the Tigers or the Seminoles have won the Atlantic Division every year since 2009.Boston College in 2008 was the last team other than Clemson or Florida State to represent the Atlantic in the title game.
Preview: Florida tries to snap 4-game losing streak with visit to South Carolina:::::TV: CBS Time: Noon COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- Florida interim coach Randy Shannon is looking for consistency from his struggling Gators.After a battering by Missouri, Shannon is anxious to see improvement at South Carolina.Shannon is coaching his second game since taking over for Jim McElwain -- McElwain and the university parted ways on Oct. 29 -- and is facing a mess on the field of historic proportions.The Gators (3-5, 3-4 Southeastern Conference) had not allowed 42 or more points in consecutive games in 100 years after a 45-16 loss to Missouri last week."We were not a football team that was consistent," Shannon said.Florida's defense gave up 455 yards of offense and six touchdowns.The offense, under former Notre Dame quarterback Malik Zaire, managed just one TD and 93 yards rushing.Shannon knows all that must improve for Florida to have success down the stretch."When you lose a game you have to be better," Shannon said."You just can't accept `Oh, we're a lot better than we were', no we're not a lot better.We're better than we've been, but guess what, you have to take that next step."That comes at South Carolina (6-3, 4-3), which is looking for its first winning league season since 2013.Muschamp, the former Florida coach, knows full well what the Gators are going through.He was let go by the university in November 2014, although he was allowed to coach out the regular season."I know it's probably taken its mental toll" on the Gators, Muschamp said of this season's turmoil in Gainesville.The Gamecocks have won three of their past four SEC games.A victory would also surpass the Gamecocks six wins from Muschamp's debut season.More Florida Gators news Some things to watch when Florida plays at South Carolina: ZAIRE STARTING Former Notre Dame quarterback Malik Zaire will start once more for the Gators.Randy Shannon elevated the graduate transfer as starter in last week's 45-16 loss to Missouri.Zaire threw for 158 yards and an interception in the defeat.Shannon said Zaire didn't "do anything to hurt us" against Missouri.TACKLE RACE South Carolina linebacker Skai Moore leads the team in tackles, a feat he's attempting to do for the fourth straight season.Only 14 players in the FBS have accomplished that feat.But Moore is just one ahead of his friend, sophomore T.J.

Japanese star Otani announces desire to move to MLB:::::OSAKA, Japan (AP) -- Highly touted Japanese pitcher-outfielder Shohei Otani announced on Saturday he wants to move to Major League Baseball next season."The other day I met with team officials and stated my intentions," Otani said at a press conference."My request was met with warm words of support so I hope to do my best in America from next year on."Otani's Japanese club, the Nippon Ham Fighters, said on Friday they will allow Otani to use the posting system this offseason, clearing the way for him to sign with a major league team next season.Otani, 23, is the reigning Pacific League MVP and was 3-2 with a 3.20 ERA this year.Despite thigh and ankle injuries, he batted .332 in 65 games with 16 doubles, eight homers and 31 RBIs.He had ankle surgery last month.He has a 42-15 record with a 2.52 ERA and 624 strikeouts in 543 innings over five seasons, and a .286 batting average with 48 homers and 166 RBIs.Because Otani has less than nine years of service time, Nippon Ham retains his rights and he must go through the posting system to leave.If MLB, the MLB Players Association and Nippon Professional Baseball agree to a deal that would extend the expired posting agreement through this offseason, the team that Otani signs with would pay the Fighters $20 million.Under MLB's labor contract, his signing bonus is restricted and remaining pool money is limited to a high of $3,535,000.Under baseball's new collective bargaining agreement, the 23-year-old Otani can only agree to a minor league contract that is subject to signing bonus pools.If added to a big league roster, he would have a salary for about the minimum $545,000 next season and not be eligible for salary arbitration until 2020 at the earliest.If he was to wait until he is 25 to enter MLB, there would be no restrictions and he likely would get a better deal.But Otani said he wanted to go now rather than wait."I am not yet a complete player yet, and I want to go to an environment where I can continue to get better," said Otani."I felt the same way when I graduated from high school.And it is my strongest reason for wanting to go now."Otani considered going straight to MLB out of high school but was convinced to sign with the Fighters as they assured him he could play the outfield as well as pitch.His injury problems this season stemmed from last year's Japan Series when he injured himself running the bases.Otani, who had ankle surgery last month and is currently undergoing rehabilitation, just completed his fifth season with the Sapporo-based Fighters.He said during Saturday's press conference that he hopes to be able to continue both batting and pitching."Just before I turned professional, I didn't imagine I would be able to do both," Otani said."But since then, the fans have encouraged it, the coaches helped me, and manager (Hideki) Kuriyama made it possible.That has left me with a strong desire, to keep doing it, not only for me, but for them.""I don't know if it will be possible, but I want to hear what teams over there say and what kind of situations might be available.Until that process has started, I can't say how it might work out."(Associated Press Writer Yuri Kageyama contributed to this report from Tokyo)

Quick turnarounds for Spurs, Bulls:::::There's never any love lost between the San Antonio Spurs and the Chicago Bulls so expect some fireworks when the two teams square off on Saturday at the AT&T Center in San Antonio for the second and final time this season.Both the Spurs, who fell 94-87 to Milwaukee, and the Bulls, 105-87 losers to Indiana, played Friday and will face a quick turnaround San Antonio committed 18 turnovers Friday against the Bucks but still had a shot in the end game to win.The Spurs missed their final five shots and got no second chances down the stretch.LaMarcus Aldridge led the Spurs (7-5) with 20 points and 12 rebounds, Ginobili scored a season-high 18 points off the bench and Patty Mills and Kyle Anderson had 14 and 10 points, respectively."We played pretty poorly for most of the game and they played better," Ginobili said."We adjusted to their defense late in the game but it was too late.It's hard to win an NBA game with 18 turnovers."San Antonio had a three-game win streak snapped."We can't turn the ball over the way we're constituted right now," Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said."Every time we have a high turnover game we are going to have problems.(Milwaukee) showed better composure than we did down the stretch -- they got some good shots and we were a little bit sloppy with too many defensive errors."San Antonio star forward Kawhi Leonard has not played a game this season due to the injury to his right leg.The Spurs have stayed afloat without Leonard, who was an MVP candidate last season, and their venerable point guard Tony Parker.Chicago never led Friday against Indiana, hit just 7 of its 27 shots from 3-point range in the defeat and lost its third straight game.Bulls coach Fred Hoiberg said his team lacked fight, and that it was evident from the opening tip."We talked (in training camp) about our rules in defensive transition and that completely went out the window tonight," Hoiberg said."Indiana scored 20 (points) in transition and it seemed like 50.We didn't get back, we hung our heads."You could see in our guys' faces that it was going to be a long night."Bobby Portis, playing his second game since returning from an eight-game suspension for punching teammate Nikola Mirotic in face in a preseason practice altercation, scored 20 points and grabbed 11 rebounds off the bench to lead Chicago (2-8) against Indiana."It's very frustrating," Portis said."But we're a young team, we're all still learning and we're trying to get better each and every day."Kris Dunn added 16 points for the Bulls, who also got 14 points from Justin Holiday and 12 from rookie Lauri Markkanen, who reached double figures for the 10th straight game.Prior to Friday's loss, Chicago president Michael Reinsdorf gave Hoiberg a vote of confidence, saying despite the Bulls' slow start that Hoiberg's efforts to get his team to play the right way "isn't going unnoticed.Right now, we're happy," Reinsdorf said."The team is playing really hard.Fred's got them playing really hard."San Antonio beat Chicago 87-77 on Oct. 21 in the Windy City in the two teams' first meeting of the season.There has not been a two-game sweep for either team since 2012-13, when the Spurs won both contests.Chicago the Bulls hasn't dropped consecutive road games to the Spurs since losing three in a row from the 2006-07 to 2008-09 seasons.

Trier scores career-high 32, No. 3 Wildcats open with rout NAU:::::TUCSON, Ariz. -- Third-ranked Arizona was short-handed for its season opener.It hardly mattered.The Wildcats still had Allonzo Trier, Deandre Ayton and plenty more talent to overwhelm Northern Arizona 101-67 on Friday night.Trier, back for his junior season, scored a career-high 32 points, making 10 of 13 shots, including both 3-point tries, and 10 of 11 free throws."He's a pre-season All-American, right?"Arizona coach Sean Miller said."That's what he was tonight."Trier scored 22 in the first 20 minutes, the highest-scoring half of his career."I decided to come out and play hard, compete, try to set the tone for my teammates," he said."Being one of the older guys, one of the leaders on this team, I just tried to take care of business."Ayton, Arizona's acclaimed 7-foot-1 freshman, had 19 points and 12 rebounds in his collegiate debut.Dusan Ristic added 20 points for the Wildcats, who shot 60 percent from the field.The Wildcats, without four players either due to discipline or injury, led by as many as 21 points in the first half.The Lumberjacks cut it to 10 in the opening minute of the second half before Arizona blew the game open.Arizona also was without two assistant coaches, most notably Book Richardson, who has been indicted on federal bribery and fraud charges and remains on the school payroll.As announced by the school earlier in the day, assistant coach Mark Phelps is serving a two-game suspension for an undisclosed NCAA violation and forward Keanu Pinder was out for one game, also due to an NCAA violation.Miller said he supported the school's statement but declined to comment further on the issue.Among players, Dylan Smith is serving a one-game suspension for a team violation.Brandon Randolph is being treated for a concussion and Rawle Alkins has a broken foot.All but Alkins could be back for the next game.Miller said Trier "has put in as much work on the game of basketball as any player that we've had.""From an offensive perspective, he takes a back seat to nobody," Miller said. "Our defense was not very good tonight, especially in the first half.The reason that we had the lead that we had was how prolific he was on offense."He said Ayton "did well" in his first game.Defensively, Miller said Ayton wasn't stopping the ball in the first half the way he usually does and the coaches talked to him about that at halftime."He was more passive in the first half," Miller said."But he was way more aggressive in the second half defensively."All three of Ayton's blocked shots came in the second half.Northern Arizona coach Jack Murphy called Ayton "unbelievable."He said he looked at the photos of the great players in Arizona's basketball history on the wall at the nearby Richard Jefferson Gymnasium "and I don't know if there is one person that compares to Ayton at this stage.""Obviously there have been some special players that have come through here, but Deandre Ayton is a special player."The Wildcats shot out to a 13-4 lead and were up 45-24 after Trier's two free throws with 4:58 to play.Trier's breakaway dunk on a turnover had Arizona up 49-29 with 2:51 to play.Northern Arizona scored the final seven of the half to cut the Wildcats' lead to 49-36.The NAU run reached 10-0 when Chris Bowling opened the second half with a 3-pointer to cut Arizona's lead to 49-39.Bowling led Northern Arizona with 11 points.BIG PICTURE Northern Arizona: The Lumberjacks got $95,000 for coming to Tucson, even though they knew they really didn't have a shot at winning.They were 9-23 last season and finished 10th in the Big Sky last year but should be at least a little better this season.Arizona: The Wildcats, still under the cloud of that FBI probe, could have the best talent yet for Miller, a group that includes a standout five-player freshman class with a blend of talented veterans.Arizona won't be tested until next week's trip to the Bahamas, where they will face North Carolina State in an eight-team tournament that includes No.6 Villanova.UP NEXT Northern Arizona hosts Embry-Riddle on Monday night on FOX Sports Arizona Plus.Arizona hosts Maryland, Baltimore County on Sunday.

Hurricanes score 50 in 2nd half to defeat Gardner-Webb:::::CORAL GABLES, Fla. (AP) -- Sophomore Bruce Brown had his second career triple-double and the third in school history to help the No.13 Miami Hurricanes win their season opener Friday night by beating Gardner-Webb 77-45.Brown, who is widely expected to turn pro after this season, totaled 10 points, 11 rebounds and 10 assists in 31 minutes.Lonnie Walker IV, Miami's most highly touted recruit under coach Jim Larranaga, came off the bench in his collegiate debut to total 10 points and five assists in 25 minutes.Miami (1-0) improved to 6-1 in openers under Larranaga.The Hurricanes have their highest ranking to start a season, but it begins under the cloud of the FBI investigation into college basketball, with Larranaga saying he was named in court documents but has done nothing wrong.Gardner-Webb (0-1) extended its losing streak against ranked teams to 10 games dating to November 2007.The Hurricanes fell behind 7-0 but took charge by scoring the first 14 points of the second half.Dewan Huell had 14 points and eight rebounds in 18 minutes.Ebuka Izundu, a 6-10 junior from Nigeria, had 14 points and 10 rebounds in 22 minutes.Brown's nifty passes included alley-oop passes to Walker and Huell for baskets.Miami won easily despite shooting only 7 for 26 from 3-point range and 10 for 21 from the free-throw line.D.J.Laster led Gardner-Webb with 10 points and eight rebounds.RUNS The Hurricanes missed two free throws and a trio of 3-pointers early before Brown scored their first points 4 minutes into the season.That started a 10-0 run, and Miami never trailed again.The score was 27-23 at halftime, and Miami went on a 24-2 run to start the second half.MISSING EARLY The Hurricanes struggled against Gardner-Webb's zone, in part because of poor shooting from the perimeter.Miami made 7 percent from 3-point range in the first half, going 1 for 13, with the only basket by Walker.BIG PICTURE Defensively the Hurricanes got their hands on the ball in the lane a lot.Their defense got ranked second in the ACC in scoring defense a year ago, but that end of the court will be the biggest challenge for Larranaga's young team.UP NEXT The Hurricanes are at home Sunday against Navy.Gardner-Webb continues a three-game swing through Florida when it plays No.8 Florida on Monday.Miami Hurricanes 77, Gardner-Webb 45
Antidoping Officials Obtain Trove of Russian Lab Data:::::This confirms the schemes and provides more definitive evidence about disappearing positives at the Moscow lab, said Richard McLaren, a Canadian lawyer whose independent investigation conducted last year illuminated the breadth and depth of the doping program.If the information provides what we think it will provide, it should confirm doping rule violations.There are already a series of cases that have been closed with the approval of WADA, and now those cases may well be reopened.The antidoping agency said in a news release that its investigators were finalizing the forensic analysis of the enormous backup file and assessing what information is relevant, asserting that they were confident in the authenticity of the information.Photo Russian officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment submitted to the governments sports ministry.The antidoping regulator seized the opportunity on Friday to restate another request: that Russia accept the findings of Mr. McLarens inquiry, which confirmed that top government officials and Russias Federal Security Service had helped with coordinated cheating.This new intelligence serves to reinforce our requirement of Russian authorities that they too publicly accept the outcomes, of last years investigation, the global antidoping agencys president, Craig Reedie, said in a statement.Through Mr. McLarens inquiry, the antidoping watchdog deconstructed Russias cheating schemes and determined that some 1,000 athletes had been tied up in them over three and a half years.Still, officials determined that many individual cases would be hard or impossible to prosecute, in part because of Russias lack of cooperation in providing certain evidence, including stored urine samples and the electronic lab records on past tests.Antidoping officials from several countries who have urged Olympic leaders to take a harder stance against Russia in the wake of Mr. McLarens investigation even calling for the nation to be barred from the Pyeongchang Games have pointed to Russias refusal to turn over the electronic data.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.The World Anti-Doping Agency had ordered Russia to share the database before the watchdog would agree to restore Russia to good standing and certify its compliance with the global antidoping code.The agency is due to evaluate Russias cooperation and decide whether to recertify the nation at a meeting next week in Seoul.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Investigators who have studied how Russia corrupted several Olympics most notably the 2014 Sochi Games, where the country controlled the antidoping laboratory and dominated the medal standings have coveted the electronic files from Moscow.Known as laboratory information management system data, the records reflect the results of lab tests run on the machines in Russias national antidoping lab, a nondescript five-story building a few miles from the Kremlin.They also reveal the identity of the athlete to whom each lab analysis corresponded.Photo Outside of international competitions, nations are responsible for drug-testing their own athletes and for reporting the results of those tests to a global database.In Russia, however, the national antidoping laboratory alerted the nations sports ministry when athletes tested positive, and they often followed a deputy sports ministers directive to falsely report positive drug tests as clean results to international authorities, according to both Mr. McLaren and the former longtime director of Russias lab, Dr. Grigory Rodchenkov.In an inquiry report published last December, Mr. McLaren said that he had uncovered records that more than 500 such incriminating tests were falsely recorded from 2011 to 2015.Well-known and elite level athletes had their initial results automatically falsified, he wrote, noting that, without access to Russias lab data and forensic analysis of it, the extent of similar discrepancies and the full scope of cheating could not possibly be known.But if the database now in the regulators possession reveals new inconsistencies in the testing histories of Russian athletes, sports officials could mount strong disciplinary cases.Without a positive drug test, it can be challenging to build a case against an athlete that will withstand a legal challenge.To date, Olympic officials have issued penalties against six Russian Olympians who competed in Sochi and have exonerated another; investigations into scores of others are continuing.Global officials from each sport have separately been asked to review allegations against hundreds of athletes.The antidoping regulator itself has agreed to close at least 95 such suspicious cases identified by Mr. McLaren based on a lack of evidence.Olympic officials are currently deliberating how to punish Russia for its state-sponsored schemes, for which no Russian government official was allowed to attend the 2016 Rio Games.The International Olympic Committee is expected to announced its decision regarding Russias participation in the 2018 Winter Games in early December.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The issue has escalated far beyond the sports world, stirring geopolitical rhetoric.President Vladimir V. Putin this week criticized the recent disciplinary decisions against Russian Olympians as an American attempt to undermine Russia and affect his nations presidential election in March.
Gymnast Aly Raisman Says She Was Molested by Team Doctor:::::Photo The American gymnast Aly Raisman said that she too had been sexually abused by the team doctor who is facing criminal charges for molesting other gymnasts.Ms. Raisman, 23, made the revelation in an interview with 60 Minutes, excerpts from which were released Friday, and in a book, Fierce, being released next week.I am angry, she said.Im really upset because I care a lot, when I see these young girls that come up to me, and they ask for pictures or autographs, whatever it is, every time I look at them, every time I see them smiling, I just think I just want to create change so that they never, ever have to go through this.Ms. Raisman was captain of the teams that won gold medals for the United States at the 2012 London and 2016 Rio Olympics.Another member of the 2012 team, McKayla Maroney, said last month that the doctor, Lawrence G. Nassar, began molesting her at age 13.Jamie Dantzscher, a 2000 Olympian, is among the other gymnasts who have accused Dr. Nassar.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Dr. Nassar is in jail in Michigan, facing 22 counts of first-degree criminal sexual conduct involving at least seven victims.This guy is a monster, Bill Schuette, the attorney general of Michigan, said in February.
N.F.L. Picks: Patriots Over Broncos; Cowboys Over Falcons:::::All of that should add up to a horrible day for the Texans (3-5).Tom Savage is not a good quarterback regardless of opponent, but with him running away from Donald and trying to throw into tight coverage, he should be especially bad.Heres the tricky thing about picking this game: 12 points is an enormous spread, even at home, and Jared Goff, while vastly improved from last season, is still inconsistent.There is not much concern that the Rams could lose, but a few garbage-time touchdowns are likely to swing the spread in favor of Houston.Pick: Texans Cowboys at Falcons, 4:25 p.m., Fox Line: Falcons by 3 Atlantas season can be summed up in one play from last week: Matt Ryan throwing a perfect 40-yard pass to a wide-open Julio Jones in the end zone, and Jones simply dropping the ball.It was such a painful and shocking turn of events the play came on fourth down with the Falcons (4-4) trailing by 10 points that Kurt Coleman, a defensive back for the Panthers, walked over to console Jones.Such is life for Atlanta a year after a magical run to the Super Bowl ended with a brutal collapse.There is some intrigue in this game still, as neither team knows if Ezekiel Elliott will be allowed to play, but with the recent improvement the Cowboys (5-3) have shown on both sides of the ball, Dallas should be in line for a road win regardless of what happens in Thursdays court hearing.Pick: Cowboys Patriots at Broncos, 8:30 p.m., NBC Line: Patriots by 7.5 Before anyone gets too excited about the Patriots (6-2) drastically cutting down the number of passing yards the team allowed in its last two games, it is worth noting that they gave up an average of 138.5 rushing yards a game in the two wins.New Englands defense might just not have that higher gear, but it is not as if the Broncos (3-5) and Brock Osweiler present much of a challenge.Add in C. J. Anderson working his way through an ankle injury and Denver does not seem to have the personnel to keep up with New England, no matter how bad the Patriots defense is.Pick: Patriots Vikings at Redskins, 1 p.m., Fox Line: Vikings by 1 The error margin for Case Keenum has been reduced to zero.If Keenum, a career backup, wants to remain at starting quarterback for the Vikings (6-2), he will need to keep winning.Teddy Bridgewater has been cleared to play, and unless his knee injury has turned him into an entirely different quarterback, he represents an enormous upgrade for Minnesota.With that in mind, the Redskins (4-4) could be a problem for Keenum because they are far more talented than their 4-4 record indicates.Their four losses have come against the Eagles (twice), the Chiefs (when that team looked unbeatable) and the Cowboys.Last weeks win over Seattle showed that they are resilient and that Kirk Cousins continues to be fearless.Taking too many chances against Minnesotas secondary could be dangerous, but a Redskins win, and Bridgewaters return to the field a week later, seem well within the realm of possibilities.Pick: Redskins Second-Tier Games Photo Saints at Bills, 1 p.m., Fox Line: Saints by 2.5 The Saints (6-2) are a passing team that loves playing indoors, so a trip to Buffalo on a chilly Sunday afternoon should present an interesting test.A huge factor in how they fare, though, will come in which version of the Bills (5-3) shows up.Two weeks ago, Buffalo looked great and easily beat the Raiders, but last week, they were hardly competitive against the Jets, allowing 194 rushing yards and three rushing touchdowns.It is that rushing success by the Jets that the Saints may want to pay attention to: In Mark Ingram and Alvin Kamara, they have the running backs to exploit the same weakness.Another win would be seven in a row for New Orleans.More important, it would improve the teams road record to 4-1.Pick: Saints Steelers at Colts, 1 p.m., CBS Line: Steelers by 10.5 The Steelers (6-2) have settled into a groove.Their defense shuts things down, keeping the score nice and low, and their offense, despite the presence of three of the N.F.L.s biggest stars, does just enough to win.Whether it is the aging of Ben Roethlisberger, tension among players or their opponents adjusting to a unit that has been together for several seasons, they just dont run up the score the way they used to.Going on the road against the Colts (3-6) does not present a true upset opportunity: The Steelers are extremely likely to win, but a spread of 10.5 points seems high considering Pittsburghs track record.Pick: Colts Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Seahawks at Cardinals, 8:25 p.m. (Thursday), NBC Line: Seahawks by 6 The Seahawks (5-3) are one game removed from a four-game winning streak, but the defense has taken a huge step back in the last few weeks: Both the Texans and the Redskins showed no fear in throwing directly into Seattles secondary.Injuries are a factor, with Earl Thomas out and Richard Sherman playing through injuries, but it is still shocking to see teams have so much success throwing the ball against them.Drew Stanton of the Cardinals (4-4) is not an aggressive passer like Deshaun Watson or Kirk Cousins, so the same level of exploitation should not be expected.Arizona will probably try to make up for that by running early and often with the veteran back Adrian Peterson, and while he has performed well since coming over from New Orleans, he may not find as much room to run this week.Thursday games are messy, but Seattle has had success in Arizona, and if it wants to avoid falling way behind the Rams in the N.F.C.West, this game needs to be something of a statement.Pick: Seahawks Advertisement Continue reading the main story Chargers at Jaguars, 1 p.m., CBS Line: Jaguars by 4 The Jaguars (5-3) had a nearly perfect defense with one glaring flaw: It could not stop the run.A trade for Marcell Dareus, a run-stopping defensive tackle who was a known quantity to Coach Doug Marrone, may not deserve all the credit for last weeks effort (29 rushing yards allowed), but if he has whipped the unit into shape, Jacksonville will be hard to score upon.The Chargers (3-5) are an interesting test for that theory, as Melvin Gordon, their star running back, is the type of player who would have torched the Jaguars in previous weeks.If Dareus stops him, then Jacksonvilles run of losing in even-numbered weeks of the season may finally end.On offense, the Jaguars should get a nice boost from Leonard Fournette, who showed up to practice on time during the week, which will get him back on the field after he was held out for a violation of team rules.Pick: Jaguars Browns at Lions, 1 p.m., CBS Line: Lions by 12.5 The Lions (4-4) may not look like a playoff contender, with a .500 record and several frustrating losses, but they have been considerably better than their record, and last weeks win at Green Bay opened the door for them to go on a winning streak ahead of their Week 12 showdown with division-leading Minnesota.The Browns (0-8) are a speed bump on that path.Detroit will probably not cover the 12.5-point spread, but if it cares about its playoff hopes it will win the game.Pick: Browns Bottom-Tier Games Photo Jets at Buccaneers, 1 p.m., CBS Line: Jets by 2.5 With Jameis Winston having been shut down for at least two weeks, the Buccaneers (2-6) will turn to Ryan Fitzpatrick at quarterback.It is a downgrade from Winston at full strength, but probably an upgrade from the way Winston had played since injuring his shoulder.Add the revenge factor of Fitzpatricks playing against the Jets (4-5), who discarded him a season after he set the franchise single-season record for passing touchdowns, and this could turn into a mild upset.Pick: Buccaneers Packers at Bears, 1 p.m., Fox Line: Bears by 5 The statistics for Mitchell Trubisky are not that much better than those for Brett Hundley, but the difference between them is that Trubisky, the rookie quarterback for the Bears (3-5), is trying to overcome his subpar wide receivers, while Hundley, a third-year backup for the Packers (4-4), has teammates on offense that made Green Bay a Super Bowl contender until Hundley replaced the injured Aaron Rodgers.Hundleys lack of production has partially been a result of an ultraconservative game plan, but an opportunistic Bears defense may make him pay if he tries to be aggressive in his third career start.Pick: Bears Bengals at Titans, 1 p.m., Fox Line: Titans by 4.5 The Bengals (3-5) got a huge boost for this matchup when the N.F.L.chose not to suspend A. J.Green over his fight during a loss to Jacksonville last week.His presence gives Cincinnati enough offense to compete, and while the Titans (5-3) have won back-to-back games, they have put little distance between themselves and their lowly opponents (Baltimore and Cleveland).This will probably be another close game.Pick: Bengals Giants at 49ers, 4:25 p.m., Fox Line: Giants by 1 With how poorly the 49ers (0-9) have played in almost every facet of the game, having a reason for optimism is a welcome change.Quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo, acquired in a recent trade with New England, represents that optimism, but San Francisco has yet to make any commitment about when, or if, he will play.If the young and talent-deprived team insists on sticking with C. J. Beathard for another week, the Giants (1-7) are destined for their second win.Pick: Giants Mondays Matchup Dolphins at Panthers, 8:30 p.m., ESPN Line: Panthers by 9 For a second consecutive week, a prime-time audience will be forced to endure the atrocious offense of the Dolphins (4-4).It was supposed to be a breakout season for Miami, with quarterback Ryan Tannehill leading several star-level wide receivers and a young Pro Bowler at running back in Jay Ajayi.Instead, Tannehill is out for the season, Ajayi was traded to Philadelphia and the Dolphins wide receivers are left shuffling along for a team that often struggles to score in double digits.The Panthers (6-3) are inconsistent and frustrating, but their defense may look to prove a point by making this game a laugher.Pick: Panthers.
Canadian Filmmakers Get a View of North Korea Through Hockey:::::To break the ice with the athletes during the first days of filming, the crew played the Canadian card.I think from a hockey standpoint, they were very interested in us being Canadians, Edwards said.I think they were a little more disappointed that my entire production team couldnt skate.But Hahm, a competitive recreation hockey player, could skate and was critical to building rapport.Aside from being able to speak Korean, he often practiced with the Taesongsan team, making suggestions to the coach and players.In a game during the crews first trip, the Taesongsan coach presented Hahm with a jersey and an offer to sit with the team during the game, though Hahm did not play because of Korean Ice Hockey Association rules.For the rest of the crew, trust and relationships were built on consistency and gestures.Edwards made a point of learning each players name; in turn they remembered his.While shooting interviews, members of the crew were cognizant of their subjects skepticism.Advertisement Continue reading the main story We spent lots of conversations just sort of talking about, how do we frame these questions?Edwards said.How do we try to show and prove to them that we mean well and were not going to like rip them off or show them in a bad light?Every morning after breakfast, the crew made the five-minute trek from its downtown hotel to the arena.Many competitors in ice sports like speed skating, figure skating and hockey have the arena on a given day.The schedule is planned to the minute, Edwards said.Photo Sharing the facility is efficient, but not conducive to ideal hockey practice.The ice is worn from overuse, and divots courtesy of the figure skaters are visible throughout the rink.The glass is scratched, and the boards lack compression.The hockey play is also behind the times.It was a very conservative, traditional style of play, Hahm, 29, said.You can tell there was a sense of real lack of creativity when it comes to formulating plays.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.According to the filmmakers, North Korean teams still abide by the training materials and methodologies passed on from the Soviet Union in the 1950s.While South Koreas hockey program has evolved in recent years, qualifying for the 2018 Winter Olympics as the host country, North Koreas has remained stagnant.The lack of outside exposure and information sharing televised N.H.L.games, foreign-exchange skills clinics and access to the internet has significantly impeded the progress.The vast majority of the team comes from the countryside, and they are recruited as kids 12, 13 years old, based on who has athletic talent in those small villages or towns, Reichel said.Most of the teams equipment is used and is donated by the International Ice Hockey Federation, which is based in Zurich.The film crew tried to help, contributing tape and new composite graphite hockey sticks.We wanted them to feel they were on equal levels of playing, Hahm said.What the North Korean players lack in knowledge, gear and size (no one on the national team is over six feet tall), they try to make up for through discipline and heart.Advertisement Continue reading the main story You must rise higher and faster because if you are running, the opposite player is flying, and in order to catch up them, you need to train harder, Hong Chun-rim, a star forward, said through an interpreter in Closing the Gap.The filmmakers shadowed the Taesongsan team for 11 days during their first trip in November.When they returned to film last spring for three weeks, they focused on the 20-man national team, which was training for and competing in the I.I.H.F.world championship in Auckland, New Zealand.
To Dodge Jerry Jones, Other Owners Speed Up Roger Goodells Contract:::::People familiar with the contract negotiations, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they involve internal league matters, said the package was 80 percent to 90 percent completed, with only a handful of minor details yet to be finished.As a nonvoting member of the compensation committee, Jones, though, continued to lobby the committee working on the pay package.Last week, The New York Times reported that he told the six owners on the committee that he had hired the lawyer David Boies and was prepared to take legal action against them and the league if they did not change Goodells deal.Jones has insisted that Goodells deal needs to be restructured to account for the poor way he has navigated the league through recent turmoil, and that more of his pay should be performance-based bonuses.After Jones threatened to sue the members of the committee which includes the owners of the Chiefs, the Falcons, the Giants, the Patriots, the Steelers and the Texans he was removed as a nonvoting member.Photo Jones was fully aware of, and in agreement with, the committees efforts to restructure the contract, according to people familiar with the committees work.On Aug. 9, Goodell traveled from his summer home in Maine to New York to meet with the compensation committee at Patroon, a restaurant a few blocks from the leagues headquarters in Midtown Manhattan.The mood was comfortable.Two of the owners, Robert K. Kraft of the New England Patriots and Arthur Blank of the Atlanta Falcons, joked about how, when they walked to the restaurant together, fans had stopped them to say they were surprised that they were together after their teams faced off in the Super Bowl in February.In a private room, the owners discussed the structure of Goodells new deal and some of the finer points the commissioner wanted added.Jones was not in New York, but was listening on a speaker phone.We got to a good place that night, one person involved in the dinner said.Jerry was on board with all of it.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Two days later, everything changed when Goodell suspended the Cowboys star running back, Ezekiel Elliott, for six games based on an accusation of domestic violence by his former girlfriend.In addition to railing against the decision and questioning the way the commissioner and his staff handled the investigation, Jones began to lobby the compensation committee and other owners to pause and alter Goodells new pay deal.Advertisement Continue reading the main story On his radio show on Friday, Jones denied that his effort to block the contract extension had anything to do with Elliott, saying it was all about Goodells performance lately.In October, when all 32 owners met in New York, Blank, the chairman of the committee, briefed them on the structure of the deal.There was little opposition.But several weeks ago, Jones held a conference call with more than a dozen owners not on the compensation committee to discuss Goodells extension.When that failed to turn the tide against the extension, Jones spoke on a conference call last week with the compensation committee and threatened to take legal action.Stunned, the committee took the extraordinary step of removing Jones from the committee, and lawyers have since handled communication between the committee and Jones.Joness threat now appears to have galvanized the committee and Goodell to conclude the last few items in the new contract.Goodell is currently paid around $30 million a year, including a set of rolling bonuses that in effect make most of his compensation guaranteed.In his new package, Goodell would receive roughly the same amount, but only if certain performance targets were met.After the owners voted unanimously in May to extend Goodells contract for five more years, the compensation committee created a new structure in which 88 percent of the commissioners compensation would be based on an array of metrics tied to the leagues financial performance.Many of those metrics would be overseen by other owners on other committees, broadening the number of people who would decide how much the commissioner would make.Goodell, who has sought to defuse the controversy over players protesting racism by kneeling during the national anthem, has devoted more time in recent days to working out the final details so this controversy, too, might subside.
On the Table, the Brain Appeared Normal:::::They expected a normal brain because of the mans age.I didnt equate his behavior with the disease, the neuropathologist said.I just thought thats who he was.On the table, the brain appeared healthy.The meninges, the layers of translucent membranes that coat and protect the brain, still enveloped it.The brain had a healthy sheen.Photo The brain was sliced into sheaths, maybe a half-inch at a time, starting at the front.That was where the first inkling came that this was not just another 27-year-old brain.Even to the naked eye, the cross sections had substantial gaps in the tissues fluid-filled ventricles that expanded as the brain tissue itself shrank.A cross section of a healthy 27-year-old brain looks robust, fleshy.This one was hollowed by boomerang-shaped caverns.The reason the skull grows is to make room for the growing brain, the neuropathologist explained.Everything is packed really tightly.Nature doesnt leave any gaps.The septum pellucidum, a small membrane between the two halves of the brain, was atrophied to the point that it looked withered and fragile, even perforated.When the neuropathologist later went to look for others in a similar condition, the youngest comparable example was a 46-year-old boxer.The fornix, a C-shaped bundle of nerves, was similarly deteriorated, stripped of its relative heft.The hippocampus, too.Even some of the most famously diseased brains that the neuropathologist had explored, from men who had died decades later, did not have such obvious signs of destruction when examined by the naked eye.But only under a microscope could the disease be diagnosed with certainty.Wafer-like tissues were immunostained, using antibodies designed to discolor a specific protein in this case, tau, which clumps and spreads, killing brain cells.That is where the full scope of the damage was apparent.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Tau, stained brown, appeared like bursts of fireworks in the frontal cortex, the part of the brain that controls decision making, impulse and inhibition.The neuropathologist could see it spreading through the brain.It was in the amygdala, the part of the brain that regulates emotions like fear and anxiety, and the temporal lobe.She spotted a perfect demonstration of lesions around the tiny blood vessels, a telltale sign.She found previous microhemorrhages and astrocytic scarring around the ventricles.She declared the case Stage 3 on her own scale of severity, which goes from 1 to 4.It was the most damage she had seen in anyone that age.Among the hundreds of other brains she had examined and graded, the median age of a Stage 3 brain from his profession was 67.Now she had one that was only 27.What made the brain extraordinary, for the purpose of science, was not just the extent of the damage, but its singular cause.Most brains with that kind of damage have sustained a lifetime of other problems, too, from strokes to other diseases, like Alzheimers.Their samples are muddled, and not everything found can be connected to one particular disease.Photo This one looked as if it had been lifted from the pages of a textbook devoted to just one disease.Its rare for us to get a brain of a person this young in such good shape, the neuropathologist said.It is a classic case.And it tells us a lot about the disease.The brain is no longer a brain, in function or form, because it has been sliced into pieces.Those pieces have been numbered, archived and stored.Scientists still study it, probably will for years, because it is such a perfect, fascinating specimen.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.The neuropathologist and her closest associates kept this all to themselves for months, though, until the mans family agreed to let the results go public.In September, the news came out and the headlines returned, but the neuropathologist did no interviews.She released only a short statement confirming the results of the examination.I didnt want to contribute to the sensationalism, she said.But science cannot advance without the cumulative power of research, which was why she was in a university ballroom on Thursday, in front of more than 150 neurologists, pathologists and other scientists.She stood in the dark and put a PowerPoint presentation on the screen, several dozen slides of images showing an immensely atrophied young brain, the mind of a former star in his field who was also a convicted murderer.He had beautiful pathology, if you can call it beautiful, the neuropathologist had said earlier.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The particulars of the damage that the neuropathologist detailed the tangled tau proteins, the battered frontal cortex, the shrunken tissues and the enlarged ventricles have long become familiar to those paying attention to brain science.They are the things that threaten the long-term future of the industry in which the man worked.This is where his job faces the most scrutiny under the microscope in darkened labs and in the scientific presentations at academic conferences.Its scientifically interesting, the neuropathologist said.To me, its a fascinating brain.
Jerry Jones Doubles Down on Threats Over Goodells Compensation:::::In the letter, which repeatedly criticized the committee chairman, the Atlanta Falcons owner Arthur Blank, Jones demanded that all owners, not just the committee members, vote on the pay package.The Cowboys lawyer, Jason Cohen, wrote that Jones did not want to resort to legal action, but said it might be necessary to stop the committees work.Accordingly, Jerry Jones will continue to exercise his right to protect himself and the owners from the Committee Chairmans undertaking of a substantial financial commitment on behalf of the NFL without the owners vote, Cohen wrote.A letter written on behalf of the compensation committee, which includes Blank as well as the owners of the Chiefs, Giants, Patriots, Steelers and Texans, brushed aside Joness claims and said his call for a full vote on the details of the contract was contrary to the Leagues operation practices.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Indeed, your description of the proposed extension is so at odds with the actual facts that we can only conclude that you are either uninformed or seek deliberately to mislead the other owners, stated the letter, which was sent Thursday.Goodells contract extension, which has been in the works for about six months, has turned into an embarrassing proxy in the dispute between Jones and Goodell.Many other owners agree with Jones that Goodell has an inordinate amount of sway on league matters.Typically, issues like the commissioners contract are finalized quietly.But Joness increasingly strident opposition to Elliotts suspension, as well as Goodells handling of the protests by players who have refused to stand for the national anthem, has spilled into an open battle at a time when the league is grappling with even larger problems, including a decline in television ratings and growing concerns over the safety of the game.Goodell has tried to sidestep questions about his extension, mostly saying that he will continue to work at the behest of the owners and in the interest of the league.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Joe Lockhart, a league spokesman, told reporters on Thursday that all 32 owners voted in May to extend Goodells contract and that he expected discussions on the extension to be wrapped up soon.He denied reports that Goodell was furious about how the contract talks have become the focus of the dispute.He said was unaware of any lawsuit being filed by Jones against the league.Asked if he expected a lawsuit to be filed, Lockhart said: Thats a question that should be put to Mr. Jones.
Yuzuru Hanyu Withdraws From Key Skating Event After Injury:::::Photo OSAKA, Japan Yuzuru Hanyus name was called at practice on Friday morning, and his music, Chopins Ballade No.1, began playing over the public address system.There was only one problem.Hanyu, of Japan, the reigning mens Olympic figure skating champion and the sports biggest star, was nowhere to be seen.On Thursday at training, Hanyu had sustained ligament damage to his right ankle during an awkward landing of a four-revolution jump.On Friday night, he was scheduled to compete in an important pre-Olympic competition, the NHK Trophy.But little seems to happen without drama and a sense of crisis in figure skating.Word spread early Friday that Hanyu, 22, would try to practice in the morning.If his ankle felt stable, he would compete in the evening.His fans, who follow him obsessively, began to gather hours ahead of the short program.Ina Oprisi, the manager of a medical equipment company, had traveled all the way from Romania, even with a ticket only to an exhibition performance on Sunday.Im checking my watch every five minutes for updates on Hanyus condition, she said.Japanese reporters and photographers staked out the entrances to Osaka Municipal Central Gymnasium.The waiting was futile.Hanyu did not show up.He was receiving medical treatment, the Japanese Skating Federation said.He still hoped to compete in the evening.Anticipation reached a fever pitch.Advertisement Continue reading the main story And then the answer came: Hanyu had withdrawn.No details were given about the severity of the ligament damage, which occurred when Hanyu essentially did a split while trying to land a quad Lutz.Later in the afternoon, Hanyu issued a statement, saying, I am very sorry to have everyone worried.His doctors had decided that he should not participate, he wrote.He would aim for the Japanese national championships, to be held just before Christmas.Even if he did not compete then, Japanese reporters said, the skating federations rules contain an exception that would permit Hanyu to compete at the 2018 Winter Games in February in Pyeongchang, South Korea.
CoCo Vandeweghe Leads the U.S. Team in the Fed Cup Final:::::Vandeweghe was speaking from Minsk, Belarus, where she and her American teammates Sloane Stephens, Shelby Rogers and Alison Riske will take on the Belarusians in the final of the Fed Cup this weekend.It is the first Fed Cup final for the United States since a loss to Italy in 2010.The United States has 17 titles, more than any other team, since the competition began in 1963, but has not won the Fed Cup since Monica Seles, Lindsay Davenport, Jennifer Capriati and Lisa Raymond beat Spain in 2000, when Vandeweghe was 8.The Americans, who toppled the three-time defending champion Czech Republic, 3-2, in the semifinals, are heavily favored against a Belarusian team that has no player ranked in the top 75.With the two-time Australian Open champion Victoria Azarenka home in California and unable to travel because of a custody battle over her 11-month-old son, Belarus is counting on No.78 Aryna Sabalenka and No.87 Aliaksandra Sasnovich.Sabalenka, 19, has had an admirable autumn, reaching the semifinals in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, in September and then losing to Maria Sharapova in the final of the Tianjin Open last month.Sasnovich has not lost a match in the Fed Cup this year, leading Belarus to upset victories over the Netherlands and Switzerland en route to the final.Sabalenka and Sasnovich are from Minsk and the team is playing its third consecutive tie in what will be a full and highly partisan arena.Believe me, we are not underestimating this team, said the first-year American Fed Cup captain Kathy Rinaldi, who, along with Raymond, a coach, prepared the squad for deafening, boisterous fan behavior.These girls are extremely talented and moving up the rankings quickly.And theyre fearless.Photo The task of choosing a team did not fall easily on Rinaldis shoulders.Serena Williams is on maternity leave; Venus Williams opted not to play Fed Cup this year; and Stephens and Madison Keys were injured earlier this season.So Rinaldi relied on Vandeweghe, Riske, Rogers, Lauren Davis and Bethanie Mattek-Sands to get past Germany and the Czech Republic.Citing continuing wrist problems, Keys withdrew from all tournaments after she reached the United States Open final.Mattek-Sands, who won the deciding doubles match over the Czechs with Vandeweghe in April, is still recovering from a ruptured patella tendon sustained at Wimbledon in July.She had planned to cheer on the team in Belarus but recently had varicose vein surgery that prevented her from flying.Advertisement Continue reading the main story I still feel very much a part of this team, Mattek-Sands said from her home in Scottsdale, Ariz.

Rangers Beat Edmonton for a 6th Straight Win:::::Nash scored what turned out to be the game winner when defenseman Brady Skjei found him darting toward the back post at 18 minutes 53 seconds of the second period.McDonagh also assisted on the play.We kind of talked about that play before the game, and we knew theres going to be a chance it would be open, Nash said of his power-play goal against Oilers goaltender Cam Talbot.Brady and I talked about it, and he made a great pass.You just try to build a wall with your skates and your sticks, and you hope it hits something.When you get a goalie like Cam, we know him pretty well.He challenges hard.He leaves that backdoor play open.New York had jumped in front, 1-0, when Nash and Kevin Hayes completed an odd-man rush at 12:16 of the first period.Zuccarello also assisted on the play.I just look to see what stick the defenseman has.When its a lefty on lefty, you just wait for him to move his stick, Hayes said of the two-on-one opportunity.You just got to wait out the goalie, then make your decision from there.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Puljujarvi, playing in his first game of the season since being called up Friday from the A.H.L., tied the game with a wrist shot at 16:26 of the first period.Skjei and Buchnevich each had difficulty clearing the puck from the defensive zone, and eventually Ryan Nugent-Hopkins controlled it.He delivered a soft backhanded pass to Puljujarvi before the wrist shot.Darnell Nurse also assisted on the play.McDavid added a power-play goal in the middle period, extending his point streak to three games.They were able to get two quick ones on the power play, Oilers coach Todd McLellan said.They do such a good job in the neutral zone of clogging things up that its hard to come back against them.Buchnevich scored for the third time in three games when Shattenkirk delivered a cross-ice pass to set up the one-timer at 15:10 of the second period.Since Oct. 26, Buchnevich has the N.H.L.in goals, with seven.Michael Grabner added an empty-net goal with 1.4 seconds remaining.Talbot made 30 saves for Edmonton.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The Rangers, who had a disappointing 3-7-2 start this season, can look to a third-period rally on Oct. 31 against the expansion Vegas Golden Knights as a turning point in their season.The Rangers trailed, 4-2, at the end of the second period and scored four unanswered goals to begin their winning streak.The things we want to do have stayed the same, Rangers Coach Alain Vigneault said.Theres no doubt that were executing better.With that execution, it doesnt lead to costly mistakes, and weve been able to build off that the last few games and play, for the most part, pretty good hockey.There was a scary moment at 3:24 of the second period, when Edmontons Zack Kassian and the Rangers Jimmy Vesey got tangled up.As both fell to the ground, Kassians skate clipped Vesey in the mouth.Vesey returned with full cage to start third period.
Indoors, Who Is the Greatest Mens Tennis Player?:::::But the year-end championship has been back under cover since 2005.Federer, best able to express his manifold gifts on faster surfaces, has nonetheless been eclipsed at the O2 Arena by Novak Djokovic, who won four straight titles from 2012 to 2015, beating Federer in two of those finals in straight sets.Djokovic is an underrated player indoors but not an underrated player on hard courts, which are now the indoor surface of choice.But even if Djokovic leads Federer, 5-4, in indoor matches, Federer still holds the overall edge.His career indoor record of 269-64 and winning percentage of 80.8 are superior to Djokovic, who is at 135-37 (78.5 percent).Photo Those career records are not quite complete, however, because they do not include indoor matches played at the Grand Slam tournaments.All of the slams, except the French Open, now have stadiums with retractable roofs that can be closed in inclement weather.But with or without the Grand Slam factor, the career indoor records from this era do not quite match up with those of the best players earlier in the Open era like John McEnroe and Ivan Lendl.They played more often indoors then.There were 19 indoor events in the first year of the ATP Tour in 1990.That was down to 15 this year.Consider that Jimmy Connors won 53 career indoor titles and McEnroe won 52.Federer has won 23, Djokovic just 12.The playing conditions then were also generally much quicker.Indoor tennis was totally different, said Brad Gilbert, a coach and ESPN analyst whose playing career lasted from 1982 to 1995.I do think the slower indoor courts today give everybody more of a chance.Federer, with his precise serve and knack for blocking huge serves back into play, presumably would have been a health hazard in that era, too.Photo Lendl was 341-70: a winning percentage of 83, which ranks second in the Open era indoors.McEnroe was 419-72: a winning percentage of 85.3, which ranks first by a significant margin, and he won five WCT Finals, which were the prestigious culmination of the WCT circuit, a rival of the traditional tour.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The only other men with an Open era winning percentage over 80 percent indoors in singles are Connors at 82 percent (469-103), Federer and Bjorn Borg at 80.6 percent (216-52).Boris Becker, a tremendous indoor player, is next and close at 79.8 percent (297-75).And then there is Pete Sampras, whose five-set victory over Becker in Hanover, Germany, in the 1996 ATP final is the best indoor match this correspondent has seen in person.Sampras was 213-61 (77.7 percent) and won five year-end championships.As in the GOAT debate, it is easier to compare and contrast indoor play in the Open era, when the major events were open to all instead of only to amateurs.But champions like Jack Kramer who turned professional before 1968 had ample opportunity to play indoors.As they barnstormed, they often played in a new city each night, traveling with a canvas court that could be rolled out and then rolled up and moved to the next venue.They could put it down on wood or cement, they even put it on ice a few times, Rod Laver said in an interview.In Madison Square Garden, when hockey season was on, theyd roll it out the day before, and your ankles were pretty much frozen by the time you came off court.

Oddities, Good and Bad, Abound at the Next Gen ATP Finals:::::The first model selected hiked up her dress and pulled her garter to reveal the letter A.Another instructed a player to remove her glove with his teeth.The tennis world quickly expressed its disapproval at the crass sexualization of the event.The Hall of Famer Amlie Mauresmo called it a disgrace, while the French player Aliz Cornet mocked the regressive start to a showcase of innovations.Good job ATPWorldTour, Cornet wrote on Twitter.Supposed to be a futurist event right?#backtozero.The draw ceremony was co-produced by the ATP and a sponsor, Red Bull.They issued a joint apology Monday.The intention was to integrate Milans rich heritage as one of the fashion capitals in the world, the statement said.However, our execution of the proceedings was in poor taste and unacceptable.We deeply regret this and will ensure that there is no repeat of anything like it in the future.Photo The tour had expected strong reactions to the events rules changes, not the opening ceremony.The young players tested numerous innovations that have been discussed in tennis.Most of the ideas had been tried before, but not since the creation of World TeamTennis in the 1970s have so many new concepts been used all at once.The most popular has been automated line calling.Instead of relying on human line judges whose calls can be challenged and reviewed with Hawk-Eye technology, the event puts the calls in Hawk-Eyes hands directly.As soon as a ball lands out, there is an immediate audio recording of Out!played, and the word flashes on screens around the court.There has been little arguing and second-guessing of calls.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Besides no line judges, there are also fewer lines: Because it is a singles-only tournament, the court was painted without doubles alleys, which are a standard feature on most courts in the world.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The scoring system is perhaps the sharpest deviation.Instead of playing best-of-three sets, in which it takes six games to win a set and in which sets must be won by two games, the matches in Milan have been best-of-five sets, but the sets have been shorter.Sets are played to only four games, with a tiebreaker played at 3-3.Each game has no-ad scoring, meaning that at 40-40 the next point decides the game.The points themselves are also different: There is no let call on serves, which several players said was hard to get used to.Though the changes were designed to create more momentum swings in a match, many sets have been uncompetitive.So far, 24 of the 57 total sets (42.1 percent) have been won by scores of 4-0 or 4-1.Because tiebreakers remain normal length, they can feel laborious compared with the quick pace of the abbreviated set.Several other changes have been instituted to expedite play: Between points, there is a 25-second clock; players are limited to one medical timeout per match; and warm-ups are shorter, with play beginning five minutes after players walk onto the court.Its not just reducing time because if a product is boring for six hours then it can be boring for six minutes, Chris Kermode, executive chairman and president of the ATP, told reporters in Milan.Its about taking away the dead time, making more points matter.The pauses that remain in the match have been layered with entertainment.Between sets, players can talk to their coaches on headsets (but only in English, and the conversations are broadcast).On-court coaching has been a feature of WTA matches since 2009, but the headset version seems to have advantages: The audio is clearer, especially on the players side, and keeping the coach in the stands maintains tenniss appearance as a one-on-one sport.On Thursday, the headset provided Denis Shapovalov of Canada an opportunity to gush to his coach, Martin Laurendeau, about how much he enjoys the coffee in Milan.Dude, Im telling you: best coffee Ive ever had in my life, he said.Some of these innovations may come to official events soon.No-ad scoring is often used in doubles and mixed doubles.The United States Open experimented with a 25-second clock between points and with coaching from the stands in some events this year.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The big changes best-of-five, first-to-four, is that going to happen in the next five years?Kermode said.No chance, in my opinion.Can it happen in 10 years?Yeah, I think it could.
When He Needs Advice, a Philadelphia Flyer Turns to His Brother the Dancer:::::From a really young age, I always kind of had the mind-set of just doing my own thing even though everybody else was really into hockey, he said.My family especially is very hockey heavy.Ever since I was little, especially when I was younger, my dad really encouraged me to play.I liked it, but I never really loved it.I was just influenced by what I wanted.Taylors hockey and Keatons dancing made for a hectic home life, an endless effort to deliver the two boys to games, tournaments, practices and recitals.On one particularly hectic day, Cindy Leier said she attended a dance competition with Keaton in Edmonton, Alberta, before having to rush back home to Saskatoon, a drive of more than 300 miles, to attend Taylors hockey awards banquet.During the long drive home, she received word that Keaton had received the competitions top accolade, an honor that included a trip to a Los Angeles dance studio.Honestly, I look back at our life sometimes and it just feels like a blur, Cindy Leier said.It goes by so fast and they were so busy all the time.Despite their divergent paths, the brothers remained close.When Taylor left home at 17 to play junior hockey with the Portland Winterhawks in Oregon, he was unknowingly establishing a precedent for his brother, who at 17 left home to train at the Royal Winnipeg Ballet School.Photo The parallels between the brothers endeavors were quickly appreciated by their mother.They experience the same emotions: the mental challenge of what they are both doing and also the physical challenge, she said.Sometimes with the mental challenge Ill say to Keaton: Why dont you call your brother?Hes been through this.Even though hes doing something completely opposite of what youre doing, hell understand what youre going through right now.That has been helpful for Keaton.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Those conversations proved invaluable for the brothers whenever they encountered inevitable career disappointments, whether it was being assigned to the Flyers minor league affiliate or being relegated to the second company at the Houston Ballet.But the benefits of having a brother at the highest level of his chosen field do not end there.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.The brothers also occasionally work out together, although their areas of concentration in the gym often contrast drastically.When Taylor encounters the occasional tweaks and pulls that come over the course of a lengthy hockey season, it helps to have a brother capable of resting his legs at a 180-degree angle.I know sometimes hell text me and say: My hip is really bothering me.Do you know any stretches or exercises I can use to fix it?Usually I can give him some sort of help, Keaton said.Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesnt.With his parents looking forward to their next opportunity to watch Taylor play for the Flyers, Keaton has been busy earmarking dates to go to Philadelphia and watch his older brother play.But it is not easy.His arduous schedule with the Atlanta Ballet will continue through December, when the company begins performing The Nutcracker.Afforded a holiday break by the N.H.L.schedule, Taylor will be there with his parents to watch his brother perform.Weve been working and weve been grinding, he said.Our family has a lot of versatility and our parents get to experience two different professions, which is pretty cool.

To Dodge Jerry Jones, Other Owners Speed Up Roger Goodells Contract:::::People familiar with the contract negotiations, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they involve internal league matters, said the package was 80 percent to 90 percent completed, with only a handful of minor details yet to be finished.As a nonvoting member of the compensation committee, Jones, though, continued to lobby the committee working on the pay package.Last week, The New York Times reported that he told the six owners on the committee that he had hired the lawyer David Boies and was prepared to take legal action against them and the league if they did not change Goodells deal.Jones has insisted that Goodells deal needs to be restructured to account for the poor way he has navigated the league through recent turmoil, and that more of his pay should be performance-based bonuses.After Jones threatened to sue the members of the committee which includes the owners of the Chiefs, the Falcons, the Giants, the Patriots, the Steelers and the Texans he was removed as a nonvoting member.Photo Jones was fully aware of, and in agreement with, the committees efforts to restructure the contract, according to people familiar with the committees work.On Aug. 9, Goodell traveled from his summer home in Maine to New York to meet with the compensation committee at Patroon, a restaurant a few blocks from the leagues headquarters in Midtown Manhattan.The mood was comfortable.Two of the owners, Robert K. Kraft of the New England Patriots and Arthur Blank of the Atlanta Falcons, joked about how, when they walked to the restaurant together, fans had stopped them to say they were surprised that they were together after their teams faced off in the Super Bowl in February.In a private room, the owners discussed the structure of Goodells new deal and some of the finer points the commissioner wanted added.Jones was not in New York, but was listening on a speaker phone.We got to a good place that night, one person involved in the dinner said.Jerry was on board with all of it.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Two days later, everything changed when Goodell suspended the Cowboys star running back, Ezekiel Elliott, for six games based on an accusation of domestic violence by his former girlfriend.In addition to railing against the decision and questioning the way the commissioner and his staff handled the investigation, Jones began to lobby the compensation committee and other owners to pause and alter Goodells new pay deal.Advertisement Continue reading the main story On his radio show on Friday, Jones denied that his effort to block the contract extension had anything to do with Elliott, saying it was all about Goodells performance lately.In October, when all 32 owners met in New York, Blank, the chairman of the committee, briefed them on the structure of the deal.There was little opposition.But several weeks ago, Jones held a conference call with more than a dozen owners not on the compensation committee to discuss Goodells extension.When that failed to turn the tide against the extension, Jones spoke on a conference call last week with the compensation committee and threatened to take legal action.Stunned, the committee took the extraordinary step of removing Jones from the committee, and lawyers have since handled communication between the committee and Jones.Joness threat now appears to have galvanized the committee and Goodell to conclude the last few items in the new contract.Goodell is currently paid around $30 million a year, including a set of rolling bonuses that in effect make most of his compensation guaranteed.In his new package, Goodell would receive roughly the same amount, but only if certain performance targets were met.After the owners voted unanimously in May to extend Goodells contract for five more years, the compensation committee created a new structure in which 88 percent of the commissioners compensation would be based on an array of metrics tied to the leagues financial performance.Many of those metrics would be overseen by other owners on other committees, broadening the number of people who would decide how much the commissioner would make.Goodell, who has sought to defuse the controversy over players protesting racism by kneeling during the national anthem, has devoted more time in recent days to working out the final details so this controversy, too, might subside.

The Cowboys Ezekiel Elliott May Have Run Out of Options:::::Photo Yet another court hearing resulted in yet another change in Ezekiel Elliotts status, and he now appears to be suspended after a ruling against his request for an emergency injunction.If this sounds familiar, it is.Similar developments have already played out several times this season with Elliott, the Dallas Cowboys star running back.Barring further action, the N.F.L.said Thursday that Elliotts six-game suspension which came as a result of domestic violence allegations was in effect.That meant he was banned from team facilities and would not be allowed to play in the Cowboys game against the Atlanta Falcons on Sunday.The latest ruling came on Thursday from the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, where the N.F.L.Players Association had argued on Elliotts behalf that the suspension should be delayed until the court could hear his appeal.The courts decision said an appeal hearing should be expedited, but it terminated what had been a temporary administrative stay of the suspension and denied a request for an emergency injunction.No date was given for when an appeal would be heard.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The N.F.L.originally suspended Elliott this summer after a yearlong investigation into allegations made by a former girlfriend of his.Elliott was not arrested or charged with any crimes, but the N.F.L.built its case on statements made by the woman, along with photographs of the injuries he was accused of inflicting on her.
Fantasy Football: Who to Start in N.F.L. Week 10:::::Before we get too far ahead of ourselves, lets break down Week 10 from a fantasy perspective.Quarterback Jared Goff (LAR vs. Texans) It may be time to accept that the Rams have a high-powered offense, which was on full display in Week 9 against the Giants.Goff led the charge with four touchdown passes as the Rams routed the Giants, 51-17.Goff has more to prove before he can be a locked-in fantasy starter each week, but consider him one against the Texans, who have allowed the fourth most fantasy points per game to quarterbacks (19.3) this season.Tyrod Taylor (BUF vs. Saints) Taylor has been a top 10 fantasy quarterback in each of the past three weeks, averaging 21.2 F.P.P.G.during that span.What makes Taylor a safer bet than most fantasy quarterbacks is his running ability.His 210 rushing yards are the fifth most among quarterbacks and he has added two touchdowns as a runner.With the former Panthers receiver Kelvin Benjamin set to debut with the team, joining Jordan Matthews, Zay Jones and Charles Clay in the Bills receiving corps, Taylor could have an even stronger second half of the season.Also consider: Josh McCown (NYJ at Buccaneers) Running Back Jordan Howard (CHI vs. Packers) Howard had at least 20 carries in four games this season.These days, that makes him a workhorse, as he is one of seven players to do so.He has been productive with those carries, too, topping 12 fantasy points in five of his eight games.The last time he played the Packers, he ran for only 53 yards but scored a touchdown.The Packers yield the fourth most F.P.P.G.(20.9) to the position and have allowed eight backs to top at least 10 fantasy points in eight games played.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Carlos Hyde (SF vs. Giants) With the help of having the second most targets among all backs, and the third most receptions, Hyde has been a consistent fantasy performer this season.He has five games as either a top-15 back or at least a 12-point scorer, and has been held to under 7 fantasy points once.Expect more success against an imploding Giants defense that got mauled by the Rams Todd Gurley for over 22 fantasy points.Also consider: Lamar Miller (HOU at Rams) Wide Receiver Robby Anderson (NYJ at Buccaneers) Its time to take Anderson seriously in terms of fantasy production.I know, it feels weird talking up any Jets offensive player given the last few years of production, but quarterback Josh McCown has found a nice rhythm throwing to Anderson, Jermaine Kearse and tight end Austin Seferian-Jenkins.Anderson has averaged over 12 fantasy points per game over the last three weeks.On the season, he has the 14th most fantasy points among wide receivers.Up next is a matchup with the team that has given up the third most fantasy points to the wide receiver position (25.3 F.P.P.G.).JuJu Smith-Schuster (PIT at Colts) After flashing signs that he could be a productive N.F.L.receiver for most of the first half, he exploded in Week 8 with 193 yards on seven receptions and a touchdown.Coming off a bye week, theres no reason to think that Smith-Schuster is not the teams second receiving option behind Antonio Brown, no matter what the team says about getting Martavis Bryant more involved.A matchup with the Colts should lead to more fantasy success, as they have allowed the second most receiving yards (293.1 per game) and the seventh most fantasy points (23.7 F.P.P.G.)to the position.Also consider: Sammy Watkins (LAR vs. Texans) Tight End Cameron Brate (TB vs.Jets) Theres not a lot of good fantasy news coming out of Tampa Bay of late, with quarterback Jameis Winston expected to miss three games and receiver Mike Evans suspended for Week 10.But even with Ryan Fitzpatrick behind center, Brate should be considered a decent fantasy asset at the thin tight end position, especially in a favorable matchup with the Jets (9.5 F.P.P.G., fifth most).Defense/Special Teams LAR vs. Texans; DET vs. Browns Kicker Kai Forbath (MIN at Redskins); Ryan Succop (TEN vs. Bengals).
N.F.L. Picks: Patriots Over Broncos; Cowboys Over Falcons:::::All of that should add up to a horrible day for the Texans (3-5).Tom Savage is not a good quarterback regardless of opponent, but with him running away from Donald and trying to throw into tight coverage, he should be especially bad.Heres the tricky thing about picking this game: 12 points is an enormous spread, even at home, and Jared Goff, while vastly improved from last season, is still inconsistent.There is not much concern that the Rams could lose, but a few garbage-time touchdowns are likely to swing the spread in favor of Houston.Pick: Texans Cowboys at Falcons, 4:25 p.m., Fox Line: Falcons by 3 Atlantas season can be summed up in one play from last week: Matt Ryan throwing a perfect 40-yard pass to a wide-open Julio Jones in the end zone, and Jones simply dropping the ball.It was such a painful and shocking turn of events the play came on fourth down with the Falcons (4-4) trailing by 10 points that Kurt Coleman, a defensive back for the Panthers, walked over to console Jones.Such is life for Atlanta a year after a magical run to the Super Bowl ended with a brutal collapse.There is some intrigue in this game still, as neither team knows if Ezekiel Elliott will be allowed to play, but with the recent improvement the Cowboys (5-3) have shown on both sides of the ball, Dallas should be in line for a road win regardless of what happens in Thursdays court hearing.Pick: Cowboys Patriots at Broncos, 8:30 p.m., NBC Line: Patriots by 7.5 Before anyone gets too excited about the Patriots (6-2) drastically cutting down the number of passing yards the team allowed in its last two games, it is worth noting that they gave up an average of 138.5 rushing yards a game in the two wins.New Englands defense might just not have that higher gear, but it is not as if the Broncos (3-5) and Brock Osweiler present much of a challenge.Add in C. J. Anderson working his way through an ankle injury and Denver does not seem to have the personnel to keep up with New England, no matter how bad the Patriots defense is.Pick: Patriots Vikings at Redskins, 1 p.m., Fox Line: Vikings by 1 The error margin for Case Keenum has been reduced to zero.If Keenum, a career backup, wants to remain at starting quarterback for the Vikings (6-2), he will need to keep winning.Teddy Bridgewater has been cleared to play, and unless his knee injury has turned him into an entirely different quarterback, he represents an enormous upgrade for Minnesota.With that in mind, the Redskins (4-4) could be a problem for Keenum because they are far more talented than their 4-4 record indicates.Their four losses have come against the Eagles (twice), the Chiefs (when that team looked unbeatable) and the Cowboys.Last weeks win over Seattle showed that they are resilient and that Kirk Cousins continues to be fearless.Taking too many chances against Minnesotas secondary could be dangerous, but a Redskins win, and Bridgewaters return to the field a week later, seem well within the realm of possibilities.Pick: Redskins Second-Tier Games Photo Saints at Bills, 1 p.m., Fox Line: Saints by 2.5 The Saints (6-2) are a passing team that loves playing indoors, so a trip to Buffalo on a chilly Sunday afternoon should present an interesting test.A huge factor in how they fare, though, will come in which version of the Bills (5-3) shows up.Two weeks ago, Buffalo looked great and easily beat the Raiders, but last week, they were hardly competitive against the Jets, allowing 194 rushing yards and three rushing touchdowns.It is that rushing success by the Jets that the Saints may want to pay attention to: In Mark Ingram and Alvin Kamara, they have the running backs to exploit the same weakness.Another win would be seven in a row for New Orleans.More important, it would improve the teams road record to 4-1.Pick: Saints Steelers at Colts, 1 p.m., CBS Line: Steelers by 10.5 The Steelers (6-2) have settled into a groove.Their defense shuts things down, keeping the score nice and low, and their offense, despite the presence of three of the N.F.L.s biggest stars, does just enough to win.Whether it is the aging of Ben Roethlisberger, tension among players or their opponents adjusting to a unit that has been together for several seasons, they just dont run up the score the way they used to.Going on the road against the Colts (3-6) does not present a true upset opportunity: The Steelers are extremely likely to win, but a spread of 10.5 points seems high considering Pittsburghs track record.Pick: Colts Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Seahawks at Cardinals, 8:25 p.m. (Thursday), NBC Line: Seahawks by 6 The Seahawks (5-3) are one game removed from a four-game winning streak, but the defense has taken a huge step back in the last few weeks: Both the Texans and the Redskins showed no fear in throwing directly into Seattles secondary.Injuries are a factor, with Earl Thomas out and Richard Sherman playing through injuries, but it is still shocking to see teams have so much success throwing the ball against them.Drew Stanton of the Cardinals (4-4) is not an aggressive passer like Deshaun Watson or Kirk Cousins, so the same level of exploitation should not be expected.Arizona will probably try to make up for that by running early and often with the veteran back Adrian Peterson, and while he has performed well since coming over from New Orleans, he may not find as much room to run this week.Thursday games are messy, but Seattle has had success in Arizona, and if it wants to avoid falling way behind the Rams in the N.F.C.West, this game needs to be something of a statement.Pick: Seahawks Advertisement Continue reading the main story Chargers at Jaguars, 1 p.m., CBS Line: Jaguars by 4 The Jaguars (5-3) had a nearly perfect defense with one glaring flaw: It could not stop the run.A trade for Marcell Dareus, a run-stopping defensive tackle who was a known quantity to Coach Doug Marrone, may not deserve all the credit for last weeks effort (29 rushing yards allowed), but if he has whipped the unit into shape, Jacksonville will be hard to score upon.The Chargers (3-5) are an interesting test for that theory, as Melvin Gordon, their star running back, is the type of player who would have torched the Jaguars in previous weeks.If Dareus stops him, then Jacksonvilles run of losing in even-numbered weeks of the season may finally end.On offense, the Jaguars should get a nice boost from Leonard Fournette, who showed up to practice on time during the week, which will get him back on the field after he was held out for a violation of team rules.Pick: Jaguars Browns at Lions, 1 p.m., CBS Line: Lions by 12.5 The Lions (4-4) may not look like a playoff contender, with a .500 record and several frustrating losses, but they have been considerably better than their record, and last weeks win at Green Bay opened the door for them to go on a winning streak ahead of their Week 12 showdown with division-leading Minnesota.The Browns (0-8) are a speed bump on that path.Detroit will probably not cover the 12.5-point spread, but if it cares about its playoff hopes it will win the game.Pick: Browns Bottom-Tier Games Photo Jets at Buccaneers, 1 p.m., CBS Line: Jets by 2.5 With Jameis Winston having been shut down for at least two weeks, the Buccaneers (2-6) will turn to Ryan Fitzpatrick at quarterback.It is a downgrade from Winston at full strength, but probably an upgrade from the way Winston had played since injuring his shoulder.Add the revenge factor of Fitzpatricks playing against the Jets (4-5), who discarded him a season after he set the franchise single-season record for passing touchdowns, and this could turn into a mild upset.Pick: Buccaneers Packers at Bears, 1 p.m., Fox Line: Bears by 5 The statistics for Mitchell Trubisky are not that much better than those for Brett Hundley, but the difference between them is that Trubisky, the rookie quarterback for the Bears (3-5), is trying to overcome his subpar wide receivers, while Hundley, a third-year backup for the Packers (4-4), has teammates on offense that made Green Bay a Super Bowl contender until Hundley replaced the injured Aaron Rodgers.Hundleys lack of production has partially been a result of an ultraconservative game plan, but an opportunistic Bears defense may make him pay if he tries to be aggressive in his third career start.Pick: Bears Bengals at Titans, 1 p.m., Fox Line: Titans by 4.5 The Bengals (3-5) got a huge boost for this matchup when the N.F.L.chose not to suspend A. J.Green over his fight during a loss to Jacksonville last week.His presence gives Cincinnati enough offense to compete, and while the Titans (5-3) have won back-to-back games, they have put little distance between themselves and their lowly opponents (Baltimore and Cleveland).This will probably be another close game.Pick: Bengals Giants at 49ers, 4:25 p.m., Fox Line: Giants by 1 With how poorly the 49ers (0-9) have played in almost every facet of the game, having a reason for optimism is a welcome change.Quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo, acquired in a recent trade with New England, represents that optimism, but San Francisco has yet to make any commitment about when, or if, he will play.If the young and talent-deprived team insists on sticking with C. J. Beathard for another week, the Giants (1-7) are destined for their second win.Pick: Giants Mondays Matchup Dolphins at Panthers, 8:30 p.m., ESPN Line: Panthers by 9 For a second consecutive week, a prime-time audience will be forced to endure the atrocious offense of the Dolphins (4-4).It was supposed to be a breakout season for Miami, with quarterback Ryan Tannehill leading several star-level wide receivers and a young Pro Bowler at running back in Jay Ajayi.Instead, Tannehill is out for the season, Ajayi was traded to Philadelphia and the Dolphins wide receivers are left shuffling along for a team that often struggles to score in double digits.The Panthers (6-3) are inconsistent and frustrating, but their defense may look to prove a point by making this game a laugher.Pick: Panthers.
Jerry Jones Threatens to Sue N.F.L. to Block Roger Goodells Contract:::::The dispute between Jones and Goodell stems from Joness anger over the commissioners suspending of Ezekiel Elliott, the Cowboys star running back, who was accused of domestic violence by his former girlfriend.Goodell gave Elliott a six-game suspension, though no charges were filed in the case.The suspension, announced in August, has since undergone a dizzying array of rulings and court appeals that has, for now, kept Elliott on the field.Jones has called the suspension an overcorrection, a gibe at Goodell, who has been criticized for his handling of player discipline.Jones appears intent on holding up Goodells contract extension and potentially pushing him out.He is in the minority among owners.While some are unhappy with how the commissioner has handled issues related to player conduct and the national anthem controversy, only a few owners are prepared to replace Goodell, who has been commissioner for more than a decade and has worked at the league since the early 1980s.The battle within the league is unusual for an organization that prides itself on order and unanimity and oversees the most popular sport in the country.But the N.F.L.is in the middle of one of its most tumultuous seasons because of players kneeling during the national anthem to protest social injustice, a wave of injuries to star players, and a television ratings dip that has fed debate over whether football is declining.Jones said in a conference call last Thursday with the six owners those of the Chiefs, Falcons, Giants, Patriots, Steelers and Texans that legal papers were drawn up and would be served this Friday if the committee did not scrap or delay its current plans to extend Goodells contract.As of Wednesday, the owners and the league had not been sued.Jones, who has owned the Cowboys since 1989, has been a nonvoting member of the committee that is considering Goodells contract, which expires at the end of the 2018 season.He has fought to have a say.After Joness conference call last week, the six owners revoked his status as an ad hoc member of the compensation committee, which decides on pay packages for the top league officials.Photo Over the past several days, the six owners have been speaking to the other 25 owners who are not on the committee to notify them of what Jones had said.Advertisement Continue reading the main story At a meeting in May, all 32 owners including Jones voted to extend Goodells contract and authorized the compensation committee to work out the details.But after Elliott was suspended, Jones began lobbying the committee to undermine the deal.Jones, known for brassy talk and bold moves, may be making his most audacious maneuver yet in taking on fellow owners, with whom he normally holds considerable sway in matters like the relocation of teams and how the league spends its money.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Joness threat is reminiscent of steps taken by Raiders owner Al Davis, who successfully sued to the league in the 1980s to win the right to move his team from Oakland to Los Angeles.Jones has also sued the league, in the 1990s, over sponsorships.But his latest move is potentially more volatile because he has not only threatened to sue the league, but also is trying to prevent the commissioner from getting a new contract.Boies is a prominent lawyer who has argued before the Supreme Court and represented corporations and executives in high-profile cases.He drew widespread criticism this week after The New Yorker reported on the legal work Boies did for Weinstein, the movie mogul facing allegations of sexual harassment and sexual assault.The article reported that Boies helped Weinsteins effort to use private investigators to help block a negative article about him in The New York Times while Boiess firm was providing outside legal counsel for The Times.Boies denied there was any conflict of interest with his work for the newspaper.In a statement, he said he believed the investigators had been hired solely to determine the facts related to the accusations against Weinstein, which Boies believed would be to The Timess benefit.The Times said it was ending its relationship with his firm.We never contemplated that the law firm would contract with an intelligence firm to conduct a secret spying operation aimed at our reporting and our reporters, The Times said in a statement.Such an operation is reprehensible.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Boies has also worked for the N.F.L., representing the league in federal court in 2011 after the players association decertified as a union.Boies has worked with several owners, some of whom now feel blindsided that he agreed to help Jones potentially sue the league.Jones has publicly questioned Elliotts suspension as well as the commissioners role in handing down player penalties.Zeke is a victim of an overcorrection, Jones said in a radio interview in October, a day after Elliott lost his bid for a preliminary injunction that would have stayed the six-game ban for violating the leagues personal conduct policy.Even this judge said it shows that very reasonable people could possibly come down on both sides of this, Jones added.Well, under our legal system it has to be stronger than that for someone to have done it.Jones has also been the most vocal owner to urge players to stand for the national anthem.Jones and other owners are upset that Goodell has not done more to stop players from kneeling or sitting during the anthem.The issue exploded into a national debate when President Trump took aim at the owners for not forcing the players to stand.
College Football Playoff Rankings: Top Four Remain Intact:::::Georgia, Alabama, Notre Dame and Clemson held their spots in the top four of the College Football Playoff rankings, and unbeaten Miami moved up three spots to No.7 before its showdown with the Fighting Irish.Oklahoma remained fifth and Texas Christian moved up to sixth in the rankings released Tuesday.The Sooners and Horned Frogs play a key Big 12 game on Saturday, with the winner taking sole possession of first place in the conference.After Miami, unbeaten Wisconsin was No.8, the highest-ranked Big Ten team.Washington, the highest-ranked Pac-12 team, is ninth and Auburn is 10th.Notre Dame visits the Hurricanes on Saturday night, and Georgia is at Auburn.No.14 Penn State and No.15 Ohio State fell out of the top 10 after losses last week.University of Central Florida was 18th, the highest-ranked team from outside the Power Five conferences.The highest-ranked conference champion from the Group of Five leagues is guaranteed a spot in one of the New Years Six Bowls, and the American Athletic Conference is in prime position to grab that bid this year.U.C.F.is unbeaten and leading the Americans East Division, and Memphis, ranked 22nd, is in first in the A.A.C.West.No other Group of Five conferences are represented in the selection committees rankings this week.
After Beating Packers, Lions Set Their Sights on the Vikings:::::With every short pass from Brett Hundley, every drive that ended in a field goal or a punt and every lingering shot of Aaron Rodgers standing on the sideline, it seemed like the Green Bay Packers were falling farther from anything resembling contention.The N.F.C.North is far from having been decided, but after Green Bays 30-17 loss at home to the Detroit Lions on Monday night, the Lions certainly seem to have the better chance of challenging the Minnesota Vikings for division supremacy.And if the Packers continue to tumble and slip out of playoff contention, they might not even feel the need to bring Rodgers back once he is eligible to return in Week 15 from the injured reserve, where he landed after breaking his collarbone on Oct. 15.For now, the North is Minnesotas division to lose.At 6-2 and riding a four-game winning streak, the Vikings are two games ahead of both Detroit and Green Bay.The Upshots Playoff Simulator gives the Vikings a 65 percent chance of winning the division.But last season showed that a hot start by the Vikings does not guarantee much, as their 5-0 start to the season was undercut by a 3-8 finish, leaving the Packers and Lions to fight for the division crown on the final day of the regular season (the Packers won out).When breaking down the three contenders, the biggest argument for the Lions is their quarterback stability.Matthew Stafford, who has not missed a game since 2010, is a true franchise quarterback (with a salary commensurate of such a distinction) who has a knack for late-game heroics.On Monday he did not need another of his signature comebacks, as he completed 26 of 33 passes for 361 yards and two touchdowns in his teams blowout win.The win was just Detroits second victory in Green Bay since the start of the 1992 season (a span of 27 games).Advertisement Continue reading the main story The Packers are in dire straits with Hundley, who was rarely asked to throw the ball more than five yards on Monday night, but they at least have the benefit of having a long-term plan at quarterback (hint: Its Rodgers).The same cannot be said of the Vikings, who have a complicated quarterback controversy on their hands.Photo Case Keenum has performed well in Sam Bradfords absence, but he will soon be challenged for the starting role not just by Bradford, who is working his way back from a knee injury, but also by Teddy Bridgewater, the Vikings former starter who has missed the last 24 regular season games after a devastating knee injury in the 2016 preseason.
How the Rams Went From Laughingstock to Contenders:::::Although questions remain about how much fans in Los Angeles will embrace the Rams they are ranked 27th in attendance this season its clear the team has found a way to recreate itself on the field.One of the keys was changing coaches.After firing Jeff Fisher, who arrived with the team from St. Louis, the Rams ripped up the playbook and hired McVay, who was then Washingtons offensive coordinator.At 31, he is the youngest head coach in N.F.L.history.Another key has been quarterback Jared Goff.Last year, the Rams made a splash by trading six draft picks to acquire the first choice, which they used to select Goff.New to the league, he struggled and lost all seven games that he started.In the off-season, the Rams added players to help Goff.They signed center John Sullivan and left tackle Andrew Whitworth to bolster the offensive line, and acquired receivers Sammy Watkins and Robert Woods.The Rams made the most of their limited draft picks by taking tight end Gerald Everett from South Alabama in the second round and wide receiver Cooper Kupp from Eastern Washington in the third round.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.(On Sunday, Woods had two touchdown catches.For the season, Everett has eight receptions and one touchdown, while Kupp has 26 receptions and three scores.)A stronger offensive line and extra receivers have helped Goff.He has been sacked 10 times this season; in seven games last season, he was sacked 26 times.With more time to throw, Goff has more touchdown passes and fewer interceptions this season.He has thrown for 13 touchdowns (including four on Sunday) and four interceptions, compared with five scores and seven interceptions last season.His adjusted yards per attempt (which accounts for the impact of interceptions) rose to 7.7 from 4.3 last season.Goff and the Rams have also benefited from Todd Gurley, a first-round pick in 2015 who has rebounded after a lackluster 2016.He has seven rushing touchdowns in eight starts after having six in 16 starts last season.He is averaging 4.3 yards a carry after averaging 3.2 (and the proverbial cloud of dust) in 2016.He has also caught three touchdown passes this season.Advertisement Continue reading the main story For all their success, the Rams have a lot of work to do to secure a playoff spot.They face the Texans at home next week, and must face Philadelphia, New Orleans, Tennessee and Minnesota all division leaders.They must also play their division rivals Seattle and Arizona on the road.Still, considering where they were last season, the Rams seem comfortable with their newfound fortune.We have to keep doing what were doing and not take our foot off the gas pedal, Goff said after Sundays game.
As Rams Prove Their Mettle, Giants Show They Have None:::::McVay said the Rams last two games have been almost perfect in all three phases, and they have remained unbeaten in four road games.That would be five if a home win in London is included.The Rams high-powered offense showed no rust as the team came off the bye, scoring on eight of its first nine possessions while reeling off six plays of 35 yards or more.The defense forced three turnovers that the offense turned into 17 points, and the special teams blocked a third-quarter punt that paved the way for Gurleys second touchdown.Its exciting, said Rams cornerback Trumaine Johnson, who intercepted a pass by Giants quarterback Eli Manning late in the first half.A lot of guys in this locker room havent been in this situation, 6-2.Its big, and every game is going to be more important, so we are doing everything one game at a time, one day at a time.Greg Zuerlein added three field goals against the Giants (1-7), who allowed the biggest offensive performance against them in a home game since Cleveland beat them, 52-21, in the regular-season finale in 1964.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.The Giants had not given up more than 27 points in any of their first seven games.You lay an egg like that obviously we didnt play well, Giants halfback Orleans Darkwa said.Weve got to go back to work.We started fast.We made some plays.We put on a good drive.But we wound up turning the ball over, and you cant do that.The loss also put Coach Ben McAdoos future in question just one year after he led the team to the playoffs.He suspended cornerback Janoris Jenkins on Tuesday for missing a workout Monday, and the depleted secondary was punished by Goff, who was 14 of 22 with no interceptions.Im disappointed, said McAdoo, who insisted his team had not quit.Expected us to come out and play a better football game than we played.We have it in us.Its my job to get it out of us.Goffs touchdowns were of 8 yards to tight end Tyler Higbee, 52 to Robert Woods, 67 to Sammy Watkins and 4 to Woods.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Eli Manning (20 of 36 for 220 yards) threw two touchdown passes and became the seventh N.F.L.quarterback to reach the 50,000-yard mark with his completion of a garbage-time pass to Sterling Shepard in the fourth quarter.His touchdowns covered 5 yards to Tavarres King and 10 yards to Evan Engram.Goffs touchdown pass to Higbee came after Aaron Donald sacked Manning and forced a fumble that Connor Barwin recovered.The play that killed the Giants was the 52-yarder to Woods on a third-and-33 screen play on which Woods was barely touched.It turned a 10-7 lead into a 10-point advantage, and the Gians never looked the same in seeing their seven-game winning streak against the Rams end.
What We Learned in N.F.L. Week 9: Whats Half a Hundred Times Two?:::::Sometimes a call just truly gets blown.At the end of a skirmish in which A. J.Green of the Cincinnati Bengals repeatedly shoved and punched Jalen Ramsey of the Jacksonville Jaguars, both players were ejected.Replays showed that Ramsey had not punched back at Green, and the N.F.L.is in a difficult situation in which a player seems to be owed an apology even though his team held on to win.Heres a look at what happened in N.F.L.Week 9: Photo With Elliott and Prescott in action, Cowboys roll.The Dallas Cowboys showed just how good the team can be with Dak Prescott and Ezekiel Elliott at full-strength, as the duo led the team to a hard-fought 28-17 victory over the Kansas City Chiefs.Now they have to wait and see if their partnership will be broken up for the next several weeks.Elliott was on the field thanks to an appeals court briefly delaying his six-game suspension with an administrative stay, but it is expected that his fate for the next six games will be decided this week.The second-year running back took advantage of the unexpected start by rushing for 93 yards and a touchdown, helping complement a fine performance by Prescott, who threw for 249 yards and two touchdowns while running for another score, in the come-from-behind win.Prescotts success came thanks to a pair of passing touchdowns to Cole Beasley, and a 141-yard day by Terrance Williams, as the team survived Dez Bryant leaving the game in the second half with an ankle injury.It looked for much of the first half like it would be a boring matchup between teams trying too hard to be careful, but things picked up dramatically in the last two minutes before halftime.Both teams scored in the final 13 seconds of the half, with Tyreek Hill of the Chiefs scoring an unbelievable 57-yard catch-and-run touchdown as time expired.Hill had at least five defenders between him and the end zone when he caught the ball, but he used his patience and game-changing speed to weave through the crowd, nearly untouched, for the score.Kansas City then opened the second half with another touchdown drive, which briefly gave them a 17-14 lead.From that point on, though, the game was all Dallas, as both the offense and defense found a higher gear.Their much-maligned secondary even managed to end Alex Smiths season-long streak of passes without an interception when Jeff Heath stepped in front of a pass intended for Charcandrick West in the fourth quarter.Going forward, things could be truly complicated for Dallas.Elliott could be out for up to six weeks, the severity of Bryants injury is not known, and the Cowboys may be facing an extended stretch in which Prescott will be trying to keep the teams playoff hopes alive with his primary offensive support coming from players like Darren McFadden, Alfred Morris and Beasley.Advertisement Continue reading the main story With or without Elliott, Dallas will travel to Atlanta to face the struggling Falcons next week and then will host the red-hot Philadelphia Eagles in Week 11.Redskins shock Seahawks with late drive.Seattle quarterback Russell Wilson appeared to have secured his second consecutive comeback win with a dramatic touchdown pass in the games final minutes.Not to be outdone, Kirk Cousins put together one of the most impressive drives of his career, going 70 yards on just four plays to secure a 17-14 victory.Cousins did not throw a touchdown pass in the game, but his bold passes into Seattles secondary in the games final minutes were key to the shocking victory.The second long pass, a 38-yarder to Josh Doctson, set up Rob Kelley for a game-winning 1-yard touchdown run.Kelleys two touchdowns accounted for most of the scoring for Washington, and the team survived the late surge by Wilson, who threw for 297 yards and rushed for 77.Photo The Falcons Super Bowl hangover isnt going away.The Atlanta Falcons continue to struggle to hold onto leads.In what has become a dramatic Super Bowl hangover, the Falcons record dropped to 4-4 after a 20-17 loss to the Carolina Panthers in which they had a 10-0 lead until late in the second quarter.The Panthers worked their way back into the game with the teams running game, and eventually rushed for a combined 201 yards on 38 carries, with Cam Newton leading the team with 86 yards, while he and Christian McCaffrey each scored on a rushing touchdown.Atlanta continued to fight even after falling behind 20-10.They got the ball back one last time with just over two minutes remaining and a deficit of three points, but the offense mustered minus-three yards while turning the ball over on downs when Matt Ryans fourth down pass failed to connect with Taylor Gabriel.But the day was symbolized by a play earlier in the fourth quarter where Ryan threw what appeared to be a perfect 39-yard touchdown pass to Julio Jones that the sure-handed receiver simply dropped, resulting in a turnover on downs.It was the type of mistake Atlanta never made during the teams run to the Super Bowl last season.- Advertisement Continue reading

makes life miserable for opponents each and every week.The addition of Jay Ajayi to the running game made them seem like something out of a video game in a 51-23 demolishing of the Denver Broncos.There were no weaknesses on display for the Eagles.Carson Wentz, who came into the game tied for the N.F.L.lead with 19 touchdown passes, threw four more, while completing 15 of 27 passes for 199 yards before being taken out in the fourth quarter with the score well out of hand.Wentz now has sole possession of the passing touchdown lead with 23, but he was focused on other things.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Touchdowns are great, but being 8-1 is what its all about, he told reporters after the game.Wentz had plenty of help, as the teams running game, powered by LeGarrette Blount, Corey Clement and the newly-acquired Ajayi combined to carry the ball 37 times for 197 yards and three touchdowns.Coming into the game, Philadelphia had just four rushing touchdowns all season.That the Eagles had so much success running the ball against the second-rated rushing defense in the N.F.L.was a testament to Ajayi.The pro bowl running back was traded from the Dolphins this week and went from an underperforming malcontent in Miami to energizing Philadelphia with a 46-yard touchdown run late in the second quarter.He finished with a team-leading 77 yards.The Broncos, meanwhile, tried to shake things up by switching from Trevor Siemian to Brock Osweiler at quarterback, but any improvement was hard to see in a game in which Osweiler completed just 19 of 38 passes for 208 yards, one touchdown and two interceptions.He was repeatedly harassed by Philadelphias front-seven and made several mistakes, including the two turnovers, both of which led to Eagles touchdowns.The highlights were few and far between for Denver, but they included Osweiler hitting Demaryius Thomas for a 1-yard touchdown pass, Brandon McManus connecting on two field goals from 50-plus yards, and Brandon Marshall, Denvers standout linebacker, getting his first career fumble recovery for a touchdown after a strip-sack of Nick Foles by Von Miller.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Philadelphia now heads into its bye-week as the N.F.L.s only eight-win team.Their next challenge will be a road

to instigate a scuffle along the sideline.Brees touchdowns went for 33 yards to Alvin Kamara and 36 yards to Ted Ginn.Kamara, who also scored on a 6-yard run, did most of the work on his TD reception, thrilling the Superdome crowd with a waving, tackle-slipping run after his short catch.The Saints also scored on Justin Hardees blocked punt, which Hardee recovered in stride and returned for a

Yankees Interviews for Their New Manager Begin With a Familiar Face:::::Because Ive been here so long, I dont think you get a free pass to interview for this job, he said.I think you have to have certain skills and certain things about you that pertain to the job.Thomson, who has not been a manager since running the Yankees rookie-ball club in Oneonta, N.Y., in 1995, said he believed his knowledge of the organization was an asset.But he also had to distance himself from Girardi, whom Cashman let go in large part because he saw communication shortcomings.I really dont want to compare myself to Joe, Thomson said.I love Joe.But I do know this: My strengths are my communications and my trust with the players, and because of that trust, we can implement more things into our game, whether it be analytics or sports science.Whatever we want to do, I think can get through to the players.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.As the bench coach the last three seasons, Thomson had a variety of duties, including working with the outfielders and distributing scouting reports to players.Another of his duties was using the dugout telephone to serve as the go-between for Girardi and Brett Weber, who monitors replays for the Yankees.Thomson accepted some of the responsibility for a replay snafu in Game 2 of the Yankees American League division series against the Cleveland Indians, when Girardi neglected to challenge a call that the Indians Lonnie Chisenhall had been hit on the hand by a pitch.Thomson said he had turned to use the phone immediately and had not seen the reaction of Chisenhall or catcher Gary Sanchez.One thing that I learned is just to take your time to the phone and always keep your eyes on the field, because Sanchy had a reaction to the play, the hitter had a reaction to the play, Thomson said.He added: Maybe if I had kept my head on the field, and kind of watched the reaction, I maybe would have been able to help Joe out in that way.A lot of things to learn just on that one play for me.INSIDE PITCH The Yankees announced Thursday that they were moving up start times by 30 minutes for Monday-to-Thursday home games in April.Seven games will begin at 6:35 p.m.
Ray Robinson, Who Wrote of Gehrig the Man, Dies at 96:::::He could be trusted not to exaggerate a story or a fact; it was what it was, and you could trust Rays memory, Marty Appel, the author of Pinstripe Empire: The New York Yankees From Before the Babe to After the Boss (2012) and other baseball books, said in an interview on Tuesday.One of Mr. Robinsons favorite players, and subjects, was Gehrig, the Hall of Fame Yankee first baseman who long held the record for consecutive games played, with 2,130, and who died at 37 from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, a degenerative ailment now widely known as Lou Gehrigs disease.In many articles and in the book Iron Horse: Lou Gehrig in His Time (1990), Mr. Robinson portrayed the famously humble and hard-working Gehrig as a human being instead of the mythical hero many see him as, without hiding his own reverence.Photo Suited up, Gehrig looked bovine, unathletic, Mr. Robinson wrote.His appearance earned him the uncomely nickname of Biscuit Pants.But shouldnt one win points for modesty, decency and determination?I thought so, and of all the Yankees, it was Lou I cherished the most.One undeniably superhuman moment of Gehrigs career was his farewell speech at Yankee Stadium on July 4, 1939.Mr. Robinson, who was there and called the speech baseballs Gettysburg Address, told The Daily News in 2014 that the sound system made it hard to make out all of Gehrigs words, but that an almost religious solemnity descended over the stadium as Gehrig spoke.Advertisement Continue reading the main story I have no way of knowing if 60,000 people were crying, he said, but I had tears in my eyes.Raymond Kenneth Robinson was born in Manhattan on Dec. 4, 1920, to Louis Robinson, a lawyer, and the former Lillian Hoffman, a homemaker.While growing up he watched the dominant Yankee teams of the 1920s and 30s, whose stars included Gehrig, Babe Ruth and, later, Joe DiMaggio, as well as the New York Giants and the Brooklyn Dodgers.Mr. Robinson first encountered Gehrig after writing him to ask for an interview for his school newspaper.The interview did not work out, but Gehrig gave him free tickets to a game.After graduating from DeWitt Clinton High School in the Bronx, Mr. Robinson went to Columbia University, which Gehrig also attended.He graduated in 1941, the day after Gehrig died, and studied at Columbias law school before serving in the Army during World War II.Photo He began writing for local newspapers while stationed at military bases in the Southern United States.After he was discharged, he worked as an editor at various magazines.He edited more than a dozen editions of Baseball Stars, annual collections of short biographical essays by burgeoning writers including Jimmy Breslin, Dick Schaap and George Vecsey.In recent years he was a regular at a monthly lunch with New York City sportswriters like Lawrence Ritter, Robert Creamer and Mr. Appel and broadcasters like Bob Costas.In 1949 he married Phyllis Cumins, with whom he lived on the Upper East Side of Manhattan.She died in March.In addition to his daughter he is survived by two sons, Steve and Tad, and four grandchildren.Mr. Robinsons other books include American Original: A Life of Will Rogers (1996) and Famous Last Words (2003), a collection of memorable deathbed statements.He also wrote articles for The New York Times about baseball players like Willie Mays, Jackie Robinson and Cal Ripken Jr., the Baltimore Orioles shortstop who finally broke Gehrigs consecutive game record, ending his own streak at 2,632.Mr. Robinson said that he sent Ripken a copy of his Gehrig biography, but that Ripken refused to read it until after he broke the record in 1995.When he did, he returned the book with a singular inscription.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Its safe to finally read, he scrawled in the front of my book, Mr. Robinson wrote in 2007.I cherish the autograph and understand his superstition.
Mourning Roy Halladay, a Master Who Craved the Big Moments:::::He left behind a wife and two sons.He coached youth teams and seemed to be enjoying a blissful retirement in the air or on the water as he wrote on his Twitter page, where he posted this right under his handle: Courage is not being fearless but rather acting in spite of the existence of fear!That playoff debut, the one he had wondered so much about, will stand as Halladays signature performance.He threw a no-hitter against the Cincinnati Reds, the first in the postseason since Don Larsens perfect game in the 1956 World Series.And that was as good as it got.In Halladays final playoff game, the next fall, he lost by 1-0 to the St. Louis Cardinals and Chris Carpenter, an old teammate who had taught Halladay his curveball while playing catch in the minors.Somebody had to win that day, and it was his friend, not him.Halladay had given his best, and lost.It happens, and he was rational enough to understand that.I was in the Phillies clubhouse after that loss, when Halladay expressed a version of the comment above.It has struck me ever since as the essence of the competitor: All you really want is a chance to test yourself, to see how it all turns out with everything at stake.Halladay had gotten his opportunities.He was proud of how he had handled them.We spoke this spring as part of my research for a book I am writing on pitching.I had chased Halladay for two years, through his agency and his former teams, with no luck.On my visit to Clearwater, Greg Casterioto, the Phillies director of baseball communications, told me Halladay was there, working with prospects on the minor league side.He met me at the picnic tables while the major leaguers played on the main field.Halladay was a little bigger than I remembered, as many players are when their training stops.He had been a fitness fanatic when he played, and said the work the way it flowed into the competition was what he missed most since retiring in 2013, at age 36.Durability was Halladays hallmark.He pitched 63 complete games from 2002 through 2011, 30 more than any other pitcher in that decade.His back gave out, but he said his arm always felt strong.The workload never caught up to him because he measured it precisely.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.If I threw 120 pitches in a game, I would throw a 20-pitch bullpen, Halladay explained.If I threw 100 pitches in a game, I would throw a 40-pitch bullpen.If I only threw 80, Id throw a 60-pitch bullpen.So I was always getting the same amount of pitches in a five-day period.Advertisement Continue reading the main story We talked a bit about the modern state of pitching.Halladay had eight seasons of at least 220 innings, a total no pitcher reached in 2017.He said todays pitchers, with their turbo fastballs, tried too hard to strike hitters out.I felt like with two strikes 0-2, 1-2 if they didnt swing at it, it was going to be strike three, he said.I wanted something that they had either had to swing at and put in play, or was going to be a strike on 0-2.Now its two extra pitches, and were getting back to 2-2 and the count goes on.So I think its just changed a lot in the way people think about pitching.They want to stay just off the plate to where theyre avoiding contact.Halladay induced weak contact and so many awkward swings using the Greg Maddux model of moving the ball in or away on either side of the plate.Hitters knew that Halladay could carve an X in the air, down by their hands or out by their handle, with his sinkers and cutters.He could also lock them up with a curve in the zone, or a split-change a pitch he learned from Rich Dubee, a Phillies coach in the dirt.I wanted them to swing at every pitch, he said.And with an arsenal like that, why not?Halladays success was hard-earned.After parts of three seasons in the majors, the Blue Jays sent him to Class A to rebuild his psyche and master a lower arm slot.He appreciated how fleeting success could be, and approached his work with a serious demeanor that evoked Steve Carlton, an earlier Phillies ace.Carlton was my baseball hero when I was young.My son now roots for the Phillies his grandparents have tickets and Halladay was his favorite.When I took him to the Hall of Fame two years ago, he took a picture with the cap Halladay wore for his perfect game in 2010.After our tour, he asked for a framed Halladay photo collage from a store on Main Street.On Tuesday, my son took inventory of the shrine to Halladay in his bedroom: two framed wall-hangings, two bobbleheads, a pennant and a baseball card.He didnt cry at the news of the crash; he is 15, too busy for that.He asked if he could go to the Y to practice jump shots.Basketball tryouts are coming up.I told him Id have to pick him up in the middle of writing this column, and he said not to bother; he wanted me to write a good story.I insisted he go, because Halladay would have wanted that.He laughed its a trite thing to say, and I barely knew the man.But I meant it.I learned a lot from Halladay in our interview this spring how he mastered each of his pitches, how he held them, how he used them to very likely earn a plaque in the Hall.But mostly I learned again that what truly drove him was not the achievement, but earning the opportunity to have it.If he could do that perfectly, he could live with the rest.Halladay did not live long enough.But his legacy, to me, is powerful and instructive in any field: The purity of the effort matters most.
For Clues in Yankees Manager Search, Look to the Dodgers:::::Still, the next Yankees manager seems unlikely to resemble Francona and Maddon, with their extensive track records; a likelier model would be one of the 2017 World Series managers: Roberts and the Houston Astros A. J. Hinch.Hinch, 43, who has a psychology degree from Stanford, used humor and humility to build bonds with his players, quickly overcoming skepticism based on a failed, brief first attempt at managing the Arizona Diamondbacks, a job he landed at age 34.As well as Hinch has done in three years with the Astros, the Dodgers hiring of Roberts might be the most instructive in looking at the Yankees, who like their long-ago crosstown rivals are trying to build a perpetual contender around a strong farm system, an adherence to analytics and one of baseballs biggest payrolls.Cashman said the Yankees, like the Dodgers, would be methodical in their search they have not yet completed a list of candidates, even as five other openings have been filled.The Dodgers dismissed Don Mattingly as manager after they lost to the Mets in a 2015 division series, but it took a month and interviews with nine candidates to fill the job.Photo The Dodgers interviewed internal candidates, former managers, novices, popular organizational figures (Kirk Gibson) and even a college coach (Darin Erstad) before selecting Roberts, then the San Diego Padres bench coach.He won the job over Bud Black, now the Colorado Rockies manager, and Gabe Kapler, who was recently named the Philadelphia Phillies manager.Andrew Friedman, the Dodgers president of baseball operations, said he was looking foremost for an excellent communicator.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Relentless optimism was something that was important going through the grind of a 162-game season, especially in a larger market, Friedman said last week.It can be a little bit of a grind, so having someone with infectious energy was something that we were looking for from the leader of our 25-man roster.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Like so much about baseball in recent years, the idea of a players manager has evolved, too, thanks to data.With statistical analysis and sports science playing a more prominent role in how lineups are constructed and the bench is deployed each day, the modern manager must be able to communicate these new strategies particularly with younger players who may wonder why they are not playing.Relationships are the foundation for those dialogues.Just so they can think along with you, Friedman said.And therefore, they are less caught off guard by certain moves you might make, which therefore reduces some tension that might come with in-game decisions or starting lineup decisions that in large part dont manifest themselves the same way when theres that open, honest communication throughout.Communication is not strictly top down.Decisions that were once the domain of a manager are now collaborative, involving the front office, pro scouts, player development and sports science staff members, among others.Thats why for a lot of us, getting asked questions like, Who makes out the lineup?or Who decides on the roster?are strange questions, said Farhan Zaidi, the Dodgers general manager and Friedmans lieutenant.We view it as such a collaboration that its not about pointing the finger at one person who goes into an office and locks the door and makes the decision by himself.The process is a lot more organic than that, and I think thats the way the game is headed.When Roberts interviewed, he did not know Friedman or Zaidi though he had worked for another Dodgers executive, Josh Byrnes, in San Diego and he had not been a manager before.Friedman said those were formidable hurdles, but when they finished the initial interview, Zaidi remarked that it was as if Roberts had the answer key.In the few areas in which Roberts was not in lock step with Friedman and Zaidi, they took the ensuing back-and-forth as a healthy sign.Obviously the relationship is way stronger today than it was a year ago, and Ill bet its stronger a year from now than it is right now, Friedman said.Thats the nature of human relationships.As long as theres trust in place, which I think we all have, we feel like, as we look ahead, the continuity that we envision is something that we feel will be a competitive advantage for us in the coming years.And something that the Yankees would like to replicate.
Roy Halladay Dies in Plane Crash in Gulf of Mexico:::::The news of Halladays death was quickly followed by expressions of grief on social media.We are numb over the very tragic news about Roy Halladays untimely death, the Phillies said in a statement posted to Twitter.There are no words to describe the sadness that the entire Phillies family is feeling over the loss of one of the most respected human beings to ever play the game.A two-time Cy Young Award winner and an eight-time All-Star, Halladay was a 6-foot-6 right-hander known for his durability and command.After 12 major league seasons with the Blue Jays, who drafted him in 1995, he was traded to the Phillies in December 2009.Halladay made 2010 a definitive year in his career.He threw the 20th perfect game in major league history during the regular season, and in a division playoff series against Cincinnati, he threw the second no-hitter in postseason history.After the postseason no-hitter, Dusty Baker, the Reds manager at the time and a fixture in the sport going back to the late 1960s, said, That is the best-pitched game Ive seen since Ive been going to the playoffs and the World Series.One of the strongest messages of condolence on social media came from Pedro Martinez, the three-time Cy Young Award winner whose prime coincided with Halladays.Halladays career was cut short by back trouble, however.He became a much weaker pitcher in the 2012 and 2013 seasons, and he retired at 36, signing a one-day contract with Toronto to leave the game as a Blue Jay.Based on his retirement date, Halladay will not be considered for election to baseballs Hall of Fame until 2019, but he will have a strong case because of his dominance in his strongest seasons.His career record of 203-105 and his 2,117 career strikeouts are not eye-popping numbers, but using the JAWS system, an evaluation tool that accounts for a players peak seasons as well as his overall career, Halladay is ranked as baseballs 42nd-best starting pitcher.Only nine players ahead of him are not yet in the Hall of Fame, while more than 30 pitchers below him on the list are already enshrined in Cooperstown.His postseason success and his popularity with the news media also bolster his case.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Shortly after he retired, Halladay discussed how odd it felt not to play baseball.I find myself kind of sitting around the house thinking, Theres something missing here I should be working out, I should be running, I should be doing something, Halladay said.For a second, its kind of a little bit of panic, and then it kind of sets in: O.K., thats right.Im retiring now.Its actually a very peaceful feeling.He eventually turned to flying as an outlet, and in October he posted pictures of the plane he had recently purchased.Halladay, whose father was a pilot, knew the risks that flying presented.He joked about his wifes opposition to his purchasing the plane in a video that had been posted to YouTube by ICON but that was removed shortly after the crash.Shes fought me the whole way, Halladay said of his wife, Brandy.Hard, Brandy Halladay said in the video.I fought hard, I was very against it.She conceded after flying in the plane, though, that she understood the appeal.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Piloting small planes has long been popular among athletes, and Major League Baseball has lost other athletes to similar crashes.Thurman Munson, an All-Star catcher and the 10th captain of the Yankees, died after crashing a Cessna Citation in 1979.And Cory Lidle, a former teammate of Halladays on the 2003 Blue Jays, died in 2006 when a Cirrus SR20 he was flying with a co-pilot crashed into an apartment building on Manhattans Upper East Side.The fact that the Pasco County Sheriffs Office led Tuesdays recovery effort carried extra emotion because of Halladays personal relationship with the department, which included the donation of a police dog that the department named Doc, in reference to Halladays nickname.You wouldnt know what Roy did because Roy wouldnt tell you what he did, Nocco said.And thats the legacy of a great man.Halladay is survived by his wife and two sons, Ryan and Braden.
Joe Girardi Didnt Sufficiently Connect With Yankees Players, Cashman Says:::::Cashman would not address any specific instances of poor communication, but some examples were evident this year.Girardi a former catcher was so frustrated by Sanchezs inattentiveness on defense that he briefly benched him and publicly criticized him in August.And during the playoffs, closer Aroldis Chapman liked an Instagram post that urged the Yankees not to bring back Girardi, though he later said it was an accident.In an interview on the WFAN radio station that ran concurrently with Cashmans conference call, Girardi disputed the idea that there were any communication problems and described his relationship with Sanchez as supportive.I think Brian was looking for something different, and evidently I didnt fit the mold, said Girardi, who nonetheless did not give an alternative reason for his dismissal.Cashman, who dismissed reports that hinted at increasing friction between him and Girardi this season or that Girardi did not work well with the analytics staff, also said that Girardis managerial gaffe in the postseason neglecting to call for a replay challenge that may have prevented a loss to the Cleveland Indians in Game 2 of an American League division series had nothing to do with his ouster.Asked if Girardi would have been back had the Yankees reached the World Series instead of losing in a seven-game American League Championship Series to the Houston Astros, Cashman said: Its tough to put a hypothetical in there.We went where we went.After the Yankees lost Game 7 on Oct. 21, they returned home the next day.Cashman gave his recommendation to Hal Steinbrenner, the teams principal owner, the next day, and Girardi was informed the following day, a Tuesday.The decision was announced two days later, on Thursday morning an off day during the World Series.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Though Cashman, whose contract has expired as well, said he had not yet reached an agreement on a new deal with Steinbrenner, he made clear that he would like to return.He said there were other priorities: the move of Kevin Reese from pro scouting director to director of player development, scouting meetings that wrapped up Friday, next weeks general manager meetings and the hiring of a new manager.Advertisement Continue reading the main story That last task is certain to garner a great deal of attention.Of the six teams that parted ways with their managers at the end of this season, only the Yankees have yet to name a replacement, and Cashman indicated that the search was just getting underway.He is winnowing a list of prospective candidates to bring in for interviews.He declined to say how many people would be interviewed but said that a previous relationship with the Yankees or managerial experience was not a prerequisite.Theres no perfect person that checks every box, Cashman said.I dont care whether theyre Hall of Famer categories.Asked if Alex Rodriguez, who served this season as an adviser to Steinbrenner while being paid $21 million for the final year of his contract, was a candidate, Cashman said, I definitely do not want to go through who may or may not be a candidate.But he promised a transparent process, one in which as with the clubs last managerial opening, which occurred after Joe Torre was pushed out 10 years ago each candidate will meet with the local news media after being interviewed.While Girardi acutely prepared but with a stilted personality seemed the antithesis of the avuncular Torre, Cashman said it would be a mistake to think the Yankees would be turning toward somebody who was solely a master communicator.The best candidate will also have to also be well versed in analytics, understand the role of sports science and be willing to challenge conventional thinking.Its an easy narrative to run to the opposite of what you already had, Cashman said.If somebody was too, for instance, structured and demanding, then you want to go from an old-school, heavy-handed personality to a new-school players manager thats not a narrative Im falling into.Were looking for the best person possible.INSIDE PITCH The Yankees did not make a qualifying offer, worth $17.4 million, to three players eligible for it: pitchers C. C. Sabathia and Michael Pineda and designated hitter Matt Holliday.Third baseman Todd Frazier and pitcher Jaime Garcia were not eligible for qualifying offers because they were acquired during the season.All the players are now free agents.Outfielder Jake Cave and pitcher Nick Rumbelow were added to the 40-man roster.
Bob Bowman, Major League Baseballs Digital Mastermind, Steps Down:::::Advertisement Bob Bowman, Major League Baseballs Digital Mastermind, Steps Down Image Bob Bowman has overseen an operation that generates hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue annually.Credit Ed Andrieski/Associated Press The former baseball commissioner Bud Selig once called Major League Baseball Advanced Media, the leagues digital and video arm, one of the great success stories of not only the baseball business, but American business.The person most responsible for that success is Bob Bowman, its chief executive for 17 years.Major League Baseball announced on Monday that Bowman, 62, was stepping down as president of business and media when his contract expires at the end of the year.Bobs vision made our game even more accessible and enjoyable to millions of fans, Commissioner Rob Manfred said in a statement.In 2000, the 30 owners of Major League Baseball teams voted unanimously to contribute a combined $120 million $1 million per team for the first four years for equal ownership in Major League Baseball Advanced Media, or Bam as its known.It was an extraordinary investment.Bam would become the crown jewel of Major League Baseball, the envy of every sports league and one of the most important companies as the broadcast world transitioned to digital streaming.It generates hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue annually, and 75 percent of a spinoff company, BamTech, has been sold for $2.58 billion.Before being hired to run the newly-created Bam, Bowman had been the state treasurer of Michigan and a top executive at the conglomerate ITT Corp., which owned Madison Square Garden and the Knicks.Under Bowman, Bam has consistently been at the bleeding edge of technology, and transformed how fans consumed sports.Bam bought MLB.com and redesigned the leagues website; centralized and ran each team website; created MLB.TV, allowing subscribers to watch out-of-market games; and created the At Bat smartphone app, the highest-grossing sports app of all time, according to the league.Most important, the technology Bam developed to stream games simultaneously to hundreds of thousands of fans has underpinned some of the biggest internet streaming services.ESPN, HBO, WWE, Fox Sports and Hulu are some of the companies that have hired Bam to run their back-end streaming operations.In 2015, Bam spun off this part of the company as BamTech, and the next year Disney purchased a 33 percent stake for $1 billion.In August, Disney paid an additional $1.58 billion to increase its stake to 75 percent.By then, Bowman had stepped back from running BamTech on a day-to-day basis, though he remained on the board, focusing on his M.L.B.duties.As Manfred became commissioner in 2015, he promoted Bowman to oversee all of the leagues revenue-generating activities, like licensing and sponsorship, in addition to his Bam duties.What Bowman will do next is unclear.The leagues statement simply said that he was stepping away.Bowman did not respond to a request for comment.Follow Kevin Draper on Twitter: @kevinmdraper.Order Reprints | Todays Paper | Subscribe A version of this article appears in print on , on Page B 8 of the New York edition with the headline: M.L.B.s Digital Visionary To Resign at End of Year Sign up for the Sports Newsletter Get the big sports news, highlights and analysis from Times journalists, delivered to your inbox every week.SEE SAMPLE Please verify youre not a robot by clicking the box.* Required field You agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for The New York Times products and services.You are already subscribed to this email.Sign Up
Denmark 0-0 Republic of Ireland: Boys in Green play out goalless draw:::::Darren Randolph was the hero and Pione Sisto the villain as the Republic of Ireland scrapped their way to a 0-0 World Cup play-off draw in Denmark.Randolph produced a fine double save to deny Jens Stryger Larsen and Andreas Cornelius, and then saw Sisto fire wide of an open goal after he had beaten away Christian Eriksen's long-range effort during a torrid first half.Ireland, as so often in the past, adopted an ultra-conservative approach which saw them create little of note, but they frustrated the Danes and the majority of a crowd of 36,189 at the Parken Stadium for much of a largely unappetising 90 minutes with a functional display.The sides will reconvene at the Aviva Stadium on Tuesday night with a trip to Russia awaiting the victor, although a score draw will be enough for the Danes to snatch the ticket on away goals.They will do so with none of the 19 men who went into the first leg on a booking having collected another and therefore a ban.Manager Martin O'Neill sprung a surprise by handing Bristol City winger Callum O'Dowda a rare competitive start for his country - but there was nothing unusual about Ireland's approach.With Harry Arter protecting the back four and Daryl Murphy operating as a lone, isolated, striker, the visitors conceded possession and space and challenged their hosts to break them down.They did so on just two occasions before the break, and both might have resulted in the opening goal had it not been for Randolph's vigilance.Denmark skipper Simon Kjaer floated the ball over the top of Cyrus Christie for full-back Larsen to control expertly before firing in a shot from a tight angle which Randolph parried to Cornelius before blocking the striker's follow-up, after 11 minutes.The Middlesbrough goalkeeper was called upon once again 12 minutes before the break when, after skipper Ciaran Clark had served up Kasper Schmeichel's scuffed clearance to Eriksen, the Tottenham playmaker took aim from distance.Randolph beat away the initial attempt and the home fans rose in anticipation as the ball fell to Sisto, only for the frontman to steer his shot wastefully wide of the far post.Ireland came close to breaking the deadlock two minutes before half-time when full-back Christie cut inside Larsen on the right and stabbed a shot towards goal - but Schmeichel made an important block.O'Dowda got his head to a Robbie Brady cross but could not pick out a team-mate after Christie had made a 58th-minute charge down the right - but the traffic was heading largely in the opposite direction and Christie needed treatment after taking a well-struck Larsen shot in the face.The Republic's best hope of scoring looked to be a set-piece, and they might have done just that had Clark been able to take Brady's 67th-minute free-kick in his stride inside the box after it had sailed over Shane Duffy's head.Substitute Yussuf Poulsen went close as the home side responded, but in a frenzied conclusion, Shane Duffy headed straight at Schmeichel and Randolph had to tip over a last-gasp Poulsen header.
Dominic Solanke, Lewis Cook and Angus Gunn earn England call-ups following injury withdrawals:::::Dominic Solanke, Lewis Cook and Angus Gunn have been drafted into the England squad for the first time after Phil Jones became the eighth player to withdraw from Gareth Southgate's group.World Cup preparations kicked off with a promising goalless draw against holders Germany at Wembley on Friday, with five-time champions Brazil providing the opposition on Tuesday.Centre-back Jones will not be involved, however, after the centre-back was forced off midway through the first half against Germany and he has returned to Manchester United for treatment, leading Southgate to bolster his squad with three England Under-21 players.Solanke, Cook and Gunn got the nod after helping Aidy Boothroyd's Young Lions continue their unbeaten start to their Euro qualifying campaign with a 2-0 win over Ukraine.Liverpool striker Solanke opened the scoring in Kiev, continuing the fine international form that saw him win the Golden Ball as England lifted the Under-20 World Cup in the summer.Bournemouth midfielder Cook skippered the side to glory in South Korea.Goalkeeper Gunn, on loan from Manchester City at Norwich, comes in after Jack Butland broke his finger.Demarai Gray and Dominic Calvert-Lewin had also been under consideration for experience.Brazil offer England another chance to hone their three-man back line against elite opposition.Chelsea's Ruben Loftus-Cheek, currently on loan at Crystal Palace, was one of five players to make his debut against the world's top-ranked side and produced a man-of-the match display.Everton goalkeeper Jordan Pickford produced a string of fine saves on an impressive first senior appearance, but Joe Hart will be between the sticks against Brazil after Butland's injury caused a rethink."It was just a straightforward goalkeeping drill, nothing out of the ordinary and just caught his finger awkwardly," Southgate said."We would have played Jack in the game against Brazil.We were always going to play Jordan (on Friday night), but we'll now play Joe on Tuesday."There will be able a temptation to play Loftus-Cheek again after a man-of-the-match debut that followed Harry Winks' impressive bow in Lithuania last month.The 21-year-old midfielders improve midfield options that Southgate was bemoaning just months ago.Asked if the assured debuts of Loftus-Cheek and currently-injured Winks made him feel more positive about his options, the England boss said: "Yeah - and I think the slightly different system opens up different possibilities."In the position Ruben played (against Germany), you could play Dele (Alli) there, you could play (Adam) Lallana there, so that different sort of profile of midfield player with a deeper one behind."I think we need the stability of the three behind that at the moment, but also all of those guys at the back use the ball well."At times it was difficult for them to press us because of the composure we showed and the system we played, so I think it was a brilliant experience for our players."Harry Kane, Winks and Alli have withdrawn from this squad through injury, as have Raheem Sterling, Jordan Henderson and Fabian Delph.

Seven unheralded Premier League players performing brilliantly this season, including Young at Man United and Liverpool's Moreno:::::We are at the stage of the Premier League season when it can be assessed whether a player is putting in good performances or is struggling for form.After 11 matches some truly superb players are performing right at the top of their game; Kevin De Bruyne is once again being called a world class midfielder, while Romelu Lukaku, Harry Kane, Alvaro Morata and Sergio Aguero have all been banging the goals in.However, these players are the ones expected to perform brilliantly.But what about the so-called 'lesser' players who are proving the doubters wrong and putting in some of the best showings of the 2017-18 Premier League campaign?Click the right arrow, above, to see seven unheralded players who are performing brilliantly in the Premier League this season...
West Brom news: A Premier League assessment of Tony Pulis' men after eleven games:::::The Baggies made an encouraging start, finding themselves in second spot after winning their opening two league matches.But the story could not be more different now.West Brom are in free fall having not won a game since August.League position: 16th (10 points) Best game: Burnley 0-1 West Brom Worst game: Brighton & Hove Albion 3-1 West Brom Best player: Jonny Evans This has not been a vintage season for West Brom or Evans but the defender looks a cut above some of his teammates this season.The Northern Ireland international attracted the interest of Manchester City in the summer, but that move never materialised.Report West Brom fans will be worried about their club's recent form, but Pulis' track record suggests his team will comfortably avoid Championship football next season.However, they could do with another player to score goals as Jay Rodriguez appears to lack the sharpness he had before his long-term injury he sustained as a Southampton player in 2014.Grade: E
Ireland 38-3 South Africa: Springboks lose out in Dublin:::::Ireland were too good for South Africa in Dublin, scoring four tries in a convincing 38-3 victory on Saturday.South Africa look likely to beat Ireland to hosting Rugby World Cup 2023 - but on the field Joe Schmidt's men appear some distance ahead of the rebuilding Springboks.Andrew Conway set things in motion, snatching Conor Murray's bouncing ball high bomb clean away from three defenders, before racing into the corner.Rhys Ruddock sneaked home for Ireland's second try, after powerful Ulster wing Jacob Stockdale and Conway had cut South Africa apart.Rob Herring capped a driven lineout before Jacob Stockdale claimed the final try, as Ireland glossed the score at the end.Wing Conway excelled on claiming his first try on his fifth Test, the 26-year-old the beneficiary of Ireland's decision to omit Munster team-mate Simon Zebo - who heads to Racing 92 in France next season.Johnny Sexton booted 14 points at the Aviva Stadium as Schmidt's men oozed calmness against the robust but limited visitors.Ireland will move on to host Fiji and Argentina in the next fortnight, with hopes fast rising of a November clean sweep.Debutant centre Bundee Aki hurtled into Test rugby in an emotional dervish, almost crying in the anthems, then pummelling Coenie Oosthuizen in a brutal tackle.The Springboks prop hobbled off after his knee buckled under the sheer force, and one monster scrum later and Ireland had the lead.Sexton posted the penalty to settle November nerves, before Andries Coetzee kicked away poorly to botch a try-scoring chance for the visitors.Fly-half Sexton slotted two more penalties, first with South Africa killing the ball, then when Eben Etzebeth was pinged for kicking at a ruck.Iain Henderson then bulldozed towering Springboks skipper Etzebeth in a remarkable feat to shake the visitors' core.Ireland rocked the Springboks again with the first half's only try, Conway latching onto Murray's bouncing bomb with lightning speed, before haring into the corner for a fine finish.Sexton hit the post from the touchline conversion attempt, and then Ireland had to cling on.South Africa punted a facile penalty to the corner, but paid the price when CJ Stander conjured a masterful ruck turnover.The tourists botched another scoring chance when bungling an overlap, and Ireland carried their 14-0 lead into the break.A rare error from Stander, a high tackle on Tendai Mtawarira, handed the Springboks their first points on the restart, with Elton Jantjies slotting the penalty.Aki's big hit on Jesse Kriel and replacement flanker Ruddock's pivotal turnover set Ireland back on the front foot.Sexton's fourth penalty edged Ireland 17-3 ahead, before Ruddock powered home after Stockdale and Conway combined to devastating effect.That second score broke South Africa's stubborn resistance, and Herring quickly powered over for a well-worked driven lineout try.Stockdale capped a flowing move for the fourth with the game's final play, after smart industry from debutant Darren Sweetnam.
Wales 21-29 Australia: Wallabies triumph in Cardiff:::::Wales suffered a 13th successive defeat against Australia as the Wallabies claimed a hard-fought 29-21 victory in Cardiff.First-half tries by forwards Tatafu Polota-Nau, Aidan Coleman and captain Michael Hooper underpinned Australia's win as they warmed up impressively for a Twickenham appointment with England next Saturday.Wales had their moments in attack - wing Steff Evans scored an impressive try and substitute Hallam Amos claimed a late consolation score - but defensive hesitancy was punished by an Australian side high on confidence following their downing of world champions New Zealand three weeks ago.Full-back Kurtley Beale added a 62nd-minute breakaway try for the Wallabies, with fly-half Bernard Foley kicking three conversions and wing Reece Hodge booted a long-range penalty.while Wales full-back Leigh Halfpenny kicked three penalties and a conversion.Handling errors also let Wales down at crucial moments, yet given the absence of four injured British and Irish Lions - Sam Warburton, Justin Tipuric, Rhys Webb and George North - head coach Warren Gatland will be encouraged by his team's attacking intent.The selection of two midfield playmakers in Dan Biggar and Owen Williams, and the subsequent shift of tactical emphasis, worked more often than not, but Wales were far more stressed in defence, and Australia did not require a second invitation to capitalise as they made it nine years unbeaten against their hosts.And there was a potential major injury blow for Wales on the stroke of full-time when their star Lions centre Jonathan Davies was helped off injured.Australia made the initial running, dominating possession and territory, but Wales had a half-chance in the sixth minute when Liam Williams charged down Hodge's attempted clearance before the ball bounced safely into Foley's hands and he cleared from inside his 22.Wales went ahead through a Halfpenny penalty three minutes later, yet Australia looked more assured then their opponents with ball in hand and they opened their points account after wing Marika Koroibete ran powerfully from his own half.Australia then took play to within striking distance of Wales' line before relentlessly driving a lineout and Polota-Nau, who will join Aviva Premiership club Leicester next month, emerged with the ball from underneath his fellow forwards.Foley converted, but Wales responded impressively when centre Jonathan Davies broke clear, then scrum-half Gareth Davies exploited space and the ball was moved at pace before Halfpenny delivered a final pass to Evans, who finished impressively on his home Test debut.Halfpenny converted from the touchline, and Wales had scored more points inside the opening quarter then they managed in the whole game when Australia visited Cardiff 12 months ago.The lead, though, lasted barely five minutes.For all of Evans' attacking excellence, Australia looked to challenge him defensively, and he appeared out of position as Hodge almost grabbed Foley's well-placed kick, and when Wales struggled to clear, the Wallabies recycled possession expertly and Coleman crashed over.Foley's conversion made it 14-10 before the less-heralded kicking expertise of Hodge took centre-stage as he landed a superb 45-metre penalty from wide out before Halfpenny cancelled it out from much shorter range.Australia looked for another score as half-time approached, and it duly arrived when the Wallabies patiently built attacking phases and Wales ran out of defensive numbers as Hooper touched down to secure a nine-point interval advantage.Halfpenny opened the second-half scoring by completing his penalty hat-trick, and Wales enjoyed a strong third quarter in terms of territory, keeping Australia pinned deep before the full-back saw a penalty attempt from halfway drop agonisingly short.Wales then conceded a fourth try after Evans, who was struggling after being on the receiving end of a hefty collision moments earlier, coughed up possession, and Beale picked it up before sprinting 60 metres unopposed to effectively end the contest.Hooper collected a yellow card 12 minutes from time, and Gatland made four substitutions either side of the Wallabies captain's departure, including a Wales debut for Ospreys centre Owen Watkin.Further new caps arrived off the bench in Dragons prop Leon Brown and Ospreys flanker Sam Cross, a sevens specialist who made just his third appearance of professional 15-a-side rugby, but Australia had done enough to seal the deal.

England 21-8 Argentina: Eddie Jones maintains perfect record against Pumas:::::England made a scruffy start to their autumn series but still ensured they will enter their group showdown against Argentina at the 2019 Wold Cup with an immaculate record against the Pumas under Eddie Jones.A 21-8 victory at Twickenham gave Jones' men a fourth successive victory in the fixture but it was a disappointing way to open a schedule that continues against Australia and concludes with the visit of Samoa.It was among the poorest performances under the Australian as - having established a 14-3 half-time lead - they only moved out of sight in the final 15 minutes when Semesa Rokoduguni crossed.Missing the rested Owen Farrell and Maro Itoje - the former acting as waterboy - England toiled on a poor Twickenham pitch that had clearly suffered from staging the recent NFL matches.At one point Jones lost his cool, television cameras showing him slam his notebook down and mouth his displeasure - his first public display of anger since taking over in 2015.England were forced to overcome the 21st-minute departure of Mike Brown after he landed heavily on his head and shoulder after being challenged in mid-air by Joaquin Tuculet.Tuculet was sent to the sin-bin for a tackle that was either a red card or no offence under the current laws, but the outstanding Nathan Hughes was at least able to maraud over for the opening try in his absence.Brown's exit presented the opportunity to trial Anthony Watson, viewed as the Harlequins' player's eventual successor at full-back, and he acquitted himself well.Deputising for Farrell as goalkicker, George Ford proved his accuracy off the tee through three penalties and a conversion - with both missed chances hitting the uprights.Ford's first attempt bounced off the right post but the Leicester fly-half was more successful soon after to calm his nerves in a scrappy start.England, wearing their dark grey change kit, attacked with intent off a dominant scrum through Chris Robshaw and Courtney Lawes and in the 23rd minute they were over.Waves of attacks were launched with quick ball and when the Pumas were stretched Ford fired a long missed pass to Hughes, who stormed over in the right corner.An ugly spectacle continued to frustrate as neither side were able to build any momentum, play interrupted by a series of penalties, handling errors and aimless kicking.England went for touch instead of goal in their hunt for a second try but the visiting defence was resolute.Argentina fought back heading into the final quarter but missed penalties from Emiliano Boffelli and Nicolas Sanchez sucked the life out of their response.Instead, a counter-attack from England that started with Alex Lozowski sprinting out of his half and ended when Henry Slade found Rokoduguni through a long scoring pass swept the hosts out of reach.The Pumas had the final say when Sanchez slipped over after 30 phases, ending a flat afternoon.
Kyrie Irving injury: Celtics PG has minor facial fracture:::::Celtics point guard Kyrie Irving has been diagnosed with a minor facial fracture and is listed as doubtful for Sunday's game against the Raptors, the team announced on Saturday.#NEBHInjuryReport Kyrie Irving suffered a minor facial fracture last night.He is currently listed as doubtful for tomorrows game.Boston Celtics (@celtics) November 11, 2017 Irving is expected to return on Tuesday night and wear a mask for two weeks, reports The Vertical's Shams Charania.Irving suffered the injury during the Celtics' 90-87 win over the Hornets on Friday night.He left the game after being inadvertently struck by an elbow from his teammate Aaron Baynes.He was evaluated for a concussion.The Celtics have struggled with injuries on the young season.Gordon Hayward suffered a gruesome, season-ending ankle injury in the first quarter of the season-opener against the Cavaliers.Al Horford has missed the last two games to go through the league's concussion protocol, but he is expected to return on Sunday.After starting the season 0-2, the Celtics have won 11 straight.For the season, Irving is averaging 20.3 points, 5.2 assists and 3.1 rebounds.
Andrew Luck injury updates: QB reportedly gets treatment in England:::::Colts quarterback Andrew Luck is reportedly getting treatment in England for his shoulder injury, reports ESPN.Luck returned to practice in October for the first time since having surgery on a torn labrum 10 months ago.However, he began to suffer inflammation, so he's being held form practice with no timetable on his return.He was placed on the injured reserve list on Nov. 3, ending his season.Colts general manager Chris Ballard has not put a timetable on Luck's return.Luck originally injured his shoulder in 2015, missing two games because of the shoulder and the final seven with a lacerated kidney.He played last season and threw for 4,240 yards and 31 touchdowns last season.
Ohio State's Jerome Baker, Dante Booker in concussion protocol:::::Ohio State dominated No.12 Michigan State Saturday 48-3 despite being without two of its leading tacklers in linebackers Jerome Baker and Dante Booker.A source tells SI that both are in concussion protocol and their return for next weeks game against Illinois is questionable.The two linebackers were injured in last weekends loss at Iowa.The Buckeyes replaced them against MSU with Malik Harrison and Tuf Borland, who played middle linebacker, and starting MLB Chris Worley shifted back to outside linebacker where he played last season.Baker is No.3 on the team with 44 tackles while Booker is tied for third in TFLs with 5.0.Against the Spartans.Borland was OSUs leading tackler with 11 and a sack while Harrison had six and also posted a sack.MSU managed just 1.9 yards per rush and only 195 total yards.The 45-point margin of victory for the Buckeyes marked the largest for Ohio State in a game against the Spartans.
Tearful Neymar Leaves Press Conference as Brazil Boss Tite Defends His Star Man After Japan Win:::::It was an emotional time for Neymar on Friday after Brazil's 3-1 win over Japan in Lille, the Daily Mail reported.The PSG superstar broke down in tears during the post match conference after Brazil coach Tite came to his defence amidst reports from French publication L'Equipe claiming the 25-year-old had developed a fractious relationship with PSG boss Unai Emery following his 198m world-record transfer move from Barcelona this summer.The Brazilian forward firmly denied the claims at the press conference in Lille and was backed by Tite, who himself had to quash suggestions that he and Neymar had previously endured a troubled relationship.The 56-year-old stated: "I keep hearing that Tite has problems with Neymar and I am tired of hearing that... we are tired of it.PHILIPPE HUGUEN/GettyImages "I know that if he did have problems, then he would have the decency and the good character to talk about them in the dressing room."I can talk about Neymar's temperament, his good nature and his big heart."A tearful Neymar was evidently impacted by Tite's kind words and left the press conference after being patted on the head by the Brazil coach.However, prior to Tite speaking at the press conference, Neymar stated that he is 'happy' in Paris and dismissed reports that he currently has a sour relationship with Emery or PSG team-mate Edinson Cavani.PHILIPPE HUGUEN/GettyImages Neymar and Cavani were involved in a controversy earlier in September during a match against Lyon where the pair argued over penalty duties.Despite the dispute, Neymar said: "I'm very well in Paris, I'm happy.I'm motivated to be a player who gives everything on the pitch."Anyway, there's something that is bothering me a lot I don't have a problem with Cavani, I don't have a problem with the coach."I want you to stop inventing stories that I have problems with the coach.I came to help, to contribute, I came to help my coach."It's something that has been bothering me, I even talked about it with Tite.So I'm asking you to stop."FRANCK FIFE/GettyImages Neymar's quotes came after stories from Le Parisien were published in Spain last month which suggested he enjoys special privileges at PSG.The Brazilian playmaker allegedly has his own dedicated team of physios who do not treat any other players and has permission to not track back during games.Other players at the club have been warned not to tackle him hard in training and have to travel with official club luggage while Neymar is free to use his own brands.In the face of these reports Neymar will be keen to do most of his talking on the pitch.It is evident that he and PSG will need to remain united as a team if they are to reach the heights so many expect them to this season.
Oklahoma St. beats Iowa St. with end zone interception (VIDEO):::::Oklahoma State clinched a crucial Big 12 victory over Iowa State with a controversial end zone interception with just 32 seconds remaining.After coming up with a crucial stop on third down, Iowa State got the ball back on its own 13 with 2:45 left.Redshirt freshman quarterback Zeb Norland, who entered the game after the starter Kyle Kempt came out with an injury, led the Cyclones down the field on a drive that included a fourth-and-13 conversion.On second-and-goal from the three yard line, Norland threw a fade into the end zone, and Oklahoma State cornerback A.J.Green made the pick.The play was reviewed as referees checked for a simultaneous catch, as Green and the Iowa State receiver, Marchie Murdock, were wrestling for the ball on the ground.It was somewhat reminiscent of the infamous simultaneous catch called by replacement NFL referees in 2012.Oklahoma State seals the win with a late interception!#OKSTvsISU pic.twitter.com/TV7gJJRP0n Chat Sports (@ChatSports) November 11, 2017 The win keeps Oklahoma State in the race for a berth in the Big 12 championship game, while the loss realistically ends Iowa State's conference title hopes.
Veterans Day: Stephen Curry pens essay:::::Golden State's point guard Stephen Curry penned an essay discussing an athlete's platform, and the idea that athletes have disrespected the military for The Players' Tribune in honor of Veterans Day.Called "The Noise," the essay discuses an athlete's decision to use their platform in protest of social issues.He discussed the issue of using sports as a form of protest when he's talked with former veterans."And every single veteran Ive spoken to, theyve all said pretty much the exact same thing: That this conversation weve started to have in the world of sports whether its been Colin kneeling, or entire NFL teams finding their own ways to show unity, or me saying that I didnt want to go to the White House its the opposite of disrespectful to them."As we celebrate Veterans today, let us be louder than all of this silence and quieter than all of this noise.https://t.co/xUMtcf8Tbm Stephen Curry (@StephenCurry30) November 11, 2017 He talked about how on his wife restaurants' opening, he meant a veteran named Michael, and they had a long conversation about the needs of veterans."We hear all the time on TV and social media about supporting our troops.But its not just about saluting them or thanking them for their service at the airport and its definitely not just about how we observe the national anthem.Michael told me that our veterans need real action.They need real help with medical services, and access to jobs, and readjusting to society."He also talked about the morning he woke up in surprise to find President Donald Trump tweeted at him.He stated that its the same people who couldn't understand his decision to not go to the White House, who think that peaceful protests are a sign of disrespect.He listed this as the main reason why he wrote the post, that he wanted to talk about "real issues."He ended his essay by saying, "Lets use our platforms, and take this day, to talk about how we can be louder than all of this silence and quieter than all of this noise."
Ohio State beats Michigan State to keep playoff hopes alive:::::Ohio States football team may not have been consistent over the past few weeks but its ceiling is as high as any team in college football.There was no denying Urban Meyers teams skill on either side of the ball Saturday, when the No.13 Buckeyes hosted No.12 Michigan State and trounced the Spartans, 48-3.That result came on the heels of a week when Michigan State beat Penn State, 27-24, and Ohio State lost to Iowa, 55-24.In a Big Ten with a muddled top tier, last week only further confused things, especially in the Eastand it rendered this game essentially a showdown for the division.After the beatdown, Ohio State has all but clinched the East and a trip to Indianapolis, barring losing out against Illinois and Michigan.Ohio State still has a near-impossible road to the playoff.Though Washingtons loss Friday to Stanford essentially eliminated itand the Pac-12from the field and pulled one less opponent out from in front of the Buckeyes, a lot more losing needs to happen among the current top 8 to make room for a two-loss team.Theres still a chance, and for now Ohio State must win out and beat Wisconsin in the conference title game, a 3-0 run thats well within the realm of possibility.Last week against Iowa, there was cause for concern with Ohio States much-lauded new-look offense under coordinator Kevin Wilson.Quarterback J.T.Barrett, who to that point had been mounting a case for Heisman consideration, threw four interceptions, setting the tone for a sloppy game on that side of the ball.Up to that point, hed tossed just one pick, in the Buckeyes Week 2 loss to Oklahoma, but on Saturday, he added two more to his season total.Fortunately, Michigan State wasnt able to manufacture a single point off the mistakes, but Barretts inconsistency in recent weeksagainst good opponentsis something to keep an eye on.The Ohio State offense still flourished Saturday, and Barretts stat line was plenty respectable.He finished with two touchdown passes and 183 yards in the air.Michigan State also let the Buckeyes run all over them; two Ohio State rushers, J.K. Dobbins and Mike Weber, finished with more than 100 yards on the ground.But just as notable was the Buckeye defense, which finished with six sacks, toppling Michigan State quarterback Brian Lewerke with players from its first-, second- and third-string defenses.The Spartans offense finished with just 195 total yards, kicking a single field goal.Its average drive covered 16 yards.And though the Buckeyes have been just fine on defense so far this season, Saturdays performance was by far their best.Blanking Rutgers and holding Army to a touchdown hardly compare to limiting an offense thats been averaging 402 yards per game to fewer than 200.From here, Ohio State controls its path to Indianapolis.Unlike a year ago, when they missed the conference championship game but still earned a playoff berth, the Buckeyes need to win their division to have a hope at being among college footballs final four teams.Saturday went a long way toward keeping that hope, however slim, alive.

UCLA shoplifting: Bill Walton apologizes 'on behalf of human race':::::After three UCLA players were arrested for shoplifting while in China, Bruins great Bill Walton offered an apology as the UCLAGeorgia Tech finally tipped off in Shanghai, China.Walton was doing color commentary for ESPN, when he apologized on "behalf of the human race" for the incident.Freshmen LiAngelo Ball, Jalen Hill and Cody Riley were arrested Tuesday for shoplifting from a Louis Vuitton store next to the team's hotel in Hangzhou.The trio was released on bail and returned to the hotel.Bill Walton apologizes in behalf of " the entire human race" for LiAngelo Ball and his teammates stealing sunglasses in China pic.twitter.com/O7VluvbRsU gifdsports (@gifdsports) November 11, 2017 I am sad, disappointed and embarrassed.This is a very big deal, Walton said.The noble purpose here has been stained.Our host, Alibaba China, the people, they have been better than perfect in everything.Theyve done everything right to make this all work.Now members of our family have displayed an appalling lack of honor, a lack of respect, a lack of decency by doing something in someone elses home that they would never do in their own.And I want to apologize right now on behalf of the human race for this travesty.UCLA will reportedly fly home without the players who might remain there for another week or two.
Report: Real Madrid Set to Spend Big for Neymar:::::Real Madrid are reportedly keen on splashing a staggering 200m to sign Paris St-Germain's star and former Barcelona forward Neymar.Los Blancos seem ready to welcome new players into their La Liga and Champions League-winning squad, as they prepare for the arrival of young ace Vinicius from June 2018 and are said to be willing to break Neymar's release clause to bring him to Madrid.The news, which has been spread out by Marca, comes shortly after rumours that he confessed to Brazilian teammate Marcelo that he regrets leaving Spain to move to France.His possible departure from the Stade des Princes could also follow speculations that would have him involved in a series of rows with PSG manager Unai Emery.After less than six months in Ligue 1, Neymar has already scored 11 times for the French giants and it seems unlikely that he will leave anytime soon.But Real Madrid could be keen on waiting until the 2019/2020 season.Asked about it, Real Madrid captain Sergio Ramos was not able to hide his wish to play alongside a striker like him: "I like to have the best and its clear Neymar is one of them," he told Cadena Ser ."Maybe it was easier for him to go to PSG, instead of directly to Real Madrid.They are personal decisions, you never know what can happen because football goes around a lot.I already have the door open for him if he wants to come.I also have a good relationship with him.This summer, Real Madrid failed to sign their main target Kylian Mbappe, who, like Neymar, chose to join PSG, despite huge deal offers were coming from Los Blancos.A post shared by Nj neymarjr (@neymarjr) on Nov 10, 2017 at 9:58am PST With Gareth Bale constantly exposed to injuries and Karim Benzema rumoured to be keen on parting ways with Real Madrid, Los Galacticos need to sign someone new as soon as possible, and the Brazilian may as well be the ideal choice.

Given Arsenal's Lack of Balls in Midfield Should Wilshere and Coquelin Be Thrown Back in?:::::Arsenal have made an indifferent start to the 2017/18 season.Currently sitting in sixth place on 19 points, they are only three points off the top four, but are already 12 points behind table-toppers Manchester City.It already looks like the title is out of reach for the very few that thought Arsenal had a chance at winning it.It seems like the same problems continue to show their ugly head.No midfield balance, not tracking back, and a lack of steel.But for the two midfielders that this piece is centred around, you would be hard-pressed to find people that attach those qualities to these academy graduates.The centre midfield position in football is fundamental to any success.The engine room of the entire team has to function as a cohesive unit as the focal point of the team.In recent games however, the Arsenal defence has been lacking the creativity in that area that is needed to push the team forward.To highlight the lack of creativity coming from that area of the Gunners, the only two players with more than one assist this season are Granit Xhaka and summer signing Sead Kolasinac.To put that into perspective, table toppers Manchester City have six players who have multiple assists this season with David Silva and Kevin De Bruyne combining for 13 themselves.Granted that chief playmaker Mesut Ozil has been in and out of the side due to injury, but its evident that Arsenal are in desperate need of more creativity.Thats where Jack Wilshere comes in.His performances in the Europa League this season have had an extremely nostalgic yet upsetting feel about it.He has marshalled the games and been the driving force to everything good that has happened with the team.In his most recent performance against Red Star Belgrade, it was clear to see why the Gunners faithful were clamouring for Wilshere to return to first-team football.In the lead up to the winning goal, he and Walcott played a beautiful 1-2 pass and Wilshere returned the pass with an outrageous outside of the boot spinning pass that highlighted the guile and unorthodox thinking this Arsenal attack has been lacking.But with a severe injury record, Wengers tentative approach to Wilshere is understandable.In a season where he is playing for a new contract, allowing him to play the game at 100% is imperative rather than risking a further injury setback.With the current personnel that the Gunners currently have at their disposal, a change in formation to a three man midfield with four at the back could suit them best, and this could mean the reintroduction of Francis Coquelin.The man nicknamed The Policeman by club legend Thierry Henry has steadily fallen down the pecking order due to the form of others and injuries.Brought back from Charlton to feature in a starring role in the 2014/15 that culminated in a starting role in the FA Cup final, Coquelin was instrumental in the middle of the park.The partnership he formed with Santi Cazorla was instrumental to the success that Arsenal found, but with the acquisition of Granit Xhaka, he was demoted to the bench.However, the Frenchman does have a unique skillset that nobody else on the team does.Not the prettiest on the ball, his rugged approach to the game and ability to snuff out opposition attacks has been missed in the middle of the park as Ramsey and Xhaka have been frequently exposed to the counter-attack.The Xhaka-Ramsey pivot in the middle of the park offers the back three very little protection.A switch in formation to bring in Wilshere and Coquelin could prove fruitful adding steel, but also creativity.However, it is highly doubtful that Wenger utilises this formation because it would force Ozil into a wider position unless Wenger was to run a diamond formation and put two strikers up front.The two Arsenal graduates could easily find their way back into the team as their qualities are few and far between in the rest of the squad, but whether this will happen remains to be seen.
After QB injuries, are the Packers and Texans doomed?:::::Injuries to big-name players have been an unfortunate theme of the 2017 NFL season.Perhaps we should have seen David Johnsons Week 1 wrist injury as an omen.Since then, a depressing amount of real-life and fantasy stars have landed on IR.Two of the biggest play the sports most important position.Its there where we train our focus to kick off the Week 10 Cheat Sheet.Injuries to Aaron Rodgers and Deshaun Watson have seemingly killed the fantasy value of the skill players tied to them.Do you have more hope for the Packers or Texans backs and receivers the rest of the season?Or, are they all doomed?T.J. Hernandez: Rolling out any skill position player on either of these teams is going to be a risky endeavor each week, but volume is the ultimate driver of fantasy points and the Texans at least have a somewhat concentrated offense.DeAndre Hopkins leads the league in percentage of team targets, and in Tom Savage's first start after Watsons injury he was targeted 16 times.Lamar Miller has accounted for nearly two-thirds of Houston's backfield touches this season, I though there are instances where D'Onta Foreman has cut into Miller's touch share.4for4's Rest of Season Rankings show both Hopkins and Miller as top-12 players at their respective positions.The Packers, on the other hand, have committed to a running back committee and 24 receivers have seen a higher target share than any Green Bay pass-catcher this season.On an offense that will struggle to move the ball with a turnover-prone quarterback, spreading out touches might kill everyone's fantasy value in Lambeau.Michael Beller: I agree with T.J. think the Packers skill players are screwed.Of course I do, right?Im the guy who said you should bench Jordy Nelson this week.This is a lost offense without Aaron Rodgers.Hes the guy who makes everything go, and without him this looks like a pedestrian group.Aaron Jones and Ty Montgomery are going to split the work in the backfield, and they could be doing so in negative game scripts more often than not.Not one of post-ACL Nelson, Davante Adams or Randall Cobb are particularly dangerous deep threats, but at least teams had to respect that possibility with Rodgers on the field.Thats not the case with Hundley.Packers receivers can likely expect a lot of press coverage and short, low-risk throws near the line of scrimmage.Thats not a great path to fantasy value.Nelson and Adams were, and still are, threats in the red zone, but how many red-zone possessions per game can we expect from an offense led by Hundley?This could be a particularly ugly second half of the season in Green Bay.Theres reason for hope in Houston, though, and T.J. nailed it.Savage is not goodhe appears to be very bad, in factbut at least Hopkins and Miller should compile a ton of volume.Our colleague Chris Raybon has done excellent work looking at how running backs and receivers can subsist on volume, and Hopkins and Miller are going to have plenty of it in this offense.The value of each individual target and carry wont be as great as it was with Watson at the helm, but all those targets and carries will accumulate and keep both as reliable fantasy contributors.Ive got Hopkins and Miller pegged for low-end No.1 production at their respective positions the rest of the year.As for Will Fuller, hes in serious trouble.He does not get enough volume to get by with a quarterback like Savage.The touchdown upside he had with Watson is gone.Jennifer Eakins: Im going to go with door No.3 here and say that both offenses are doomed.Brett Hundley and the Packers have a rough three weeks ahead of them schedule-wise.Theyre set to face three teams in a row, two on the road, that are in the top 10 against the pass.The path for the Texans isnt any rosier, with the Jaguars, Ravens and Rams, all of which are in the top five against the pass, on tap.Football Outsiders ranks Houstons offensive line ranks 30th and Green Bays 25th in pass blocking.Neither Hundley nor Tom Savage has the chops to overcome such tough odds, and their position players will suffer a slow, painful fantasy death.

Three more youngsters called into England squad for Brazil:::::LONDON (Reuters) - England coach Gareth Southgate has called up three more youngsters for the teams home friendly against Brazil on Tuesday.Soccer Football - International Friendly - England vs Germany - Wembley Stadium, London, Britain - November 10, 2017 England manager Gareth Southgate before the match Action Images via Reuters/Carl Recine Southgate, who gave five players their international first-team debuts against Germany on Friday, has added goalkeeper Angus Gunn, defender Lewis Cook and striker Dominic Solanke to the squad for Tuesdays Wembley encounter with the five-times World Cup winners.All three were in action on Friday for Englands under-21 side in Ukraine -- and the latter two featured in the under-20s World Cup-winning campaign earlier this year.Manchester Citys Gunn, 21, who is on loan at second-tier Norwich City, was called up to replace Jack Butland, who broke a finger in training.Cook, of Bournemouth, and Liverpools Solanke, both 20, join an already young squad hit by injuries to senior players, including Dele Alli and Harry Kane, and now without Manchester United defender Phil Jones, who limped off after less than half an hour of the Germany match with what England say is a thigh problem.Harry Maguire, Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Tammy Abraham all made their senior debuts on Friday and were joined by two more debutants -- substitutes Joe Gomez and Jack Cork -- during the game.The starting 11 had just 101 caps between them -- their most inexperienced side since 1980.
Bottas grabs pole while Hamilton crashes out:::::SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Valtteri Bottas took pole position for Mercedes at the Brazilian Formula One Grand Prix on Saturday while team mate and newly-crowned four-times world champion Lewis Hamilton will start at the back after crashing out.Formula One F1 - Brazilian Grand Prix 2017 - Sao Paulo, Brazil - November 11, 2017 Mercedes' Valtteri Bottas celebrates getting pole position with Lewis Hamilton after qualifying REUTERS/Paulo Whitaker Ferraris Sebastian Vettel will join the Finn, who is 15 points behind him in the championship, on the front row with his Finnish team mate Kimi Raikkonen third and Red Bulls Max Verstappen fourth.The pole was the third of Bottass career and he did it with a track record time of one minute 08.322 seconds at a damp Interlagos.It feels good.It was so close with Seb all through qualifying, said the Finn, who was 0.038 quicker than Vettel.Its a shame Lewis went out but Im happy I could do a good job for the team.Hamilton, who clinched his fourth world championship in Mexico two weeks ago, had been hoping for a 12th pole of the season but spun into the barrier at turn seven in the opening session before he could set a lap time.Vettel had been on provisional pole until Bottas produced his late burst of speed and the German looked forward to a good scrap on Sunday.For tomorrow I think its fine.I think I chickened out a bit on the brakes into Turn One on the final run, he said.But our long run looked good compared to Valtteri so I am feeling good for tomorrow.Hamiltons was a rare mistake by Britains most successful racing driver, and last years winner from pole at Interlagos, and he will now have to fight through from the back for the second race in a row.Formula One F1 - Brazilian Grand Prix 2017 - Sao Paulo, Brazil - November 11, 2017 Mercedes' Valtteri Bottas celebrates getting pole position with Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel after qualifying REUTERS/Ueslei Marcelino The Mercedes driver won the title by finishing ninth in Mexico after a first lap collision with Vettel sent both to the back of the field.His mechanics will have work to do, with the impact causing damage to the left side of the Mercedes and ripping off the front wheel and suspension.Hamilton, unhurt and smiling somewhat unconvincingly as he spoke to reporters later, said it had all happened really quickly.Slideshow (6 Images) It is what it is.Of course its unfortunate.Challenges are what makes life interesting and overcoming them makes life meaningful, I guess, said the 32-year-old.Im just going to try to take whatever bubble of negativity comes from that experience and move forwards and try to grow from it.Its very unusual of me but just shows that were all human and things happen.I will try to have as much fun as possible tomorrow, added Hamilton.Years ago I came from quite far behind and had a great race.Australian Daniel Ricciardo qualified fifth fastest for Red Bull but has a 10 place grid penalty as a result of power unit changes.That will lift Mexican Sergio Perez, for Force India, to fifth with McLarens double world champion Fernando Alonso set to start sixth.Brazilian Felipe Massa, preparing for a home farewell in the penultimate race of his last season in Formula One, will start ninth.
Is clock ticking on tennis marathons?:::::LONDON (Reuters) - Keith Glass took the balls to serve during the second set of his match against Anthony Fawcett in the 1975 Surrey grass court championships and served, and served and served... and served.FILE PHOTO: A spectator photographs a plaque attached to the wall of number 18 court after the match in 2010 that lasted more than 11 hours, between John Isner of the U.S. and Nicolas Mahut of France, at the Wimbledon tennis championships in London June 21, 2011.REUTERS/Suzanne Plunkett File Photo Eighty points, and 37 deuces, later, in which time an adjacent match started and finished, he finally won the game.He lost the match, fatigue getting the better of him, but gained a place in the record books as having contested the longest single game ever recorded.Such freakish passages of play are rare, but are what make the unique tennis scoring system, with origins in the 16th Century, a thing of wonder.The principal of winning a game by two clear points, or a set by two clear games, is ingrained in the psyche of club hackers and elite pros alike -- so much so that the almost ubiquitous deciding set tiebreaks still rankle with many.Wimbledon remains true to tradition, as demonstrated in bizarre circumstances in 2010 when American John Isner and Frenchman Nicolas Mahut contested the longest match of all time -- an 11 hour five minute monster spanning three days in which the 138-game fifth set alone lasted eight hours and 11 minutes.Which is why the inaugural Next Gen ATP Finals, which concluded in Milan on Saturday, caused such a stir.The event, showcasing the best players in the world aged 21 and under, ripped an ace through the rulebook with a raft of innovations the ATP claim can re-invent tennis.Shot clocks enforced the 25-second between points rule, warm-ups were shortened, and sets were to four games not six, with tiebreaks at 3-3.Even service lets were scrapped.The crowd could eavesdrop as players discussed tactics with their coaches via enormous headphones and line judges were replaced by live Hawkeye calling.Even the court looked different, with doubles lines removed and a huge mock-up of Milans La Scala at one end complete with a resident DJ pumping out tunes at changeovers.It was tennis but not as we know it.Gimmicky perhaps, but the good-sized crowds loved the rock and roll tennis served up by the exciting talents such as Denis Shapovalov, Andrey Rublev and Chung Hyeon -- three players tipped to fill the void when Roger Federer and co retire.FILE PHOTO: John Isner of the U.S. (L) and France's Nicolas Mahut pose for a photograph next to the scoreboard on court 18 after their record breaking match at the 2010 Wimbledon tennis championships in London, June 24, 2010.REUTERS/Suzanne Plunkett/File Photo The players bought into the experiment, producing some eye-catching duels.However, while they were positive to some of the new rules, messing with the scoring system touched a nerve.In Milan, the first deuce effectively became a sudden death deciding point, meaning games could contain a maximum of seven points, 73 less than Glasss epic.ATP chief executive Chris Kermode, trying to balance tradition with the task of future-proofing the sport, said the quickfire scoring reduced dead periods in matches.The players, willing guinea pigs, were lukewarm about it.Russian 20-year-old Rublev suggested it reduced a tight match to a lucky dip.With these rules, everyone can beat everyone and I dont think thats very fair, he said.The winner should be the guy who works harder for it.While the best-of-five set format meant players still required to win 12 games for victory -- as they do on the regular ATP tour -- matches often resembled a series of short sprints.Missing were the elongated games, the mini-battles that often decide who wins the war.In this brave new world, the mesmerising 13-deuce game between Novak Djokovic and Stan Wawrinka in the 2013 U.S. Open semi-final or the 20-minute game won by Steffi Graf in the 1995 Wimbledon final against Arantxa Sanchez Vicario would not exist.I think tennis would lose something, it would become more clinical Glass told Reuters.But they said the same about tiebreaks and they are appreciated now.But I would be sad if they decided this was the way to go.Kermode said no changes to the scoring would happen in the next five years but said in 10 years it was conceivable, saying there had already been interest from tournaments directors of the often struggling ATP 250 events.It is unlikely to ever affect Federer, but the 19-times grand slam champion, while admitting to enjoying watching developments in Milan, has urged caution, saying it could rob the sport of its variety.Longer sets allow you to stretch a lead, try different things, he said.You can work on stuff -- whereas, when every point counts so much, theres no room for anything any more.The debate will rage on but in this time-hungry technological age, tennis cannot afford to stand still.
Randolph frustrates Denmark as Ireland grab goalless draw:::::COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Goalkeeper Darren Randolph pulled off a string of fine first-half saves as Ireland held Denmark to a scoreless draw in the first leg of their World Cup playoff on Saturday, with the two sides due to meet again in Dublin on Tuesday.Soccer Football - 2018 World Cup Qualifications - Europe - Denmark v Ireland - Telia Parken, Copenhagen, Denmark - November 11, 2017 Ireland's Callum O'Dowda in action with Denmark's Thomas Delaney.Scanpix Denmark/Lars Moeller via REUTERS The Irish defended deeply form the first whistle, denying playmaker Christian Eriksen space, but the Danes still managed to fashion half a dozen scoring chances in a goalless first half.With his side barely venturing forward in attack, Randolph was called into action early, parrying a stinging volley from Jens Stryger Larsen and smothering an attempt from Andreas Cornelius to hammer home the rebound.Eriksen and Pione Sisto also went close for Denmark in quick succession, and Randolph tipped over a late header from Yussuf Poulsen to ensure his side escaped from the Danish capital with a draw.
Four-try Ireland hammer dreadful South Africa 38-3:::::DUBLIN (Reuters) - Ireland built on last years successful November series against the best of the southern hemisphere by recording their biggest ever victory over a dreadful South Africa side in a 38-3 hammering at Dublins Aviva Stadium on Saturday.Rugby Union - Autumn Internationals - Ireland vs South Africa - Aviva Stadium, Dublin, Ireland - November 11, 2017 Ireland's Rhys Ruddock celebrates scoring a try with team mates REUTERS/Clodagh Kilcoyne Looking set to lose out to the South Africans in the race to host the 2023 World Cup next week, Ireland took their revenge on the pitch and were superior all over against a team they could meet in the quarter-finals of the 2019 tournament in Japan.Four penalties from Johnny Sexton and a first international try for Andrew Conway put Ireland in control before three tries in the last 10 minutes from Rhys Ruddock, Rob Herring and Jacob Stockdale completed South Africas wretched evening.To beat any southern hemisphere team is a big ask and to do it by that margin ... but I thought the new faces were outstanding and we were pretty clinical, man-of-the-match Sexton said in a pitchside interview.The hosts dominated up front early on, taking advantage of the loss of South Africa prop Coenie Oosthuizen to injury following a big first-minute hit from debutant Bundee Aki as Sexton kept the scoreboard ticking over with three penalties.Irelands dominance at the scrum - with a rejuvenated Cian Healy making his mark in a rare big-game start - continued and the home side began to find more room out wide while easily stifling any counter-attacks with a high defensive line.Rugby Union - Autumn Internationals - Ireland vs South Africa - Aviva Stadium, Dublin, Ireland - November 11, 2017 South Africa players look dejected REUTERS/Clodagh Kilcoyne It was poor Springbok defence that led to the first try, letting an innocuous Conor Murray box-kick bounce 30 metres out and into the arms of Munster wing Conway, who darted in to make it 14-0.Conway, winning his fourth cap, was particularly impressive among the inexperienced Irish players given an opportunity, with big winger Stockdale and New Zealand-born centre Aki very solid in defence.Slideshow (7 Images) A woeful first half for the South Africans was summed up just before the break when, closing in on the Irish line, flanker Siya Kolisis attempt to find a teammate drifted forward and out of play.Elton Jantjies got the visitors on the board with an early second-half penalty but they continued to look more like the team who were hammered 57-0 by New Zealand in September than the one who lost by a point to the world champions last month.Sexton restored the advantage with another penalty before the late flurry of tries, with Ruddock barrelling over first, followed by fellow replacement Herring and Stockdale, both of whom also scored for the first time for their country.Ireland, who beat New Zealand for the first time a year ago, will expect to make it a clean sweep with tests against Fiji and Argentina ahead while South Africa will look to start again against France next week before travelling to Italy and Wales.
Chung beats Rublev to become first Next Gen champion:::::MILAN (Reuters) - South Korean iceman Chung Hyeon doused the fire of Russian Andrey Rublev to win the inaugural Next Gen ATP Finals on Saturday -- pocketing a $390,000 (295,668) cheque in the process.FILE PHOTO - South Korea's Hyeon Chung hits a shot during his first round match against Serbia's Novak Djokovic at the Australian Open tennis tournament at Melbourne Park, Australia, January 18, 2016.REUTERS/Jason Reed Picture Supplied by Action Images Chung, 21, was outplayed in the first set and was 3-1 behind in the second set before taking over to win 3-4(5) 4-3(2) 4-2 4-2 to go through the five-day round-robin tournament unbeaten.A high-quality final full of sublime ball-striking was a fitting end to a promising debut for an event which has experimented with a range of innovations such as shorts sets, sudden-death deuces and on-court coaching.The 20-year-old Rublev, at 37th the highest-ranked qualifier for the event restricted to players aged 21 and under, lost his cool as the relentless Chung turned the match around.But the Muscovite showed tremendous resolve to survive a deciding point deuce, effectively match point, when serving at 1-3 in the fourth set, winning a ferocious baseline exchange.The 54th-ranked Chung showed his first sign of nerves when he double-faulted at 30-30 in the next game but Rublev wasted the break point with a shanked forehand.At deuce Rublev still had the chance to drag the set into a tiebreak but Chung struck a forehand winner to seal victory in just under two hours of compelling action.Chung, 21, is the first South Korean to win an ATP singles trophy since Hyung Taik-lee captured the 2003 Sydney title by beating Juan Carlos Ferrero.Rublev, who began his ATP Tour title collection in Umag this year, looked close to tears at the end but his performance, and that of Chungs, suggested both will be challenging for some of the biggest prizes in the sport before long.Add in the likes of Canadian teenager Denis Shapovalov, who dazzled in the Fiera Milano venue earlier in the week, beaten semi-finalists Daniil Medvedev and Croatian Borna Coric and a third Russian, Karen Khachanov, not to mention American Jared Donaldson, and the future looks bright for the mens Tour.Whether or not any of the rule changes trialled this week ever become regular features remains to be seen, although the 25-second shot clock and shorter warm-ups were popular with players and fans alike.
Stuttering England beat Argentina 21-8:::::LONDON (Reuters) - England got their November international series off to a victorious but hardly glorious start on Saturday when they forced their way past Argentina 21-8 at Twickenham in a stuttering game with barely any flowing rugby.Rugby Union - Autumn Internationals - England vs Argentina- Twickenham Stadium, London, Britain - November 11, 2017 Englands Ellis Genge in action with Argentinas Leonardo Senatore Action Images via Reuters/Andrew Boyers Argentina came into the match having won only one game all year against Georgia and, not helped by missing five of six goalkicks, they never looked remotely like avoiding a fourth loss in 13 months to England, who they will meet again in the pool stage of the 2019 World Cup.England led 14-3 at the break with a try by number eight Nathan Hughes and, though Semesa Rokoduguni added a second after 67 minutes, instead of a late flurry of home points, Argentina finished on top and scored their only try through Nicolas Sanchez.Argentina had won only five games in the 24 since reaching the 2015 Rugby World Cup semi-finals and for the first time they lost all six Rugby Championship games and did not even muster a bonus point.So England, with 19 wins out of 20 under Eddie Jones, expected a straightforward win to warm up for next weeks perceived stiffer challenge against Australia.However, they were slow out of the blocks and struggled to gain any real momentum in a first half punctuated by penalties, including a harsh red card for Puma fullback Joaquin Tuculet.Rugby Union - Autumn Internationals - England vs Argentina- Twickenham Stadium, London, Britain - November 11, 2017 England players line up before the match Action Images via Reuters/Andrew Boyers His accidental mid-air collision with Mike Brown ended his opposite numbers day after 22 minutes, giving Jones a fortuitous chance to have a look at Anthony Watson at 15.He failed to shine there though, as did Henry Slade at 13, with only tough-tackling openside Sam Underhill really advancing his cause on his second appearance.Slideshow (8 Images) The only try of the first half was created by a flashing George Ford pass that sent Hughes over the line.Ford, taking the kicks in the absence of the rested Owen Farrell, missed two of his five, while Juan Martin Hernandez also missed two as England led 14-3 at the break.The stop-start nature of the game continued in the second half, with precious little to lift the crowd with no addition to the scoreboard as the clocked ticked past the hour and Jones was seen smashing his desk in frustration.Slades long pass eventually sent Rokoduguni over in the corner and the crowd settled back for the traditional late surge.However, unlike in many of their games in the Rugby Championship, Argentina did not fade and instead enjoyed their longest period of sustained pressure, which was rewarded when Sanchez nipped over in the corner.
Northern Ireland switch focus back to game after penalty row:::::BASEL (Reuters) - Northern Ireland will concentrate on improving their passing and pressing when they face Switzerland in the second leg of their World Cup playoff on Sunday rather than dwelling on the controversial penalty that led to their defeat in the first match.Soccer Football - 2018 World Cup Qualifications - Europe - Northern Ireland vs Switzerland - National Stadium, Belfast, Britain - November 9, 2017 Northern Ireland manager Michael O'Neill before the match REUTERS/Clodagh Kilcoyne Switzerland brought a 1-0 win back from Belfast thanks to the penalty, awarded for handball by Corry Evans after he blocked Xherdan Shaqiris acrobatic volley at point-blank range, leaving them as firm favourites to progress on Sunday.The decision incensed Northern Ireland as Evans had his back to the ball and it seemed impossible for him to get out of the way.There was a lot of emotion in the dressing room after the game but its gone now, the focus is on trying to get the result that will get us through, Northern Ireland manager Michael ONeill told reporters.We have to do better in possession, put more pressure on Switzerland, he added.We didnt press the ball as well as we could have done.The players agree with that and we know we can play better.Following a run of five successive wins without conceding a goal, Northern Ireland have lost their last three games but ONeill denied they had gone off the boil just as they attempt to reach their first World Cup finals since 1986.I dont think the players are short on confidence or belief, he said.Its a massive achievement for us as a country to be here.We have given ourselves a difficult task but I wouldnt say it was an insurmountable task.Switzerland coach Vladimir Petkovic looked bemused as he was repeatedly asked to comment on Thursdays penalty.If it happened to us, I would accept it like a true professional, he said.There wouldnt be any talking about it afterwards.We also had a decision go against us in the 85th minute of the game.Midfielder Granit Xhaka added: Were not bothered about whether it was a penalty or not.The referee blew his whistle and we deserved the win.Thats the end of the story.Petkovic warned his side that they could not afford to let up on Sunday.As soon as we lost our style and took the pressure off, they were dangerous, said Petkovic.We mustnt lose concentration for even a second.

Sergio Aguero, Manchester City Star, Seals Argentina Win In Moscow:::::A late goal from Sergio Aguero unlocked a stubborn Russian defence on Saturday as Argentina won 1-0 in the ground that will stage the 2018 FIFA World Cup final next year.The goal by the Manchester City forward gave the South Americans a deserved win at Moscow's renovated 81,000-capacity Luzhniki stadium."We came here to play against a very disciplined and organised side," Argentina coach Jorge Sampaoli said."We made some mistakes in the first half but in the second we improved.We played a very intense game."The things we've planned did work.We played in a bold, direct manner."The coach singled out Aguero for his performance."Aguero played very well," Sampaoli said."He understood the philosophy of the game and was very active even though he didn't have much space."Argentina, orchestrated by Lionel Messi, seized the initiative early on.Their first meaningful chance came in the 21st minute when Angel Di Maria received Messi's pass in the area but Russian 'keeper Igor Akinfeev parried his low shot for a corner.Three minutes later, Aguero forced Akinfeev into a diving save to deny his attempt from just outside the box.Akinfeev was the hero of the first half as he produced another impressive save after Aguero's powerful shot from just nine yards.After the interval Argentina continued to dominate possession and kept Russia's defence under constant pressure but failed to find the net before the 86th minute.Aguero broke the deadlock when he headed in a rebound from his own blocked shot after a sharp break down the right wing and low cross from Cristian Pavon."We expected the match to be difficult and that we would not possess the ball or the initiative," Russia's head coach Stanislav Cherchesov said."Argentina scored after the referee failed to see that one of their players was offside, but I'd say they won deservedly."

Ranji Trophy: Gritty Gautam Gambhir Fights Lone Battle For Delhi vs Karnataka:::::Gautam Gambhir showed enormous patience during his undefeated 135 while some of the junior batsmen threw away their wickets as Delhi reached 277 for four at stumps on day three of the Ranji Trophy Group A game against Karnataka.The home team's gigantic 649 still seems a long haul as Delhi would need another 373 runs on the final day to ensure three points.With only six wickets in hand, this looks improbable at the moment with Gambhir only having vice-captain Milind Kumar (10 batting) for company.The likes of Unmukt Chand (16) and Rishabh Pant (41) did not show the wherewithal to stay at the crease and support the team's oldest cricketer, who mostly waged a lonely battle with partial support from Dhruv Shorey (64).After Milind, next batsmen to come in the middle will be all-rounder Manan Sharma, who has had a nightmarish game with the ball.For Delhi, the target will be not to get all out and prevent Karnataka from at least getting three points from the game.With the pitch showing no signs of wear and tear, it will be difficult for Karnataka to push for innings victory even if they can fold Delhi's first innings by the first session tomorrow morning.The day was all about Gambhir showing how to make runs at the first-class level.He has so far faced 237 balls and hit 20 boundaries.There were straight drives and a few cover drives off seamers R Vinay Kumar (0/60 in 16 overs) and Abhimanyu Mithun (1/56 in 17 overs).Against spinners Shreyash Gopal (0/64 in 16 overs) and Krishnappa Gowtham (1/46 in 20 overs), he was cautious and waited for the loose deliveries.However, that was not the case with former U-19 World Cup-winning captain Chand, whose prolonged failure has raised questions about his place in the team.On the day, he did all the hard work, staying at the wicket for the first hour before edging one-off military medium pacer Stuart Binny to keeper CM Gautham behind the stumps.Shorey, who had a good outing against Uttar Pradesh, then forged a good 110-run stand with Gambhir, hitting eight boundaries off 97 balls.Once he was cleaned up by Mithun, skipper Pant came to the crease.He got into the act hitting three boundaries and two sixes off 59 balls adding 83 runs in 22.4 overs.However, when the situation demanded responsible batting, Pant tried to play a delicate late cut off Gowtham, only dragging the ball back to his stumps to put Delhi in further trouble.Brief Scores: Group A At Alur: Karnataka 1st Innings 649.Delhi 1st Innings 277/4 (Gautam Gambhir 135 batting, Dhruv Shorey 64, Rishabh Pant 41) At Pune: Mahasrashtra 1st Innings 481.Railways 1st Innings 330/5 (Pratham Singh 73, Nitin Bhille 56, Shivakant Shukla 62, Chirag Khurana 2/50) At Guwahati: Uttar Pradesh 349 and 221/2 (Umang Sharma 131 batting).Assam 318 (Shib Sankar Roy 72, Rishav Das 52, Saurabh Kumar 5/54).

Fed Cup: CoCo Vandeweghe, Sloane Stephens Aim To End United States' 17-Year Title Drought:::::The United States aim to end their longest Fed Cup title drought when they meet a Belarus team missing former world number one and two-time Australian Open champion Victoria Azarenka in this weekend's final.The 17-time champions USA claimed their last title in 2000 and have lost three finals since -- to France in 2003 and Italy in 2009 and 2010.The US team is made up of world number 10 CoCo Vandeweghe, US Open champion Sloane Stephens, Shelby Rogers and Alison Riske.This time they are missing the Williams sisters, who have not played in the Fed Cup this season, but all the members of American team are ranked higher than Belarus' top available player, Aryna Sabalenka, who is 78th in the world.Belarus have battled into their maiden Fed Cup final but will be without Azarenka because of an ongoing custody battle over her baby son.Azarenka was forced to skip the US Open in August after a Los Angeles judge ruled that 10-month old Leo could not leave California until the case had been settled."It is heart-breaking for me to not have a chance to play and help Belarus in the final but unfortunately, my current custody situation is keeping me in California," the 28-year-old said in a statement posted on her Twitter account."Even though I will not be in Minsk for the final my heart is always with my country and my team and I will cheer for them from afar."American team captain Kathy Rinaldi said she believed in her team's prospects in the final."We've selected the players who have been playing for the team this year and were instrumental in getting the team to the Fed Cup final," she told Wednesday's news conference."This is my A-team, I believe in its strength and the work that we have done to get this far."The players really care for each other, so we are very excited and ready to go.We respect Belarus, they have a strong, talented team which have had a great year and reached the final."The USA won their only previous Fed Cup encounter with Belarus, whitewashing the former Soviet republic 5-0 in the World Group II opening-round tie in February, 2012.Belarus team skipper Eduard Dubrov said he believed that both teams had even chance of winning the title."One can consider us to be the final favourites.I have nothing against it but we don't even think about it," he said."We just come onto the court and play.For me it's really hard to guess which team have the better chance to win."
Ranji Trophy: Swapnil Singh Hits Maiden Ton As Baroda Tighten Noose Around Mumbai:::::Swapnil Singh broke an eleven-year jinx as he scored his maiden first class ton, a knock of 164 without a blemish, to help Baroda take a massive first innings lead of 404 runs against Mumbai on day three of the Ranji Trophy Group C match on Saturday.And then Baroda had the hosts and 41-time champions on the ropes at 102 for 4, with Mumbai needing 302 runs more to avoid an embarrassing innings defeat in their landmark 500th Ranji game.Overnight not out on 63 in a team score of 376 for four in reply to the hosts' meagre 171, Swapnil grinded the hapless Mumbai attack relentlessly during a stay of five minutes under seven hours as Baroda reached 575 for 9 before applying the declaration at the Wankhede Stadium.The bearded Swapnil, bowling left arm spin, then produced a ripper to clean bowl young Mumbai opener Prithvi Shaw for 56, the ball pitching outside the leg and zooming to tilt the middle stump as the batsman offered a defensive shot.Mumbai, faced with the daunting task of preventing an outright defeat, had lost captain Aditya Tare for 5 earlier and then surrendered two more wickets in fading light before Ajinkya Rahane (28) and Suryakumar Yadav (2) prevented further loss.Apart from Tare and Shaw, Mumbai had lost Shreyas Iyer (8) and the promoted Vijay Gohil (0) in an extended day's play to stare a massive defeat in the face going into the final day tomorrow.The third day's play belonged almost entirely to the 26-year-old, UP-born Swapnil, who had made his debut in first class cricket 11 years ago as a boy just short of his 15th birthday, which also made him the youngest ever Indian first class cricketer.His highest score, in 42 games before today, was 95 and he finally reached the three-figure landmark with a single off left arm spinner Vijay Gohil in 242 balls and 315 minutes.Swapnil, in the company of the lower order, ensured that Baroda who lost two early wickets within half an hour in the morning, did not allow Mumbai even a whiff of a chance to come back in the game.Swapnil first added 63 runs for the seventh wicket with Atit Sheth, who made 25 on top of his five-wicket haul in the Mumbai innings.He then put on 109 runs in 121 minutes with Sagar Mangalorkar (43 not out) against the tired home side attack for the 9th wicket.The two-down batsman was finally out, after hitting four sixes and ten fours, as he charged out to Dhawal Kulkarni with the third new ball in hand and was caught off the leading edge at deep point.By then, Baroda had advanced to 463 and they declared soon afterwards to try and push for an outright victory.Mumbai lost skipper Tare cheaply as he edged left arm seam bowler Lukman Meriwala, who grabbed five wickets in the first innings, to 'keeper Mitesh Patel in the sixth over.Exciting new talent Shaw, who made a duck in the first innings, batted fluently to complete his second half century in 54 balls, studded with seven fours and a six, to add to his four tons in his sixth game.Shaw looked in good touch when Swapnil bowled a dream ball to beat him all ends up and send him back with 12 overs left for stumps.Then Iyer, out to a poor shot in the first essay, repeated his folly by trying to slog a short ball dug in by Sheth, the first innings destroyer, from outside the off and skied the ball to square leg to depart with stumps approaching.Kartik Kakade then dismissed Gohil, promoted to see off the day, to leave Mumbai tottering at 99 for four before Rahane, after a stay of 117 minutes, and Yadav held fort till close.
Gareth Bale's Fragility Bemoaned After Latest "Breakdown":::::Gareth Bale is set to be sidelined with a thigh problem for another month.Gareth Bale is set to be sidelined with a thigh problem for another month.AFP Gareth Bale once again dominated Spain's sports pages on Saturday after the Real Madrid star suffered the latest in a series on injury setbacks.Since signing a lucrative new six-year contract with Madrid over a year ago, Bale, 28, has featured in just 24 matches as an ankle operation last November was followed by calf strains and now a thigh problem, which is expected to keep him out for another month."Bale breaks down again," splashed the front page of Madrid sports daily AS.Both AS and rival publication Marca calculated that Bale has until now missed 73 Madrid games through injury since joining the Spanish giants for a then world record 100.7 million euros (USD 117 million) from Tottenham Hotspur in 2013.Indeed, including Bale's bumper salary, AS believe his 159 games for the club have cost Madrid 1.06 million euros a match.Bale's time in Madrid has not been short of success.In four full seasons, he has lifted the Champions League three times and scored 70 goals.His highs include Real's crucial second goal to see off Atletico Madrid in the 2014 Champions League final, netting from the spot in a nervous penalty shootout against the same opponents in the final two years later, and a memorable solo run and finish to beat Barcelona in the 2014 Copa del Rey final.However, for many in Madrid those moments have been far too fleeting for the club's record purchase.Bale admitted to "taking tablets to get through games and training" last season, but, even then, his lack of fitness meant he only made a cameo appearance of the bench for the final 13 minutes as Real romped to a 12th European Cup win in his home city of Cardiff in June.No longer untouchable In his absence over the past year, home favourites Isco and Marco Asensio have starred and it would cause serious disquiet in the stands and the dressing room at the Bernabeu if they were to be squeezed out to make room for Bale when fit.For a long time untouchable, the 'BBC' front three of Bale, Karim Benzema and Cristiano Ronaldo haven't played a single minute together so far this season."Protected by the hierarchy since he arrived as part of the non-negotiable BBC, he hasn't made himself important," AS added in their analysis."In fact, players like Isco or Asensio with their performances continually put his place in the team in doubt."Just 15 months on from carrying his country to the semi-finals of Euro 2016, Bale also had to watch on in agony from the stands as Wales' attempts to qualify for a first World Cup since 1958 fell short last month.As patience wears thin in Madrid, the potential for a return to England's Premier League, where Bale was twice Players' Player of the Year with Spurs, remains a strong possibility.Manchester United boss Jose Mourinho conceded before the start of the season the Red Devils would "wait for him" should Bale ever be discarded by Real.However, as the Spanish media counted the cost of not cashing in on the 28-year-old, there is a question mark over whether even the cash rich United would part with up to the 100 million euros Madrid spent on Bale for a player who has struggled just to get on the pitch for the past year.

Jorge Sampaoli Calls On Lionel Messi's Teammates To Prove Argentina Worth:::::Jorge Sampaoli called on his side to show they can cope without Lionel Messi.Jorge Sampaoli called on his side to show they can cope without Lionel Messi.AFP Argentina coach Jorge Sampaoli called on his side to show they can cope without Lionel Messi, ahead of the friendly with 2018 World Cup hosts Russia in Moscow on Saturday.Five-time Ballon d'Or winner Messi scored a hat-trick as Argentina clinched a place for next year's finals with a 3-1 win at Ecuador in their final qualifier last month.The 30-year-old is set to play at the newly-renovated Luzhniki Stadium against Russia but will sit out of Tuesday's game with Nigeria in Krasnodar after an agreement between the Argentinian federation and his club side Barcelona."We need to find a strategy that will help us to strike a balance," Sampaoli told a press conference on Friday."If Messi is out of the game, the team need to demonstrate the same kind of performance."Definitely, we will give him some rest if we feel there's some massive fatigue.He doesn't need to prove anything to anyone.But he's never asked not to play because it's a happiness for him."Despite their struggles to score in qualifying, Argentina boast a host of attacking options with Manchester City's record goalscorer Sergio Aguero and Juventus forward Paulo Dybala also in the squad.But Sampaoli again left out Juve forward Gonzalo Higuain, after dropping him for the last four qualifiers.The former Chile coach, who has given 21-year-old Paris-Saint Germain midfielder Giovani Lo Celso a maiden call-up, said he needs to find a player with pace to complement Messi."We need to find a fast player that can play near Messi," he said."We definitely need to find a player who will be able to resist the external pressure, when all the media focuses on Lionel (Messi)."And we need to find a strategy that will help us to strike a balance.If Messi is out of the game, the team need to demonstrate the same kind of performance."But the 57-year-old Sampaoli, who led Chile to the 2015 Copa America title, said he would not make wholesale changes to the side before the World Cup."We need to rely on what we have already," Sampaoli added."We cannot experiment too much.We need to convince our players to move in the right direction."I might look calm but I was very nervous and concerned.I was afraid that we would miss the World Cup and the strategy was to look as confident as possible."Now we're qualified, we need to pick up good players, be in shape and become the team that will win the World Cup."- Russia ready for tough test - Saturday's encounter will be only the second meeting between the teams in the post-Soviet era after a 3-2 Argentina win in 2009.The Russians have played just three competitive matches since being dumped out of Euro 2016 in the group phase when they also failed to make the knockout stage at June's Confederations Cup on home soil.Russia is unbeaten in their last five friendlies -- scoring 12 goals in the process.But now Stanislav Cherchesov's side will face a real test against three of the best teams in the world in consecutive matches.Russia follow the Argentina game by taking on Spain on Tuesday in Saint Petersburg, before welcoming Brazil to Moscow in March.But Cherchesov insisted that he considered the Argentina clash to be just another warm-up outing."It's not our first match against World Cup finalists," Cherchesov said."We've already played Belgium, Portugal, and Mexico.Our preparations for the World Cup are taking their normal course.And there was nothing special at our training ahead of this match."My men are currently in a good mood.And I think the best thing I can do with just a day remaining before kick-off is to leave them alone."

Gautam Gambhir's Delhi and District Cricket Association Role Under Conflict Of Interest Scanner:::::Veteran opener Gautam Gambhir's inclusion as a government nominee in Delhi and District Cricket Association's (DDCA) Managing Committee has come under the scanner due to conflict of interest issue.Yesterday, Gambhir announced via Twitter that he has been nominated in the managing committee of DDCA and also thanked sports minister Rajyavardhan Rathore.However, Gambhir is an active first-class cricketer and as per Lodha Committee recommendations will fall under the conflict of interest purview if he is a part of the policy-making body before retiring from the game.DDCA's managing committee, as and when it comes into effect, will decide on coach and selection committee, which will then be directly beneficial to Gambhir if he remains an active cricketer.Interestingly, Delhi High Court appointed administrator of DDCA, Justice (Retd) Vikramajit Sen said he was unaware of the existence of any managing committee in the current set-up."I have not received any notification from the government about Gautam Gambhir's appointment.I am not aware about any managing committee.I will be writing to the sports ministry to seek more details," Justice Sen told PTI today."Also, he is an active cricketer, so I am not sure if Lodha Committee reforms will allow him to take up administrative post," he said.It is also learned that no such managing committee exists as of now in DDCA since the time court-appointed administrator took over.No one knows who all are a part of the committee.A close friend of Gambhir said that if the conflict of interest issue arises then he will not take up the post."Gautam has no plans to retire and will be playing active cricket.If there is a conflict of interest issue, he will not take up the post," he said
Kidambi Srikanth Pulls Out Of China Open Super Series:::::Star India shuttler Kidambi Srikanth has pulled out of the China Open Superseries due to a niggle but will be back in action after a week's rest at the Hong Kong Super Series where he will have the chance to reach the World No.1 ranking.Srikanth, currently the second-ranked men's singles player, decided to take a week's rest after aggravating a leg injury during the Senior National Badminton Championships in Nagpur."I am pulling out of China Open (November 14-19).It is a muscle strain and a doctor advised me to take rest for one week.It happened in the Nationals but because I kept playing it got a little worse.But I should be ok in a week," Srikanth told PTI today.The Badminton Association of India (BAI), however, said that it was just a coincidence that Srikanth sustained the injury at the Nationals, the dates for which were pre-fixed in consultation with all the top shuttlers of the country."I think it is wrong to say Nationals were responsible for his injury and it is wrongly timed," BAI secretary general Anup Narang said."The dates were decided in consultation with the top players and they willingly participated in the event.In fact, if not Nationals, many players would have played at the Macau Open," he said."There has been no major injuries to any player.Srikanth has a mild injury which will be corrected with a week's rest.So he would be playing in Hong Kong, where he will have the opportunity to reach no.1 ranking."The BAI official said the National Championship is an integral part of the annual calendar and the federation will continue to organise the event in consultation with the players."The Nationals have been very well managed.It is very important to conduct the Nationals.We will keep organising it in consultation with the players, according to their comfort.If it is not done the next crop of players will not come up.It is an important event for the growth of Indian badminton," Narang said.Srikanth, who lost to H S Prannoy in the final of the National Championship, has been playing non-stop badminton since October 18.

AIFF fiasco: SC stays Delhi HC order, Bhaskar named ombudsman:::::NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court stayed the order of the Delhi High Court allowing all AIFF elected committees to function on a regular basis, a release issued by the federation stated.This will effectively allow Praful Patel to continue in his role as the president of the AIFF.The AIFF release stated that Supreme Court also appointed SY Qureshi , former Chief Election Commissioner of India and former India football captain Bhaskar Ganguly as the Ombudsman to formulate the AIFF constitution within eight weeks.Earlier, the Delhi High Court had set aside the election of AIFF president Praful Patel, who was last year elected as the president for a four-year term, his third successive tenure.The court set aside the elections saying they were held without following the National Sports Code.It also directed that fresh elections be conducted within a period of five months.A bench of justices S Ravindra Bhat and Najmi Waziri also appointed former chief election commissioner (CEC) S Y Quraishi as an administrator to look into the functioning of the AIFF.The court's order came on a plea by advocate Rahul Mehra contending that the elections of the federation were held contrary to the National Sports Code.Patel, former civil aviation minister, was elected for the post in December last year along with the Executive Committee for the term 2017-2020 after the high court had vacated a stay on elections.One of the greatest goalkeepers that India has ever produced, Ganguly captained India to the quarter-finals of the 1982 Asian Games in Delhi.He was an East Bengal legend, having represented the club for a decade.He has also played for Mohun Bagan and Mohammedan Sporting.He was also the one who spotted the Bhaiching Bhutia when he went as a spotter for the Sikkim Governor's Gold Cup.
Ranji Trophy: Gritty Gambhir fights lonely battle for Delhi:::::ALUR (Karnataka): Gautam Gambhir showed enormous patience during his undefeated 135 while some of the junior batsmen threw away their wickets as Delhi reached 277 for four at stumps on day three of the Ranji Trophy Group A game against Karnataka.The home team's gigantic 649 still seems a long haul as Delhi would need another 373 runs on the final day to ensure three points.With only six wickets in hand, this looks improbable at the moment with Gambhir only having vice-captain Milind Kumar (10 batting) for company.The likes of Unmukt Chand (16) and Rishabh Pant (41) did not show the wherewithal to stay at the crease and support the team's oldest cricketer, who mostly waged a lonely battle with partial support from Dhruv Shorey (64).After Milind, next batsmen to come in the middle will be all-rounder Manan Sharma , who has had a nightmarish game with the ball.For Delhi, the target will be not to get all out and prevent Karnataka from at least getting three points from the game.With the pitch showing no signs of wear and tear, it will be difficult for Karnataka to push for innings victory even if they can fold Delhi's first innings by the first session tomorrow morning.The day was all about Gambhir showing how to make runs at the first-class level.He has so far faced 237 balls and hit 20 boundaries.There were straight drives and a few cover drives off seamers R Vinay Kumar (0/60 in 16 overs) and Abhimanyu Mithun (1/56 in 17 overs).Against spinners Shreyash Gopal (0/64 in 16 overs) and Krishnappa Gowtham (1/46 in 20 overs), he was cautious and waited for the loose deliveries.However that was not the case with former U-19 World Cup winning captain Chand, whose prolonged failure has raised questions about his place in the team.On the day, he did all the hardwork, staying at the wicket for the first hour before edging one off military medium pacer Stuart Binny to keeper CM Gautham behind the stumps.Shorey, who had a good outing against Uttar Pradesh, then forged a good 110-run stand with Gambhir, hitting eight boundaries off 97 balls.Once he was cleaned up by Mithun, skipper Pant came to the crease.He got into the act hitting three boundaries and two sixes off 59 balls adding 83 runs in 22.4 overs.However when the situation demanded responsible batting, Pant tried to play a delicate late cut off Gowtham, only dragging the ball back to his stumps to put Delhi in further trouble.Karnataka 1st Innings 649.Delhi 1st Innings 277/4 (Gautam Gambhir 135 batting, Dhruv Shorey 64, Rishabh Pant 41)

BCCI has no plans to remove Dilip Vengsarkar:::::NEW DELHI: Dilip Vengsarkar 's future as a member of the National Cricket Academy NCA ) committee member will only be decided when the BCCI holds it's next Annual General Meeting, even as the board is set to appoint a full-time 'Special Projects' director.Asked about Vengsarkar's future, a senior BCCI official, who attended the CoA meeting on Saturday, said: "Dilip Vengsarkar does not have a contract with the BCCI.So where does the question of removing him arise?He is a part-time committee member.Like every sub-committee's tenure is till AGM, same with Vengsarkar."The official said that the BCCI will soon be appointing a full-time Special Project Director for the National Cricket Academy (NCA)."There are extensive plans with regards to NCA.We will have a Project Director, who will execute the BCCI blueprint with regards to NCA revamp.As and when something concrete happens, we would be able to divulge more information.We are also in the process of finalising the revised pay structure for domestic players," the official said.He also said that the BCCI is fully backing CEO Rahul Johri , who sent a letter to the National Anti Doping Agency (NADA) clarifying the cricket board's stand on dope test.BCCI has made it clear that since they are not a National Sports Federation (NSF), NADA has no jurisdiction to test Indian cricketers."The dope tests are conducted by National Dope Test Laboratory and union sports secretary is the ex-officio or vice-chairman of the institution.So this is a wrong concept that we are flouting any rules," the official added.The BCCI is also leaving it on Justice Vikramajit Sen to deal with Gautam Gambhir's alleged conflict of interest if he happens to take up the role of a managing committee member in Delhi and District Cricket Association (DDCA)."Justice Sen will look into the matter as he is a High Court-appointed administrator," the official said.

Sunil Chhetri: Chhetri hopes India builds on popularity generated by U-17 World Cup:::::MUMBAI: Star India player Sunil Chhetri hopes the country will build on the massive popularity generated by the FIFA U-17 World Cup "Massive, the kind of popularity, the kind of interest generated (about football ) by the World Cup is massive, I hope we build on it.It is one thing to have a tournament and more important thing to build on it, so I just hope as nation we build on it," he told reporters on sidelines of the Indian Sports Honours held here.India successfully hosted the FIFA U-17 World Cup last month, with games played at six cities and Kolkata hosting the final.England emerged victorious in the tournament.The 33-year-old football player also said that the goal scored by India U-17 player, Jeakson Singh , was a good one.
Sergio Aguero: Aguero seals Argentina win in Moscow:::::MOSCOW: A late goal from Sergio Aguero unlocked a stubborn Russian defence as Argentina showed their intent ahead of next year's World Cup with a 1-0 win over the tournament hosts on Saturday.The goal by the Manchester City forward set the South Americans on their way to a well-deserved win at Moscow's renovated 81,000-capacity Luzhniki stadium which will host next year's final.Argentina, orchestrated by Lionel Messi, seized the initiative early on but their first meaningful chance came in the 21st minute when Angel Di Maria received Messi's pass in the area but Russian 'keeper Igor Akinfeev parried his low shot for a corner.Three minutes later Aguero forced Akinfeev into a diving save to deny his attempt from just outside the box.Akinfeev was the hero of the first half as he produced another impressive save after Aguero's powerful shot from just nine yards out.After the interval Argentina continued to dominate posession and kept Russia 's defence under constant pressure but failed to find the net before the 86th minute.Aguero broke the deadlock when he headed in a rebound from his own blocked shot after a sharp break down the right wing and low cross from Cristian Pavon.
india v sri lanka: Well prepared to tackle Ashwin, Jadeja: Karunaratne:::::KOLKATA: Sri Lanka's left-handed opener Dimuth Karunaratne is willing to think out of the box in an attempt to counter spinners Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja in the upcoming three-match Test series against India.Karunaratne was the leading scorer with 285 runs in their 0-3 loss to India in September, including a valiant 141 in the second innings of the first Test."I know Jadeja and Ashwin are both hungry for wickets.Every time they bowl it's about sticking to the basics.If I don't give them any chance, they will try to do something else.If we need them to change the field you have to do something extra."That's my gameplan...I wait for the loose ones and I will stick to that.If it does not work I will think out of the box and give some extra pressure to the bowlers," Karunaratne told reporters after day one of their tour match against Board President's XI.Fresh from a career-best 196 that came against Pakistan in the second Test in Dubai last month, Karunaratne said the 141 in the second innings against India was confidence- boosting."That hundred helped me a lot to take some confidence to Pakistan.It's not easy wicket to bat in second innings.I was determined to get some runs especially against Ashwin, their wicket-taking bowler on that pitch."I was thinking to play first five overs without big shots.I realised it's not easy.I played a lot of sweep and reverse sweeps and they had to change the field position."That's my style, to play in my comfort zone and not go for anything else.That's key and I can bat longer period.that's my game plan."The 29-year-old who was dismissed twice by Ashwin and once by Jadeja in their home series said he prepared for the series, starting November 16, by batting on dusty wickets back home."We have practised on dusty wickets and have another five days before the Test.We will prepare for the good spin attack," Karunaratne, who scored a fluent 50 from 60 balls against Board President's XI, said.Asked how he would tackle the likes of Mohammed Shami and Umesh Yadav, he said: "I played them in the last series.I have a few plans and I know what they're going to do with me.I've prep well.I will stick to that plan, if it needs to be changed I will go and do it."He further said Board President's XI did not play a left-arm spinner as India may go with two left-armers in Jadeja and Kuldeep Yadav "They didn't give us left-arm spinners.It's not easy I know they will definitely play with Jadeja, and maybe Kuldeep to go alongside Ashwin," he said.Sri Lanka declared their first innings at 411/8 after 88 overs with four half-centuries in the tour game against Board President's XI.Sri Lanka played a third-string Board President's XI in the two-day match but he said it did not matter as their main objective of getting runs was fulfilled."We need a bit of confidence going into the series as apart from Angelo and Rangana nobody else has played here.It was good batting-friendly conditions and the ball was not turning much, so most of us batsmen got runs."It's all about runs.It doesn't matter if they bowl fast or slow, if they bowl good line and length that's the most the difficult part for a batsman.They bowled really in good areas."
Want to dominate in Asia: Sandesh Jhingan:::::NEW DELHI: India football team star defender Sandesh Jhingan , ahead of the 2019 AFC Asian Cup qualifiers against Myanmar on Tuesday, asserted he wants his side to improvise and dominate in Asia.India, who made their last appearance at the Asian Cup in 2011 have already qualified for the 2019 edition of the tournament."It's a big achievement for the Country as it's a continuous process of growth of Indian Football after the last qualification in Doha 2011," the Chandigarh-born player told All India Football Federation AIFF )."Our priority from now on is to improve and try to dominate in Asia as the Asian Cup provides us with the chance to play the bigger teams.To improve we need to learn the dominance and there is still a lot of work to be done for that," Jhingan added.The 24-year-old also said the current India football team carries a 'never give up' spirit which has helped the side hold to their successful unbeaten streak."The biggest character of this team stays that we never give up.If you look back, we had a bad run initially but since then we have been able to turn around and it has to be attributed to the mental strength of the team," the Kerala Blasters player said."The unity in the squad is commendable, it's like a group of brothers playing football together.That's the understanding which we have and it's very vital for us," Jhingan added.
Top players at one platform would be good for Indian chess: Anand:::::PUNE: Bringing top chess players of the country to play in the same tournament can help the sport grow better, feels five-time World Champion Viswanathan Anand Anand was in Pune to announce his association with a city-based construction group by starting his academy Viswanathan Anand Chess Academy at one of their projects.Anand, 48, appreciated Badminton Association of India's idea of reviving the national championships in Nagpur recently where all the top Indian shuttlers played and then winner turned out to be a real National champion.Anand said similar step could be taken by the national chess body.In the just-concluded National Premier chess meet in Patna, only three of the top 20 Indian players participated.And none of the top-12 were there."It would be very good idea to get all the top players to play in some event, could be the Nationals or may be a league.Either of them works for me, but currently talks are more about the league than all the players getting to play in the nationals," Anand said.When asked if there are enough platforms for the upcoming chess players to compete with elite Indian players, the veteran said there is always a scope of improvement."We have a circuit of four open tournaments, Indian 'A' and 'B' championships.They are very competitive even if the top-players don't participate.Of course, it would be nice if all of us could play.The Maharashtra Chess League (MCL) was a very good initiative in that sense (getting top players play with juniors), hopefully it can be revived soon," said Anand.The MCL, which was held for four consecutive years in Pune, is unlikely to be held this year because state politics is more vibrant than chess activity.The AICF had disaffiliated Maharashtra Chess Association and gave blessings to newly-floated All Marathi Chess Association.When asked the details about his academy, Anand said in jest: "By the way, it is a nicer way to ask the retirement question."He added: "My role will be of monitoring (and not coaching).My first job will be to monitor to see new training methods.The second will be to see how the students react to the coaching methods," he added.Talking about India's representation in the sport at the world level, Anand was all praise for youngster Vidit Gujrathi."Vidit is one of our great hopes.He has progressed over the last year and a half.It has been a very consistent rise.He has been firmly a 2700 player and he is showing that.I think working with Anish Giri has helped him a lot as it allowed him to see how the best players work.We have four or five hopefuls, but he is definitely the best one," Anand said.Interestingly, Vidit is India No.3 (Elo 2676) behind P Harikrishna (Elo 2687).But at 23, Vidit is younger than Harikrishna by eight years.
West Indies to play T20Is in Pakistan:::::KARACHI: Pakistan and the West Indies have signed an agreement under which they will play a T20 series each year in Pakistan and the United States for the next five years.This was announced by the Pakistan Cricket Board ( PCB ) chairman, Najam Sethi at a press conference in Lahore on Saturday."There has been a lot of speculation regarding Pakistan and West Indies series.I can confirm now that both the boards have reached an agreement under which we will play a T20 series each year for the next five years in Pakistan and USA subject to availability of dates and venues which will be finalised later," Sethi said.He said the first series would take place with the West Indies board confirming they will send their full national side to Pakistan in March 2018."The matches will take place on March 29 and 31st and April 1st next year," he added."This series couldn't be held in November as earlier planned due to adverse weather conditions and we didn't want to take any risk," he said.Sethi said the West Indies would come to Pakistan for the next five years each year and Pakistan will go to the USA each year in return."The series in the USA will be a triangular series with Pakistan, West Indies and a third team to be finalised every year."He also made it clear that this bilateral arrangement between the two boards was outside of the official future tours program of the International Cricket Council (ICC)."I want to say here that this agreement is part of our endeavour to bring back international cricket back to Pakistan in a proper way."Sethi said that both boards would now sit down and finalise a third team and the broadcaster for the first series in the USA in 2018.Pakistan have already hosted the Pakistan Super League final in March followed by a tour by the World Eleven in September and most recently, Sri Lanka played a lone T20 in Lahore on October 29.He said the ICC bilateral series would be finalised next year by February.Sethi said Pakistan felt it was financially viable to have a tri-series of T20 matches in the United States every year.
Srikanth: Kidambi Srikanth to return in Hong Kong after a week's rest:::::NEW DELHI: Star India shuttler Kidambi Srikanth has pulled out of the China Open Super Series due to a niggle but will be back in action after a week's rest at the Hong Kong Super Series where he will have the chance to reach the World No.1 ranking.Srikanth, currently the second ranked men's singles player, decided to take a week's rest after aggravating a leg injury during the Senior National Badminton Championships in Nagpur."I am pulling out of China Open (November 14-19).It is a muscle strain and doctor advised me to take rest for one week.It happened in the Nationals but because I kept playing it got a little worse.But I should be ok in a week," Srikanth said on Saturday.The Badminton Association of India BAI ), however, said that it was just a coincidence that Srikanth sustained the injury at the Nationals, the dates for which were pre-fixed in consultation with all the top shuttlers of the country."I think it is wrong to say Nationals were responsible for his injury and it is wrongly timed," BAI secretary general Anup Narang said."The dates were decided in consultation with the top players and they willingly participated in the event.In fact, if not Nationals, many players would have played at the Macau Open," he said."There have been no major injuries to any player.Srikanth has a mild injury which will be corrected with a week's rest.So he would be playing in Hong Kong, where he will have the opportunity to reach no.1 ranking."The BAI official said the National Championship is an integral part of the annual calendar and the federation will continue to organise the event in consultation with the players."The Nationals have been very well managed.It is very important to conduct the Nationals.We will keep organising it in consultation with the players, according to their comfort.If it is not done the next crop of players will not come up.It is an important event for the growth of Indian badminton," Narang said.Srikanth, who lost to HS Prannoy in the final of the National Championships, has been playing non-stop badminton since October 18.
Gautam Gambhir: Gautam Gambhir's DDCA role under conflict of interest scanner:::::Had the honour of adjusting fields at Ferozeshah Kotla.Time to adjust 'corridors' at DDCA to help restore its glor... https://t.co/yIDF4G7yT4 Gautam Gambhir (@GautamGambhir) 1510316614000 NEW DELHI: Veteran opener Gautam Gambhir 's inclusion as a government nominee in Delhi & District Cricket Association's ( DDCA ) Managing Committee has come under the scanner due to conflict of interest issue.On Friday, Gambhir announced via Twitter that he has been nominated in the managing committee of DDCA and also thanked sports minister Rajyavardhan Rathore However, Gambhir is an active first-class cricketer and as per Lodha Committee recommendations will fall under the conflict of interest purview if he is a part of the policy making body before retiring from the game.DDCA's managing committee, as and when it comes into effect, will decide on coach and selection committee, which will then be directly beneficial to Gambhir if he remains an active cricketer.Interestingly, Delhi High Court appointed administrator of DDCA, Justice (Retd) Vikramajit Sen said he was unaware of the existence of any managing committee in the current set-up."I have not received any notification from the government about Gautam Gambhir's appointment.I am not aware about any managing committee.I will be writing to the sports ministry to seek more details," Justice Sen said on Saturday."Also, he is an active cricketer, so I am not sure if Lodha Committee reforms will allow him to take up administrative post," he said.It is also learnt that no such managing committee exists as of now in DDCA since the time court appointed administrator took over.No one knows who all are a part of the committee.A close friend of Gambhir said that if the conflict of interest issue arises then he will not take up the post."Gautam has no plans to retire and will be playing active cricket.If there is a conflict of interest issue, he will not take up the post," he said.
Gopichand: After 30 years of badminton, I still don't know much, says Gopichand:::::BENGALURU: After spending 30 years in badminton, if there is anything that Pullela Gopichand is certain of is that he still doesn't know much.The chief national coach said he began his badminton career by fluke."There were no admissions open in cricket or tennis.Nobody was interested in badminton at the time and it was the only place I could join.So I did," he recalled.Speaking at the second Global Leadership Forum at the Art of Living International Centre, Gopichand said when he began coaching in 2004, the general practice was to identify the best and train them to be better."But I was proved wrong when a young girl in the academy asked me to teach her how to hold the shuttle.I realized that in the bargain of giving our children literacy and exposing them to technology, we are making them lose their human connect.""This made me wonder that excellence doesn't come with literacy.It comes with believing that every child is talented.Running against Usain Bolt and beating him wouldn't mean as much as it would if I ran against myself and got a better score than last time.And in the bargain, if we get a medal...fantastic!"The two-day forum brought together an array of speakers from various fields to discuss leadership needed in an increasingly complex world.Sri Sri Ravishankar, founder of AOL , said: "Leaders are of two kinds: one who wants to achieve and the other who has achieved but wants more people to follow suit."We need more of the second kind."Alojz Peterle, European Parliament member and ex-Slovenia Prime Minister, said, "Although globalization has contributed to interdependence in society, it has also resulted in wars, human crimes and ignorance of our own responsibilities.We need to change the concept of power."
Mercedes team members robbed at gunpoint in Brazil:::::SAO PAULO: Armed robbers held up a Mercedes Formula One team minibus outside the Brazilian Grand Prix circuit in Sao Paulo on Friday night but nobody was hurt, a spokesman said."We can confirm that a team minibus was robbed at gunpoint last night leaving the circuit," he said."Valuables were stolen but most importantly everybody is safe and uninjured."Hold-ups are a known risk for teams in Sao Paulo and around the Interlagos circuit, with drivers travelling to and from their hotels with police escorts and in cars with bulletproof protection.Britain's Jenson Button was the victim of an attempted robbery in 2010, the year after he won the title with Brawn GP, but the police driver smashed his way through traffic to escape when the gunmen were seen approaching.Mechanics and other staff travel to and from the track by minibus and are advised against wearing branded team clothing away from the circuit.A Mercedes team member was also robbed at gunpoint in Mexico last year while travelling by car from the airport to his hotel.Mercedes have won both of this year's championships for the fourth year in a row with Lewis Hamilton arriving in Brazil as a four-time world champion.Sunday's race is the penultimate round of the season.
GR Viswanath: Not just me, team recalled Bob Taylor: Viswanath:::::If the name GR Viswanath evokes memories of silken square cuts, it also kindles images of his grace and fair play.Coming right up the order in world cricket's list of sporting gestures is his recall of English player Bob Taylor after the batsman was given out caught behind.India eventually lost that Golden Jubilee Test played in Mumbai in 1980.Viswanath says the decision happened after a chat with colleagues, but it was a call that he had to take.He deconstructs the scene: "I didn't call him back on my own.The close-in fielders were looking at Bob.They asked me, 'Is he out?'I said no, certainly not.Then they said why don't you call him back... so I went up to Hanumantha Rao , the umpire, and said, 'Sir, I am withdrawing the appeal'."He said he had already declared him out.I turned away, but he called me back and asked, 'Are you withdrawing the appeal?'I said yes.Bob was still standing inside the ropes, and so I called him back.At dinner that night, someone mentioned that the gesture was nice but it wasn't entirely right.After all, the umpire's decision was final.But why didn't they understand?I had checked with the umpire...If it were to happen again, I would do the same thing."As a player too, propriety came naturally to him.Asked how he made a habit of walking back well before the umpire's finger went up, he says: "I picked it up on my own.Just the way I was... People generally say that it all evens out, the bad decisions and the good ones.But it never happened with me.In Test cricket, I was wrongly given out nine times, and not even once the other way.I never complained, it just happened so in my career, that's it..."And then he recalls a couple of deviations from the norm."In my second Test in Delhi, just before lunch, there was an appeal for bat-pad, with Ian Redpath taking the catch.The umpire turned it down.As I was leaving for lunch, dragging my bat as usual, Paul Sheahan kicked the bat and when I turned, gave me a dirty look.I didn't say anything.I didn't know if I had hit the ball or not, honestly.In the dressing room, Tiger (Pataudi) asked me if I had nicked it.I told him, I wasn't sure.'That's fair enough,' he said.""In a Ranji game at Chepauk much later, I was caught by P Mukund at short leg off Venkat (S Venkataraghavan).I returned to my crease after having gone forward with the momentum.Mukund said, 'Not you, Vishy!'I tried to hit the next ball and was out.Venkat asked me whether I hadn't heard the nick.I said I had, but I just couldn't walk.I couldn't believe myself!"
Federer: Federer, Nadal urge caution over rule changes:::::LONDON: Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal said they welcome innovation in tennis but warned the game's administrators on Friday not to tamper too much with the current format.A series of rule changes and innovations are being trialled at the Next Gen ATP Finals in Milan , featuring the world's top 21-and-under singles players.They are aimed at creating a high-tempo, TV-friendly product geared towards attracting new and younger fans.Rule changes include a shorter format with first-to-four-games sets (tie-break at 3-3), a shorter warm-up, a 25-second shot clock used between points, no line judges, player coaching and no doubles lines on the court.Federer , in London for the ATP Finals, starting on Sunday, said he had enjoyed watching the matches on TV but urged caution."We need to think, take seriously all these rule changes if ever you're going to do it because once you do it you don't want to bounce back and forth with changing something and then you don't like it later on," said the Swiss world number two."I don't see that much wrong with our Tour right now that it needs that much fixing, especially the shorter sets.I know it can be somewhat intriguing but at the same time the longer sets allow you to stretch a lead, it's more comfortable at times."You can try different things.You can work on stuff, whereas if every point counts so much... there's no room for anything anymore.There are positives and negatives to it but I don't want to see anything change on the Tour that much to be honest."Top-ranked Nadal , bidding to win the ATP Finals for the first time, said it was good to try new things."There are a couple of things that I like and a couple of things I don't like but nothing is perfect.We are in a sport where we have a big tradition -- not many changes have been made in all of its history."The Spaniard used the example of net height, which has stayed the same despite taller players in the modern era.But the 16-time Grand Slam champion, who looks likely to play in London despite an injury scare, said he was happy with how things are."If you asked me 'do you want changes?'I will say 'no'," he said."I am number one in the world, I have achieved a lot of things but if the game needs something to be more attractive for the fans, that's the way that the game will move forward.""It's not my job," he added."The people who run the sport have to look around and take the right decisions to make our sport even more interesting than it is today.I'm happy with how it is but maybe in the future you need to do something."
U.S. soccer star Hope Solo says ex-FIFA president 'grabbed' her:::::(This story contains strong language) Soccer player Hope Solo arrives for the "Glamour Women of the Year Awards" in the Manhattan borough of New York, November 9, 2015.REUTERS/Carlo Allegri (Reuters) - U.S. soccer star Hope Solo accused ex-FIFA President Sepp Blatter of grabbing her buttocks during an awards ceremony five years ago, an allegation that the former head of international footballs governing body denied.Solo, 36, told a Portuguese newspaper that Blatter touched her inappropriately in January 2013 during the Ballon Dor awards ceremony in Lisbon.A spokeswoman for Solo on Saturday confirmed her comments.I had Sepp Blatter grab my ass, the former goalkeeper on the U.S. national womens team said in an audio interview with Expresso, posted on Saturday.It was at the Ballon Dor one year, right before I went on stage, said Solo, who received FIFAs womens player of the year award in 2013.Its been normalized.A spokesman for Blatter said in a phone interview on Saturday that Solos allegation was absurd and ridiculous, and it is not true.Solo is the latest celebrity to go public with accusations of sexual misconduct by powerful men in sports and entertainment, including movie producer Harvey Weinstein, actor Kevin Spacey and former Fox News host Bill OReilly.The high-profile allegations have inspired an online campaign, tagged #MeToo, that has encouraged men and women in all walks of life to reveal their own experiences with sexual harassment and assault, often years after they occurred.Solo last month posted a statement on her Instagram page that commended women in the entertainment industry for having courage to reveal their experiences with sexual misconduct and suggested she had been a victim herself.From inappropriate comments, unwanted advances and grabs of the ass to coaches and GMs and even press officers speaking about players tits and physical appearance, sexual harassment is rampant in the sports world, Solo wrote online.I always felt Id handled it and stood up for myself in those situations, but there were never any consequences for the perpetrators, she added.Solo, considered one of the best goalkeepers in the world, played on the U.S. womens soccer team from 2000 to 2016, when it won two Olympic gold medals and a World Cup.Blatter is in the midst of a six-year ban from all soccer-related duties imposed by Zurich-based FIFAs ethics committee after a corruption scandal.

Chung beats Rublev to become first Next Gen champion:::::MILAN (Reuters) - South Korean iceman Chung Hyeon doused the fire of Russian Andrey Rublev to win the inaugural Next Gen ATP Finals on Saturday -- pocketing a $390,000 check in the process.FILE PHOTO - South Korea's Hyeon Chung hits a shot during his first round match against Serbia's Novak Djokovic at the Australian Open tennis tournament at Melbourne Park, Australia, January 18, 2016.REUTERS/Jason Reed Picture Supplied by Action Images Chung, 21, was outplayed in the first set and was 3-1 behind in the second set before taking over to win 3-4(5) 4-3(2) 4-2 4-2 to go through the five-day round-robin tournament unbeaten.A high-quality final full of sublime ball-striking was a fitting end to a promising debut for an event which has experimented with a range of innovations such as shorts sets, sudden-death deuces and on-court coaching.The 20-year-old Rublev, at 37th the highest-ranked qualifier for the event restricted to players aged 21 and under, lost his cool as the relentless Chung turned the match around.But the Muscovite showed tremendous resolve to survive a deciding point deuce, effectively match point, when serving at 1-3 in the fourth set, winning a ferocious baseline exchange.The 54th-ranked Chung showed his first sign of nerves when he double-faulted at 30-30 in the next game but Rublev wasted the break point with a shanked forehand.At deuce Rublev still had the chance to drag the set into a tiebreak but Chung struck a forehand winner to seal victory in just under two hours of compelling action.Chung, 21, is the first South Korean to win an ATP singles trophy since Hyung Taik-lee captured the 2003 Sydney title by beating Juan Carlos Ferrero.Rublev, who began his ATP Tour title collection in Umag this year, looked close to tears at the end but his performance, and that of Chungs, suggested both will be challenging for some of the biggest prizes in the sport before long.Add in the likes of Canadian teenager Denis Shapovalov, who dazzled in the Fiera Milano venue earlier in the week, beaten semi-finalists Daniil Medvedev and Croatian Borna Coric and a third Russian, Karen Khachanov, not to mention American Jared Donaldson, and the future looks bright for the mens Tour.Whether or not any of the rule changes trialled this week ever become regular features remains to be seen, although the 25-second shot clock and shorter warm-ups were popular with players and fans alike.

Former Star Pitcher Halladay Killed in Florida Plane Crash:::::Roy Halladay, a former pitching great for the Philadelphia Phillies, died when the small plane he was piloting crashed into the Gulf of Mexico off Florida.Legendary Philadelphia Phillies pitcher Roy Halladay has died in a plane crash, according to officials.He was 40.Halladay's ICON A5 plane went down just after noon in the Gulf of Mexico near Tampa, Florida, on Tuesday.It landed upside down in shallow water about a quarter mile west of Ben Pilot Point in New Port Richey, Florida, the Pasco County Sheriff's Office said.No Mayday calls were made to Tampa Air Traffic Control and the 911 call came in at 12:06 p.m., officials said.The sheriff's office marine unit along with Pasco Fire Rescue and the Coast Guard responded to the downed plane and found Halladay's body.No one else was on board the plane.Photo credit: WFLA "We recovered one body," Pasco County Sheriff Chris Nocco announced late Tuesday afternoon."It's a two-passenger plane but I can confirm that only one body is involved.And it's sad to say it's a friend of ours.It's Roy Halladay."Police haven't revealed where the plane was headed.The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is investigating the crash.The ICON A5 is a two-person, single engine amphibian plane.Since retiring to Florida with his wife and two children, Halladay had picked up flying as a hobby, posting just last month about his joy of buying an ICON A5 aircraft.ICON aircraft had posted a video with Halladay trying out the ICON A5.In the video, Halladay said the terms of his baseball contract prevented him from having a pilot's license while playing, and that his wife was originally against the idea of him getting the aircraft."She's fought me the whole way," Halladay said."Hard.I fought hard.I was very against it,'' Brandy Halladay said in the same video, before explaining why she eventually understood and approved of her husband's desire to have the plane.Halladay had donated money to purchase a K9 for the Pasco County Sheriff's Office."We are grateful and blessed to have known this incredible friend," the Pasco County Sheriff's Office said in a statement."Our thoughts and prayers are with Roy's family."MLB Commissioner Robert Manfred called Halladay a well-respected figure and fierce competitor during his 16-year career in a statement expressing his sadness and condolences to Halladays family.Halladay, known as "Doc," pitched four seasons with the Phillies before retiring after injuries cut short his 2013 season.He won the 2010 National League Cy Young Award and pitched a perfect game while winning 21 games in his first season with the Phillies.He went on to pitch a no-hitter against the Cincinnati Reds in the 2010 divisional series.In Memoriam: MLB Star Pitcher Halladay Dies in Plane Crash He started his career with the Toronto Blue Jays, winning the 2003 American League Cy Young Award, before he was traded to the Phillies ahead of the 2010 season."We are numb over the very tragic news about Roy Halladays untimely death," the Phillies said in a statement."There are no words to describe the sadness that the entire Phillies family is feeling over the loss of one of the most respected human beings to ever play the game.It is with the heaviest of hearts that we pass along our condolences to Brandy, Ryan and Braden."The Toronto Blue Jays also released a statement on Halladay, writing the organization is "overcome by grief with the tragic loss of one of the franchises greatest and most respected players, but even better human being."Former Phillies pitcher and former teammate Cole Hamels spoke about the impact Halladay had on him during a press conference early Tuesday evening."He was a man of few words," Hamels said."But you just sat back and you just watched him and you watched what he did.I have two boys of my own and I got to see what that meant to him every time he was able to bring them around the ball park.That was something that really did leave an impression and hopefully I'll be able to do what he was able to do for his boys."News of Halladay's death led to many reactions from fans, former teammates, opponents, athletes from other sports, celebrities and politicians.

Dodger Yasiel Puig's Home Burglarized on Night of World Series Loss:::::While coming to terms with the loss of the World Series, Yasiel Puig takes another loss after finding out his home was broken into.Patrick Healy reports for NBC4 News on Thursday, Nov. 2, 2017.(Published Friday, Nov. 3, 2017) A San Fernando Valley home owned by Dodger Yasiel Puig was burglarized on the same night Los Angeles' dreams of its first World Series title in 29 years were dashed at Dodger Stadium.The break-in occurred shortly after Game 7 of the World Series, a disappointing 5-1 loss to Houston.A window at the address was smashed and items were taken, according to the Los Angeles Police Department.Police responded to the address after a burglary alarm was activated.Puig was likely at Dodger Stadium at the time.He was 0-for-3 at the plate in Wednesday night's loss.TMZ reported that jewelry was taken from the Mediterranean-style villa in Encino's Amestoy Estates, which Puig recently bought for $2.65 million.Security cameras captured the crime, according to TMZ.The home is not the same one owned by Puig that was burglarized in March.About $500,00 worth of jewelry was taken in the March burglary, which occurred when Puig was away at spring training.A string of burglaries have been reported in recent months targeting celebrities in the Hollywood and Beverly Hills area, including Alanis Morissette, Nicki Minaj, Emmy Rossum, Jaime Pressly, David Spade, Puig, and former Lakers Nick Young, Byron Scott and Derek Fisher.In March, a burglary was reported at the family home of Lakers star rookie Lonzo Ball.
It Can Take a Mountain of Money to Raise a Winter Olympian:::::American ice dancing duo Rachel and Michael Parsons, left, and snowboarder Mike Trapp.They've all spent tens of thousands of dollars a year on training as they vie to go to the Olympics.The rewards for competing in the Olympics this winter in Pyeongchang are largely symbolic for the vast majority of athletes who won't win medals or sign lucrative endorsement deals.And the financial strain their years of training puts on their families can hit hard."Its a daunting challenge," said Richard Parsons, whose two eldest children are the reigning U.S. and world junior ice dance champions.Rachel and Michael Parsons' win at the 2017 World Junior Figure Skating Championships in Taiwan this year marked a milestone in their quest to compete at the 2022 Olympics if not sooner, should they clinch the spot as alternates for Team USA at the 2018 Games.Once theyve qualified for the Olympics, athletes flights, accommodations, food and training are paid for by the United States Olympic Committee.But getting to that point?That's on the athletes, and often their families.Olympic Hopefuls Gear Up for Winter Games American Olympic hopefuls are doing everything they can to be ready for the 2018 Winter Games in Pyeongchang.(Published Tuesday, Oct. 31, 2017) The cost of the Parsons' 12-year journey thus far has been over $500,000, to cover the ice time, coaching, choreography, dance classes, costumes, ice skates, registration fees and travel expenses necessary to help Rachel and Michael compete at the elite level on the international stage, their dad said."When they were starting out, it was just a thousand or two a year early on.Then it started ramping up steadily as they started competing nationally and then internationally," Richard Parsons said, noting the annual expenses increased from an average of $40,000 a year to $75,000 last year.And the Maryland family is not an outlier in how much it spends eye-popping expenses are par for the course for most Olympians.Parsons said some teams in their sport spend more than $100,000 a year to train at the elite level.Mike Trapp, the 2011 and 2012 U.S. snowboarding champion, said an average season training costs about $35,000 in equipment, coaching and traveling expenses.It's more expensive in a year leading up to the Olympics.The native of Cape Cod, Massachusetts, is training in Italy ahead of World Cup qualifiers in December and January.In order to score a spot on the U.S. Olympic team, Trapp needs to finish in the top three in one of five events taking place in Italy, Austria and Slovenia.It took nearly two decades of training and discipline, plus hundreds of thousands of dollars, just for Trapp to reach the cusp of Olympic selection.Rachel and Michael Parsons.Photo credit: Daphne Backman/Ice-dance.com FUNDING THE 'A TEAM' The United States is one of the only countries with an Olympic committee that is not supported through funding from the federal government.The separation was established in 1978 with the Ted Stevens Olympic and Amateur Sports Act, which gave sole control over Americas representation in the games to the USOC and the various sports' national governing bodies under the committee.Under this legislation, the USOC has complete control over the intellectual property associated with the Olympic Games, giving it exclusive distribution rights over logos and other licensing material.The autonomy also means the USOC is responsible for raising and allocating all of the funding needed for the U.S. to compete in the Olympics and Paralympics.It does this through trademark licensing, corporate sponsors and broadcast revenue.Some of the money is also distributed to various sports' national governing bodies to help fund athlete development.Richard Parsons said that once his kids made the jump to the junior level in ice dancing they began receiving support from the U.S.Figure Skating Association, which helped offset some of their costs.The money is allocated based on performance, or "likelihood that an athlete will win a medal," according to Team USA spokesman Mark Jones.This pay-for-performance model leaves some organizations struggling to support their athletes.Olympians Try Korean Snacks In preparation for the Olympic Winter Games, NBC gave Team USA some of the most popular Korean snacks to see what they thought of them.(Published Tuesday, Oct. 31, 2017) "U.S.Ski and Snowboard can only fund the A team," Trapp said.As a B team member, Trapp, who moonlights as a mechanic during his summers, has had to foot the bill for his training."I'm doing this all on my own dime," he said."That job keeps the dream alive."The A team is fully funded in the U.S. ski teams budget, which allocates about $100,000 per athlete annually, according to U.S.Ski President Tiger Shaw."But theres a $2 million funding gap in paying for travel costs for B and C team athletes."Members of the B and C teams are billed $15,000 to $20,000 at the beginning of each season to close the gap.Shaw acknowledged that is a significant amount of money, but the only other option, he said, is to cut half the team.He said the organization works with the athletes to help them find sources of revenue.EXPENSIVE SCHOOLING Like many elite athletes competing in snowsports, Trapp attended a ski academy during his formative school years, albeit part-time.From sixth to 11th grade, Trapp transferred out of his regular school curriculum for part of the year to train at Waterville Valley Academy in New Hampshire, where tuition for a three-month season cost $15,000, not including equipment and race fees.That figure pales in comparison to the $55,000 tuition Olympic gold medalist Mikaela Shiffrin paid to attend Burke Mountain Academy in Vermont full-time.Olympic Torch Lighting Starts Relay to Pyeongchang Games The torch for the 2018 Winter Olympics was lit among the ruins of Olympia, Greece, marking the start of its 100-day journey to the Pyeongchang Games.Skier Apostolos Aggelis, of Greece, was the first torch-bearer.(Published Monday, Oct. 30, 2017) Shiffrin was born in Vail, Colorado, "an epic ski town," she told NBC.Both her parents and her older brother are skiers, and they grew up with skiing as their "family recreational sport."She recalled starting out in a kids' "Fresh Tracks" training program by age 5.When it came time for high school, the prodigy who was already winning races opted for a ski academy.She gained entrance to one of the country's most exclusive ski academies, where Shiffrin trained for hours each day, learning "a lot about time management" and "being responsible."Shiffrin went on to claim gold in the slalom in Sochi.But it's not just expensive to attend an exclusive training program.To even be considered for admission to an elite ski school, applicants usually need a solid foundation in skiing and a resume of winning races."You had to apply and get in, and part of that process obviously is showing your skiing resume you couldnt just be a beginner," said Gordy Megroz, a graduate of Stratton Mountain School in Vermont.And though some ski schools offer junior classes for skill-development training, "realistically youd need to live within four or five hours of the ski area to be able to get to practice, races and lessons," said Megroz, highlighting the geographical difficulties some aspiring athletes face.He learned to ski growing up in Vermont, he said, by standing on his father's and grandfather's skis when he was as young as 2 years old.He started competing when he was 10.His parents drove him to races on weekends."You have to pay for everything from season passes to equipment to race fees," Megroz said."Its certainly an expensive sport no disputing that.People who get into ski racing probably are pretty affluent."Former U.S.Ski Team coach and co-founder of the alpine skiing World Cup, Robert "Bob" Beattie, said the cost of ski racing is pricing out talent who have no income and "killing our sport.""We're only getting kids with money," Beattie said in a March interview with the Aspen Times."Kids like Billy Kidd, Jimmie Heuga and Buddy Werner would never be ski racers now.They could never afford it.Their parents didn't have that kind of money."Kidd and Huega became the first American men to win Olympic medals in skiing, taking silver and bronze respectively in the slalom at the 1964 Games.'WE'VE HAD TO MAKE A LOT OF SACRIFICES' Chasing the Olympic dream is a risky venture, and for most families, raising an Olympic athlete is a tremendous investment with no guarantee of a monetary return.Many Olympians are young, and a lot of their expenses are covered by their parents.The average Olympic hopeful will train for a decade or more.And with athletes devoting more than six hours a day, six days a week to training, there isn't much room for a part-time job or career.Team USA Concerned About N. Korea, But Trusts USOC With tensions high between North Korea and the U.S., how do Olympic hopefuls feel about traveling to South Korea for the 2018 Olympic Winter Games?(Published Friday, Oct. 27, 2017) Michael Parsons, now 22, began skating at age 7, and sister Rachel Parsons, 19, at age 6.Their parents credit the Wheaton Ice Skating Academy, a Maryland rink run by Russian ice dancing champions Alexei Kiliakov and Elena Novak, for making the endeavor affordable in the early years by offering classes in group sessions, which are less expensive than private lessons.But as their kids began moving up the ranks, they required more training, fresh routines, new costumes and more money.And just as they were taking off on the world stage, the 2008 recession hit and Richard Parsons was laid off from his job by 2009."We've had to make a lot of sacrifices.We're just a middle class family and we've had to be very creative, especially with two," Parsons said, noting the family doesn't take vacations, he and his wife drive older-model, well-worn cars and they don't shop for new clothes.Team USA speedskater Emily Scott made headlines in 2013 when she applied for food stamps while training for the Olympics after her monthly stipend from the U.S.Speed Skating Federation got cut from $1,950 to $600.Scott turned to crowdfunding site GoFundMe for help, ultimately flying to Sochi thanks to thousands of strangers.Like many athletes vying for the Olympics, Trapp and the Parsons have also turned to crowdfunding to raise the money needed to fund their goals.Even entire teams and national sports organizations are turning to sites like Rallyme and Dreamfuel to help foot the bill to prepare for the Winter Games.But despite all the hardships, Richard Parsons said Rachel and Michael have gotten so much out of the experience that "I wouldn't change it for the world."Click here to support Team Parsons or here to support Mike Trapp.NBC's Emilie Mutert contributed to this report.

Still Obsessing Over Tonya and Nancy Nearly 25 Years Later:::::Pop quiz, hotshot.Where were you the evening of Feb. 25, 1994?Well, if you're over the age of 35 it's a fairly safe bet you were huddled around a television that night watching Olympic figure skating.But this wasn't just any Olympic ice skating.It was appointment television because it was was Tonya Harding versus Nancy Kerrigan, the Super Bowl of ice skating showdowns.And the appeal had nothing to do with their competition on the ice.Their duel would become the third-highest-rated sporting event ever to that point.Long before the days of Facebook or Twitter or any social media, when people still largely digested their information from newspapers and the evening news, the showdown between Kerrigan and Harding captivated the nation.And to this day we're still not over it hence the upcoming film starring Margot Robbie and Amy Adams, "I, Tonya."It was on Jan. 6, 1994 at the U.S.Figure Skating Championships in 1994 just one month before the Winter Olympics in Lillehammer, Norway that Kerrigan was clubbed in the knee leaving skating practice.Video of her plaintively screaming "Why?Why?"amid sobs played on endless loops on the evening news for days afterward.In a 2013 "Today" show interview, Kerrigan spoke about the horrific incident."Watching anything sort of horrific, its disturbing to see anybody in pain," Kerrigan said."To think its me its a lifetime ago.It hurts to see anybody in such pain.Its a long time ago.I just moved on."Check Out the New Olympic Skating Stadiums South Korea is ahead of schedule in constructing venues for the 2018 Winter Olympics and NBC got an exclusive tour of the arenas that will host skating events.Some of the biggest events of the games will take place here.(Published Monday, Oct. 30, 2017) It was later revealed that Jeff Gillooly, Harding's then-husband, had hired Shane Stant to maim Kerrigan in a bid to knock her out of the upcoming Olympics.To this day, Harding disputes her level of involvement, but she was ultimately convicted of hindering the investigation.Harding received three years' probation, 500 hours of community service and a $160K fine, and was banned from the U.S.Figure Skating Association for life.But before all that, she was free to compete in Lillehammer, and she did.After a series of mishaps, Harding came eighth.Kerrigan, healed from the attack, took home silver.Not surprisingly, over the past 23 years, the lives and careers of Harding and Kerrigan careened along distinctively different paths.Kerrigan was inducted into the Figure Skating Hall of Fame in 2004, has served as a special correspondent covering various Olympic Games and this year, at age 47, returned to spotlight by competing on "Dancing with the Stars."Welcome to Pyeongchang: A Look Inside the 2018 Olympic Venue The years weren't as kind to Harding.She released a sex tape showing her with Gillooly, was arrested on domestic violence charges in 2000 and appeared on Fox's "Celebrity Boxing" in 2002.Now, thanks to the upcoming film, a new generation will get to relive the Kerrigan-Harding feud.This is the VERY FIRST LOOK at @itonyamovie also starring @imsebastianstan and #allisonjanney Coming soon to theaters!A post shared by @margotrobbie on Oct 19, 2017 at 8:34am PDT "To be honest, when I read the script, I didnt know who Tonya Harding was, and I didnt realize it was a true story," Robbie, who plays Harding, told Vanity Fair."I thought it was entirely fictionalized and our writer Steve was so creative to come up with the quirky characters and absurd incidents."Robbie is not the first to portray Harding onscreen.Both Melanie Hutsell and Amy Poehler parodied her on NBC's "Saturday Night Live," in 1994 and 2002, respectively.Tina Yothers played the athlete in Comedy Central's spoof, "Spunk: The Tonya Harding Story" in 1994, as did Alexandra Powers in NBC's drama, "Tonya & Nancy: The Inside Story" in 1994.Robbie told Vanity Fair after the film was completed she and the director screened it for Harding, who was moved to tears."I think it is a lot for someone to have the most traumatic events of their life encompassed in a two-hour film," Robbie said."I feel like you have to be very brave to let someone do that.I dont know if I could do that, and she handled it incredibly."Pyeongchang 2018: The Comebacks

Mason, an American professor of Korean tourism at Sejong University in Seoul.Mason has lived in South Korea for more than 30 years, and was part of the committee that helped create the Temple Stay program that opened up the South Korea.With our Temple Stay program, we can show an entirely different and balancing side of Korea: the quiet simplicity and subtle beautiful artworks, charming aspects like the green tea ceremony, beautiful mountains and a profoundly deep enlightened spirituality with roots 1,600 years deep -- the Outside-of-the Seoul-urban part of Korea, Mason told NBC in an email.On a typical day in a temple, guests are awoken at 4 a.m. by a moktak, a wooden percussion instrument used for the morning chanting ceremony.Visitors can practice Buddhist meditation and other traditions such as lotus flower making, wood block printing and cooking communal meals of rice and vegetables are cooked and served in moderate amounts so there is no waste.Leisurely walks through the forest are encouraged.Despite the tranquil imagery, tourists should keep in mind that staying in a mountain temple in the depths of winter wont be as comfortable as in spring or fall, except for people who love cold, Mason said.But on the other hand, having this unique and very pleasant experience of authentic Korean traditional culture might well be the most memorable part of many tourists visit, he said.'These Spiritual Burpees Are a Real Test' Mohammed Sami, who stayed at the Woljeongsa temple in Pyeongchang in January of 2015, said not everything went as expected during his stay with his girlfriend.The couple, visiting from Toronto was looking forward to guided meditation sessions and making lotus flower lanterns, but neither of these activities were offered at the time of their stay because there were too few people, they were told.Still, they took part in bead making and prayer services and enjoyed breathing the fresh mountain air, and Sami said he'd recommend that others stay there as part of the Temple Stay program.Even in the bone-chilling winter, it's a wonderful place to experience, especially when the entire place is covered in snow, Sami said in an email.The pagoda in the middle of the the temple is beautifully lit up at night.The ceremonious ringing of the bells and banging of the drums by the monks is definitely something to experience; you do get to strike the bell yourself.The pine tree forest close by is really calming.It occurred to one temple visitor that his temple would actually be more work than relaxation when he realized how often he would have to sit cross-legged.Journalist Andrew Sun, who described himself as a "meat-eating, Facebook-addicted non-believer" in an article in The South China Morning Post, stayed at the Beomosa temple near Busan.Making prayer beads, which was meant to be a sort of meditation in motion, was more of a physical struggle than he had expected, Sun wrote."The drill is that for each bead we insert the string through, we must perform a full prostration from a standing position," Sun wrote, adding that there were 108 beads total and they had to maintain a strict tempo."These spiritual burpees are a real test and most of the group fall behind or resort to a kneeling bow."Sun said he only managed to clear his mind toward the end of his 24-hour stay."Im not sure I feel enlightened, but at least Ive stopped caring that my phones battery is almost dead," he wrote.Buddhism's Revival in South Korea The idea of foreign tourists staying in their temples was not originally welcomed by the Jogye Order, the representative order of traditional Korean Buddhism.They were imagining drunken European soccer hooligans burning down their temples, Mason said.But Mason and the rest of the special tourism committee, created in 2001 by former president Kim Dae-Jung to build new tourism initiatives, convinced the order to try out the concept when they presented it as a missionary opportunity for tourists interested in Buddhism and as a means of spreading the heritage of Korean Buddhism and traditional Korean culture.For 500 years, Buddhism was suppressed in South Korea, forcing monks to take refuge in monasteries deep in the mountains and exiled from most of civilization.But as of the late 20th Century, when paved roads and electric lines were brought into those temples (and now full internet and cellphone access, with other luxuries), these are now some of the best places to live -- grand monasteries right inside national parks and provincial parks, amidst the best scenery of the nation, Mason said.Foreign tourists aren't the only ones taking advantage of this program.South Koreans from Seoul often stay in these temples as a low-priced health spa option and to reduce the stress from urban life, Mason said.A night in a temple starts at about $44 per night for an adult, with stays ranging from two days to up to a month.Day trips are also available starting at $27.The the official Temple Stay website provides more details and reservation information.Although it was created by the government, the Temple Stay program was handed over to the Jogye Order in 2005 after a few years of operation.Mason calls this "a textbook excellent case of how religious tourism should be run by the religion themselves, even if government and commercial interests help get the program going, in order to keep it 'authentic' and not 'Disneyfied.'"
The Top 10 Social Media Moments That Made Sochi Olympics Memorable:::::How much do you remember from the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia?We put together a quiz to test your knowledge as we look ahead to 2018 in PyeongChang, South Korea.(Published Tuesday, Oct. 17, 2017) The Olympic torch will soon journey to Pyeongchang, South Korea, to kick start the 2018 Winter Olympics.Top athletes from around the world will vie for a cherished gold medal in 15 different winter sports when the competition starts Feb. 8.As sports fans gear up for the Winter Olympics and the internet anxiously awaits what new memes will surface, take a look back at some of the top Sochi social media moments from the 2014 Winter Olympics.The top 10 viral moments from Sochi include puppies, toilets and more: 10.Missing Olympic Ring: The Opening Ceremony Snowflake That Never Was The opening ceremony is a time for the host country to showcase its pomp and the worlds first glance at the Olympic athletes.With years of preparation and billions of dollars and resources put into its production, its no wonder a malfunction during the ceremony might draw attention.That's what happened during Sochi's -- a lighted snowflakes that was supposed to open into the fifth Olympic ring did not work.The stubborn snowflake became a meme, but the Russians took it in stride, making fun of it in their closing ceremony festivities.9.Oshies Shootout Goals Help U.S.Beat Russia's Hockey Team Sharpshooter T.J.

Would a US Men's Ice Hockey Gold in 2018 Be Another Miracle?:::::The NHL will not allow its players to participate in the 2018 Winter Olympics.Mens head coach Tony Granato is up for the challenge of putting a competitive team on the ice with players from college and other leagues.The Winter Olympics are approaching against a backdrop of nuclear-armed tension, NHL players won't be playing in the hockey tournament and the men's team from Russia is the distinct favorite to win gold.What was true in 1980 is also shaping up as the situation for Team USA at the 2018 Olympics.The NHL has refused to let its players represent their countries at the games, but the bona fide Russian stars playing in the world's second-best hockey league, the Russian-based Kontinental Hockey League, can still make the trip to Pyeongchang.Bookies have Team Russia as the front-runner in the run-up to the 2018 Games, while some of the Americans playing may be unknown even to serious hockey fans.Still, if you ask the captain of the "Miracle on Ice" team, it won't count as a miracle if the group of American college kids and professionals playing in minor leagues or abroad beats Russia this time around.Olympians Try Korean Snacks In preparation for the Olympic Winter Games, NBC gave Team USA some of the most popular Korean snacks to see what they thought of them.(Published Tuesday, Oct. 31, 2017) "We're a good team, we're not unknowns anymore.The days of the 'Miracle on Ice,' those days are over," said Mike Eruzione, now director of special outreach at Boston University."1980 will never happen again."Russia has won four world championships in the last decade, but it's a perennial underachiever at the Olympics, last medaling in 2002 and only winning silver before that.Russia was eliminated by the U.S. in the first round at the 2014 Sochi Games despite being on home ice.The Soviet team, by contrast, won gold in seven of nine tries.But Russia's time may be at hand, after the NHL said in April that it would not disrupt its season for 17 days to accommodate Olympic play.NHL players have participated in the Olympics since 1998.The KHL, which features teams from across Europe and one in China, has plenty of Russian players who were all-stars back in North America.Ilya Kovalchuk, who once led the NHL in goals, retired from the New Jersey Devils in his prime to move to Russia.He could have returned to the U.S. over the offseason this year, but has called the Olympics "one of the main factors" in deciding against it.His SKA Saint Petersberg teammates, Pavel Datsyuk and Slava Voynov, won Stanley Cups with the Detroit Red Wings and L.A. Kings, respectively.(Voynov went to jail on a domestic violence charge in 2015, then decamped for Russia.)Meanwhile, the all-time highest-scoring foreigner in the KHL is Brandon Bochenski, a Minnesota native who's relatively unknown stateside but was the captain of Barys Astana in Kazakhstan.He retired this year with 154 goals in seven KHL seasons, after scoring just 28 goals in five years in the NHL.Bochenski last played for the Kazakh national team he's a newly minted citizen.Olympic Torch Lighting Starts Relay to Pyeongchang Games The torch for the 2018 Winter Olympics was lit among the ruins of Olympia, Greece, marking the start of its 100-day journey to the Pyeongchang Games.Skier Apostolos Aggelis, of Greece, was the first torch-bearer.(Published Monday, Oct. 30, 2017) U.S. men's coach Tony Granato is picking players for his roster among Americans playing abroad, in domestic minor leagues (unless their contract would allow them to play in the NHL) and in colleges.The list will be announced around Jan. 1.The Team USA line-up for an international Olympic tune-up tournament this November offers a glimpse into who will be playing in Pyeongchang, and it lacks the star power of their Russian rivals.Brian Gionta, who won a Stanley Cup in 2003 with the New Jersey Devils, is the most recognizable name on the list, but the 38 year old is eligible for the Olympics only because no NHL team signed him this year.The other player on the list with prior Olympic experience is Ryan Malone, 37.He last played in the NHL in 2014 and retired before suiting up again this year for the Iowa Wild of North America's top minor league, the American Hockey League.He has one assist in eight games, in which his team has been outscored by eight goals when he's been on the ice (excluding power plays).But navigating the Olympics without NHL players isn't bothering coach Granato."I think we have a tremendous talent pool of players that are available to us," Granato said."We'll be able to put together a fun team, an energetic team and a skilled team that'll make the Americans proud."Granato noted the way players in the U.S. grow up dreaming of wearing the jersey: "You're playing in the basement of your house and you're pretending like you're Mike Eruzione and Jim Craig and Mark Johnson."Eruzione is, of course, familiar with winning against a much-hyped team from Russia, scoring the game-winning goal in the "Miracle" game and taking the gold-medal podium as Team USA's captain.But despite the long odds, he always thought they could make the podium."I always tell people, if you think you're going to lose, you probably will," Eruzione said.He knows all the ex-NHL stars that Russia will have in 2018, while the U.S. will be missing guys like Patrick Kane and budding stars Auston Matthews and Jack Eichel.But he noted some very big differences between his team and today's that make it hard to compare the two.For one thing, his 1980 team had six months of training to gel as a team, while none of the top Olympic teams will train together for anything like that much time.Eruzione's team had an average age of 21, while this team will probably be much older.Oh, and the U.S. junior players, some of whom are in contention to make the team, are the reigning world champions, having beaten Canada in a shootout.Team USA Concerned About N. Korea, But Trusts USOC With tensions high between North Korea and the U.S., how do Olympic hopefuls feel about traveling to South Korea for the 2018 Olympic Winter Games?(Published Friday, Oct. 27, 2017) "I don't see this as being a super huge challenge, other than coming together as a team," Eruzione said.He knows one of the college players who starred on that victorious world junior team, Jordan Greenway, from his work at Boston University, where Greenway is a junior.He's an "awesome kid," big and competitive, Eruzione said, and definitely has a chance of making the team."It's obviously a big change," Greenway said of the NHL's decision not to participate in the Olympics."I think everyone's really excited just to kind of see how it turns out."Eruzione didn't have too much advice for the collegiate players who may end up taking the ice against some of the best Russian players of their generation with the whole world watching.They already have plenty of international experience, he said."You're still playing on a sheet of ice.Who's in the crowd is really irrelevant," Eruzione said."Just go out there and play."
Meet Soohorang, Pyeongchang's Protective Olympic Mascot:::::In this July 18, 2016, file photo, South Korean students react to the mascot for the 2018 Pyeongchang Winter Olympics, a white tiger named "Soohorang," during the mascots' first public staging event at Hoenggye elementary school in Pyeongchang.The mascot for the 2018 Pyeongchang Winter Olympics is a white tiger named Soohorang, and there's a rich symbolism and culture behind the animal, which is closely tied to Korean mythology and culture.A familiar symbol in the host country's folk tales, the tiger often represents trust and strength.It is seen as a guardian that helps protect the country and its people, according to the Olympic announcement unveiling Soohorang.His white fur also has meaning, calling to mind the snow and ice found at the sports that will be played at Pyeongchang.Pyeongchang Winter Olympics Venue Pronunciation Guide As we get closer to the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea, here is a pronunciation guide for some of the venues at the Winter Games, as spoken by NBC Boston's Young-Jin Kim, a Korean American journalst.(Published Wednesday, Nov. 1, 2017) The name Soohorang is derived from a few Korean words and phrases."Sooho" is the Korean word for "protection," as in the protection of the Games' athletes, spectators and other participants."Rang" comes from "ho-rang-i," meaning tiger.It also comes from "Jeongseon Arirang," the traditional folk music of South Korea's Gangwon Province, home to Pyeongchang."It's a beautiful animal," IOC member Gunilla Lindberg said in a statement."It also symbolizes the close link between the Olympic Winter Games and the natural environment."Soohorang can be seen in the icons representing the different sports being played at the Games, trying his hand at each.Photo credit: PyeongChang 2018 He isn't the first tiger to serve as an Olympic mascot in Korea.Hodori, an orange Amur tiger, was the mascot for the 1988 Seoul Summer Games.Soohorang also has a friend, the mascot for the 2018 Paralympic Games in Pyeongchang: a black Asian bear named Bandabi.Pyeongchang 2018: The Comebacks With the Winter Games six months away, we take a look at some of the athletes who fell short of their goals at the Sochi Games and are looking to make comebacks in South Korea.(Published Monday, Oct. 30, 2017) "The mascots have been designed to embody the collective will of everyone for the successful hosting of the Olympic and Paralympic Games in 2018," PyeongChang 2018 Organizing Committee President Lee Hee-beom said in a statement.The first official Olympic mascot was a dachshund named Waldi for the 1972 Games in Munich.Dachschunds are popular animals in Bavaria, known for their endurance and agility.
Ten things I like and don't like, including Kyrie-Horford wizardry:::::Time for our weekly run around the league ... 1.Andre Drummond, blooming This is the Drummond we've been dying to see.He has taken just 12 shots out of post-ups in 11 games, per Synergy Sports.Drummond tried 277 last season, mostly clunky jump hooks that rarely resulted in free throws.Drummond has abandoned the post to focus on what he does best: setting screens, catching lobs from a revived Reggie Jackson, and snaring above-the-rim rebounds before anyone else can hope to reach them.When Drummond wants to go on his own, he's facing the basket and driving -- something Stan Van Gundy was prodding him to try last season.Van Gundy is even running a lot of the offense through Drummond above the elbows.Tobias Harris and Drummond have developed a refined two-man game; Harris has never been better.On defense, Drummond is venturing further out of the paint to smother pick-and-rolls around the 3-point arc.He has the wheels to corral little guys out there, but he has resisted it in the past.He's also more discerning about ignoring decoy action -- "fluff" in NBA parlance -- and zeroing in on the real threat.Watch him keep half an eye on his man, John Henson, while waiting to pounce on Tony Snell's backdoor cut: The Pistons are playing with a new alertness and ferocity.They are flying around on defense, denying passing lanes and screaming out help assignments.Jackson is pushing the pace more often, and everyone is cutting at full speed.It's like they watched Avery Bradley in practice and realized, "Oh, that's how you cut with purpose."Anthony Tolliver has brought an indispensable brew of shooting, defense, and surprising off-the-bounce verve as a bench guy who often plays crunch time.Drummond is at 64 percent from the line even after Wednesday's 0-of-7 stinker.If he sustains as a serviceable free throw shooter, it will be one of the best stories in the league -- a franchise-changing one for the Pistons.2.The Kyrie-Horford mind-meld, and the rip-roaring Celtics In two months, Horford and Irving have established a level of wink-wink mind-meld other tandems can't approach after five years together.Their give-and-go game is already one of the prettiest in the league.Forty of Irving's 100 baskets have come via assists this season; Horford has supplied the dime on 17 of them, more than double any other teammate, per NBA.com.Irving has been the passer on 25 of Horford's 44 assisted buckets.They don't even need the ball to make magic: The guard in Irving's spot there would typically fly around Horford's pick and continue into a handoff from Daniel Theis.Irving sees Dennis Schroder duck under Horford's pick, and senses a chance to moonwalk into a catch-and-shoot triple instead.Horford reads that, and flips his screen around to give Irving daylight.Splash.Boston has scored a mammoth 1.5 points per possession on any trip featuring a handoff between Irving and Horford, per data from Second Spectrum.Among 168 duos who ran at least 50 such plays last season, only one -- Maurice Harkless handing to Damian Lillard, which happened just 57 times -- produced a higher figure.When Horford feels his defender itching to trap Irving, he'll fake the handoff and bolt to the rim -- the NBA's version of a play-action scramble: I'm not sure Horford has played with this kind of constant aggression in his career.It's as if Irving has injected him with some swagger.Horford is driving full-speed when defenders rush to close out on his jumper, dunking on people, and zipping touch passes the moment the ball hits his fingertips.Is Al Horford -- placid, unselfish Al Horford -- showing off just a little?Skeptics worried Boston chose glamour over grit in sending Avery Bradley and Jae Crowder out to make way for Irving and Gordon Hayward.Nope.They lead the league in points allowed per possession, and they are fourth in defensive rebounding.Jaylen Brown, Marcus Smart, Terry Rozier, Horford, Aron Baynes, Daniel Theis and Semi Ojeleye provide plenty of grit, and Marcus Morris will assume a larger role soon.The guards are gang rebounding fiends.Ojeleye has quick feet on defense.Theis is a banger who can shoot a little and pass.Baynes is a walking cement wall.Brown can defend almost every position, and everyone is talking to each other on switches.Jayson Tatum plays like a five-year veteran.Brown and Tatum are shooting well enough from deep -- 44 percent combined -- that Smart can roam the interior when they all play together.The lineup of Irving, Smart, Brown, Tatum and Horford is off to a nice start, and could become Boston's go-to crunch-time group -- this season's "IT and D." Imagine when Hayward is available next season to replace one of the wings?Look out.3.Damian Lillard, slinging fire Lillard's assist numbers haven't budged much, but the quality of his passes has reached a new level.He is slinging crazy diagonals like this -- and with both hands!-- more often than he did even a year ago: Ridiculous.That is some peak Rajon Rondo-level angling.The timing of his pitty-pat pocket passes to Jusuf Nurkic is exquisite.They flow so naturally from the typical rhythm of his dribble that you almost don't see them coming; they kind of look like dribbles, until you realize Nurkic has the ball on his way to a rumbling layup.Portland will need a lot from Lillard during Al-Farouq Aminu's absence.Aminu is a crucial glue guy on defense -- and even on offense when he's canning enough 3s.4.Pascal Siakam, now with more dribbling Injuries helped Siakam butt his way back into Toronto's rotation, and he has made the most of his chance, bringing his usual frenetic energy and some added craft.Siakam wasn't doing stuff like this last season: This is partly a product of Toronto's liberalized offense.They are tossing about 20 more passes per game than last season, assisting on more of their baskets, and relying a little less on their stars to create.Everyone else gets to stretch themselves.The Raps have outscored opponents by about nine points per 100 possessions with Siakam on the floor, per NBA.com.He has meshed nicely with both their backup centers, and even with some starter-heavy units.The jury is still out on ultra-big lineups featuring OG Anunoby, Siakam and one of the Lucas Nogueira/ Jakob Poeltl duo, but they have performed well so far.Anunoby can play.5.When boo-bird targets turn the tables You don't hear a lot of people booing Robert Covington and Chandler Parsons these days, or questioning Horford's max contract.A segment of Philly fans turned on Covington during a shooting slump last season, even though he was providing rock-solid defense across four positions on a contract so larcenous, it spawned its own nickname: The Hinkie Special.Covington is shooting 50 percent from deep, and he has been even better on defense this season; he trails only Paul George, Thaddeus Young, and Kelly Oubre in deflections per game after leading the league last season, per NBA.com.Covington is eligible for a raise and extension on Nov. 15.Expect it to be done within days.Parsons is on fire from deep as the small-ball power forward on bench units that are wrecking the league.He's moving surprisingly well.Fingers crossed.Horford does almost everything for Boston.He'll never average 25 per game, and if you believe only guys who can get buckets one-on-one over and over are worthy of max deals, then you will never believe Horford is worthy of one.But his all-around play and behind-the-scenes leadership are converting skeptics.6.The sheer amount of Ricky Rubio and Donovan Mitchell happening in Utah It was charming for a while -- the shaggy passing savant embracing his selfish side, and the fearless rookie jitterbugging into step-back 3s and artful floaters.It has started to come apart.Ricky Rubio is down to 39 percent overall, and 30 percent from deep on a career high (by a mile) in shot attempts.He has mastered some nice back-and-forth pick-and-roll dance steps with Rudy Gobert, but Rubio jacking about 12.5 per shots game while dishing only six dimes is an alarm bell.Mitchell's numbers are just as bad: 34 percent from the floor, 31.7 on 3s.And, man, is he letting it fly.Mitchell is launching 19.6 shots for per 36 minutes.Only 13 rotation players cracked the 19 barrier last season: Kawhi Leonard, Stephen Curry, Russell Westbrook, Isaiah Thomas, Anthony Davis, DeMarcus Cousins, Damian Lillard, DeMar DeRozan, Kyrie Irving, Kemba Walker, Carmelo Anthony, Dwyane Wade (do you, Dwyane!)and Zach Randolph (guh).That is not a group for Mitchell.At some point, you need to pass.The volume from Rubio and Mitchell is unsustainable.This shot distribution is less about these guys, and more about Utah's construction.Losing both George Hill and Gordon Hayward robbed them of two off-the-bounce engines who could also space the floor as dangerous 3-point shooters when someone else took the controls.Rodney Hood has siphoned a little of the load, but not enough to make a dent -- and not as much as the Jazz likely anticipated.The other three starters -- Joe Ingles, Derrick Favors, and Rudy Gobert -- are about maxed out in terms of how much offense they can create without help.The ginormous, old-school Favors-Gobert duo is struggling for the first time; Utah's starting lineup has been among the worst heavy-minute groups in the league so far.There is very little space to maneuver when Rubio is on the floor with two traditional big men.The Jazz are down to 27th in points per possession.Squeezing points from this roster will be the biggest challenge of Quin Snyder's NBA career.It is really hard to make the playoffs with a bottom-five offense.7.They're not booing.They're saying KUUUUUUZ My favorite thing about the Lakers' real rookie sensation: Kyle Kuzma's shoot-pass-or-drive decisiveness when the ball swings his way.Secondary players cannot afford to hesitate, even for a second or two, when they get the ball against a scrambling defense.It strangles possessions.It gives the defense a chance to reset itself.Kuzma varies his tactics depending on matchups.If he has a bigger, slower guy on him, Kuzma catches and goes without a real pump fake: He has soft touch with both hands, and a deep bag of wackadoo hooks and runners.Against wings who can match his speed, Kuzma will unleash a mean fake, and whoosh away if they take the bait: The threat of Kuzma's shot has made him a snug fit next to both Julius Randle and now Brook Lopez in L.A.'s revamped starting five.(Randle Hill is thriving, by the way.)?Some adversity is coming, and it may have started last night in a blowout loss against the Wizards.Kuzma is squishy on defense, and he's shooting only 30 percent from deep.It just feels like he has been more accurate.He'll have to make more for that pump-fake to remain convincing.8.Washington's bench (kinda) The decision to stagger star players instead of maximizing the minutes they play together isn't as easy as we make it out to be -- at least for teams with exactly two distinct stars.Depending on roster and opponent, it might make sense on some nights to survive extended minutes with a punchless bench mob -- to try to play to a draw -- and milk 30-plus double-star minutes.Washington probably faces the most pressing version of this night-to-night dilemma.Their main starting lineup is plus-72 in 144 minutes, per NBA.com/Stats.All other lineups are minus-38 in 389 minutes.It's Groundhog Day in D.C.: The bench isn't quite carrying its weight, and the Wiz are talking junk before crapping the bed against too many bad teams.The return of Markieff Morris should help, but it pushes Kelly Oubre Jr. -- shooting a preposterous 44 percent from deep -- into an alpha reserve role for which he is ill-suited.The Oubre version of Washington's bench mob -- Tim Frazier, Jodie Meeks, Oubre, Mike Scott, and Ian Mahinmi -- has been a mess on both ends.These five just sort of go through their paces for 20 seconds, cutting and screening and gaining no north-south traction, before someone heaves a shot.Scott Brooks has tried Otto Porter in the lone starter role alongside four bench players, but that's a tough ask for him, too.(He is playing so well this season, he might be ready for it.)?I've pitched the idea before of moving Morris to the bench; he served as Washington's holdover starter for much of last season, and he can generate offense on the block.That move has downsides.If Morris doesn't buy in, it's a no-go.It would also create a logjam of backup bigs.The real solution against top competition will be to stagger John Wall and Bradley Beal so that one is always on the floor, and I suspect Brooks will do this in the postseason -- unless the bench gives him a reason to chance it.9.Golden State, entering Destructo Mode Uh oh.They woke up.The Warriors are 5-0 since a blas?home loss to Detroit.They have outscored those five opponents -- four strong playoff candidates and the even-better Spurs -- by almost 22 points per game.They are doing that thing again where they come out in the third quarter and absolutely blow the doors off of people.They have blitzed those five teams by 12 points per game alone in the third quarter, per NBA.com.They are scoring 116.2 points per 100 possessions -- on pace to bust their own record as the greatest offensive team in NBA history.The chasm between that figure and the No.2 mark -- Houston, at 109.3 -- is the same as the gap between the Rockets and Philadelphia's 20th-ranked offense.They have cracked the top 10 in points allowed per possession, and they will rise further.Steve Kerr's apoplectic reactions to uncalled travels are in postseason form.They have assisted on 70 percent of their buckets, tops in the league.They have barely even begun to incorporate Nick Young and Omri Casspi.They don't even really have to.They are getting quality minutes from all of their centers, and when their centers score, you can warm up the bus.David West is shooting 68 percent!Kevon Looney looks more comfortable moving around on defense.They even allow Zaza Pachulia to flip up a few goofy scoop shots every night, just so he keeps setting screens and boxing dudes out.I sat just above the baseline in Denver on Saturday night when the Warriors, up five at halftime, put up 27 points in the first 6 minutes.30 seconds of the third quarter.They whipped the ball around so fast, I could barely track it.One 3-pointer bled into another.The Nuggets had no clue what hit them.They had no idea what to do.It is jarring, and frankly almost uncomfortable, to see a good team in the world's best basketball league rendered helpless.They had no recourse.Kevin Durant is blocking everything, just for sport.Draymond Green is never out of place on defense, and he's shooting well again -- and with confidence pouring out of him -- on the other end.Stephen Curry is still below 40 percent from deep, but he looks like a man fully in command of the game.He's playing with an icy calm, happy to take what the defense gives -- even if it means launching a few long 2s, or driving into contact.Their early-season scuffles gave us all some hope for suspense.They are extinguishing it right now.10.Basketballs in photos The yearbook-style media day photos are corny enough -- the ones in which players, wearing their official jerseys, all put their hands on a basketball that is there for no reason and grin like lunatics.Sometimes they even pretend they are fighting over the ball, and make mean faces at each other!Fun!But why in the hell is cocktail chic Dwane Casey randomly holding a basketball?"Why yes, I did bring a basketball to the bar.Is that weird?Can I coat check it?Why are you walking away from me like Homer Simpson backing through the hedge?"It's so absurd, this almost counts as a "like."But the placement of basketballs in official team photos has gone too far.
Colts put Andrew Luck on IR:::::INDIANAPOLIS -- The Colts have placed quarterback Andrew Luck on the injured reserve list, general manager Chris Ballard announced Thursday.The decision came after Luck went to visit with doctors earlier this week to ask why he was still having soreness in his right shoulder.It also ends months of speculation about whether the quarterback would play this season after having surgery in January."The one thing I want y'all to understand is that there's never been once a time where I've tried to mislead, [when] this organization has tried to mislead," Ballard said."This whole thing has been very fluid."Luck told the team's website that he is optimistic about his future."I wish I was better and 100 percent this season, but that's not the case," Luck said."I know I'll be better from this.I know I'll be a better quarterback, teammate, person and player from this, and I'm excited for the future."Luck practiced on Oct. 4 for the first of two times since December 2016.Then he practiced two more times before he was shut down and given a cortisone shot to see if the soreness would subside."The consensus from all the doctors is to continue rehab, to be patient and continue rehab," Ballard said."The shoulder is subjective and after a surgery everybody's different, everybody rehabs at a different way.So we're going to shut his throwing down and we're going to continue to rehab.We're going to continue hard rehab."We think for the long-term interest of Andrew this is the best course of action.I've heard all sorts of rumors about 'career-ending.'That's not the case here.I've not got that from one doctor.Career-ending is putting him out on the field before he's ready to play.That's where you should be concerned."Ballard, as he has consistently said since April, will not put a timetable on Luck's return.That means there's no guarantee the quarterback will take part in offseason workouts in the spring.Luck will continue his rehabilitation at different places and they will take "a little different approach and do some different strength and recovery efforts to try to get the soreness out."Injuries have derailed what was a positive start to Luck's career.The Colts selected him with the No.1 overall pick in 2012 and he started every game during his first three seasons.The Colts went to the playoffs, including the AFC Championship Game in 2014, in each of those seasons.Luck originally injured his shoulder during the 2015 season in Week 3 at Tennessee.He missed two games due to his shoulder and then missed the final seven games of that season due to a lacerated kidney.Luck missed a game last season with a concussion and all of this season with the shoulder.Despite dealing with the shoulder injury that caused him to miss practice at times last season, Luck threw for 4,240 yards and 31 touchdowns while completing a career-high 63.5 percent of his passes.The Colts missed the playoffs in 2015 and 2016 and will likely miss them again this season.They're currently 2-6."It's unfortunate that we've come to this point," coach Chuck Pagano said in a video posted on the Colts' Twitter account."Andrew is frustrated.Andrew wants to be out there.Andrew wants to be fighting with his teammates.He's a great warrior, he's a great competitor and he's a great player, one of the best in this league.He'll be back.He's going to get right.This is the right thing to do for him and the right thing to do for the organization.He'll be back."The Colts tried to sign Eagles quarterback Nate Sudfeld off the practice squad, but Philadelphia promoted him to its 53-man roster Wednesday to avoid losing him, a league source told ESPN's Tim McManus.On Tuesday, the Colts worked out free-agent quarterbacks Josh Johnson, Matt Barkley, Matt McGloin and Connor Shaw, according to ESPN's Adam Schefter.Jacoby Brissett has been starting at quarterback in Luck's absence.Brissett, who was acquired from the New England Patriots before the start of the season, has completed 60.4 percent of his pass attempts (145 of 240) for 1,642 yards with five touchdowns and four interceptions.He also has rushed for three touchdowns this season.
Seahawks CB Richard Sherman out for season after rupturing Achilles:::::GLENDALE, Ariz. -- Seattle Seahawks cornerback Richard Sherman?will miss the rest of the season after suffering a ruptured Achilles tendon in Thursday night's 22-16 win over the Arizona Cardinals.?Sherman exited the game in the third quarter and did not return.He says he expects to undergo surgery after swelling in the Achilles goes down in the next few days."No coming back from that until you get surgery," head coach Pete Carroll said, adding that Sherman "couldn't even walk" after leaving the game and standing on the sideline.?"He's been a bastion of consistency, competitiveness and toughness.We're going to miss the heck out of him."?Sherman,?who has never missed a game since entering the league in 2011, said his Achilles has been bothering him all season and that he has tried to avoid making any drastic cuts.On the play in which he was hurt, Sherman said the defense was playing Cover 2 and that he was going for an interception."I thought I could get the ball.Once it popped, just unfortunate," said Sherman, who was visibly emotional at times while addressing reporters."One of those things that you have to play through for as long as you can.When it goes, it goes."I've put a lot of stress on it.Think it would have gone eventually."In a text message to ESPN's Josina Anderson, Sherman later said, "I'm gonna be back with a vengeance."He also posted his thoughts on Twitter.Sherman was on Seattle's injury report last week because of his Achilles.He was listed as a non-participant all three days, though the team held walk-throughs, and his participation was an estimation of what would have occurred in a normal practice.Sherman has railed against Thursday night football, saying it's hypocritical of the NFL to promote player safety in other areas, only to require teams to play after only three days off.Sherman called Thursday night football a "poopfest" last season in The Players' Tribune and referred to it as "terrible" this week in an interview with ESPN.com.Carroll bit his tongue when asked if the league should change Thursday night football, saying: "I don't want to pay anything so I'm not going to comment on anything."Doug Baldwin and other Seahawks did express their sentiments on the Thursday games, saying it's too much to ask of players to play on only four days of rest."Guys don't have time to recover," he said."Hard to recover in four days."Baldwin said that was "absolutely" what led to so many players going down with injuries in this game.Asked if this game was Exhibit A for why Thursday night games are difficult, he said: "It's Exhibit A, Exhibit B, Exhibit C, Exhibit D, Exhibit Z. Thursday night football should be illegal."Injuries piled up for the Seahawks on Thursday night.Carroll said left tackle Duane Brown sprained his ankle but that the team is unaware how severe the injury is.Brown left late in the second quarter and didn't return."There was guys dropping down on both side with serious, minor injuries," Seahawks linebacker Bobby Wagner said."We play a very physical game, a very physical sport, and to ask us to turn around and be ready after Sunday to turn around and have our bodies OK on that Thursday, it's really tough to do.I hope the league is watching.Hopefully they'll look at it and see what happens and change this format."Defensive lineman Michael Bennett equated it to a boxer having to fight twice in one week."I know you want to give fans what they want but also you want to protect the players as best as you can, and sometimes I feel like Thursday night football doesn't give them the opportunity to be protected like that."Carroll also said safety Kam Chancellor suffered a stinger, and he sounded incredulous when announcing that running back C.J.Prosise, who missed most of the past five games with a right high ankle sprain, sprained his left ankle in the third quarter."I can't even fathom how that happened to this poor kid," Carroll said.Defensive tackle Jarran Reed left in the first half after injuring his hamstring.Linebacker Michael Wilhoite left the game with a calf injury.Defensive linemen Sheldon Richardson and Frank Clark left the game in the fourth quarter after colliding with each other; Richardson returned.Cornerback Shaquill Griffin hurt his shoulder in the third quarter but returned.?Baldwin said his hip tightened up in pregame warm-ups and that the injury worsened during the game.
Keldon Johnson, No. 7 recruit in ESPN 100, commits to Kentucky:::::Top-10 prospect Keldon Johnson?announced his commitment to the?Kentucky Wildcats?on Saturday."Next year I'll be attending the University of Kentucky," Johnson said before Oak Hill Academy's game against Bristol Prep (Tennessee).Johnson chose the Wildcats over Texas, Maryland and NC State.He took official visits to all four schools in September.Kentucky turned up the heat on Johnson in late August, extending a scholarship offer after his unofficial visit to the Lexington campus.The Wildcats had shown interest prior to the offer, but once it looked like an uphill battle for top prospects R.J. Barrett (No.1) and Cam Reddish (No.3), they increased their pursuit.Johnson, a 6-foot-6 small forward from Oak Hill Academy (Virginia), is ranked No.7 in the ESPN 100 for 2018, slotting in as the No.3 small forward behind the Duke-bound duo of Barrett and Reddish.Johnson was one of the best scorers on the Nike EYBL circuit this past spring and summer, averaging 19.7 points, 8.1 rebounds and 3.0 assists for the Boo Williams AAU program.He's capable of big single-game efforts, as evidenced by three outings with 30 or more points.John Calipari and Kentucky now have two high-level prospects in the fold, with Johnson joining five-star point guard Immanuel Quickley (No.12) in the two-man class.Johnson's commitment also continues the Calipari vs. Mike Krzyzewski recruiting battle, as either Duke or Kentucky has finished with the No.1 recruiting class in the country every year since 2013.Of the six top-12 prospects currently committed in 2018, three of them are heading to Duke and two are headed to Kentucky.The two schools are still both involved for Zion Williamson (No.2), while Kentucky is also pursuing Bol Bol (No.4), Quentin Grimes (No.13), Moses Brown (No.17) and Tyler Herro (No.27).
3 UCLA players arrested in China could remain there for 'a week or two,' source says:::::SHANGHAI -- The three UCLA men's basketball players arrested on shoplifting charges Tuesday will remain in Hangzhou, China, and are not with the team on its flight back to Los Angeles after the Bruins' season-opening 63-60 win over?Georgia Tech in Shanghai on Saturday, sources told ESPN.The three players -- freshmen LiAngelo Ball, Cody Riley and Jalen Hill -- were questioned about allegedly stealing sunglasses from a Louis Vuitton store next to the team's hotel in Hangzhou, where the Bruins had been staying before leaving for Shanghai on Tuesday.They were released on bail early Wednesday morning and have been staying at a lakeside hotel in Hangzhou since then while the team had been in Shanghai preparing for Saturday's game.They remained there as of Saturday night along with a team representative.A source with firsthand knowledge of the investigation said the players could be in Hangzhou for "a week or two."The source noted that there is surveillance footage of the players shoplifting from three stores inside of a high-end shopping center, which houses Louis Vuitton, Gucci, Yves Saint Laurent and Salvatore Ferragamo stores.Bruins coach Steve Alford declined to discuss the matter after the team's win.Los Angeles Lakers rookie Lonzo Ball?-- LiAngelo's brother -- on Saturday said his father LaVar called him Friday night and told him the family is staying in China with LiAngelo and that "we are handling it out here, so that's a good sign."Hangzhou police arrived early Tuesday morning at the Hyatt Regency, where UCLA and Georgia Tech were staying ahead of their game, and questioned three players from each team.Team representatives and interpreters were with the players during that time, according to a source.Afterward, LiAngelo Ball, Riley and Hill were taken to the police station in Hangzhou, where they were kept for a number of hours.UCLA representatives, including Alford, were at the police station along with the players.Ball, Riley and Hill were released around 4 a.m. local time Wednesday and returned to the Hyatt Regency, where they have remained since, along with a UCLA representative, according to a source.They are being required by Hangzhou police to remain at the hotel until the legal process is over, the source said.Alford rejoined the rest of UCLA's team in Shanghai on Wednesday morning after the players were released.During the investigation, the school and Pac-12 Conference have been receiving assistance from Chinese e-commerce goliath Alibaba, the presenting sponsor of the Pac-12 China Game.On Monday, UCLA and Georgia Tech received a tour of Alibaba in Hangzhou and met Joseph Tsai, the executive vice chairman and co-founder of Alibaba.Tsai, who recently reached an agreement in principle to purchase a 49 percent minority stake in the Brooklyn Nets that includes the option to acquire controlling interest of the NBA franchise in 2021, splits his time between Hangzhou and La Jolla, California, where his wife and children reside.While talking to UCLA players at Alibaba on Monday, he made it a point to single out freshman guard Jaylen Hands and tell him he watched him play the Bishop's School while Hands was at Foothills Christian last year."Every young person makes mistakes, but the key point is how they will handle it after making the mistake," Tsai said before the game Saturday."I think sometimes things can be very complicated, and the last couple of days I've seen firsthand professionalism on all sides."Before the game in Shanghai on Saturday, the Pac-12 announced that next year's China Game would be a matchup between Cal and Yale; Alibaba extended its sponsorship of the game through 2020."I'm certainly disappointed that we don't have three UCLA students here to compete in the game today, given that they were involved in an incident that's being investigated in Hangzhou," Pac-12 commissioner Larry Scott said Saturday before the game."It has provided a real distraction and unwanted publicity, which distracts from what overall has been a tremendous experience and a tremendous week for the UCLA and Georgia Tech students.It has also highlighted the value of our partnership.We've received tremendous support from our partners at FUSC [Federation of University Sports of China] and Alibaba.We've had a chance to apologize for the unwelcome attention it has brought."There's nothing new.We're monitoring the situation and staying in close contact with the students until the situation, and we hope the situation resolves itself soon."LaVar Ball, and brother LaMelo Ball, who have been in China, visited LiAngelo on Thursday.UCLA athletic director Dan Guerrero visited all three players Friday.The Ball family has been staying at the UCLA team hotel in Shanghai since Tuesday night and is being filmed while in China for the Facebook reality show "Ball in the Family," which was renewed for a second season last month.The family is scheduled to leave Sunday morning for Hong Kong, where the family's Big Baller Brand is opening a pop-up shop on Tuesday.They opened a pop-up shop in Shanghai on Friday night, when a crowd of more than 100 fans lined up to get autographs and pictures with LaVar and LaMelo.On Wednesday morning, LaVar had been expected to address the media from his hotel suite in Shanghai, but he said he was advised by legal counsel not to speak "due to the legal nature of the matter."As he was leaving the hotel later Wednesday, LaVar said: "I'm going to wait until I get some more intel on what's going on, and then I can tell you what's up."Asked if he was worried about LiAngelo, LaVar said, "He'll be fine.He'll be fine.Everybody making it a big deal.It ain't that big of a deal."Lonzo Ball on Saturday said his father's call put his mind at ease, though his father "didn't leave me much information."
Chiefs' Roy Miller arrested in Jacksonville on battery charge:::::JACKSONVILLE, Fla. -- Kansas City Chiefs nose tackle Roy Miller was arrested early Saturday morning and charged with domestic battery.According to the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office Department of Corrections, Miller was booked into the Duval County Jail at 4:53 a.m.ET.He was later released on his own recognizance after an initial court appearance, according to multiple reports.?Another hearing was set for Nov. 28.The incident involved a minor injury.No other details were available, but the Chiefs are aware of the situation."This morning we were informed about an incident involving one of our players, Roy Miller," the Chiefs said in a statement."We are still in the process of gathering details on the situation.We will have no further comment at this time."The Chiefs are on a bye this week.The AFC West leaders next visit the New York Giants on Nov. 19.The 30-year-old Miller played four seasons with the Jacksonville Jaguars before being released March 12.He signed with Kansas City on Aug. 2 and has six tackles and one pass breakup in seven games.The Associated Press contributed to this report.
No. 12 Oklahoma State rallies past No. 24 Cyclones 49-42:::::Mason Rudolph threw for 376 yards and three touchdowns including two in the final 5:55 and 12th-ranked Oklahoma State rallied to beat No.24 Iowa State 49-42 on Saturday and keep its Big 12 title hopes alive.Justice Hill had 134 yards and three TD runs for the Cowboys (8-2, 5-2 Big 12, No.15 CFP), who remain in a tie for second place in the league with two games to go."We're very resilient.I knew it was going to be a difficult game," Oklahoma State coach Mike Gundy said after last week's exhausting 62-52 loss to the rival Sooners.The top two finishers in the Big 12 will meet in the championship game in Arlington, Texas, on Dec. 2.But even if neither the Cyclones nor Cowboys make it to Jerry World, they still gave the Big 12 a game few in the league will ever forget.Rudolph found Marcell Ateman for a 30-yard TD pass, and Hill's two-point conversion run tied the game at 42 with 5:55 left.The Cowboys jumped ahead 49-42 just two minutes later as Rudolph found Dillon Stoner for a 19-yard touchdown reception.The Cyclones got inside Oklahoma State's 3-yard line with 32 seconds left, but Zeb Noland threw an interception to A.J.Green to end the game."It's a gut-wrenching loss.It's not easy.But college football isn't easy," Iowa State coach Matt Campbell said."It's a game of inches, and our job is to win the inch.And we came up a little bit short."Quarterback-linebacker Joel Lanning had a rushing and passing TD for Iowa State (6-4, 4-3).He connected with Allen Lazard on a 22-yard TD strike with 14:13 left a pass Lazard caught with one hand while falling down.David Montgomery made it 42-34 on a subsequent 4-yard run, but Iowa State's highly-rated defense faltered down the stretch.Montgomery had 105 yards and three TDs for the Cyclones.THE TAKEAWAY Oklahoma State: Give the Cowboys credit.They took it to one of the nation's best defenses on the road and made the plays that needed to be made in a game that went bonkers from the opening kick.Oklahoma State became the first Big 12 opponent to score more than their weekly average against the Cyclones.With two home games left against Kansas State and Kansas, Oklahoma State is still very much alive in the league title race.Iowa State: The TD pass from Lanning to Lazard came in their final home game and was a fitting end to their brilliant careers.Lanning and Lazard both passed on offers from more prestigious programs to play for the hometown Cyclones and if Campbell can get Iowa State in a position to compete for Big 12 titles on an annual basis, their contributions won't be forgotten.Sadly, losing a heartbreaker like this one is also fitting for a team with too many agonizing defeats in recent memory to count."That's two loyal soldiers, and two awesome Cyclones forever," Campbell said."That's one of the best catches I've ever seen."UP NEXT Oklahoma State hosts Kansas State on Nov. 18.Iowa State plays at Baylor next Saturday.More college football: http://collegefootball.ap.org and https://twitter.com/APTop25
No. 11 Ohio State rebounds, routs No. 13 Michigan St 48-3:::::No.11 Ohio State put to rest any notion that it wouldn't be motivated to finish strong after a surprising loss last week dropped the Buckeyes out of national championship contention.The Buckeyes came out fast, scoring on five of their first six possessions on the way to a 48-3 rout of No.13 Michigan State, a team that has given them headaches in recent years.The blowout in front of the home fans helped Ohio State (8-2, 6-1 Big Ten, CFP No.13) bury last week's mystifying loss to Iowa, and put it in sole possession of first place in the Big Ten East with two games remaining.J.T.Barrett threw two touchdown passes and ran for two more scores, and Mike Weber rushed for 162 yards and pair of touchdowns for Ohio State."We can't go back in the past, of course, so I mean we try to just move on, learn from things, learn from losses, and I think that's what we did (after last week's game), grew from it."Barrett said.In a season already marked by radical highs and lows, the Buckeyes took out their frustrations on the Spartans (7-3, 5-2 Big Ten, CFP No.12), using a run-heavy attack to dominate them on both sides of the ball."I wouldn't have thought this was going to happen," Michigan State coach Mark Dantonio acknowledged.Ohio State outgained Michigan State 524-195, and a Buckeyes defense that was smoked by unranked Iowa in the 55-24 loss limited Michigan State quarterback Brian Lewerke who threw for 445 yards last week against Penn State to 131 yards and forced two interceptions."We took that one on the chin today," Michigan State center Brian Allen said."Didn't see that coming, but it happened and it kind of sucks."Barrett, who threw four interceptions last week against Iowa, was 14 for 21 for 183 yards Saturday with two touchdowns.He also ran nine times for 55 yards, including a pair of 4-yard touchdown runs.J.K. Dobbins, who split time with Weber in the backfield, rushed 18 times for 124 yards.THE TAKEAWAY: Michigan State: The Spartans suffer a huge letdown after beating Penn State last week and watch their hopes of winning the Big Ten East dissolve in the cold Ohio afternoon.They could never get any significant offensive traction against the stout Buckeyes defense, which was intent on redemption."We have to play better," Lewerke said."We have to step up to the stage when it's there."Ohio State: The Buckeyes shook off a mystifying loss that took them out of national championship contention by bullying a divisional rival.A spot in the Big Ten title game is theirs if they win out.RBS LET LOOSE Ohio State coach Urban Meyer faced questions this week about not using his pair of talented tailbacks enough.He put those concerns to rest on Saturday, with Weber and Dobbins combining for 286 rushing yards.Meyer said "there was a mandate to make sure those guys touch the ball."I thought the running backs ran really, really hard," he said."Even when they got hit, it was plus-2 (yards)."Weber's 162 yards on nine carries was a career high.Dobbins' 128 put him over the 1,000-yard mark for the season.He became the fourth freshman in program history to hit that mark.The third was Weber last year.STARTING LBS HURT Ohio State's defense dominated despite losing starting linebackers Jerome Baker and Dante Booker to midweek injuries.Meyer didn't disclose the nature of the injuries but said both are expected back next week against Illinois.Malik Harrison and Tuf Borland started for them.Borland led the team with 11 tackles.QUOTABLE: "I look at Ohio State and they've lost two games and I had to listen to how poorly the media treated Urban Meyer this week, to be quite honest.And I listened to all the things he was hearing, which I'm sure I'll hear now."-- Dantonio.UP NEXT: Michigan State: Hosts Maryland next Saturday.Ohio State: The Buckeyes warm up for the Michigan finale with a home game against Illinois next week.More AP college football at www.collegefootball.ap.org and https://twitter.com/APTop25.Follow Mitch Stacy at http://twitter.com/mitchstacy
McSorley sets all-time Penn State TD mark in win vs. Rutgers:::::Coach James Franklin saw Saturday's game against Rutgers as an opportunity to bounce back from a tough, two-loss stretch that all but ended Penn State's chance to play for a national championship.It took a little longer than Franklin would have liked for the No.16 Nittany Lions to rediscover the tools they used to dominate opponents in the first half of the season.Trace McSorley accounted for 258 total yards and three touchdowns and Penn State overcame an early deficit with 35 unanswered points to beat the Scarlet Knights 35-6.McSorley became Penn State's all-time touchdown leader with 68, overtaking Daryll Clark's record of 65 with one rushing and two passing scores.Trailing 6-0 with 11:16 left in the first quarter, Penn State's offense came alive with two deep McSorley passes that set up his own zigzagging 20-yard touchdown run.The scoring drive took just 1:44 and gave Penn State the lead for good."I think we're always at our best on offense when Trace factors into our running game and keeps people honest and keeps people on their toes," Franklin said.McSorley threw touchdowns to DaeSean Hamilton and Mike Gesicki, and Saquon Barkley ran for two touchdowns for Penn State (8-2, 5-2 Big Ten).Barkley, a Heisman Trophy candidate, was slowed again.He ran for just 35 yards on 14 carries while McSorley added 44 yards on 13 carries."Their skill players were the difference in the game, including him," Rutgers coach Chris Ash said."He was able to scramble around and extend drives with his feet."Rutgers (4-6, 3-4) got a pair of field goals from Andrew Harte, including one from 33 yards after the Scarlet Knights recovered the opening kickoff.He added a 25-yarder later in the first, but Rutgers' momentum ended there.The Scarlet Knights didn't get a first down in the second half until their final drive, which ended in a turnover on downs.Robert Martin led Rutgers with 71 yards on 11 carries.Giovanni Rescigno completed 7 of 20 passes for 43 yards for the Scarlet Knights.SLOWING SAQUON Barkley, who looked like the Heisman favorite just three weeks ago, had little room to run behind an offensive line without its starting left tackle.Ryan Bates, who was hurt Oct. 28 against Ohio State, missed his second game with an undisclosed injury.Barkley has been held to 63 rushing yards or fewer in each of the last three games."It's part of the game," Barkley said."Obviously I'm aware of what teams are going to try and do and teams are going to try to take away our run game and take away our backs."JUGGLING LINEBACKERS Penn State was without starting outside linebacker Manny Bowen, who was suspended for a violation of team rules.Franklin didn't elaborate and didn't answer a reporter's question, walking out of the media room when asked whether Bowen would return.Veteran walk-on Brandon Smith started in Bowen's spot and made 10 tackles.INJURED KNIGHTS Rutgers receiver Damon Mitchell left the game in the first half with an apparent left leg injury.He was hurt trying to cover a kick and was unable to put weight on his leg as he was helped off.Receiver Janarion Grant also was seen receiving treatment on the bench for what appeared to be a lower body injury during the final few minutes of the game.He's battled injuries throughout his career and has missed three games this season.THE TAKEAWAY Rutgers: The Scarlet Knights let a rare chance to win back-to-back games slip away after a solid first half.They're built to pound the ball and Rescigno showed off some scrambling ability to give Rutgers its best shot.Penn State: Three games ago, Penn State was sitting at No.2 and had a clear path to the playoff with a bona fide Heisman Trophy front-runner in Barkley leading the offense.With two losses and one shaky start later, Penn State can't get Barkley going on the ground, and his Heisman chances are becoming slimmer.UP NEXT Rutgers: Visits Indiana on Saturday.Penn State: Hosts Nebraska on Saturday.More AP college football: http://collegefootball.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/APTop25
AP source: 3 UCLA players stay in China; team returns to US:::::The UCLA basketball team is heading back to Los Angeles without three players arrested on shoplifting charges in China, a person with knowledge of the situation told The Associated Press on Saturday.The person spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter.Freshmen LiAngelo Ball, Jalen Hill and Cody Riley were to remain in Hangzhou, China, while the rest of the team was due back Saturday night.Ball is the brother of Los Angeles Lakers rookie Lonzo Ball.UCLA didn't immediately respond to a request for comment by the AP.No.21 UCLA won its season-opening game 63-60 over Georgia Tech in Shanghai earlier Saturday.The trio was questioned by police about allegedly stealing from a Louis Vuitton store next to the team's hotel in Hangzhou last week, where the Bruins visited before leaving for Shanghai.Citing a source with firsthand knowledge of the investigation, ESPN reports the players could be Hangzhou for "a week or two" while the situation is resolved.The source told ESPN there is surveillance footage of the players shoplifting from three stores inside a high-end retail center.Bruins coach Steve Alford declined to discuss the matter after the team's victory.UCLA Chancellor Gene Block, athletic director Dan Guerrero and Pac-12 Commissioner Larry Scott have been traveling with the team, but only Scott has issued any statements."It has provided a real distraction and unwanted publicity, which distracts from what overall has been a tremendous experience and a tremendous week for the UCLA and Georgia Tech students," Scott said before the game."We've had a chance to apologize for the unwelcome attention it has brought.There's nothing new.We're monitoring the situation and staying in close contact with the students, and we hope the situation resolves itself soon."The conference said Friday that California and Yale will meet in next year's Pac-12 China game to open the 2018-19 season.For more AP college basketball coverage: http://collegebasketball.ap.org and http://twitter.com/APTop25
With no Zeke, is arrow pointing up for Dallas?:::::The arrow was pointing up for the Cowboys, sideways or down for the Falcons.Then a federal court on Thursday upheld the six-game league suspension for Ezekiel Elliott, a damaging blow to Dallas.When they meet Sunday in a critical NFC match, the winner will be in decent position for a run toward the playoffs, hardly what either 2016 conference power projected.The loser, particularly if it is Dallas with NFC East leader Philadelphia already 2?games in front and Elliott presumably gone for much of the remainder of the schedule, will have used up significant margin for error."We know as a team what we're capable of," safety Ricardo Allen said of his 4-4 Falcons ."Just go out there and do our job.Just give a little more, take it to another level."We have another whole half of the season.Get it rolling.Get the small things right."Dallas (5-3) has done a lot of big things right after a 2-3 start.Somehow, the Cowboys managed through all the distractions from their star running back's on-again, off-again suspension, and they handled Kansas City quite well last Sunday.Now comes a huge in-conference test at the new Mercedes-Benz Stadium, where Atlanta is only 1-2, but plays four of its next five games."We've just got to keep on pushing," says receiver Dez Bryant, who is bothered by knee and ankle woes."We know exactly who we are.We're going to show everybody.This is a real team that sticks together and fights for one another.We've been through a lot of adversity, and we're just showing you how to get out of it.That's what we're going to do.We're going to keep on fighting and see where it takes us."The action began Thursday night with Seattle's 22-16 victory in Arizona.Russell Wilson threw two touchdown passes to Jimmy Graham for Seattle.The Seahawks (6-3) limited Adrian Peterson to 29 yards in 21 carries in a game marred by a host of injuries and penalties, most of them against Seattle, to improve to 4-0-1 in Arizona in Bruce Arians' five seasons as coach of the Cardinals (4-5).Off this week are Kansas City (6-3), Philadelphia (8-1), Baltimore (4-5), and Oakland (4-5).New Orleans (6-2) at Buffalo (5-3) Miami (4-4) at Carolina (6-3), Monday night NFC South leaders vs. AFC East chasers.The Saints are one of the league's main surprises.We all expect Drew Brees to load up on passing yards and touchdowns, but New Orleans' ground game has been formidable with Mark Ingram and rookie Alvin Kamara.As for the defense, it's been just as responsible for a six-game win streak."It's just great to see young players bring the Saints back up, because a lot of people just wrote the Saints off and said that we were a bad team and everything," says first-round cornerback Marshon Lattimore, a strong contender for Defensive Rookie of the Year.Buffalo hasn't won at home against New Orleans since 1983.But the Bills are 4-0 at home this season; only the league-leading Eagles also are spotless in their own stadium.Up-and-down Carolina comes off a key division victory against Atlanta and now faces Miami's abysmal offense.All the Panthers have is the NFL's top-rated defense.Miami is averaging a league-low 14.5 points per game, which must make head coach (and offensive guru) Adam Gase cringe.The Panthers seem to be getting first-round pick RB Christian McCaffrey more involved in the offense.Pittsburgh (6-2) at Indianapolis (3-6) A matchup the Steelers love they are 22-6 and have won four straight and tend to get off to strong starts without the ball.Pittsburgh's defense hasn't allowed a TD on an opening possession in 25 games, the longest active streak in the NFL.Expecting Indy's defense to handle RB Le'Veon Bell and WR Antonio Brown might be far too much.Plus, there's turmoil on the Colts after Vontae Davis publicly complained about sitting out with what he says is a balky groin, but what the team called a coach's decision.The veteran cornerback was released Thursday.Minnesota (6-2) at Washington (4-4) An unquestionable lift for the Vikings came this week with Teddy Bridgewater activated.He'll serve as backup to Case Keenum, but his return from a devastating knee injury in training camp 2016 is a huge plus."He hasn't had training camp.He hasn't done anything," coach Mike Zimmer said of the prospect of Bridgewater seeing any action."We're just trying to get him to where everybody feels comfortable with him."Minnesota is comfy atop the NFC North with a two-game lead and showing lots of balance on offense and defense during a four-game win string.Washington comes off a comeback victory at Seattle made more impressive by the wave of injuries it has fought through.Its defense has looked formidable, led by LBs Zack Brown and Ryan Kerrigan.New England (6-2) at Denver (3-5) This might look like a mismatch with the Patriots on a four-game winning streak and the Broncos in a four-game slide.Beware of that: While New England is seeking a 12th consecutive regular-season road win, which would tie its own AFC record, Bill Belichick is 8-10 against Denver.Tom Brady is 3-7."I think they've had good teams," Brady says."Obviously, you play on the road, it's tough communication-wise, but when you play good teams I think the margin of error is even more slim, and this team has always had a good football team."A lot of the games have been close.... You can't go out there and make a bunch of mistakes and expect to win."The Patriots will practice in Colorado Springs next week before taking on Oakland in Mexico City.Denver must protect the ball better.It's minus-12 in turnovers with 19 giveaways and seven takeaways.Los Angeles Chargers (3-5) at Jacksonville (5-3) WOW!The Jaguars won a game at EverBank Field, beating Cincinnati.They were 1-6 there last season.This is no gimme for the AFC South co-leaders.The Chargers have won six straight in this series, scoring 30 or more points in five of those and outscoring the Jaguars by a combined 116 points.Jaguars rookie RB Leonard Fournette can become the first player in NFL history to score a TD in the first seven games of a career.Former Jaguars coach and current Chargers defensive coordinator Gus Bradley returns to Jacksonville 11 months after getting fired to end one of the worst coaching tenures in NFL history.Bradley went 14-48 with the Jags.Cincinnati (3-5) at Tennessee (5-3) Cincinnati ranks last in overall offense, so it's lucky that star wide receiver A.J.Green was not suspended for his fight with Jacksonville CB Jalen Ramsey last week.The Bengals best hope probably is getting an efficient pass rush led by Geno Atkins.These are the kind of games in which the Titans tend to stumble while in the playoff chase.But they have won three straight and have a dynamic rushing attack with DeMarco Murray, Derrick Henry and quarterback Marcus Mariota.Titans S Kevin Byard has five interceptions in his past two games, tying him for the most in consecutive games since 1970.Byard leads the NFL with six picks and Andy Dalton has thrown eight.Houston (3-5) at Los Angeles Rams (6-2) The Rams could ravage Tom Savage in this matchup as LA returns home.The previous time the Rams played at the Coliseum was Oct. 8.Houston was inept on offense for most of last week's loss to Indianapolis as it needed to revamp much of the offense to suit the more stationary, less imaginative game of Savage with Deshaun Watson gone for the season (knee).LA ranks third in yards and tops in points per game (32.9).Its 263 points are already more in half a season than in all of 2016 (224).QB Jared Goff comes off career highs in yards passing (311) and touchdowns (four) in a rout of the Giants.This is only the third time these franchises have met, with the Rams up 2-1.New York Jets (4-5) at Tampa Bay (2-6) Journeyman QB Ryan Fitzpatrick had one very good season and one horrendous year with the Jets.He'll start against his former team Fitz also has played for the Rams, Bengals, Bills, Titans and Texans and face New York's current journeyman QB, Josh McCown.McCown is having a strong season as the entrenched starter, though, and leads the AFC in completion rate at 70.4 percent.Fitz goes for Jameis Winston, who will miss a start for the first time after 40 games as a pro.Incidentally, McCown has Fitzpatrick beat for number of NFL teams.McCown has played for Arizona, Detroit, Oakland, Carolina, Chicago, Tampa Bay and Cleveland.Green Bay (4-4) at Chicago (3-5) While Minnesota appears ready to march off with the NFC North, these also-rans continue the NFL's longest rivalry.Will Packers coach Mike McCarthy loosen the reins a bit on Brett Hundley, who looked befuddled and frustrated last week standing in for the injured Aaron Rodgers (collarbone)?Maybe Hundley can be comfortable at Soldier Field, where the Packers have won seven in a row.Give Chicago credit for playing hard as the roster is rebuilt.Like Hundley, second overall draft pick Mitchell Trubisky has been shackled in the passing game by his coaches; the Bears have the NFL's lowest-ranked aerial offense.Cleveland (0-8) at Detroit (4-4) Only four franchises have never made a Super Bowl, and these are two of them; the others are Jacksonville and Houston.Not much to recommend here, although the Lions looked solid last week against undermanned Green Bay.Now, they get under-talented Cleveland in a lopsided series the Lions lead 18-5.New York Giants (1-7) at San Francisco (0-8) Oh, for the days of Joe Montana vs. Lawrence Taylor, Big Blue against the 49ers Dynasty.This is the first time since 1984 these teams have played this late in the season with only one combined win.Enough said.AP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and http://twitter.com/APNFL
Chiefs DT Miller arrested in Florida on battery charge:::::Kansas City Chiefs defensive tackle Roy Miller was arrested early Saturday in Florida on a domestic battery charge, according to Duval County jail records.Miller was jailed shortly before 5 a.m. by the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office.The incident involved a minor injury, but no other details were available about the alleged battery.Local news outlets reported that Miller was released on his own recognizance after an initial court appearance Saturday.Another hearing was set for Nov. 28.The Chiefs, who are off this week, said in statement to The Associated Press that they were aware of the incident and gathering facts.They declined any further comment.The 30-year-old Miller, who was drafted out of Texas by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, spent the past four seasons with the Jacksonville Jaguars.Miller signed a $1.4 million deal with Kansas City this past offseason but has only appeared in seven games with two tackles.The AFC West-leading Chiefs (6-3) visit the New York Giants on Nov. 18.For more NFL coverage: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/APNFL
Irving has facial fracture; Horford probable for next game:::::Celtics point guard Kyrie Irving has a broken bone in his face and is doubtful for their next game.The team called the fracture minor.Irving left Friday night's game against the Charlotte Hornets in the first quarter after taking an inadvertent elbow to the face from teammate Aron Baynes.Irving was bleeding from the nose as he was escorted to the locker room.Also Saturday, the Celtics said Al Horford probably would be able to return for Sunday's game against the Toronto Raptors.The Celtics have won 11 straight games, beating the Hornets on Friday night despite playing most of the game without Horford, Irving and Gordon Hayward.
Japanese star Otani announces desire to move to MLB:::::Highly touted Japanese pitcher-outfielder Shohei Otani announced on Saturday he wants to move to Major League Baseball next season."The other day I met with team officials and stated my intentions," Otani said at a press conference."My request was met with warm words of support so I hope to do my best in America from next year on."Otani's Japanese club, the Nippon Ham Fighters, said on Friday they will allow Otani to use the posting system this offseason, clearing the way for him to sign with a major league team next season.Otani, 23, is the reigning Pacific League MVP and was 3-2 with a 3.20 ERA this year.Despite thigh and ankle injuries, he batted .332 in 65 games with 16 doubles, eight homers and 31 RBIs.He had ankle surgery last month.He has a 42-15 record with a 2.52 ERA and 624 strikeouts in 543 innings over five seasons, and a .286 batting average with 48 homers and 166 RBIs.Because Otani has less than nine years of service time, Nippon Ham retains his rights and he must go through the posting system to leave.If MLB, the MLB Players Association and Nippon Professional Baseball agree to a deal that would extend the expired posting agreement through this offseason, the team that Otani signs with would pay the Fighters $20 million.Under MLB's labor contract, his signing bonus is restricted and remaining pool money is limited to a high of $3,535,000.Under baseball's new collective bargaining agreement, the 23-year-old Otani can only agree to a minor league contract that is subject to signing bonus pools.If added to a big league roster, he would have a salary for about the minimum $545,000 next season and not be eligible for salary arbitration until 2020 at the earliest.If he was to wait until he is 25 to enter MLB, there would be no restrictions and he likely would get a better deal.But Otani said he wanted to go now rather than wait."I am not yet a complete player yet, and I want to go to an environment where I can continue to get better," said Otani."I felt the same way when I graduated from high school.And it is my strongest reason for wanting to go now."Otani considered going straight to MLB out of high school but was convinced to sign with the Fighters as they assured him he could play the outfield as well as pitch.His injury problems this season stemmed from last year's Japan Series when he injured himself running the bases.Otani, who had ankle surgery last month and is currently undergoing rehabilitation, just completed his fifth season with the Sapporo-based Fighters.He said during Saturday's press conference that he hopes to be able to continue both batting and pitching."Just before I turned professional, I didn't imagine I would be able to do both," Otani said."But since then, the fans have encouraged it, the coaches helped me, and manager (Hideki) Kuriyama made it possible.That has left me with a strong desire, to keep doing it, not only for me, but for them.""I don't know if it will be possible, but I want to hear what teams over there say and what kind of situations might be available.Until that process has started, I can't say how it might work out."(Associated Press Writer Yuri Kageyama contributed to this report from Tokyo)
Hope Solo says Blatter grabbed her; he calls it 'ridiculous':::::Hope Solo says former FIFA President Sepp Blatter grabbed her rear shortly before the two were to appear on stage at a prestigious soccer ceremony four years ago.A representative for Blatter called the allegation "ridiculous."In an interview published Friday in the Portuguese newspaper Expresso, the former goalkeeper for the U.S. women's national team recounted what happened at the Ballon d'Or awards in 2013 in Zurich.A representative for Solo confirmed to The Associated Press on Friday that the report was accurate and said the player had no further comment.Blatter spokesman Thomas Renggli messaged the AP on Saturday: "This allegation is ridiculous."The remarks by Solo come amid a torrent of accusations by women of sexual harassment and abuse in the entertainment and media industries.Solo anchored the U.S. team in goal during its 2015 Women's World Cup championship run, allowing just three goals in seven games with five shutouts during the tournament.For her career, Solo has made 202 total appearances with the national team, with 153 wins and an international-record 102 shutouts.Solo's time with the national team ended following last year's Olympics in Brazil, where the Americans were ousted by Sweden in the quarterfinals.Afterward, Solo called the Swedish team "cowards" for its defensive play.She was suspended from the team shortly thereafter and has not returned.She was dogged throughout her career with controversies, including a 2014 domestic violence case involving a family member's home in Washington state.Blatter was suspended as head of soccer's governing body for six years following allegations of widespread corruption in a scandal that came to light in 2015.U.S. and Swiss officials cooperated in the investigation, which is ongoing, and more than 40 people have been indicted.Blatter has had a history of what many consider to be sexist behavior concerning the women's game.U.S. forward Alex Morgan has said that Blatter failed to recognize her at the annual awards event in 2012, even though she was one of three nominees for the women's Player of the Year.Blatter also famously argued in 2004 that players could boost the popularity of the women's game by wearing tighter shorts.
