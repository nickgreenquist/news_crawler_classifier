LONDON/STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Private trades in Spotify shares are valuing the music streaming company at about $16 billion, according to people familiar with the deals, raising the prospect of a bumper flotation next year.
That is around $3 billion higher than in similar trades up until June, the people said, adding strong demand for the shares and rising subscription numbers at the Swedish business meant it could be worth at least $20 billion when it goes public.
Spotify declined to comment.
The market for shares prior to their public listing allows employees and founders of big name private companies such as Spotify, Airbnb and Uber to cash in on some of their paper wealth, while letting other investors get a head start on the listing.
Early investors tired of waiting for a payout are selling shares too.
While this secondary market was hit by Facebooks chaotic listing in 2012, it has recently made a comeback.
A $13 billion price tag would value Spotify, the worlds biggest music streaming company with more than 140 million active users, at around four times its 2016 sales.
But investors and sector bankers not involved with the company said Netflixs valuation of seven times expected 2017 sales was a more appropriate benchmark, supporting speculation of a price tag of at least $20 billion around listing.
Spotify is aiming to file its intention to float with U.S. regulators towards the end of this year in order to list in the first or second quarter next year, one of the sources said.
MARKET LEADER

An investor survey led by technology investment and advisory firm GP Bullhound, which owns shares in Spotify, estimated the companys valuation could reach $50 billion in a few years.
The investors and venture capitalists polled pointed to Spotifys position as the undisputed market leader in music streaming, and to rapid growth in its paying users from 5 million in 2012 to over 60 million today.
While its net losses doubled last year to $600 million, a more than 50 percent increase in revenues to $3.4 billion has raised hopes it is on the right track to make money.
A bumper equity valuation would give Spotify a currency to help meet the challenge from rivals such as Apple Music and Amazon Music, and potentially fund an expansion into adjacent businesses, such as video, or geographies it has yet to reach.
That could be vital, as Spotify does not have the large, profitable devices and retail businesses that its rivals can respectively draw on for support.
A high market valuation would also bolster Spotifys position in licensing negotiations with major music labels on which its business model depends.
The trade-off, though, is that it piles the pressure on management to deliver results, and raises the specter of Twitter and Snap - two once white-hot internet players that have disappointed investors as public companies.
Snap has lost nearly a quarter of its value since its flotation in March.
Its hard to speculate on Spotifys valuation since we only have historic results prior to the most recent renegotiation with the music majors, said Louis Citroen, an analyst at Arete Research.
But a $20 billion valuation sounds punchy as it implies both that Spotify can continue growing customers at a fast pace, and that it might achieve a double-digit margin.
We can believe in the customer growth, but are less sure about profitability given high royalty costs and limited differentiation with rivals on content, price or technology.
PAVING THE WAY

Spotify is pursuing a so-called direct listing on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), allowing existing investors to sell shares without raising money from new ones, sources have previously told Reuters.
The move is also aimed at saving hundreds of millions of underwriting fees from investment banks.
A successful listing could pave the way for others, with France-based rival Deezer saying it could consider going public if Spotify is well received.
Vivendis Universal Music Group, the worlds largest recording label, is also considering a listing.
Worldwide, music streaming revenue leapt 60.4 percent in 2016, lifting recorded music sales for the second consecutive year after 15 years of decline during which revenue dropped by nearly 40 percent, according to data compiled by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry.
LONDON (Reuters) - Uber told a British employment appeal tribunal on Wednesday its drivers were self-employed, not workers entitled to a range of benefits, less than a week after it heard it would lose its London license.
The U.S. ride-hailing service has faced regulatory and legal setbacks around the world amid opposition from traditional taxi services and concern among some regulators.
It has been forced to quit several countries, such as Denmark and Hungary.
Losing its license in London, one of the worlds wealthiest cities, is one of the U.S. technology firms biggest setbacks so far.
The London regulator cited the firms approach to reporting serious criminal offences and background checks on drivers.
It can operate during its appeal, which could last months.
Last year, two drivers successfully argued at a tribunal that Uber exerted significant control over them to provide an on-demand taxi service and had responsibilities in terms of workers rights.
At the two-day appeal hearing starting on Wednesday, Uber said its drivers were self-employed and worked the same way as those at long-established local taxi firms.
The self-employed are entitled to only basic protections such as health and safety, but workers receive benefits such as the minimum wage, paid holidays and rest breaks.
This would add to Ubers costs and bureaucracy across Britain.
The position of drivers who use the App is materially identical to the (familiar and long-established) position of self-employed private hire drivers who operate under the auspices of traditional minicab firms, Uber said in its court submission.
Minicabs, or private hire vehicles, sprung up in Britain more than 50 years ago.
Minicabs cannot be hailed in the street like traditional taxis, but can be booked for specific times and places via a registered office with a call or via the internet.

PROTEST MARCH

Ubers lawyer Dinah Rose said she would not discuss the firms loss of license except to say: Its quite apparent from that decision that Uber is right to point out to this tribunal the regulatory constraints under which it operates.
Around 200 trade union-led protesters marched through central London on Wednesday against what they called precarious labor in the gig economy, where people work for various employers at the same time without fixed contracts.

All Uber want to do is flood the market with drivers, with no responsibility nor liability - keep reducing fares to attract more customers, while drivers carry all the risks, Yaseen Aslam, one of the two drivers involved in the tribunal claim, told the protest.
Some, however, opposed the decision by Londons regulator to strip Uber of its license, saying the firm should be allowed to operate but must grant workers rights.
In a bid to strengthen itself in Britain, Uber said on Wednesday it was seeking to appoint a UK chairman, in a newly created non-executive role which it began recruiting for around six weeks ago.
In a further challenge for Uber, law firm Leigh Day said it would represent a female driver who says Uber is putting her and other women at risk as drivers do not know the passengers destination until they get in the car, and that could mean traveling to a remote or unsafe area.
An Uber spokesman said drivers could cancel trips without penalty and did not have to go to a particular area if they did not want to.
He said many women worked for Uber due to its safety features.
One of the main reasons why women choose to drive with Uber is because of the safety features in the app.
All trips are GPS tracked and a driver is able to share a live map of their trip with a friend or loved one, he said.

THE HAGUE (Reuters) - Ransomware eclipsed most other forms of cybercrime as on-line crime surged in 2017, European policing agency Europol said on Wednesday, citing high-profile attacks such as WannaCry that reached millions of computers.
Europol coordinated several successful cross-border operations against cybercriminals last year.
But national authorities urgently need to devote more resources to targeting the developers of hacking tools, the agencys head said.
The last year has been exceptional, given the size and the type and the range of the attacks that weve seen, Europol director Rob Wainwright said, detailing an annual review of Internet crime threats.
Growing sophistication in the cybercrime community, where criminal groups band together to deliver cybercrime services, is becoming the major engine of growth in online crime undertaken for illegal profit, he said.
Ransomware has eclipsed most other cyber-threats.
..indiscriminately affecting victims across multiple industries in both the public and private sectors, the report said.
The 80-page report also named data breaches, darknet markets, extortion of youth for child pornography and payment fraud as growing threat areas.
Wainwright said Europol is setting up a special unit to fight darkmarket operations, where credit card information is increasingly being sold in addition to drugs, impacting the retail, airline and hotel industries.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday criticized Facebook Inc (FB.O) as anti-Trump and questioned its role during the 2016 presidential campaign, amid ongoing probes into alleged Russian interference in the election and possible collusion by Trumps associates.
Facebook was always anti-Trump.
The networks were always anti-Trump, Trump said on Twitter, leveling the same charge against the New York Times and the Washington Post.
Collusion?

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - In a rare public feud between large technology companies, Amazon.com Inc said on Tuesday its Echo Show devices could no longer play videos from YouTube because the sites parent, Google, stopped supporting the service.
The spat is the latest in Silicon Valley in which competitive tensions stood in the way of customers.
Amazon and Google square off in many areas, from cloud computing and online search, to selling voice-controlled gadgets like the Echo Show.
In a statement, Amazon said, As of this afternoon, Google has chosen to no longer make YouTube available on Echo Show, without explanation and without notification to customers.
There is no technical reason for that decision, which is disappointing and hurts both of our customers.
Google, owned by Alphabet Inc, said instead that the development was no surprise.
Weve been in negotiations with Amazon for a long time, working towards an agreement that provides great experiences for customers on both platforms, it said in a statement.
Amazons implementation of YouTube on the Echo Show violates our terms of service, creating a broken user experience.
We hope to be able to reach an agreement and resolve these issues soon.
The Echo Show had displayed YouTube videos without integral features, from video recommendations to channel subscriptions.
Google has been in a similar dispute with Microsoft Corp in the past.
It was not clear how many customers were affected.
Amazon only started selling the Echo Show in June, which comes with a touchscreen and responds by voice command.
Amazons suite of Echo devices, including the Echo and Echo Dot, have outsold the voice-controlled Google Home, according to research firm eMarketer.
Amazon has ambitions to make it normal for people to control computers by voice - and to place orders for its online retail business by voice, too.
Its a bit of a blow to Amazon, said analyst Jan Dawson of Jackdaw Research.
YouTube is one of the big video services that they had in addition to their own.
For that to disappear means a big chunk of the possible video content you could watch on Echo Show is now gone.
The Verge, a technology news website, earlier reported the news.
Among recent tech standoffs, Amazon had stopped selling Apple Incs TV players in 2015 because they did not support its Prime Video service.
The two finally reached an agreement earlier this year.
Things get harder for end users because these companies cant get along, Dawson said.
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The days of Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) limiting messages to 140 characters, a signature of the social network since its launch in 2006, may be numbered.
Twitter said on Tuesday that it would begin a test with a random sample of users allowing them to send tweets that are as long as 280 characters, double the existing cap, in most languages around the world.
The San Francisco-based company has stood by its short messages as a defining characteristic - like chirps from a bird, which is the company logo - even as users found ways around the limit, such as posting photos of text.
In a blog post on Tuesday, Twitter said its emphasis on brevity would never change but that it had been wondering whether people could express themselves easily enough, hurting the services popularity.
Trying to cram your thoughts into a Tweet - weve all been there, and its a pain, Twitter project manager Aliza Rosen and senior software engineer Ikuhiro Ihara said in the post.
The employees acknowledged some users may have an emotional attachment to the current limit.
FILE PHOTO: People holding mobile phones are silhouetted against a backdrop projected with the Twitter logo in this illustration picture taken September 27, 2013.

News reports in January 2016 said that Twitter was running internal tests for longer tweets and considering a limit as high as 10,000 characters.
Though Twitter is ubiquitous in media because of frequent use by U.S. President Donald Trump and many celebrities, the company has struggled financially.
For the second quarter, it reported a loss of $116 million and zero growth in the number of users, at 328 million people.
Facebook Inc (FB.O) has 2 billion users.

A higher character limit was inspired by how people use Twitter when writing in Chinese, Japanese and Korean, the company said.
Characters in those languages can often express more than Roman characters can, meaning those users already, in effect, have a higher limit.
They also use Twitter more often.
In all markets, when people dont have to cram their thoughts into 140 characters and actually have some to spare, we see more people Tweeting, the two employees wrote.
The test of 280 characters will run for an unspecified number of weeks in all languages except Chinese, Japanese and Korean, Twitter said.
The company declined to say how many people would be included in the test.
The 140-character limit originated from the use of SMS text messages.
Twitters founders, including Chief Executive Jack Dorsey, wanted a limit just below the SMS cap of 160 characters.
DETROIT (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co (F.N) said on Wednesday it will collaborate with Lyft to deploy Ford self-driving vehicles on the ride-services companys network in large numbers by 2021.
Ford and Lyft teams will begin working together to design software to allow Ford vehicles to communicate with Lyfts smartphone apps.
Ford self-driving test vehicles will be connected to Lyfts network, but at first, customers will not be able to use them, Sherif Marakby, Fords vice president for autonomous vehicles and electrification, told Reuters.
Ford will put human-driven vehicles on Lyfts network.
He did not say when Ford and Lyft expect to offer the first rides in self-driving cars.
Were not building prototypes for the sake of building prototypes, Marakby said, adding Ford intends to ultimately put thousands of self-driving vehicles in use.
Fords new Chief Executive Jim Hackett is scheduled to meet with investors on Tuesday to outline the Dearborn, Mich. automakers strategy for boosting profitability.
Ford shares are down 1.65 percent so far this year, while Detroit rival General Motors Cos (GM.N) shares have risen 15.6 percent, and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCHA.MI) shares are up 71 percent.

Hacketts plans to compete for revenue from mobility services, which include car sharing and ride hailing, will be one area of focus for investors.
The Lyft partnership fills in a piece of the puzzle.
Ford also is testing delivery services using self-driving vehicles and a van shuttle service.
The self-driving vehicles Ford will deploy through Lyft will use software developed by Argo AI, a company in which Ford is investing $1 billion over the next five years.
The company has said it will invest $700 million in a factory in Flat Rock, Michigan, to make it capable of building electric and self-driving vehicles.
Lyft has said it will offer an open platform for companies to deploy self-driving vehicles on its network, and has partnerships with self-driving vehicle technology startup Drive.ai and Alphabet Incs (GOOGL.O) Waymo self-driving car unit.
GM has a 9 percent stake in Lyft, acquired for $500 million in January 2016.
Our relationship with GM has always been a non-exclusive relationship, Raj Kapoor, Lyfts chief strategy officer, told Reuters.
GM is also assembling the assets necessary to launch its own ride services using self-driving cars, building its Maven car-sharing unit and preparing to launch mass production of autonomous Chevrolet Bolt electric cars at a factory in suburban Detroit.
This does not affect our existing business relationship with Lyft, GM said in a statement on Fords announcement.
GMs plan remains steadfast - we are on track to launch our self-driving technology first in a ride-sharing application.

ZURICH (Reuters) - UBS (UBSG.S), the worlds largest wealth manager, is convinced its new online private bank needs to get bigger.
Now it needs to work out how.
The Swiss bank began piloting SmartWealth last year in Britain as a platform to rival start-ups such as WealthFront in the United States and British venture Nutmeg.
Juerg Zeltner, the head of UBSs wealth management division, told Reuters on Wednesday he was very happy with the offering but that scale was crucial for the model to be a success.
This is a big learning ... the real question is how do you scale it to more?
Zeltner said.
Digital wealth managers are dwarfed by established banks like UBS, which manages more than $2 trillion in client assets.
But their lower-cost model of building an investment portfolio based on a clients risk appetite is seen as a possible threat to private bankings traditional advisory model.
RISK APPETITE

UBS SmartWealth targets clients whose wealth starts in the tens of thousands of dollars, whereas the assets of traditional private banking clients can stretch to more than $1 billion.
So far UBS, which has not said where it will roll the product out next, has seen a lag before clients start using the platform to make investments, Zeltner said.
One avenue for UBS to scale up SmartWealth is the banks One Wealth Management Platform, on which Zeltner expects more than 85 percent of its assets will be by the end of the year.
These are part of efforts to improve performance at its main wealth management division, which was the source of almost half the banks pre-tax income last year but has been hampered by negative interest rates in Switzerland and the euro zone.
Negative interest rates have proved particularly difficult with clients keeping larger cash positions in the aftermath of the 2007-09 financial crisis.
One way to cope with negative interest rates is to take advantage of the cheap money on offer with more lending, although Zeltner said UBS has no plans to do so.
Weve defined our risk appetite, Zeltner said.
I know how much earnings Im willing to put at risk and that limits my exposure to how much lending Im going to do.
Credit Suisse (CSGN.S), which competes directly with UBS in wealth management, has taken a different approach and is more active in areas such as ship financing.

SEOUL/TOKYO (Reuters) - South Koreas SK Hynix Inc (000660.KS) said on Wednesday its board had approved its participation in a Bain Capital-led consortium that plans to purchase Toshiba Corps (6502.T) memory chip unit for 2 trillion yen ($17.7 billion).
SK Hynix said in a statement it will invest 395 billion yen, part of which will be in convertible bonds that could allow it to take an equity stake of up to 15 percent in the future.
Toshibas board agreed last week to sell the unit, the worlds second biggest producer of NAND chips, to the Bain group although a formal signing has been delayed, with sources saying they did not expect it to be signed on Wednesday.
While talks relating to consortium member Apple Incs (AAPL.O) demands on chip supply have now been settled, the group still has to work out one snag that relates to financing in the event that legal risks materialize, one source with direct knowledge of the deal said.
A Toshiba spokesman said the firm was aiming for a signed deal as soon as possible.
Bain and Apple did not immediately reply to requests for comment.
Sources declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter.
The Bain-led consortium will hold 49.9 percent of the voting rights in the chip unit, while Toshiba will hold 40.2 percent and Japans Hoya Corp (7741.T), a medical technology firm that also makes parts for chip devices, will own 9.9 percent, the SK Hynix statement said.
Consortium members Apple, Dell Inc [DI.UL], Seagate Technology Plc (STX.O) and Kingston Technology, will invest in the form of non-convertible preferred shares, it said.
Pressure from the Japanese government, changing alliances among suitors and a slew of revised bids has drawn out the auction over nine months - heightening the risk that the deal may not close before the end of Japans financial year in March as regulatory reviews usually take at least six months.
If the deal does not close before then, Toshiba - hurt by liabilities at now bankrupt nuclear unit Westinghouse - is likely to end a second consecutive year in negative net worth, putting pressure on the Tokyo Stock Exchange to strip it of its listing status.
The sale also faces legal challenges from Western Digital (WDC.O), Toshibas chip venture partner and rejected suitor, which is seeking an injunction to block any deal that does not have its consent.
Western Digital, one of worlds leading makers of hard disk drives, paid some $16 billion last year to acquire SanDisk, Toshibas chip joint venture partner since 2000.
It sees chips as a key pillar of growth and is desperate to keep the business out of the hands of rival chipmakers.
Toshiba has said the sale would improve its shareholders equity by 740 billion yen.

ATHENS (Reuters) - Greeces central bank dismissed claims by hacking group Anonymous that it had accessed confidential internal files, saying on Wednesday the material was already in the public domain.
Anonymous responded by warning that it was merely testing out the banks defenses and could step up its attack.
Anonymous Greece had posted a link on its Facebook page on Tuesday, claiming it was leaking central bank data and warned that more would follow in the coming days.
A link the collective supplied didnt appear to immediately work.
The Bank of Greece said the alleged leak only contained information widely available on its website.
The claims that Bank of Greece data bases were hacked and leaked are totally unfounded, the central bank said.
Anonymous, which previously attacked the central bank in May last year when it disrupted service on its website, said its campaign was not over.
The Bank of Greece was a test, not exactly an attack.
It was a warning, The worst is yet to come, Anonymous said.
Be afraid of us because you never know when your entire system will collapse.
Then we will see what you have to say.
The central bank played down the threat.
The alleged revelations of 1,217 files, which contain administrative decisions, presentations from conferences and other data, is nothing other than information available to the public through the banks website, the Bank of Greece said.
Anonymous originated in 2003, adopting the Guy Fawkes mask stylized by the V for Vendetta movie as their symbol for online hacking.

(CNN) Japan is building the world's fastest supercomputer, which it hopes will make the country the new global hub for artificial intelligence research.
The supercomputer is expected to run at a speed of 130 petaflops, meaning it is able to perform a mind-boggling 130 quadrillion calculations per second (that's 130 million billion).
Once complete (the target date is April 2018), the AI Bridging Cloud Infrastructure (ABCI) will be the most powerful supercomputer in the world, surpassing the current champion, China's Sunway TaihuLight, currently operating at 93 petaflops.
What makes a computer 'super'?
While the ABCI will not have a mouse or screen, it's not vastly different from a personal computer -- just souped-up, a whole lot faster, and much, much bigger.
"The current supercomputer system is one million times faster than your personal computers," explains Satoshi Sekiguchi, a director general at Japan's National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology.
Sekiguchi calculates that it would take 3,000 years for a personal computer to achieve what a supercomputer can do in just one day.
In terms of size, Japan's supercomputer will be comparable to a parking lot with space for 30 to 40 cars.
"The supercomputer that is currently under development would take up about 1,000 square meters of floor space," says Sekiguchi.
What will it be used for?
The ABCI could help Japanese companies develop and improve driverless cars, robotics and medical diagnostics, explains Sekiguchi.
"A supercomputer is an extremely important tool for accelerating the advancement in such fields," he says.
Its supersonic speed will also help Japan develop advances in artificial intelligence technologies, such as "deep learning."
But supercomputers are to thank for smaller everyday inventions too.
"The initial design of paper diapers was actually done using a supercomputer," explains Sekiguchi.
"However, mothers continue to use them without knowing that fact."

Race to the top?
Japan's K computer, which runs at just over 10 petaflops, claimed the title of world's fastest supercomputer for six months in 2011, before it was outperformed by the United States and China.

But for Sekiguchi, it is not about the race to build the fastest supercomputer.
"Before, there was a competition in the computer industry itself, however, from now on, it is going to be more about what you can do with the computers," he said.
"It is no longer about which computer becomes the best in the world, but rather, creating an environment in which these new applications can be used properly."

Story highlights Japanese scientists are developing a system to capture and remove space debris

They plan to use magnets to catch and force debris down to burn up in Earth's atmosphere

This feature is part of Vision Japan, a series about the visionaries who are changing Japan, and the places that inspire this innovation.

(CNN) Japan's Space Sweepers are taking it upon themselves to do a little spring cleaning in space.
One hundred and seventy million pieces of space debris currently orbit the Earth, according to estimates from the European Space Agency (ESA).
Defunct satellites and other man-made objects rocket around the atmosphere at eight kilometers per second -- 10 times faster than a bullet.
Some chunks are as big as a truck, others smaller than a dime.
But even the tiniest piece of cosmic junk poses an enormous threat to other satellites and spacecraft.
A collision with a one centimeter speck of space debris at orbital velocity, for example, has the equivalent energy force of an exploding hand grenade, according to Heiner Klinkrad, head of the space debris office at the ESA.
When an accident like this occurs, fragments scatter around space, increasing the risk of further accidents.

Twitter is experimenting with raising the limit on tweets from 140 characters to 280 characters.
The company wrote in a blog post on Tuesday it was rolling out 280-character limit tweets to "a small group" of users who tweet in languages that may make it difficult to include everything they want to say.
"We understand since many of you have been Tweeting for years, there may be an emotional attachment to 140 characters  we felt it, too," Twitter product manager Aliza Rosen wrote.
"But we tried this, saw the power of what it will do, and fell in love with this new, still brief, constraint."

How to Protect Yourself From Hackers

Hackers breached the filing system of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and may have accessed "nonpublic information" for profit, the agency said in a statement late Wednesday.
The SEC, which regulates the financial securities industry, gave few details on the hack but said the hackers may have made "illicit gain through trading," NBC News reported.
It is not believed that any personally identifiable information or SEC operations were compromised, the agency added.
The hack was first detected in 2016, but the SEC didn't realize until last month that the hackers may have benefited from the data accessed.

FILE - A Kaspersky employee shuffles tokens around a table-top display at the company's stand at a cybersecurity conference in Lille, northern France, Jan. 25, 2017.
Federal agencies have been ordered to stop using software made by Kaspersky Lab because of concerns about the companys ties to Russian intelligence.
The Department of Homeland Security said Wednesday that the "risk that the Russian government, whether acting on its own or in collaboration with Kaspersky, could capitalize on access provided by Kaspersky products to compromise federal information and information systems directly implicates U.S. national security."
The move came after mounting concerns about Kaspersky, which is the subject of an ongoing FBI counterintelligence investigation.
FBI agents in June paid visits to at least a dozen employees at home, asking questions about that company's operations as part of the inquiry, multiple sources familiar with the matter told NBC News.
A Kaspersky spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Advanced hackers have successfully broken into core operations systems after targeting energy companies in the United States and Europe, according to new report from a cybersecurity firm.
Reuters reported that Symantec researchers found malicious email campaigns helped a group, apparently one called Dragonfly, gain entry into U.S. energy firms, as well as in Turkey and Switzerland and likely elsewhere.
The researchers believe the cyberattacks are probably the work of a foreign government, and while their report didn't name Russia, some code strings were in Russian.
The research adds to concerns that utilities and other industrial firms could be susceptible to damaging cyberattacks in a global conflict.
In June, the U.S. government alerted firms about a hacking campaign targeting the nuclear and energy sectors.

Warning: Details in this story may be disturbing for some users

A suburban Chicago dad has issued a now-viral warning to parents after he made a disturbing discovery on a popular app being used by his 7-year-old daughter.
Brad Summer, of Batavia, said he and his wife allowed their daughter to use the app Musical.ly on their phones while under supervision by an adult.
She used this app to connect with her cousins and make goofy duets of songs together, he wrote on Facebook.
But what he said was a fun, family-friendly game, quickly made him furious.
Summer said someone pretending to be 9 years old had messaged his daughter via the app and his daughter alerted him to the disturbing exchange.
First I want to say how proud of our daughter I am and want this to be a warning to your families, he wrote.
In screenshots posted by Summer, the messages show someone identified only as Jessy asking the young girl how old she is.
The person then asks the girl to send a photo of herself.
When the girl sends a selfie, the person says looking nice and send me your pics without t-shirt.
I like to see your body without t-shirt, one message read.
The girl tells the person she cant, but they continue to press for photos, saying dont tell to anyone and its secret between us only.
Then, the young girls father chimes in.
I am her father and I am a police officer, the message reads.
We have documented your ip address and location.
I recommend that you refrain from any other contact.
Summer said he called police and handed the phone over so they could pull information in hopes of tracking the person down.
He said he knows some might criticize his parenting but said we never thought like predators and I guess we were nave in thinking our daughter safe on what we thought to be a kid friendly app.
We live and learn and I continue to do so everyday as a parent, he wrote.
This post is meant as a warning call to others that let their children use this app.
This post wasn't meant for people telling me how to raise my child.
My child came and told me and it didn't get any further luckily.
She followed what I taught her.
I'm sure that others families aren't so lucky.
The world we live in needs focus on these types of things, say what you will.
Summers post has been shared more than 80,000 times and liked more than 18,000 times.
Musical.ly did not respond to NBC Chicagos request for comment, but the apps rules prohibit anyone under the age of 13 from using it.
The apps website also provides resources for parents on internet safety and cyberbullying and details how to change message settings so only approved followers can message an account.
If youd like to make sure that only approved followers can send messages via direct.ly, we recommend enabling the only friends can direct.ly me on the settings page, the website reads.
With these private settings enabled, only approved followers can view your teens videos and send them messages.
Summer said since his posting, hes received support from parents across the world.
This story has spread through almost every continent and the replies have been overwhelmingly touching, he wrote.
From those who comment, to those of you who send me a PM, I read each and every one.
I have been given advice, other sites to look out for and most appreciated, the encouragement to keep fighting.

He's also recommending President Donald Trump create three new monuments in Montana, Kentucky and Mississippi.
Here's some background on the sites Zinke says merit protection under the Antiquities Act of 1906:



BADGER-TWO MEDICINE

The area spans approximately 203 square miles (526 square kilometers) within the Lewis and Clark National Forest in northwest Montana.
Badger-Two Medicine is the site of the creation story of the Blackfoot tribes of the U.S. and Canada.
It's bordered by the Blackfeet Indian Reservation, Glacier National Park and the Bob Marshall Wilderness.
For more than two decades, a Louisiana-based oil and gas company, Solenex, has sought to drill for oil and gas on a federal lease it holds within the proposed monument.
MEDGAR EVERS' HOME

Evers, who lived in Jackson, Mississippi, was the first field secretary for the NAACP and organized boycotts over segregation statewide during the civil rights movement.
He was killed by a gunshot to the back on June 12, 1963, as he returned home from a meeting with NAACP lawyers.
A local Ku Klux Klan member, Byron De La Beckwith, was arrested for Evers' murder, but juries twice deadlocked on the case.
Beckwith remained free until new evidence three decades later helped lead to his conviction in 1994.
Evers' home was designated as a National Historic Landmark in February.
CAMP NELSON

On about 6 square miles (16 square kilometers) near Nicholasville, Kentucky, Camp Nelson was established in 1863 as a 700-bed Union Army hospital, supply depot and recruiting center for African-American troops in the state.
A cemetery, known today as Camp Nelson National Cemetery, was later built to take the many wounded soldiers who died in the camp's unsanitary conditions.
The Army also built a refugee camp for family members of freed slaves who trained at Camp Nelson.
As many as 8,000 troops garrisoned the camp at any one time.
After the war, much of the land returned to farming and almost all its 300 buildings were sold for lumber, leaving only the refugee camp and the cemetery, according to the National Park Service.
Climate researchers are warning that Europeans should prepare for the return of "Lucifer," saying the hellishly named heat wave that hit parts of the continent this summer could become a regular occurrence due to man-made climate change.
Hotter-than-usual temperatures in the Mediterranean region resulted in higher hospital admissions, numerous forest fires and widespread economic losses between June and August.
Peak heat struck Italy and the Balkans for three days in early August, when temperatures remained above 30 degrees Celsius (86 Fahrenheit) even at night.
"We found clear evidence of human influence on this summer's record warmth  both in the overall summer temperatures and in the heat wave dubbed Lucifer," said Geert Jan van Oldenborgh, a senior researcher at the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute.
Van Oldenborgh is part of the World Weather Attribution team that published a study Wednesday , concluding that greenhouse gas emissions linked to human activity have increased the chances of such heat waves four-to-tenfold compared to the early 1900s.
The team's use of actual temperature measurements and computer simulations is widely accepted among scientists as a means of determining whether climate change plays a role in extreme events.
"The analysis applies state of the art techniques that have withstood rigorous peer-review in many previous studies," said Maarten van Aalst, director of the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Center.
The World Weather Attribution team said its study indicates that summers like in 2017 could become the norm in the Euro-Mediterranean region by 2050 if greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise.
Van Aalst, whose center provides research to national Red Cross or Red Crescent agencies around the world, said the new study should be a wake-up call to policymakers about the need to prepare for hotter summers.
While the average person in developed countries might enjoy a few days of strong sunshine  especially if they can cool off at the beach  elderly people, infants and those who are chronically ill will suffer, he said.
"Climate change is already having a significant impact on the risks we face today, and we should do what we can to keep that risk from rising out of control."
A rumbling, belching volcano that's threatening to blow had forced more than 7,000 people to flee their homes by Wednesday on an island in the Pacific nation of Vanuatu.
Authorities have declared an emergency on Ambae island, where activity at the Manaro volcano has increased recently, raising fears of a major eruption.
About 10,000 people live on the island, and villagers close to the volcano have been moved to schools and community halls on the island's less vulnerable eastern and western regions.
For those displaced villagers, it's now a waiting game to see whether the volcano erupts or returns to normal activity that's not a threat to them.
Shadrack Welegtabit, the director of Vanuatu's National Disaster Management Office, said a ship had arrived Wednesday carrying food, water and other essential supplies.
He said a second ship was due to arrive Friday.
New Zealand's military flew over the volcano on Tuesday, and said they noticed huge columns of smoke, ash and volcanic rocks billowing from the crater.
Group Captain Nick Olney said they had already planned the aerial survey in an Orion aircraft before the recent activity, but were happy to help provide Vanuatu authorities with images and information.
He said the military "always stands ready to support our Pacific neighbors, especially in times like this."
Vanuatu's Meteorology and Geohazards Department said in an alert that villagers within 6.5 kilometers (4 miles) of the volcano face the biggest risk from airborne rocks and volcanic gas.
The department warned that acid rain could damage crops across a broader area.
Vanuatu is about one-quarter of the way from Australia to Hawaii.
It's made up of 80 islands, about 65 of which are inhabited, and is home to around 280,000 people.
The nation is considered one of the world's most prone to natural disasters, with a half-dozen active volcanoes as well as regular cyclones and earthquakes.
It sits on the Pacific's "Ring of Fire," the arc of seismic faults around the Pacific Ocean where earthquakes and volcanoes are common.
In a quest to end cookie-cutter health care, U.S. researchers are getting ready to recruit more than 1 million people for an unprecedented study to learn how our genes, environments and lifestyles interact  and to finally customize ways to prevent and treat disease.
Why does one sibling get sick but not another?
Why does a drug cure one patient but only cause nasty side effects in the next?
Finding out is a tall order.
Today, diseases typically are treated based on what worked best in short studies of a few hundred or thousand patients.
"We depend on the average, the one-size-fits-all approach because it's the best we've got," said Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health.
That's changing: The NIH's massive "All Of Us" project will push what's called precision medicine, using traits that make us unique in learning to forecast health and treat disease.
Partly it's genetics.
What genes do you harbor that raise your risk of, say, heart disease or Type 2 diabetes or various cancers?
But other factors affect that genetic risk: what you eat, how you sleep, if you grew up in smog or fresh air, if you sit at a desk all day or bike around town, if your blood pressure is fine at a check-up but soars on the job, what medications you take.
Not to mention differences based on age, gender, race and ethnicity, and socioeconomics.
Layering all that information in what's expected to be the largest database of its kind could help scientists spot patterns, combinations of factors that drive or prevent certain diseases  and eventually, researchers hope, lead to better care.
"The DNA is almost the easiest part," Collins said.
"It's challenging to figure out how to put all that together to allow somebody to have a more precise sense of future risk of illness and what they might do about it."
Pilot testing is under way, with more than 2,500 people who already have enrolled and given blood samples.
More than 50 sites around the country  large medical centers, community health centers and other providers like the San Diego Blood Bank and, soon, select Walgreens pharmacies  are enrolling patients or customers in this invitation-only pilot phase.
If the pilot goes well, NIH plans to open the study next spring to just about any U.S. adult who's interested, with sign-up as easy as going online .
It's a commitment.
The study aims to run for at least 10 years.
The goal is to enroll a highly diverse population, people from all walks of life  specifically recruiting minorities who have been under-represented in scientific research.
And unusual for observational research, volunteers will get receive results of their genetic and other tests, information they can share with their own doctors.
"Anything to get more information I can pass on to my children, I'm all for it," said Erricka Hager, 29, as she signed up last month at the University of Pittsburgh, the project's first pilot site.
A usually healthy mother of two, she hopes the study can reveal why she experienced high blood pressure and gestational diabetes during pregnancy.
Heading the giant All Of Us project is a former Intel Corp. executive who brings a special passion: How to widen access to the precision medicine that saved his life.
In college, Eric Dishman developed a form of kidney cancer so rare that doctors had no idea how to treat him, and predicted he had months to live.
Only two studies of that particular cancer had ever been done, on people in their 70s and 80s.
"They didn't know anything about me because they'd never seen a 19-year-old with this disease," said Dishman.
Yet he survived for two decades, trying one treatment after another.
Then, as he was running out of options, a chance encounter with a genetics researcher led to mapping Dishman's DNA  and the stunning discovery that his kidney cancer was genetically more like pancreatic cancer.
A pancreatic cancer drug attacked his tumors so he could get a kidney transplant.
"I'm healthier now at 49 than I was at 19," said Dishman.
"I was lucky twice over really," to be offered an uncommon kind of testing and that it found something treatable.
Precision medicine is used most widely in cancer, as more drugs are developed that target tumors with specific molecular characteristics.
Beyond cancer, one of the University of Pittsburgh's hospitals tests every patient receiving a heart stent  looking for a genetic variant that tells if they'll respond well to a particular blood thinner or will need an alternative.
The aim is to expand precision medicine.
"Why me?"
is the question cancer patients always ask  why they got sick and not someone else with similar health risks, said Dr. Mounzer Agha, an oncologist at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center.
"Unfortunately I don't have answers for them today," said Agha, who says it will take the million-person study to finally get some answers.
"It's going to help them understand what are the factors that led to their disease, and it's going to help us understand how to treat it better."
And NIH's Collins expects surprises.
Maybe, he speculates, Type 2 diabetes will turn out to be a collection of genetic subtypes that require varied treatments.
"This looks at individual responses to treatment in a way we couldn't do previously with smaller studies."
The study starts simply: Volunteers get some standard health checks  weight, blood pressure and heart rate.
They answer periodic questionnaires about their health, background and habits, and turn over electronic health records.
They give a blood sample that, if they agree, will undergo DNA testing sometime next year.
Eventually, researchers will ask some participants to wear sensors that may go beyond today's Fitbit-style health trackers, such as devices that measure blood pressure while people move around all day, or measure environmental exposures, Collins said.
In Pittsburgh, the Rev.
Paul Abernathy made a health change after signing up for the pilot study: Surprised to learn his BMI was too high despite regular weightlifting, he began running.
"I'm praying I have the discipline to continue that, certainly in midst of a busy schedule," said Abernathy, who directs the nonprofit Focus Pittsburgh that aids the poor and trauma victims.
"We have a chance really to influence history, to influence the future of our children and our children's children," added Abernathy, who hopes the study will help explain racial disparities such as lower life expectancies between African-Americans and whites who live in the same areas.
At NIH, Collins plans to enroll, too.
He's had his DNA mapped before but can't pass up what he's calling a one-in-a-million experience to be part of a monumental study rather than the scientist on the other side.
"I'm curious about what this might teach me about myself.
I'm pretty healthy right now.
I'd like to stay that way."

A company that wants to build and operate a large terminal to export coal from the western U.S. to Asia was denied a key permit by Washington state on Tuesday because of environmental concerns.
The Department of Ecology rejected a water quality permit that Millennium Bulk Terminals sought because the proposed facility near the city of Longview would have caused "significant and unavoidable harm" to the environment.
The department cited effects to air quality, noise pollution and tribal resources, among others.
"There are simply too many unavoidable and negative environmental effects for the project to move forward," Ecology Director Maia Bellon said in a statement.
Millennium Bulk Terminals has long hoped to build a facility along the Columbia River to handle up to 44 million tons of coal a year.
Trains would carry the coal from Montana, Wyoming and other states, which would be loaded onto ships headed to Asia.
William Chapman, the president and CEO of Millennium, said the company will appeal the decision and expects "a fairer and more consistent interpretation of the law."
"Multiple recent decisions by the agency seem biased against the Longview community, and particularly blind to the need for employment opportunities in Cowlitz County," he said in a written statement.
Environmentalists, tribes and others have fiercely opposed the project  which could increase U.S. exports of coal by 40 percent  because of concerns about global warming, coal dust pollution and potential damage to fisheries on the river.
Several of those groups lauded Tuesday's decision.
"The state did the right thing today, standing up for clean water, public health and the Pacific Northwest's iconic endangered salmon runs," Power Past Coal co-director Jasmine Zimmer-Stucky said in a statement.
Businesses, some labor groups and other supporters say the project would create jobs, add tax revenue and boost the local economy.
The governor of Wyoming, the nation's leading coal-producing state, previously traveled to the Pacific Northwest to pitch the importance of coal exports to the governors of Washington and Oregon.
Kris Johnson, president of the Association of Washington Business, criticized the process that led to the decision, saying that the project has faced "unprecedented regulatory hurdles."
"We need companies to invest in manufacturing, construction and infrastructure to support trade," he wrote in a prepared statement.
"Instead of turning away investment, our leaders should be encouraging responsible growth."
Montana's attorney general said he plans to review the decision to make sure the law has been followed.
Wyoming Gov.
Matt Mead said that despite Washington's decision, "Wyoming will continue to work towards a plan that allows for the safe transportation of coal through coastal ports."
An environmental review released in April by Washington's ecology department and Cowlitz County analyzed potential harm to fish habitat, wetlands, water quality, local communities and more.
Of 23 environmental areas, 19 would face harmful effects, and some could not be offset or reduced, officials said at the time.
The review found that coal dust pollution from trains would not be major because emissions levels would be below state and federal standards, but pollution from locomotives would raise the cancer risk for one low-income neighborhood.
Residents also would see more noise and traffic delays at rail crossings without a quiet zone or other measures, the study said.
At full capacity, the project would add 16 more trains through the area and increase the number of ships by 1,680 a year.
Jay Inslee said he was confident that state ecology officials "based their decision on sound science and in accordance with the law."
"It's absolutely critical that all projects  particularly of this scale  undergo an objective and extensive review that ensures they are able to meet the standards necessary for protecting our land, air and water," he said in an emailed statement.

Twitter announced today that it is testing out increasing its character limit from 140 to 280.
"Cant fit your Tweet into 140 characters?"
the company tweeted Tuesday afternoon.
"Were trying something new with a small group, and increasing the character limit to 280!"
Cant fit your Tweet into 140 characters?
Were trying something new with a small group, and increasing the character limit to 280!
Excited about the possibilities?
Read our blog to find out how it all adds up.
?https://t.co/C6hjsB9nbL  Twitter (@Twitter) September 26, 2017

In a longer blog post, Twitter said it was experimenting with the move "in languages impacted by cramming," which is nearly all of them, save for Japanese, Chinese and Korean.
"Were hoping fewer tweets run into the character limit, which should make it easier for everyone to tweet," the company wrote.
Twitter noted that it understands its users may have "an emotional attachment to 140 characters," adding "we felt it, too."
"But we tried this, saw the power of what it will do, and fell in love with this new, still brief, constraint," the company said.
"We are excited to share this today, and we will keep you posted about what we see and what comes next."
Twitter cited President Donald Trump's "newsworthiness" and the public interest as reasons why it declined to remove a tweet that added to the fiery rhetoric between the United States and North Korea.
Trump tweeted Saturday : "Just heard Foreign Minister of North Korea speak at U.N.
If he echoes thoughts of Little Rocket Man, they won't be around much longer!"
On Monday, North Korea's top diplomat called the tweet a declaration of war.
White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders responded by calling the suggestion of such a declaration "absurd."
Twitter's rules state users "may not make threats of violence or promote violence, including threatening or promoting terrorism."
This includes direct as well as indirect threats.
The company responded to questions about why Trump's tweet wasn't removed Monday by posting in a series of messages on its public policy account that "newsworthiness" is one of the factors it considers in determining if a tweet breaks the platform's rules.
"This has long been internal policy and we'll soon update our public-facing rules to reflect it," one message read.
"We need to do better on this, and will."
The company also stated it is "committed to transparency and keeping people informed about what's happening in the world."
Calls for Twitter to curtail Trump's use of the platform are not new .
The company has said in the past that it doesn't comment on individual accounts, but it has cited the importance of hearing from leaders in order to hold people accountable.
Trump's account wasn't affected in July, when Twitter announced that it was taking action, including suspensions, on 10 times the number of abusive accounts than it did a year before.
Keeping the president on the service also makes business sense: Trump's tweets are constantly in headlines, calling attention to Twitter and, ideally for the company, getting more users to sign up.
In its latest attempt to wrest control of the Internet, Russia's communications agency on Tuesday threatened to block access to Facebook if the company refuses to store its data locally.
Alexander Zharov, chief of the Federal Communications Agency, told Russian news agencies on Tuesday that they will work to "make Facebook comply with the law" on personal data, which obliges foreign companies to store it in Russia.
Critics have slammed the law, which went into effect in 2015, for potentially exposing the data to Russian intelligence agencies.
Zharov said that the Russian government understands Facebook is a "unique service" but said it will not make exceptions and will have to block it next year if Facebook does not comply.
Last year, Russia blocked business-focused social network LinkedIn after a court ruled it violated the law on data storage.
LinkedIn is available in Russia only if accessed via proxy servers.
In the most recent step to crack down on Internet freedom, Russia's parliament in July outlawed the use of virtual private networks, or VPNs, and other Internet proxy services, citing concerns about the spread of extremist materials.
Russians use VPNs to access blocked content such as LinkedIn by routing connections through servers outside the country.
The law obliging companies to store personal data about Russian citizens in Russia has been applied selectively since it came into force two years ago.
It has been widely viewed as the Kremlin's attempt to expand control over the Internet.
Russian Internet freedom activists have urged international tech companies to reject the government's calls to give them access to personal data, saying that this would undermine cybersecurity for millions of Russian users.
Leonid Levin, chair of the parliamentary committee on communications and information policy, in comments carried by the Interfax news agency on Tuesday expressed hope that "it would not come to" blocking Facebook and that Russian authorities would be able to negotiate with the U.S. company.
Japan's government approved a revised road map Tuesday to clean up the radioactive mess left at the Fukushima nuclear power plant after it was damaged beyond repair by an earthquake and tsunami in 2011.
Decommissioning the damaged reactors is an uncertain process that is expected to take 30 to 40 years.
A look at some of the challenges:



THE FUEL RODS

The three reactors that had meltdowns together have 1,573 units of mostly used nuclear fuel rods that are still inside and must be kept cool in pools of water.
They are considered among the highest risks in the event of another major earthquake that could trigger fuel rods to melt and release massive radiation due to loss of water from sloshing or structural damage because the pools are uncovered.
The plant operator, Tokyo Electric Power Co., or TEPCO, plans to begin moving the rods from reactor Unit 3 in the fiscal year beginning April 1.
However, the latest road map delays removal of the rods from units 1 and 2 for three years until fiscal 2023, because further decontamination work and additional safety measures are needed.
Ironically, because the building housing reactor 3 was more heavily damaged, it is easier to remove that unit's fuel rods.
The fuel rods will be moved to a storage pool outside the reactors, and eventually sent for long-term storage in what are known as dry casks.
THE MELTED FUEL

By far the hardest part of decommissioning Fukushima will be removing the fuel that melted and presumably spilled out of the reactor cores.
In July, an underwater robot for the first time captured images inside the primary containment chamber of Unit 3.
They showed a large number of solidified lava-like rocks and lumps on the chamber's floor, believed to be melted fuel mixed with melted and mangled equipment and parts of the structure.
The search for melted fuel in units 1 and 2 has so far been unsuccessful.
The water level is lower, so crawling robots have been tried, but they have been obstructed by debris as well as extremely high radiation levels.
Despite the unknowns about the melted fuel and debris and their whereabouts, the road map calls for finalizing the removal method in 2019, and starting actual removal at one of the reactors in 2021.
The government-funded International Research Institute for Nuclear Decommissioning is developing robots and other technology to carry out the work.
CONTAMINATED WATER

TEPCO has treated and stored a massive amount of radioactive water  about 800,000 tons  and the volume is growing every day.
Cooling water leaks out of the damaged reactors and mixes with groundwater that seeps into the basements of the reactor building, increasing the amount of contaminated water.
The utility has managed to halve the volume to 200 tons per day by pumping up groundwater via dozens of wells dug upstream from the reactors, as well as installing a costly "ice wall" by freezing the ground to block some of the water from coming in and going out.
The water is stored in hundreds of tanks that cover much of the plant property.
They get in the way of decommissioning work and pose another risk if they were to spill out their contents in another major earthquake or tsunami.
After treatment, the water still contains radioactive tritium, which cannot be removed but is not considered harmful in small amounts.
Experts say controlled release of the water into the ocean is the only realistic option, but TEPCO has not moved forward with that plan because of opposition from fishermen and residents who fear a negative image and possible health impact.
RADIOACTIVE WASTE

Japan has yet to develop a plan to dispose of the highly radioactive waste that will come out of the Fukushima reactors.
Under the road map, the government and TEPCO will compile a basic plan during fiscal 2018.
Managing the waste will require new technologies to compact it and reduce its toxicity.
Finding a storage site for the waste seems virtually impossible, as the government has not been able to find a site even for the normal radioactive waste from its nuclear power plants.
The prospect raises doubts about whether the cleanup can really be completed within 40 years.

In past skirmishes with local regulators, Uber's playbook under co-founder and now-ousted CEO Travis Kalanick was simple: fight.
Now, as brand-new CEO Dara Khosrowshahi deals with a stunning rebuke from London, the playbook gets another page: fight, but offer some diplomatic humility.
On Friday, just hours after Greater London's transport authorities decided not to renew Uber's operating license, citing a lack of corporate responsibility, Uber wound up for its first punch.
Almost reflexively, it followed the familiar tactic of recruiting its mass rider base for help, starting an online petition drive to pressure regulators that now has more than 770,000 signatures.
It also promised appeals and defiantly accused regulators of caving in to Taxi interests.
Then, Khosrowshahi took to Twitter.
"Dear London: We r far from perfect," he wrote.
"Pls work w/us to make things right."
It remains to be seen which strategy will work best, and Uber also runs the risk of antagonizing London officials by sending the mixed messages.
But deviating from Kalanick's approach is exactly the right tactic for Khosrowshahi, says Jan Dawson, chief analyst for Jackdaw Research in California.
Conciliation, he says, likely will require concessions, but also will bring peace in a huge market with 40,000 drivers and 3.5 million riders  over 5 percent of Uber's ridership base of 65 million globally.
"The fact that Uber is so mature and broadly used in London means it's very unlikely that it will be permanently banned there  the political fallout would just be too great," Dawson said.
As Uber grew at lightning speed during the past seven years, it often entered U.S. cities without permits.
When taxicabs complained, Uber defiantly kept hauling people.
Usually Kalanick's tactics prevailed.
"We're totally legal, like totally legal, and the government is telling us to shut down," he said in a 2014 Vanity Fair article.
"And you can either do what they say or you can fight for what you believe."
He called the strategy "principled confrontation."
It worked in Chicago as recently as last year, where Alderman Anthony Beale, who fought unsuccessfully to more tightly regulate Uber, said the company used Uber riders and political connections to win  at least so far  a fight over fingerprint background checks of drivers.
"You're talking about an 800-pound gorilla," says Beale.
"This company needs to be regulated.
They need to be regulated heavily because they're out of control."
On Monday, Khosrowshahi, who was hired away last month from travel booking giant Expedia, apologized publicly for mistakes of the past.
Uber "got things wrong" during its global expansion and is willing to change to stay in business in London, he said in an open letter published by the Evening Standard newspaper.
"We will look to be long-term partners with the cities we serve; and we will run our business with humility, integrity and passion."
Mayor Sadiq Khan welcomed the apology and was pleased to see the company acknowledge issues.
Transport for London, the regulatory body, said last week it wouldn't renew Uber's license when it expires Sept. 30.
Uber can continue operating while it pursues an appeal.
"Even though there is a legal process in place, I have asked TfL to make themselves available to meet with him," Khan said of Khosrowshahi.
The row leaves an opening for Lyft, Uber's much-smaller rival that has designs on growing outside of the U.S. Lyft has talked with TfL, but the company won't comment on expansion plans.
Uber has struggled with a series of scandals this year, ranging from accusations of sexism to suggestions that it used software to hide information from regulators.
Transport for London said it wouldn't renew Uber's license because the company isn't "fit and proper" to operate in the city.
Uber didn't report serious criminal offenses, including a sexual assault, to London police, authorities said, and failed to conduct proper driver background checks.
The regulator also cited Uber's use of a phony app to deceive regulators in the U.S.
Some Uber supporters say the critique is a smokescreen for a politically motivated decision to appease London taxi drivers, not protect public safety.
Uber has long been a target of cab drivers who complain that its drivers don't have to comply with the same licensing standards, giving the ride-hailing service an advantage.
Abs Dawodu, a London resident, said that forcing Uber off the streets of London would remove a lower-cost alternative to traditional black cabs.
"I can get an Uber for an hour, and if there is two of us, it's 20 pounds, whereas if it's a black cab and you go across London it's going to be a lot more than that," he said.
John Colley, a professor at the Warwick Business School, points out that Londoners have other options to black cabs, including pre-booked car services such as Addison Lee.
He doubts Uber will be able to demonstrate that it has changed its ways because Kalanick remains on the board and has a large ownership stake.
"In the short term, expect plenty of PR, but the prospects of the culture changing while Kalanick is still there are slim," he said.
Krisher reported from Detroit.
The Latest on SEC Chairman Jay Clayton's appearance before the Senate Banking Committee (all times local):

11:50

The chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission refused to comment Tuesday when asked if executives at Equifax engaged in insider trading when they sold shares after the company learned of a massive data breach but before it disclosed the hack to the public.
Jay Clayton told Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., that he couldn't comment on an issue that might come before the agency.
Three Equifax executives sold shares worth a combined $1.8 million days after the company discovered the breach.
Equifax says the executive were unaware of the breach prior to the stock sales.
Kennedy and other senators on a senate banking panel also questioned Clayton about the SEC's own data breach, which the agency disclosed last week.
Clayton said he became aware of the breach in August, months after becoming chairman, but couldn't say when the hack occurred or when an investigation into the breach would be completed.
His comments led one senator to wonder how the SEC could hold companies accountable when the agency itself isn't forthcoming about cybersecurity problems.
11:40 a.m.

U.S. senators from both parties grilled Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Jay Clayton Tuesday on the agency's handling of a 2016 data breach that Clayton disclosed only last week.
The hack focused on the agency's system for handling corporations' public documents, known as EDGAR.
"I was disturbed to learn that the SEC suffered a cyber-breach of its EDGAR system in 2016, but did not notify the public, or even all of its Commissioners, until it was discovered during your recent review," Senate Banking Committee Chairman Mike Crapo, Republican from Idaho, said.
Clayton said the hack "concerns me deeply" and said that he has ordered an investigation by the agency's Inspector General.
Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, acknowledged that the breach occurred before Clayton took office in May.
But he criticized the SEC chairman for not revealing it more quickly.
"The disclosure, or lack thereof, is all yours," Brown said.
"How can you expect companies to do the right thing when your agency has not?"
10:45 a.m.

Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Jay Clayton says that senior executives at Equifax should be forced to return recent bonuses if the company's delay in disclosing a data breach is found to be improper.
Sen. Sherrod Brown, Democrat from Ohio, slammed Equifax for a six-week delay in disclosing the massive security breach, which exposed personal information for 143 million Americans.
Several executives sold Equifax shares during that six-week period.
Clayton said the bonuses should be recovered if the delay is found to be improper.
The company argued that revealing the information wasn't "material" to investors.
9:35 a.m.

Jay Clayton, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, is likely to face tough questions from a Senate banking panel, after the agency acknowledged that it also was a victim to a hack.
Two major issues in the SEC breach are the potential any information obtained was used for insider trading and whether the SEC knew about the security breach for months and only recently decided to disclose it.
Clayton has been at the head of the SEC since May, and is not likely to face calls for his removal since the breach happened a year ago.
But he may be questioned about whether the SEC  the federal government's main arm for enforcing rules and regulations on Wall Street  is up to the task of keeping data secure.
This story has been corrected to show that the number of Americans affected by the security breach at Equifax was 143 million, not 134 million.

Transcript for Facebook to turn over Russian-linked political ads to Congress

New developments in the Russia investigation.
Facebook is admitting Russia agents bought thousands of ads during the election.
Now, the social media giant says it will turn over those ads to congress.
Our chief investigative correspondent Brian Ross is here with that story.
Good morning.
Reporter: Good morning.
For months Facebook had been stonewalling congress on turning those over but now caved with Mark Zuckerberg finally acknowledging the scope of the issue and saying his company will provide copies with Russian ads.
I don't want anyone to use our tools to undermine democracy.
That's not what we stand for.
Reporter: Russian companies spent more than $100,000 on Facebook ads during the campaign.
Many of them praising Donald Trump or attacking Hillary Clinton and others dealing with controversial issues.
But Facebook has refused to let congress keep copies of even the few ads they showed them.
They showed the senate staff seven of those ads and they didn't allow us to even keep them and that was just with stats -- Took them back?
Took them back.
Reporter: Millions saw those ads and Clinton said Facebook has to own up to the problem.
I don't think anybody can with a straight face say that the Russians did not set out to influence our election and they did so.
This latest revelation about the way they bought ads on Facebook and targeted them, we're going to find out a lot more.
Reporter: Zuckerberg did not say Facebook would prohibit the Russians from buying political ads again but he said the company will at least make it clear who paid for them.
We can do better.
Reporter: It was not just ads.
Investigators say they have also found huge numbers of fake Facebook pages linked to the Russians.
Like this one discovered by "The New York Times" supposedly an anti-clinton father in Pennsylvania but he didn't ex-he is.
The picture was actually of someone in Brazil.
Now even with the new concession senator Warner says the time may have come for Facebook and other social media sites to face restrictions about who can buy political ads and what must be disclosed.
Zuckerberg called senator Warner with his change of heart.

Transcript for Apple CEO talks Dreamers, augmented reality

back now with apple's CEO Tim cook.
Here for his first interview since the launch of the highly anticipated and revolutionary new iPhones 8 and X with facial recognition and cutting-edge augmented reality technology.
Something you can have in your hands and use for the first time today.
It's going to be downloaded today in all these phones you have here and Tim says it could change our lives and so wonderful to have you here live with us, Tim cook, ladies and gentlemen.
Thank you, thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you for the live demo yesterday and earlier this morning ginger and some kids had a great time with ar.
They were playing with various games and people want to know, augmented reality.
It's different.
It's new.
That's on apple right now, in fact, it's going to be downloaded later today.
Tell us why it's a big deal.
This is huge because it's the first time that hundreds of millions of customers actually later today hundreds of millions of customers will be able to use ar for the first time.
So we're bringing it to mainstream.
If you have an iPhone 6s or later you have augmented reality today.
We've made it really simple for developers to design apps with their passion and bring it to everybody.
Explain what it is, ar.
It's taking the virtual world and overlaying it to physical world.
And so you saw a Democrat Poe earlier to position chairs in a living room.
We're seeing that right now.
It's a fantastic way to shop.
It's a fantastic way to learn.
You might even want to look at your favorite car and actually go in the car and so you have to do that in a showroom today, you can now do that right from your living room.
It's unbelievable.
Well, it's fun.
Face it as you're talking about we're look at the set and looking at how we just saw it -- see, that's what we're seeing right now and then when we had the demonstration earlier it shows such a difference.
Now we have to admit ar has been around for awhile but apple is putting its stamp on it.
What's making it different.
We're taking the complex and making it simple.
I mean, this is what apple is so fantastic at.
We want everybody to be able to use ar and so we've taken the complexity that developers would normally have to do in their apps and made it simple for them to convert all of their apps to an ar experience.
And the thing that's very different about apple is in one day, we can make ar available for hundreds of millions of people and that will happen in a few hours from now.
Get ready for the download.
You know when it says a download that's what's going to happen on your phone.
This is a day to remember.
This is a day to remember.
This is a profound day.
Let's talk a little about the 8 and 10.
The two new phones and wonderful options part of it.
But there's one facial recognition that's getting a lot of attention.
People are saying, wait a minute here.
What is the potential of -- because we're talking about this facial data, millions of people and the potential that it could be misused or hacked.
Should people be concerned about that, Tim?
Not with us.
Because we're about your privacy.
We want to protect your data because we know it's yours, not ours.
And so once you place your face in the phone, it's in the phone.
Apple doesn't have it.
We've encrypted on your device.
You make the decisions about who has it.
Not us.
We're very protective of our customers' data because we believe that privacy is very important in this world, that there are hackers everywhere trying to steal your information.
We want it to be yours.
It is not ours.
That's been the hallmark of apple from the very beginning.
We fought very hard for it.
The headphone jack gone.
Now the home button gone.
I know you said the space is a premium on the phone.
What's next?
Why the home button.
You know, the home button is belogged but we think having an edge-to-edge display such that the whole phone is a display will be loved even more and so we're doing that for all of us.
Well, we have a couple of questions from our viewers but I do want to ask you one question, though, your response to when president trump announced that he was going to change the laws that protect d.r.e.a.m.ers, DACA, you mentioned to your beloved apple employees that there were 250 d.r.e.a.m.ers that you have and you encouraged them and said you were dismayed by that but now that the president seems to be willing to at least compromise with the Democrats are you encouraged by that at all?
I am encouraged about it.
These folk, I think this is really important for everybody to understand, these folks came to the country when they were very young.
Most of them don't even remember coming to the country because they were 1, 2, 3 years old at the time and these kids, if you talk to them, they deeply love this country.
They have great jobs.
They pay taxes.
These guys are our neighbors, they're our co-workers and so we feel it's essential that we not only allow them to stay in our country but we welcome them, that we desire that they be here.
I hope everyone reaches out and meets some of the d.r.e.a.m.ers, because it will really warm your heart in meeting them.
And so I am encouraged that congress will pass a law to make this permanent and we're doing everything we can to advocate for that.
Good we're having this dialogue.
Thank you for discussing that.
Back to the phone and the questions from -- they didn't hold back.
You know that.
You know they never hold back.
One viewer asks, you knew this was coming.
I understand inflation, et cetera, but don't you find the price tag for the iPhone X out of reach for the average American?
Well, it's a value price actually for the technology that you're getting and as it turns out, you know, most people are now paying for phones over long periods of time.
And so very few people will pay the price tag of the phone initiay.
Also most people actually trade in their current phone and so that reduces the price further and some carriers even throw in subsidies and discounts.
And so when we look at it, the phone -- the iPhone in particular has become so essential in our daily lives, people want it to do more and more and more and so we built more and more technology in to be able to do that.
I love how you told me you don't want to sell the most, you want to sell the best.
Apple has never been about selling the most of anything.
We don't -- that is not our objective.
Our objectives are not big revenues.
Our objective is to make the best product that enriches people's lives.
All right.
We want to help people.
I know you do.
Here's another question.
This one says about face I.D.
Can more than -- can more than one person use facial re krechlt on the same phone.
Kids on parents' phone, spouses, for instance?
Oh, that's a good question.
I wouldn't recommend that one.
I wouldn't recommend that.
So just leave it at that.
I'd leave it at that.
I wouldn't recommend that.
Steve jobs, when you had your announcement last week you got really emotional.
His DNA is still so much of apple.
I walked in the theater that day and from the moment I walked in there, I know this may strange to your viewers, but I could feel him there.
His DNA is very much the DNA of apple.
And the way that his philosophy of life is how we run the company.
We don't sit and think about what would Steve do?
But we think about the principles that apple is based on, a values-based company that is making insanely great products that are simple to use for the technology takes the backseat, not the front seat.
The user experience is top for us.
We want users to be happy.
And so this company still runs like that today.
And you can feel him in there.
You can feel him in the products and in everything and I love it that way.
Very grateful and appreciate your passion and creativity.
You and your team.
Get ready for that download.
You guys are going to love it check it out.
Tim cook, thank you very much.
Always a pleasure to see you.

The auto parts maker Delphi plans to split itself into two companies early next year.
The Delphi spinoff, targeted to take place before April, may become more common in the industry as companies separate older businesses from their more advanced technology wings.
Sweden's Autoliv also plans a split, with one company making passive devices like air bags, and the other focusing on electronics that prevent crashes.
One Delphi company, called Aptiv, will focus on electronic safety systems, autonomous cars and the electrical backbone of vehicles.
The other will be named Delphi Technologies and will focus on combustion engine parts, software controls and electric vehicle components.
Delphi Automotive PLC announced the names of the companies at its investor day Wednesday in Boston.
Shareholders will vote on the split Nov. 7.
Climate researchers are warning that Europeans should prepare for the return of "Lucifer," saying the hellishly named heat wave that hit parts of the continent this summer could become a regular occurrence due to man-made climate change.
Hotter-than-usual temperatures in the Mediterranean region resulted in higher hospital admissions, numerous forest fires and widespread economic losses between June and August.
Peak heat struck Italy and the Balkans for three days in early August, when temperatures remained above 30 degrees Celsius (86 Fahrenheit) even at night.
"We found clear evidence of human influence on this summer's record warmth  both in the overall summer temperatures and in the heat wave dubbed Lucifer," said Geert Jan van Oldenborgh, a senior researcher at the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute.
Van Oldenborgh is part of the World Weather Attribution team that published a study Wednesday , concluding that greenhouse gas emissions linked to human activity have increased the chances of such heat waves four-to-tenfold compared to the early 1900s.
The team's use of actual temperature measurements and computer simulations is widely accepted among scientists as a means of determining whether climate change plays a role in extreme events.
"The analysis applies state of the art techniques that have withstood rigorous peer-review in many previous studies," said Maarten van Aalst, director of the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Center.
The World Weather Attribution team said its study indicates that summers like in 2017 could become the norm in the Euro-Mediterranean region by 2050 if greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise.
Van Aalst, whose center provides research to national Red Cross or Red Crescent agencies around the world, said the new study should be a wake-up call to policymakers about the need to prepare for hotter summers.
While the average person in developed countries might enjoy a few days of strong sunshine  especially if they can cool off at the beach  elderly people, infants and those who are chronically ill will suffer, he said.
"Climate change is already having a significant impact on the risks we face today, and we should do what we can to keep that risk from rising out of control."

Twitter has announced it is trialling a new 280-character limit to allow users to "easily express themselves" - but the site's users have been predictably snarky.
The fun started when Twitter chief executive Jack Dorsey took to the social media platform on Tuesday to announce the change.
Skip Twitter post by @jack This is a small change, but a big move for us.
140 was an arbitrary choice based on the 160 character SMS limit.
Proud of how thoughtful the team has been in solving a real problem people have when trying to tweet.
And at the same time maintaining our brevity, speed, and essence!
https://t.co/TuHj51MsTu  jack (@jack) September 26, 2017 Report

Journalist Caitlin Kelly was one of the first to edit his rambling tweet back down to the current 140-character limit.
Others made fun of the current practice of stringing together multiple tweets, which already allows users to express longer ideas.

Gifs and images summed up other users' feelings.
Mr Dorsey seemed unperturbed by the criticism, which he tweeted "comes with the job".
He encouraged users to give the new character limit a chance.

https://t.co/qJrzzIluMw  jack (@jack) September 27, 2017 Report

At the moment, the 280-character limit is just a trial for some members, and the company has not said whether it will roll out the change more widely.
Image copyright BT Image caption BT attracted a high level of complaints despite promising users "faster wi-fi connections" than rivals

BT has continued its run as the UK's most complained about home broadband provider, according to data from the regulator Ofcom.
The company attracted 28 complaints per 100,000 customers for the service across the months of April to June.
That meant BT was ranked worst out of the UK's major six providers for the fifth quarter in a row, despite the figure being lower than for the previous period.
Its pay-TV service also struggled.
BT TV attracted 13 complaints per 100,000 subscribers over the three months.
The service has now had more complaints than its rivals in every Ofcom report since mid-2015.
The industry average figures for the second quarter were:

21 complaints per 100,000 customers for broadband

four complaints per 100,000 customers for pay TV

Ofcom's data represents only complaints consumers have chosen to escalate by referring them to the watchdog - and not those sent to individual firms or separate ombudsmen - so probably underplay the level of discontent.
The body does not publish details about individual cases.
But it said that common grievances against BT had included:

technical faults

billing issues

the way it had handled complaints made to its own staff

"We apologise to customers we've let down," said BT in a statement.
"We care about service and we've invested heavily to make improvements, including hiring 2,200 extra people, which is helping us answer calls more quickly than ever before - over eight out of 10 are now being answered in the UK and Ireland."
Ofcom's consumer policy chief did not refer to BT by name in her summary, but appeared to signal she wanted further action.
"We expect providers, particularly those who have been consistently under-performing, to make service quality and complaints handling their number one priority," said Jane Rumble.
One market-watcher noted that BT's broadband service shared the same infrastructure - provided by its Openreach division - as Sky and EE, which were the two least complained about providers.
"The data we have from speed tests indicates BT isn't giving people a worse experience than others," said Andrew Ferguson from the ThinkBroadband news website.
"That suggests it's not got a broadband problem so much as a customer-service one - including the length of time it leaves people on hold... or worse when people try to call support, it takes them four or five times to get through."
Image copyright Amazon Image caption The Echo Show smart speaker has a screen to display video and images

Amazon and Google have clashed publicly after access to YouTube was pulled from one of the online retailer's devices.
On Tuesday, YouTube stopped working on Amazon's Echo Show, a voice-controlled assistant with a screen that can display information and videos.
Both companies issued statements criticising one another.
Amazon said Google had blocked YouTube on Echo Show "without explanation".
Google said the Echo Show delivered a "broken user experience".
While the Echo Show could play videos from YouTube, it did not provide all of YouTube's functions such as the ability to subscribe to channels or serve up video recommendations.
Google said in a statement: "Amazon's implementation of YouTube on the Echo Show violates our terms of service, creating a broken user experience.
We hope to be able to reach an agreement and resolve these issues soon.
"We've been in negotiations with Amazon for a long time, working towards an agreement that provides great experiences for customers on both platforms."
'Hurts our customers'

However, Amazon said in its statement: "Google has chosen to no longer make YouTube available on Echo Show, without explanation and without notification to customers.
"There is no technical reason for that decision, which is disappointing and hurts both of our customers."
It is not the first time that tech giants have removed rival products from their platforms.
In 2013, Google ordered Microsoft to remove its unofficial home-made YouTube app from the Windows Phone store, despite not providing an official app.
It said Microsoft's app violated its terms of service by letting people download videos and hiding advertisements.
In 2016, Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos said the retail giant had stopped selling the Apple TV video-streaming box, because the two companies had not agreed "acceptable business terms" to include Amazon's Prime Video service on the device.
Both Amazon and Google are currently developing rival voice-controlled smart home speakers, which can act as a gateway to lucrative services.
"Both companies are coming into conflict because they are competing for the same new growth opportunities - in this case, around the smart home," said Ian Fogg, an analyst at the IHS Markit consultancy.
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Humans have long harboured a desire to fly, but few have conquered the conundrum

The search is on for a mass market personal flying machine, with a $2m (1.4m) competition to "make the dream of personal flight [a] reality".
Sponsored by Boeing and run by start-up GoFly, the competition will encourage teams from around the world to come up with designs.
Entries must be capable of carrying a person 20 miles without refuelling or recharging, with a vertical or near vertical take-off and landing.
A "fly-off" will take place in 2019.
GoFly founder Gwen Lighter told the BBC: "I was one of those kids who was always making crazy contraptions and throwing themselves out of trees.
"I, like millions of people around the globe, always dreamed of flying, and I began to realise that we were seeing a moment of convergence of technologies and were at a point in history when these personal flight devices become possible."
Image copyright Martin Jetpack Image caption New Zealand's Martin Aircraft has shown off a working prototype

She cited the increased performance of batteries, the control systems being developed for drones and the growth of 3D printing and rapid prototyping as some of the technologies that could help build "a compact, quiet flying device that anyone can use, anywhere".
Boeing chief technology officer Greg Hyslop said: "We're excited to see how the visionaries of the future will take on this ambitious and exciting challenge."
Prizes will be awarded in three stages:

Stage one will include 10 $20,000 prizes based on written technical specifications

Stage two will include four $50,000 prizes awarded to teams with the best prototypes

Stage three will see a fly-off in the autumn of 2019 with a $1m prize for the best overall idea, $250,000 for the quietest entry, $250,000 for the smallest, and $100,000 for the most state-of-the-art design

The winner will maintain control of their own intellectual property, and it will be up to them to commercialise it.
"We see ourselves as the catalyst for kick-starting a future for personal flying devices, but at the end of two years we do not believe you will be able to go into a store and buy one," said Ms Lighter.
All entries must abide by strict safety guidelines, including having a failsafe function so there is no single point of failure, and the regulatory framework of the country where they have been developed.
Image copyright Bret Hartman/Ted Image caption Inventor Richard Browning showed off his Iron Man flying device at the Ted conference in Vancouver

Hobbyists, academics and engineers are all encouraged to submit their ideas before the deadline, 4 April 2018.
Jetpack dreamers

Jetpack technology has advanced, but it still seems a long way from becoming mass market.
New Zealand-based Martin Aircraft had promised its first commercial jetpack in 2016 - but this was delayed and, in August 2107, the company suspended from trading on the Australian stock exchange.
A spokeswoman for the company told the BBC that a loan had now been agreed with major Chinese shareholder KuangChi Science that would enable Martin Aircraft to continue and it was currently testing a jetpack for commercial release.
In April, hobbyist engineer Richard Browning showed off his Iron Man suit - six miniature jet engines and a specially designed exoskeleton - at the Ted (Technology, Entertainment, Design) conference in Vancouver.
Also in April, Silicon Valley start-up Kitty Hawk released a video of its prototype flying machine, which it plans to deliver "this year".
Roger Connor, a specialist at the US National Air and Space Museum said there were many issues that needed to be overcome.
"The challenge has been to find something that can stay in the air for longer than 15 minutes and fly further than 30 miles [48km].
There are also safety and infrastructure issues - it is no use having your personal aircraft if you don't have anywhere to land it."
He envisaged that the final design would be "part aeroplane, part drone and part helicopter".
"There is a convergence of technology - from better batteries in electric vehicles, faster processors and higher performance electric motors that are heralding a new field in aeronautics."
Image copyright Heathcliff O'Malley Image caption Sir James Dyson accused the mainstream car industry of polluting the world with diesel emissions

Dyson, the engineering company best known for its vacuum cleaners and fans, plans to spend 2bn developing a "radical" electric car.
The battery-powered vehicle is due to be launched in 2020.
Dyson says 400 staff have been working on the secret project for the past two years at its headquarters in Malmesbury, Wiltshire.
However, the car does not yet exist, with no prototype built, and a factory site is yet to be chosen.
Sir James declined to give further details of the project.
"Competition for new technology in the automotive industry is fierce and we must do everything we can to keep the specifics of our vehicle confidential," he told staff in an email.
Important points that are undecided or secret include the firm's expected annual production total, the cost of the car, or its range or top speed.
Sir James said about 1bn would be spent on developing the car, with another 1bn on making the battery.
Analysis: Richard Westcott, BBC transport correspondent

It was a slightly unusual launch, but then, Sir James Dyson likes to be different.
In a small room above his swanky London shop he told us about his vision for a clean car.
First up, we were treated to an old clip of Blue Peter, from the 90s, where Anthea Turner interviewed him about his new device to clean soot from the exhaust of diesel vehicles... it was the cyclone from his vacuum cleaner, put to a different use.
"That is how long I have wanted to do this," he told us.
In fact he first hatched the idea in the late 1980s.
Since then, he has developed motors and batteries and now he is able to bring all that expertise together in a new, electric car.
He promised that it will be radical and different, because, as he put it, what is the point of making it like any other car?
And he promised that it will not be cheap.
I did ask how much it would be to put down a deposit... he told me he would have to think about it.
Further development work will take place at a former RAF base at Hullavington in Wiltshire, where staff will move to in February.
Sir James also said that his firm's car would look "radical and different", but will not be aimed at the mass market.
The motor is designed and ready to go, he said, but the firm is still designing the car.
Dyson's decision means it is joining the rush within the global car industry to develop and make electric cars.
Image copyright AFP Image caption Dyson hopes to challenge other electric car manufacturers such as Tesla

Some manufacturers such as Nissan, Tesla, Renault, BMW and Hyundai already manufacture them.
Others such as VW, Volvo, Mercedes, Honda and Jaguar Land Rover have announced plans to sell electric or hybrid versions of their existing petrol and diesel engine ranges.
VW, for instance, plans to spend 20bn euros (17.5bn) by 2030 to develop its battery powered vehicles.
Sir James said he had been interested since 1990 in developing filtration technology to stop vehicle diesel emissions polluting the environment.
But as the motor industry had shown no interest in adopting this idea, he would instead join the fast-growing trend to make electric vehicles.
Analysis: Theo Leggett, BBC business correspondent

The electric car market is growing rapidly, but it is also about to become a lot more crowded.
Within the next few years, many new models are due to come on to the market, including Jaguar's Ipace, Porsche's Mission E, Volkswagen's I.D.
family and Mercedes' EQ range.
Tesla also has big plans for its recently launched Model 3.
They will be joining established models such as the Nissan Leaf, the BMW i3, the Renault Zoe and the Tesla Model S.

Dyson clearly sees an opportunity here.
As new designs become available, and prices come down, more consumers will be willing to try electric vehicles.
Policymakers, concerned about air pollution, want them to do just that.
The big question is whether Dyson can muscle in on territory that the major manufacturers are already trying to make their own.
And let's not forget Google's designs on the electric/self-driving market.
Tesla was able to build a new car brand from scratch, but only by producing a design which effectively moved the goalposts and changed people's expectations of what an electric car could provide.
If Dyson wants to play with the big boys, it may have to pull off a similar trick.

Social media site Twitter is trialling longer character limits to help users "easily express themselves".
Twitter currently limits tweets to 140 characters, but has doubled that to 280 characters for a small group of users.
The current character limit was "a major cause of frustration" for some users, the firm said in a blog post.
The firm has been suffering from slowing growth and the shift could be one way for the firm to widen its appeal and attract new users.
"Trying to cram your thoughts into a Tweet - we've all been there, and it's a pain," Twitter product manager Aliza Rosen wrote.
Ms Rosen said the longer character limit was being tested in all languages bar Japanese, Chinese and Korean which she said could convey more information in a single character.
"We understand since many of you have been Tweeting for years, there may be an emotional attachment to 140 characters - we felt it, too.
"But we tried this, saw the power of what it will do, and fell in love with this new, still brief, constraint," she said.

With constant concerns over hate speech, propaganda bots, and trolling - you might wonder why Twitter is spending its time worrying about doubling the character limit.
Me too, if I'm honest.
But whatever - Jack Dorsey is right to point out that the 140 limit was only ever a technical limitation owing to the limits of text messages, something the service hasn't had to worry about for a long time.
So why not make it a little longer?
It won't be a dramatic change.
Twitter will hope it increases the engagement and attention times of its users.
Marketers will have more characters with which to get their message across, which might make Twitter a bit more cash.
@DaveLeeBBC

Twitter's founder Jack Dorsey was one of the first to try the new limit out, saying it was "a small change, but a big move for us".
Skip Twitter post by @jack This is a small change, but a big move for us.
140 was an arbitrary choice based on the 160 character SMS limit.
Proud of how thoughtful the team has been in solving a real problem people have when trying to tweet.
And at the same time maintaining our brevity, speed, and essence!

But not all users were convinced.
Writer Sarah Kendzior said it was too long.

And The Times journalist Sathnam Sanghera pointed out that US President Donald Trump, famed for his prolific tweeting, could get more characters.
Skip Twitter post by @Sathnam I don't want to wake up in the morning if Donald Trump is one of the people who gets 280 characters as part of this test  Sathnam Sanghera (@Sathnam) September 26, 2017 Report

But Twitter said the change could mean people tweet more frequently.
"When people don't have to cram their thoughts into 140 characters and actually have some to spare, we see more people tweeting," Ms Rosen said.

Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates has revealed he uses an Android-powered smartphone, rather than a Windows one.
"Recently, I actually did switch to an Android phone," he said, speaking on Fox News Sunday.
Microsoft's own Windows-powered phones have failed to make a significant impact on the smartphone market, which is dominated by devices running Google's Android operating system.
However, Mr Gates said he had installed lots of Microsoft apps on his phone.
When asked whether he also had an iPhone, perhaps as a secondary device, he replied: "No, no iPhone."
He did not reveal which particular smartphone he currently uses.

Microsoft struggled to make a success of its own mobile operating system, Windows Phone.
In 2014, the software giant paid $7.2bn (5.5bn) for Nokia's handset business, but Windows-powered phones accounted for fewer than 1% of global smartphone sales in 2016.
Microsoft's latest operating system, Windows 10, can power smartphones in addition to laptops, tablets and desktop computers.
However, few Windows 10 smartphones have been released.
In April, Microsoft started selling a customised version of Samsung's Galaxy 8 smartphone in its US stores.
"Microsoft's strategy under its current chief executive Satya Nadella is to make Microsoft apps and services widely available on Android and iPhone," said Ian Fogg, an analyst at the tech consultancy IHS Markit.
"That's where their customers are these days."
The "Microsoft Edition" phone comes with the firm's apps such as Office, Outlook email and its voice assistant Cortana included.
"It used to be putting the Windows operating system on everyone's phone was a priority, but now it's about selling services such as Office and Outlook email," said Mr Fogg.
"To do that, you have to make those services available on every device."

British Airways has launched an investigation after a staff member posted an offensive rant on the social app Snapchat.
The flight attendant filmed herself before working on a flight to Nigeria.
She mocked Nigerian accents and made lewd remarks about body parts.
A concerned member of staff who saw the video shared it with the Daily Mail.
BA said: "We expect the utmost professionalism from our staff when they are representing British Airways.
"We will not tolerate offensive comments about our customers and will always take the appropriate action."
In the video - captioned "I can't cope with this flight" - the woman can be heard putting on a fake Nigerian accent.
"All the Nigerians are gonna be there like 'gimme Coca Cola, gimme me beef, why you have no beef left?
I want beef'," she says.
Referring in explicit language to the size of Nigerian men's genitals, she then goes on to claim that all the Nigerian passengers will ask for upgrades.
She can also be heard complaining that she has to work on a Friday evening while others are drinking.
Many in Nigeria have used social media to react to the flight attendant's comments.
Alao Abayomi said: "Even if we like free stuff, that does not mean you rub our noses in it.
"The money they make in Nigeria alone, is enough for us to request more than upgrades.
Please let her bosses upgrade her punishment to sack level."
Image copyright EasyJet Image caption An EasyJet picture shows where the engines might be in an electrically powered plane

EasyJet is backing plans to develop commercial passenger aircraft powered by electric batteries instead of conventional aero engines.
The airline wants the proposed planes to fly passengers on its short-haul routes, possibly within 10-20 years.
The prototype is going to be developed by a new US firm called Wright Electric, which has already built a two-seat battery-powered plane.
The new, larger plane would have a range of 335 miles, the companies said.
EasyJet said this meant it would be able to cover popular routes such as London to Paris, Brussels, Amsterdam, Cologne, Glasgow and Edinburgh.
EasyJet's possible involvement was first revealed in March 2017.
Carolyn McCall, the chief executive of EasyJet, said she was now confident that such a plane, possibly carrying 220 passengers, would eventually fly.
"We share an ambition with Wright Electric for a more sustainable aviation industry," she said.
"Just as we have seen with the automotive industry, the aviation industry will be looking to electric technology to reduce our impact on the environment."
Image copyright Reuters Image caption EasyJet wants the proposed planes to fly passengers on its short-haul routes

Wright Electric was only founded last year in the US.
It said EasyJet's support was a "powerful validation" of its plans that would involve developing "new energy storage chemistries" that are lighter than conventional batteries.
The firms argued that if successful, this new technology would lead to a further big cut in the amount of fuel being burned in the air and on the ground, a big cut in emissions, and would also lead to much quieter aircraft.
Wright Electric explained that the new batteries it is hoping to invent would power the propellers or fans of aeroplane engines.
However the motors would be put inside a plane's wings, rather than be slung underneath them.
That, it said, would make the planes more aerodynamic and would cut drag.
The batteries, the firm suggested, would be situated in the main body of the aircraft.
A company spokesman told the BBC that the technology was changing rapidly and that its preferred option was for a combination of lithium ion and aluminium air batteries, which would need to be one and half to two times as powerful as existing versions.

Uber is not part of the so-called "gig economy" and operates a similar business model to local taxi firms, an Employment Appeals Tribunal has heard.
The cab app firm, which is appealing against a ruling that its drivers are entitled to rights such as holiday pay, says its workers are self-employed.
Lawyers for Uber said drivers are under no obligation to use its booking app.
Last year, a tribunal ruled two drivers were Uber employees and entitled to rights including the minimum wage.
As employees, drivers would also be entitled to sick pay and paid holiday.
Uber - which this month lost it licence in London - appealed against the decision, which is being heard at an Employment Appeals Tribunal hearing.
Dinah Rose QC, representing Uber, told the tribunal there was a tendency to "lump" the firm in with the so-called gig economy and for people to assume it was a "wicked" company that exploited workers.
But she said it was wrong to associate Uber with firms that utilise short-term contracts or freelance work, as opposed to permanent jobs.
She said the Uber booking app acted as an agent and was a "very powerful piece of technology", giving drivers access to passengers in return for a cut of the fare.
"Potential drivers or users are under no obligation at all to use it and if they don't use it they don't have to pay Uber anything at all," Ms Rose added.
She argued Uber operates the same "business model" as local taxi firms, but by using technology it did so on a "much larger scale".
No control

Last year, two drivers, James Farrar and Yaseen Aslam, argued that they were employed by the company but did not have basic workers' rights.
They claimed Uber was acting unlawfully by not paying holiday or sick pay.
The tribunal ruled in their favour, saying the idea that Uber's 30,000 drivers were essentially small businesses linked by a common platform was "faintly ridiculous".
Before the appeal hearing, Mr Farrar told the BBC: "Uber tell you that you are your own boss, but in reality I don't control the fare.
"If I take a different route other than the one I've been given I'll be penalised.
I'm performance managed through a ratings system and if I hit 4.4 I'm out of a job. "

"I don't know who the customer is, so I can't ever develop a customer database that I can work with.
"I can't take the booking myself, so there's very little control."
Being self-employed means you are not subject to workplace rules and your rights are governed by the contract not statutory rights.
As a worker, there must be a contract which requires the driver to carry out duties personally and rights and benefits are guaranteed by the company.
The ruling could threaten to significantly increase the operating costs of companies, like private hire and delivery firms, that use people who work on demand or those in the gig economy.
Recent estimates suggest more than a million people are working under such arrangements.
Uber says the tribunal's decision was wrong in law and maintains its drivers are independent contractors.
Fred Jones, from Uber, told the BBC it had appealed against the ruling because 80% of its drivers would rather be self-employed than be classified as a worker.
The company says it has invested in a number of changes, including discounted illness and injury cover, paid waiting time and the ability to cash out fares at any time.
The tribunal hearing is due to last two days, with a judgement reserved to a later date.
Image copyright Reuters Image caption The drone taxi could be up and running within five years

Dubai has conducted its first test of a drone taxi service that it hopes will become a viable transportation system in the city.
The two-seater, 18-rotor unmanned vehicle took off for a five-minute flight above a strip of sand on the Gulf coast.
The flight was watched by Crown Prince Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed.
Dubai has big ambitions for becoming a smart city, with drones and robots central to its plans.
The drone was designed by German firm Volocopter and the firm said it hopes to have the taxis up and running within five years.
"Implementation would see you using your smartphone, having an app, and ordering a Volocopter to the next Voloport near you," said chief executive Florian Reuter.
"The Volocopter would come and autonomously pick you up and take you to your destination."
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption WATCH: Volocopter on manned maiden flight

The drone had previously been tested in Germany in April.
Rival Chinese firm eHang was supposed to be the first to launch a fleet of flying taxis in the city but its plans appear to have been delayed.
Blade Runner?
Dubai has positioned itself to become the smartest city in the world with ambitions to have self-driving vehicles account for a quarter of journeys made by 2030.
Noel Sharkey, a computer scientist and robotics expert at Sheffield University, said of the drone plans: "The big challenge will be dynamic obstacle avoidance of other taxis, buildings, birds and delivery drones.
"The skies over Dubai could become uncomfortably crowded very quickly.
The ground level of the city could become a dark place of intrigue and mystery like Blade Runner."
Image caption The RAC believes thieves are getting better at beating modern security systems

Vehicle thefts have risen by 30% in the last three years following a decade of decline, RAC figures suggest.
Almost 86,000 vehicles were stolen in 2016, up from about 66,000 in 2013, according to the motoring group.
The RAC says thieves are getting better at beating modern security systems by using new technology and that the rise in robberies reverses a downward trend

However, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said that new cars "have never been more secure".
RAC insurance director Mark Godfrey said that before the new figures, there had been a fall in vehicle thefts since around 2002.
"We fear thieves are now becoming more and more well equipped with technology capable of defeating car manufacturers' anti-theft systems," he said.
The RAC obtained the figures from 40 police forces in England and Wales, which revealed that 85,688 vehicles were stolen last year - up 30% from 65,783 in 2013.
'Visible deterrent'

London was the worst place for vehicle theft with nearly a third being taken from the capital, followed by the West Midlands, West Yorkshire and Greater Manchester.
Police in Warwickshire reported the largest percentage rise in stolen vehicles from 2013 to 2016 - up 189%.
Mr Godfrey said the statistics were "bad news" for motorists as the increase causes insurance premiums to rise.
Old fashioned anti-theft devices such as steering-wheel locks were making a comeback because they are a "visible deterrent", he added.
Tamzen Isacsson, director of communications and international at the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, said: "The latest technology has helped bring down theft dramatically and manufacturers invest billions to stay one step ahead of the criminals.
"However, technology can only do so much, and we continue to call for stronger safeguards to prevent the sale of cloning or signal blocking devices that have no legal purpose."
A Home Office spokeswoman said vehicle thefts were at "record low levels", according to the Crime Survey of England and Wales, which is based on people's experiences of crime.
She said: "But we know that the methods used by criminals are constantly evolving and recognise the importance of staying one step ahead.
"That is why the Home Office brought together senior representatives from the vehicle industry and policing to improve our understanding of the nature and extent to which criminals are compromising electronic vehicle security and to develop responses to it."
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Twitter said it would update its rules soon

Twitter has been forced to clarify why it does not believe a tweet from President Donald Trump violated its terms and conditions.
In the tweet in question, President Trump appeared to directly threaten North Korea with destruction.
Many argued that the statement was in breach of Twitter's terms, which forbid violent threats, and should be removed.
Twitter said the tweet remained online because it was "newsworthy".
The tweet at the centre of the row read:

Skip Twitter post by @realDonaldTrump Just heard Foreign Minister of North Korea speak at U.N.
If he echoes thoughts of Little Rocket Man, they won't be around much longer!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 24, 2017 Report

In a series of tweets aimed to deflect the ensuing row among users, Twitter sought to clarify its rules: "Some of you have been asking why we haven't taken down the tweet.
"We hold all accounts to the same rules and consider a number of factors when assessing whether tweets violate our rules.
"Among the considerations is 'newsworthiness' and whether a tweet is of public interest.
This has long been internal policy and we'll soon update our public-facing rules to reflect it."
Current policy states that users "may not make threats of violence or promote violence, including threatening or promoting terrorism".
North Korea's foreign minister has accused President Trump of declaring war on his country via Twitter but Washington has said that such an assertion is "absurd".
Past changes to Twitter's rules include:

2009-10: Twitter places limits on parody accounts, saying it will take down any that a "reasonable person" would mistake as real

2013: The company issues "Targeted Abuse" guidelines in response to a wave of high-profile misogynistic harassment

2015: Twitter bans threatening terrorism and "promot[ing] violence against others on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, age, or disability".
A strike by actors who provide voices, carry out stunts or motion capture in video games has been suspended.
It's been almost a year since they walked out over pay, transparency and working conditions.
A provisional agreement has been reached between the union, SAG-AFTRA, representing actors and the 11 game companies they took action against.
Actors are now free to start working with the companies again.
Starting on October 21, 2016, it's the longest strike in the union's history, affecting the makers of hit games such as Call of Duty and FIFA.
The union says the new contract could mean more money and bonuses for artists and make companies be more transparent with them.
It argued that the 11 companies often employed actors without telling them what game or role they would be in or asked actors to perform stunts without consulting stunt coordinators first.
"Notoriously anti-union"

The gaming industry has grown over the years and is now worth billions of pounds.
Rami Ismail is an award-winning, independent game developer: "The games industry is notoriously anti-union," he says.
But he thinks the requests were largely reasonable.
"As you can imagine, games often require stressful voice acting - many games require hours of yelling and intense acting."
says Rami.
"To limit the vocal damage of such sessions, the voice actors demanded stressful sessions be limited to two hours."
Another reason for the lengthy strike was the reluctance from the games companies to part with extra payments known as residuals.
The union argued unlike film actors, video game actors don't get any bonuses if titles make a lot of money.
But Rami says "there is barely any job in the games industry that pays out residuals - not programmer, not designer, not artist, and many were upset voice actors would get such payments before their role would."
Game delays?
Rami says that the strike probably couldn't have lasted much longer without causing delays to upcoming games.
"While contracts in progress were not affected, a game takes about two to three years to create.
"That means that a year is pretty much the maximum a major strike can run without affecting any current game projects.
It's likely that as new projects went from pre-production to development, the pressure of not having access to talented voice actors increased.
"Pressure for both parties must've bubbled up until we've got this contract."
That pressure looks to have brought the two parties together.
"We have great news," the union told it's members in a statement, "You are free to resume working for the companies that were struck on all titles effective immediately."
The contract will be formally reviewed at a SAG-AFTRA meeting in October.

Image copyright EPA Image caption Equifax's share price has fallen by more than a third since the data breach

US credit report giant Equifax has announced that its chairman and chief executive, Richard Smith, is stepping down with immediate effect.
The move comes as Equifax struggles to rebuild its reputation after it emerged earlier this month that the firm had suffered a massive data breach.
Data on up to 143 million Americans may have been stolen by hackers between mid-May and July.
About 400,000 Britons and a number of Canadians were also affected.
The company said Paulino do Rego Barros, who currently runs the firm's Asia Pacific division, would take over as interim chief executive, while Mark Feidler would serve as non-executive chairman.
Mr Smith said: "At this critical juncture, I believe it is in the best interests of the company to have new leadership to move the company forward."
Equifax said it would undertake a search for a new permanent chief executive, looking at candidates from inside and outside the firm, while Mr Smith had agreed to stay on as an unpaid adviser during the transition.
Chief information officer David Webb and chief security officer Susan Mauldin departed shortly after the firm disclosed the breach.
Equifax faces dozens of legal claims over the breach, which the US Federal Trade Commission is investigating.
Social security numbers, birth dates, addresses and driving licence numbers for up to 143 million Americans were exposed, the Atlanta-based firm has said.
Credit card numbers for about 209,000 Americans and "certain dispute documents with personal identifying information" for some 182,000 Americans were also accessed by the hackers.
Lenders use data amassed by firms like Equifax to assess the credit worthiness of customers seeking to acquire houses, cars and credit cards.
Equifax holds data on more than 820 million consumers as well as information on 91 million businesses.
Senators said the incident shows the need for stronger rules on what companies must disclose about cyber attacks.
They also asked if the Securities and Exchange Commission would take action against executives who sold Equifax stock after the breach was discovered but before the public was informed.
Equifax has said previously the executives in question were not aware of the breach when the sales occurred.
Speaking before a Senate panel on Tuesday, SEC Chair Jay Clayton said it is policy not to confirm or deny investigations, but added: "I'm not ignoring this or other events like it."

The messaging service WhatsApp has been disrupted in China as the government steps up security ahead of a Communist Party meeting next month.
Users have faced problems with the app for more than a week with services dropping in and out.
At times, it has been completely blocked and only accessible via virtual private networks (VPNs) which circumvent China's internet firewall.
WhatsApp is Facebook's only product allowed to operate in mainland China.
Facebook's main social media service and its Instagram image sharing app are not available on the mainland.
Services disrupted

The BBC's China based correspondents said the WhatsApp messaging service started going offline more than a week ago.
A test of its services on Tuesday showed users in China could not send video messages or photographs to people outside China.
The disruption follows restrictions on WhatsApp video chats and photographs in July, which were later lifted.
The tightening of online censorship comes as China steps up security ahead of the Communist Party's national congress which is held every five years.
"The run-up period to a gathering is normally a time of greater restrictions of all kinds to assure that the critical Party Congress is held under ideal social conditions and is not disrupted", Robert Lawrence Kuhn, long-time advisor to China's leaders and multinational corporations told the BBC.
However, he said it is not yet clear whether the restrictions will be relaxed as has happened after previous party congresses, adding that many analysts do not believe they will be.
WhatsApp has declined to comment on the latest clampdown.
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption WeChat is the most popular messaging service in China

Analysis - Stephen McDonell, BBC China correspondent, Beijing

Last week word started spreading around other platforms "Is WhatsApp blocked?"
The replies would come in: "You need to use a VPN".
Then the VPNs were being blocked.
Welcome to online China in the run-up to the Communist Party Congress.
Taking out WhatsApp has no impact on most Chinese people.
They don't use it.
The unrivalled king of cyberspace in this country is WeChat (or, in Chinese, Weixin )

You would really struggle to find somebody here not using WeChat to send messages, share photos, swap locations, flirt, read news and pay for pretty much everything.
This all-encompassing app at the centre of people's lives is available for the Communist Party to spy on the entire population.
WhatsApp is not - at least not to the same extent.
So, during this sensitive time leading up to the once-in-five-years Party Congress, those with responsibility for censoring social media are nervous.
They worry that somebody may use an app beyond their complete control to, for example, organise a protest or post a funny photo of President Xi Jinping and for this to somehow go under their radar.
Tech crackdown

WhatsApp provides end-to-end encryption which ensures only the sender and recipient can view the content of messages.
It also prevents Facebook from knowing what is said in any text, voice and video conversation being communicated on WhatsApp.
"China has shown little tolerance to encryption especially on platforms that can be used to share materials or potential propaganda," Bill Taylor-Mountford, Asia Pacific vice president for LogRhythm told the BBC.
The latest disruption to WhatsApp appears to be part of a broader crackdown on the internet and online content in China.
On Monday, China's cyber watchdog handed down maximum penalties to some of the country's top technology firms including Tencent, Baidu and Weibo for failing to properly censor online content.
The penalties were imposed for failing to remove fake news and pornography, as well as content that authorities said "incites ethic tension" and "threatens social order".

Consumers need to hunt for deals as they do on the High Street when using switching websites for energy, holidays or insurance, a review has found.
Price comparison websites worked best for car insurance and worst for broadband, the study by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said.
Consumers should use a variety of sites to get the best deals, it said.
The CMA said it was investigating one website over contracts that risked raising home insurance prices.
A spokesman for Comparethemarket.com said: "We operate some simple contractual arrangements with home insurers to ensure that our customers always get the lowest available price.
We welcome the opportunity to discuss this further with the CMA."
Andrea Coscelli, CMA chief executive, said it was "vital" that people benefitted from using comparison sites given that most have used one.
"The good news is that more than 90% of the people we surveyed were very or fairly satisfied with the sites they used.
But we have also found that improvements are needed to help people get even better deals."
Tips for using price comparison websites

Image copyright Getty Images

Choose carefully between comparison sites, like you would any retailer

Not all sites are the same, so try more than one if you can

Check how the site has ordered results

Source: CMA

Commission

Price comparison websites offer best buy tables and, increasingly, automated switching services that do not charge a fee to consumers.
Instead, companies often pay a fee of about 30 to a site for each new customer they gain.
The CMA study into what it calls Digital Comparison Tools (DCTs) looked at sites offering price comparisons for car insurance, home insurance, energy, broadband, flights, and credit cards.
Despite a general clean bill of health, the CMA raised concerns including:

Sites risk breaking equality laws by not doing all they can to make tools user-friendly for vulnerable people

The need for more explanation on what is done with personal data

Potential issues with the presentation of excess amounts on insurance deals

One site's contract that limits insurers' ability to offer cheaper deals on other comparison sites - possibly resulting in higher home insurance prices for consumers

The final point has led to the launch of an investigation against one site.
It is against the law for a site to stop businesses offering cheaper deals elsewhere.
Confidence?
The CMA has detailed a template for these sites to ensure they deal with customers fairly.
Last year, the CMA's review of the energy sector found that more than a third of the 7,000 people it asked did not realise switching suppliers of gas and electricity was an option.
Alex Neill, from consumer group Which?, said: "When shopping around via comparison websites or apps, consumers should be confident that they can find the best deal for them and that their personal data will be used responsibly.
All regulators must ensure businesses abide by the rules and customers get good outcomes, or be ready to take action."
Recent proposals from regulators have included a plan from Ofcom to allow mobile phone users to switch operators by sending a text to the provider they want to leave.
Energy regulator Ofgem said it was considering a trial that would allow households to enter only their postcode and current supplier into a "digital deal checker" to view the cheapest tariff, and a clickable option on all price comparison websites to ensure customers saw prices in the whole of the market, not just preferred suppliers.

Corporate finance giant Deloitte suffered a cyber-attack that compromised confidential data, including the private emails of some of its clients, the company has confirmed.
Its system had been accessed via an email platform and "very few" clients had been affected, Deloitte said.
The Guardian reported the attack had been discovered in March but could have happened months earlier.
Deloitte said it had contacted those whose data had been accessed.
It did not confirm exactly how many people had been affected or how much information had been compromised.
Deloitte carries out auditing, consultancy, tax and financial advice services for clients worldwide.
For the year ending on 31 May, it reported revenues of of $38.8bn (29bn).
Email addresses

Prof Alan Woodward, cyber-security expert at Surrey University, told the BBC that private email addresses alone were valuable data for hackers.
"Many people expect their email address to be in the public domain," he said.
"But what most people have done when dealing with confidential matters is they have a second address - and it looks like it is that one that may have been let out here.
"Is it immediately going to be mean people's data will be breached?
Not really - but the secondary, more confidential email addresses mean phishing can become much more sophisticated."
Phishing is an attempt by criminals to get valuable information, such as banking login details, by pretending to be emailing from an official source.
It is more likely to succeed if it is sent to an address that regularly receives correspondence from the real organisation.
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Technology explained: What is phishing?
Deloitte said it had reviewed the email platform accessed and had determined there had been "no disruption" to the work of its clients.
However, Tony Pepper, chief executive of data security company Egress, said that compromised email servers could be full of sensitive information.
"This is why multi-factor access control such as two-factor authentication is important, especially for administrators," he said.
"It makes it much harder to gain illicit access in the first place, and provides a warning if someone is trying to log in without your knowledge."
Two-factor authentication involves providing extra information before logging in - for example, an access code sent by text message.
Mr Pepper added that individual emails should also be encrypted.
In a statement, Deloitte said it had informed government authorities and regulators of the breach.
"Deloitte remains deeply committed to ensuring that its cyber-security defences are best in class, to investing heavily in protecting confidential information and to continually reviewing and enhancing cyber-security," it said.

Sports drink Gatorade has agreed to pay $300,000 (220,000) to the state of California over an app called Bolt!
which featured a character based on Olympic medallist Usain Bolt.
In the game Bolt had to drink Gatorade to enhance his performance while water slowed him down.
Attorney General Xavier Becerra said the game made "misleading statements" about water.
The app was released in 2012 and is no longer available to download.
It was only available on Apple's operating system and was downloaded 2.3 million times from 2012 to 2013.
It was briefly made available again in 2017.
Players were told to "keep your performance high by avoiding water" in a tutorial that accompanied the game, the Attorney General's office said.
In a statement Gatorade's parent company PepsiCo said the game was designed to "highlight the unique role and benefits of sports drinks in supporting athletic performance".
"We recognise the role water plays in overall health and wellness," it said, adding that it also markets bottled water brands.
Youth audience

Bolt!
had an audience of mainly young people aged 13 to 24, the state added.
"Making misleading statements is a violation of California law.
But making misleading statements aimed at our children is beyond unlawful, it's morally wrong and a betrayal of trust.
"It's what causes consumers to lose faith in the products they buy," said Mr Becerra.
Almost half the settlement ($120,000) will be used to fund research and education into water consumption and nutrition in young people.
PepsiCo said in a 2014 statement that it does not advertise in spaces where children aged under 12 make up more than 35% of the audience.
Analyst Jack Kent, from IHS Markit, told the BBC the app store market had moved away from "branded entertainment" and games connected to a particular ad campaign.
"Mobile is a primary channel for reaching a youth audience, and the rise of branded apps highlighted that, but now there is more focus on reaching users through existing mobile social, entertainment and media platforms rather than just through dedicated apps," he said.
Image copyright Reuters Image caption Cyber-attacks to aid IS's aims have not been very successful, said a security researcher

Hackers working for the so-called Islamic State are bad at coding and hiding what they do, suggests research.
They produce buggy malware and easily crackable encryption programs, said senior security researcher Kyle Wilhoit at security conference DerbyCon.
In particular, he called three attack tools created by one large IS hacker collective "garbage".
Their poor skills meant IS groups had switched to online services and the dark web for attack code, he said.
Little harm

While IS was very proficient at using social media as a recruitment and propaganda tool, its cyber-attack arm was nowhere near as effective, said Mr Wilhoit, a cyber-security researcher at Domain Tools, while presenting his work at the conference in Kentucky.
"ISIS is really, really bad at the development of encryption software and malware," he told tech news outlet The Register, adding that the vulnerabilities found in all the tools effectively rendered them "completely useless".
As part of his research, Mr Wilhoit analysed three separate types of tools created by hackers who were part of what is known as the United Cyber Caliphate (UCC).
This was set up as an umbrella organisation for 17 hacker groups that had declared their support for IS.
All the tools had problems, he said.
the group's malware was full of basic bugs

"As it stands ISIS are not hugely operationally capable online," Mr Wilhoit added.
"There's a lack of expertise in pretty much everything,"

IS also had a lot to learn when it came to hiding its activities online, he said.
There were many examples of it sharing pictures of successful attacks, or which lauded its members, that still held metadata that could identify where the photos were taken.
Mr Wilhoit said that, during his research, he had found an unprotected IS server online that served as a repository of images the group planned to use for propaganda.
"You can basically mass export metadata from each of the pictures and get literally up-to-the-second information on where people are operating, because they are not really that great at operation security," he said.
Many of the people involved with the cyber-arm of IS had been killed in drone strikes, said Mr Wilhoit adding that it was open to speculation about how location data to aid the drones was found.
Over the last year UCC had begun moving to attack tools used by Western cyber-thieves, he said.
"They know they cannot develop tools worth a damn, so they are going to use stuff that works, is minimally cheap and is easy to use."

London Mayor Sadiq Khan has asked the city's transport regulator to meet Uber's boss after the firm apologised for the "mistakes" it has made.
Uber chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi issued the apology after the taxi-hailing firm lost its London licence.
Mr Khosrowshahi said in an open letter that Uber would appeal against the city's decision, but accepted the company "must change".
On Friday, Transport for London (TfL) denied Uber a new licence to operate.
Uber has said it wants to meet TfL to discuss the regulator's concerns over public safety and security.
The London mayor welcomed Mr Khosrowshahi's apology, saying: "Even though there is a legal process in place, I have asked TfL to make themselves available to meet with him."
In deciding not to renew Uber's licence beyond the end of September, TfL cited concerns about the firm's treatment of criminal offences, medical certificates, and drivers' background checks.
When asked about a possible meeting, a spokesman for TfL said: "We are always available and happy to meet at any time."
Uber says it has followed the regulator's rules and works closely with the Metropolitan Police.
The firm, which is used by an estimated 40,000 drivers and 3.5 million customers in London, also says it will continue operating while its appeal is heard.
Mr Khosrowshahi, who took over at the firm less than a month ago, wrote on Monday: "While Uber has revolutionised the way people move in cities around the world, it's equally true that we've got things wrong along the way."
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Dara Khosrowshahi took over as Uber boss last month after Travis Kalanick resigned

In a letter addressed to Londoners, the new Uber boss said the firm "won't be perfect, but we will listen to you".
"On behalf of everyone at Uber globally, I apologise for the mistakes we've made," Mr Khosrowshahi said.
Earlier, the mayor of London accused Uber of putting "unfair pressure" on TfL, with an "army" of PR experts and lawyers.
Mr Khan, who is also chairman of TfL, told the BBC: "What you can't do is have a situation where unfair pressure is brought on a quasi-judicial body, where there are officials working incredibly hard.
"I appreciate Uber has an army of PR experts, I appreciate Uber has an army of lawyers - they've also made aggressive threats about taking us to court."
Uber-TfL talks

When asked if he would meet Uber personally, the mayor said it would be "improper for politicians to interfere with a quasi-judicial matter".
The mayor's office said Mr Khan would not be directly involved in discussions or meetings with Uber if they took place.
While Mr Khan chairs the TfL board, according to the organisation he was not involved in the process of deciding whether to issue Uber with a licence.
That is handled by TfL's taxi and private hire department.
Uber is keen to hold talks with officials from that department "as soon as possible", Fred Jones, a senior executive with Uber in the UK, told the BBC's Today Programme.
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption More than 750,000 people have signed an online petition to keep Uber operating

Mr Jones said that Uber was "not clear" about the issues raised by TfL when it denied the company a licence.
One of the points raised by TfL was Uber's "approach to how Enhanced Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) checks are obtained" for its drivers.
That part of the process was not even handled by Uber, said Mr Jones.
Instead, the drivers organised their own DBS check and took that paperwork to TfL.
TfL then reviews that application before giving the driver a licence allowing them to drive for Uber.
TfL would not elaborate further on its issue with the way in which Uber organises DBS checks, because that would be likely to come up when Uber appealed against the decision.
It would only repeat that it was Uber's "approach" to DBS checks that was the problem.
More than 750,000 people have signed an online petition in a bid to keep Uber operating in London after its licence expires on 30 September.
Image caption The judge told Brian Thompson that "all sentencing options" were open

A Middlesbrough shop owner has admitted selling modified TV boxes that allow access to subscription content such as Premier League football and films.
Brian Thompson, 55, had originally denied any offences and set up the prospect of a landmark court case relating to the sale of Kodi boxes.
However, at Teesside Crown Court he changed his plea to admit two charges related to their sale and advertising.
Kodi developers have said boxes should not be used to access blocked content.
Judge Peter Armstrong told Thompson, of Barnaby Avenue in Middlesbrough, that "all sentencing options" were open.
Thompson admitted one count of selling and one count of advertising devices "designed, produced or adapted for the purpose of enabling or facilitating the circumvention of effective technological measures".
He was granted unconditional bail ahead of his sentencing on 20 October.
Judge Armstrong told him: "I don't know what the sentence will be, all options to the court will be open."

Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner used a private email account to carry out official White House business, his lawyer said.
Mr Kushner is a senior presidential adviser and is married to Ivanka Trump.
His lawyer confirmed the existence of the personal email account in a statement on Sunday.
During his campaign, Mr Trump repeatedly criticised rival Hillary Clinton for using a personal email account while secretary of state.
The president frequently encouraged crowds at rallies to chant "lock her up", and vowed to imprison Mrs Clinton.
An investigation into the matter was closed without charges, though then-FBI director James Comey said she was "extremely careless" in handling classified information.
Dozens of emails were exchanged between Mr Kushner and other White House officials on topics including media coverage and event planning, according to Politico, which first published the story.
There is no indication that Mr Kushner shared classified or privileged information through his private email account.
"Mr Kushner uses his White House email address to conduct White House business," his lawyer, Abbe Lowell, said in a statement.
"Fewer than a hundred emails from January through August were either sent to or returned by Mr Kushner to colleagues in the White House from his personal email account."
"These usually forwarded news articles or political commentary and most often occurred when someone initiated the exchange by sending an email to his personal, rather than his White House, address."
Federal regulations specify how records related to the president and other government activities should be maintained.
The use of private accounts can put official records beyond the reach of journalists, lawmakers, and others who seek publicly-available information.

Bees in Manchester are having computer chips glued to their bodies, to help beekeepers track when they enter and exit the hive.
Rory Cellan-Jones visited the project to find out how it works.
Britain will need to boost its generation of electricity by about a quarter, Scottish Power has estimated.
The energy firm said electric cars and a shift to electric heating could send demand for power soaring.
Its chief executive also said there would have to be a major investment in the wiring necessary to handle rapid charging of car batteries.
Keith Anderson was speaking as the firm reached the milestone of 2,000 megawatts of wind power capacity.
That equates to about an eighth of the British total.
The figure includes Whitelee wind farm, on Eaglesham Moor, south of Glasgow, which has more than 200 turbines.
Believed to be Europe's biggest wind farm, it is capable of generating enough power for all of Glasgow's homes.
Image copyright Thinkstock Image caption Whitelee is believed to be Europe's biggest wind farm

In the past 18 months, the Spanish-owned company has been installing nearly a quarter of the British total, but the pipeline of work is coming to an end.
Attention is turning to offshore wind.
But Mr Anderson told BBC Scotland there would have to be a renewed surge in the building of onshore wind turbines if consumer demand was to be met.
He warned that past experience with technology change had shown consumers could make the move faster than governments or companies expect.
Once the price of electric cars falls to that of petrol or diesel, which it is thought will happen between 2022 and 2025, there could be a rapid shift in buying patterns and electricity usage.
Earlier this month, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced a target of shifting from petrol and diesel-fuelled cars to battery power by 2032, while the UK government intends to make that shift by 2040.
'Worst position'

Mr Anderson said: "The worst position for this country to be in and the worst position for customers is that we get huge enthusiasm, people rushing out to buy electric cars because the price has come down, and then we can't allow people to plug them in because we haven't invested in the infrastructure.
"So one of the things we're looking at now is how we plan what has to happen to the distribution system."
The estimate of a 20%-30% increase in demand for electricity comes after years of gradually declining power use, much of that due to growing energy efficiency and the closure of older, energy-intensive industries.
Image copyright Getty Images

At the same time, old power stations - including Scottish Power's coal-burning plants at Longannet in Fife and Cockenzie in East Lothian - have been closed down.
The added challenge of cars is the change in technology from an eight-hour overnight charge to a rapid charge of 15 to 20 minutes.
If several car owners on a residential street plug those in at the same time, the system could not cope.
Mr Anderson said: "The system that takes the wires into the house, down the street, to local businesses - how do we make sure it can cope with that level of demand?
It'll take a long time to plan and deliver."
'Let's keep going'

Heating is the next frontier in the energy revolution, which has barely begun.
In place of gas and oil-fired boilers in each home, electric central heating can be powered by renewable generation.
What we're saying to the politicians, regulators and customers is: let's keep going - this [wind power] has been a huge success Keith Anderson, Scottish Power chief executive

However, it is likely to require not only removal of a boiler, but the replacement of radiators and hot water heating pipes throughout a home.
Mr Anderson said: "What we're saying to the politicians, regulators and customers is: let's keep going - this [wind power] has been a huge success.
"We have been able to develop these projects faster and faster, and to deliver them more efficiently, at much lower cost.
"Keep going, because that will bring costs down and make us more efficient for the future.
"If you stop now, the technology development stops, the innovation stops: the new jobs, the new roles, they all stop.
You stop that for two or three years, and trying to restart it becomes more difficult and more expensive."
Most of the recent onshore wind developments have been in Scotland, focused on the south west.
The UK government has allowed much less onshore wind developing, in response to anti-turbine campaigners.
It has also left onshore wind out of the auctions which offer generators a minimum price for their energy.
These auctions have helped drive down the cost of renewable power, with offshore wind nearly halving in price.
Image copyright Reuters Image caption Apple introduced new iOS on Tuesday

Android devices as well as Apple computers have Persian keyboards, but until this week the option wasn't available on Apple phones or iPads.
For years Persian speakers used the Arabic keyboard on the iPhone, which was not really ideal for writing quickly or accurately in Persian.
There were lots of petitions to Apple, pressing them to add a Persian keyboard to mobile phones.
That finally paid off with the latest release.
Arabic and Persian keyboards are very similar.
But there are two major issues - the four extra letters in Persian - and the "half space" feature needed for a well-edited Persian message.
In order to type the extra four letters in our alphabet we had to press and hold another letter and wait for a window to pop up so we could drag our finger on it and see it on screen.
Yet that was still doable.
The "half space" was the more serious issue.
In Persian, the letters in a single word are joined-up.
Some words we make by combining two words together.
These compound words should be near but not attached to each other.
On Apple and Microsoft computers, as well as in Android devices we have long been able to use a "half space" to separate words but keep them close enough.
A hyphen does almost a similar task in English.
But the half space is used far more in Persian.
Image caption First line is typing without half space and the second line has the half space.
Extra Persian letters are circled in Red.
Half space button has a blue circle around it.
For example: "I work for the BBC."
If I want to write this sentence in Farsi, I use the "half space" three times to keep the BBC letters close to each other and to join two parts of the verb.
For several years, many Iranians and Afghans signed petitions, hoping to add the keyboard.
One of my friends personally wrote to Steve Jobs twice, but never heard back.
Even though Apple could have given us this option sooner, I took the joy of having a proper keyboard to Twitter and wrote about it there.
Some Android enthusiasts replied to me, saying their devices had it for "ages".
Others wondered why Apple would add the keyboard as they abandoned Iranian apps.
Recently Apple has removed some apps developed in Iran from their stores.
Snapp, a popular ride-hailing app like Uber, was one of those affected.
Apple said it was deleting them due to US sanctions, but some Persian cooking apps or video streaming apps developed outside Iran were also deleted.
Google did not take the same measures.
Even though many see Apple's recent moves as a double standard, I still think having a Persian keyboard is good for our language.
Persian written in the Persian alphabet is common in only two countries: Iran and Afghanistan.
During the time of the Soviet Union, Iranian elites often sent their sons to Europe and the USSR to study.

Amazed by the Western world, some suggested we should change our alphabet to Latin, much like Turkey did.
Others argued we would cut our ties with our literary heritage, and those arguments won out.
We ended up keeping our alphabet.
Then came the era of computers and smartphones.
Early technology did not support the Persian alphabet.
So my generation, who grew up in the 80s and 90s, started writing Persian with a Latin alphabet on computers and early phones, calling it Farglish.
Because of the sanctions, Apple and other major tech companies do not have any legal presence in Iran and as some of these smartphones are considered expensive, they don't have a big market in Iran and Afghanistan.
One may wonder why it was important for us to have a Persian keyboard on devices that not many Iranians own.
The answer is that we do care about our cultural heritage and appreciate any attempt to have a better connection with our great poets and writers - masters like Sa'di, Rumi, Hafiz, Ferdowsi, Khayyam and others.
A text for me is like a wall.
Every word is like a brick.
If I want to build a sturdy and beautiful wall I cannot use broken bricks.
I don't want any extra space between the pieces of a brick.
As a journalist or even as a user on Twitter, I would like to make a good impression on my audience.
Image copyright Reuters Image caption Apple uses Imagination's technology in its iPhones

UK technology firm Imagination, which designs graphics chips for smartphones, is being bought for 550m by a Chinese-backed investment firm.
Imagination put itself up for sale in June after Apple, its largest customer, said it would stop using its products.
The boss of Imagination, Andrew Heath, said the takeover by China-backed Canyon Bridge was a "very good outcome" and would ensure it remained in the UK.
It becomes the latest UK chip designer to be bought by a foreign investor.
Last year, ARM, which designs microchip technology used in Apple and Samsung smartphones, was bought by Japan's Softbank for 24bn.
Canyon Bridge recently raised $1.5bn (1.1bn) from Chinese investors and has offices in Beijing and San Francisco.
'British innovation'

The firm said it currently has no plans to cut jobs at Hertfordshire-based Imagination after the takeover.
Ray Bingham, a partner at Canyon Bridge, said: "We are investing in UK talent and expertise in order to accelerate the expansion of Imagination, particularly into Asia, where its technology platform will lead the continued globalisation of British-developed innovation."
Imagination saw its shares halve in value when Apple said in April that it would end a deal to use its products.
The two firms are still engaged in a dispute over the move - with Imagination questioning Apple's "assertions" that it would be able to develop its own computer chip designs without breaching Imagination's intellectual property rights.
Apple's royalty payments for the chip technology, used in its iPhones, iPads and iPods, accounted for about half of Imagination's revenues.
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The Trump administration blocked Canyon Bridge's attempts to buy a US tech firm

Mr Heath said: "Imagination has made excellent progress both operationally and financially over the last 18 months until Apple's unsubstantiated assertions and the subsequent dispute forced us to change course.
"The acquisition will ensure that Imagination - with its strong growth prospects - remains an independent IP licensing business, based in the UK, but operating around the world."
It is not Canyon Bridge's first deal for a Western tech company.
The firm is seeking approval for a $1.3bn deal to buy US chipmaker Lattice Semiconductor.
Last week, the Trump administration barred the sale of Lattice to the Chinese-backed company, citing national security risks.

One of Google's most senior executives has defended the company's response to terrorist propaganda appearing online.
General counsel Kent Walker told the Today programme the company is working to improve the quality of machine learning so it can identify and remove material it finds.
But he added that the government and the police must work with the firm.
His interview coincides with a demand by Prime Minister Theresa May that tech firms take down terrorist material within two hours or face fines.
China has disrupted WhatsApp in a censorship drive ahead of the government's Communist Party meeting next month.
It has only been accessible through virtual private networks (VPNs) at times - but even some of them are being blocked.
Other social media platforms, which people in the West use every day, are also banned in mainland China.
Instead they're replaced by other ones which the government can monitor.
So what social media platforms are Chinese people able to use?
Instead of WhatsApp: WeChat

WeChat started off as pretty much a direct replica of WhatsApp, but it's now used for a lot more than just messaging and calling.
You can use it to pay for things, do your online shopping and play games.
It was created by Chinese company Tencent and there's also a feature where you can record a message which is then picked up by a random person - sort of like throwing a message in a bottle in the sea.
But the price its hundreds of millions of Chinese users pay for using it is that all their information is shared with the government.
Instead of Twitter: Weibo

Twitter has been blocked in China since it was partly blamed for helping to organise a protest in 2009.
That's when Weibo was set up instead and it basically does the same job - you have 140 characters to get your thoughts out.
But it's used differently to Twitter as people tend to post more about their personal and family lives rather than argue about politics.
Although this could partly be down to worries about censorship, it's also because the culture isn't one where people talk about these things in real life - so that translates into the online world too.
Instead of Google: Baidu

Baidu provides a lot of the same services online as Google, which is also banned in China.
But it also has Reddit-style forums called Baidu Tieba and a Wikipedia-style online encyclopaedia.
And like Google, it's investing a lot into AI and self-driving cars.
But the Chinese authorities are investigating Baidu, along with Weibo and WeChat, in an attempt to bring them under even more control.
Instead of Facebook messenger: QQ

QQ is a messenger platform owned by Tencent, the same company that owns WeChat - in the same way that Whatsapp is also owned by Facebook.
So they're not really direct rivals to each other but do quite a lot of the same things.
The main difference is that QQ, like Facebook messenger, started as a desktop app rather than a phone app.
You also don't need a phone number to use QQ, which means younger people who don't have a phone yet can use it to message each other.
Instead of YouTube: Youku

Youku is China's main site where anyone can upload their own videos - but they are all monitored by the Chinese government and anything criticising the Communist Party is taken down.
It also streams Netflix or Amazon-style original TV shows.
And there are famous "Youkuers" who can make millions of dollars, mostly from directing their users to buy stuff from Alibaba.
That's the Chinese version of Amazon or eBay - which also just happens to own Youku too.

Image caption David Meade from Rathfriland in County Down is a mentalist - but did not predict the end of the world

Having the same name as a man who predicted the world would end on Saturday - last Saturday - has caused County Down mentalist David Meade no end of grief - even five death threats.
American conspiracy theorist David Meade claimed that Planet Nibiru would collide with Earth on 23 September.
David Meade, from Rathfriland, County Down, has been forced to dissociate himself from the claims.
Newspapers have incorrectly linked the claim to him on social media.
His picture has also been used in relation to the story.
Mr Meade, who now lives in Banbridge with his wife Elaine and their family, said: "About six or seven months ago we started getting the odd tweet here and there and I thought it was hilarious.
Skip Twitter post by @DavidMeadeLive And I had a day of death threats, my site crashed with traffic.
Still getting hundreds of threatening messages to my site every day.
David Meade (@DavidMeadeLive) September 23, 2017 Report

"I think part of the source of the confusion, first of all, is that it is a pretty unusual way to spell Meade, with an 'e' at the end.
"But then also, when people were arriving on my site they were seeing things like 'mentalist', 'mind reader'.
"That probably sounds like the sort of person that would predict the end of the world," he confessed.
"The last two weeks have been extraordinary and actually it's verging on worrying this morning."
The father-of-two is both a lecturer in international business and an entertainer who "caught the bug" for mind-reading as a teenager.
His website has been so inundated with traffic that it has crashed three times, something he said was a concern, as he has five employees.
"Sixty percent of my work is in the United States, it is deeply worrying to think that this nonsense could be there online and could affect my business," he said.
He has now received five death threats but said that he is not taking the threats seriously.
His lawyer is in contact with a number of media outlets asking them to retract stories linking the County Down man to the story.
"A Fox news anchor linked directly to my Twitter feed, directly to my website, and, to date, has refused to apologise for it," he said.
"My main concern is that no one seems bothered to correct this."
The entertainer seems confident the Earth is not facing impending doom - from an unknown planet at least - and has offered a "1000%" refund on tickets sold for his upcoming tour "in the event of an apocalypse".
Following the fact that the world did not end on Saturday, the American David Meade told the Washington Post: "The world is not ending, but the world as we know it is ending."
"A major part of the world will not be the same the beginning of October," he said.
He describes himself as a "Christian numerologist", whose apocalyptic theory is based on a "numeric code" he said he found in the Bible.
Image copyright Planet X News Image caption David Meade, the "Christian numerologist"

Mainstream Christian groups have dismissed his theories and have denied that Christians believed them.
He describes himself as a having studied astronomy and being a "specialist in research and investigations" and talks about a "Planet X".
However, the US space agency said Planet Nibiru, also known as Planet X, does not exist.
David Meade, the conspiracy theorist, said, however: "The existence of Planet X is beyond any reasonable doubt."
He said Nasa discovered Planet X in the 1980s and that preparations for it striking - or closely passing - Earth were well under way in both the US and in Russia.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Flooding in the Dominican Republic continues long after Hurricane Maria has passed

With hundreds dead and millions either left homeless, or facing huge damage to their properties, catastrophic flooding has devastated many parts of the world.
Nature's fury may seem unstoppable, but can technology at least help us to cope better?
Savage hurricanes and record rains have struck around the world, bringing chaos to many countries and regions, including Bangladesh, India, the Caribbean, China and Texas in the US.
Each year on average, flooding affects 96.9 million people worldwide, and causes $13.7bn (10bn) in damage, according to the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction.
Those figures are likely to rise dramatically after this year's deluges.
"There are now many indications that the incidence of storms and persistent rainfall events is increasing with climate change," says Dr Justin Butler, chief executive of Brighton-based flood risk assessment firm Ambiental.
But more accurate data from satellites and ground-based sensors, coupled with supercomputer modelling and machine learning, are giving us a clearer picture of which areas are likely to be most affected, says Mr Butler.
"Tens of thousands of simulations need to be run to capture a range of possible events," he explains, "so the number of calculations that have to be carried out every second runs into the billions."
This kind of modelling is helping authorities plan flood defences more effectively, insurers price risk more accurately, emergency services improve how they respond, and homeowners take better protective measures.
Ambiental's "digital terrain models", built up using Lidar (light distance and ranging) laser technology and other data, map how water flows across urban and rural landscapes.
Image copyright Ambiental Image caption Highly detailed satellite data is helping to improve flood map modelling

Its Flowroute modelling engine crunches all the data from sensors on land and in the sky - as well as historic data - to simulate complex flood flow patterns and make predictions.
All this extra data and computing power is helping insurance companies improve their pricing.
Liz Mitchell, founder of flood insurance specialist Flood Assist, says: "Recent flood events have seen insurers invest in more sophisticated data, which is allowing them to assess the flood risk of an individual property rather than that of a postcode.
"You can have many properties registered at a postcode, and some could literally be at the top of a hill and others at the bottom - they would represent very different risks."
In the 2011 Brisbane floods, Ambiental's model was 95% accurate, claims Mr Butler, correctly predicting flooding in 19 out of every 20 flooded properties.
More accurate modelling means some householders in previously "high risk" areas could see their premiums coming down.
But other householders, of course, could see their premiums rising after a reassessment.
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Puerto Rico was also badly hit by Hurricane Maria, but the people were forewarned

"The use of data varies greatly from insurer-to-insurer.
The more sophisticated the data the more accurate - theoretically - their pricing should be," says Ms Mitchell.
Given that the cost of winter flooding in the UK last year was estimated to be 1.3bn, insurers are desperate to get a clearer picture of their likely liabilities.
More extreme weather needs more sophisticated monitoring, which is why Nasa has funded the Global Flood Monitoring System (GFMS), an experimental online computer program run by the University of Maryland.
It can make almost real-time flood analysis by combining data from satellites with a sophisticated land surface model that incorporates vegetation cover, soil type, and terrain.
If water cannot soak away into the land, flood surges are more probable, and knowing where these are likely to hit is crucial for saving lives.
Organisations like the Red Cross and the UN World Food Program are already using GFMS before, during, and after floods to supplement other on-the-ground intelligence they may have.
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Japan's H-2A rocket carried the Himawari 8 weather satellite into orbit in 2014

Dr Robert Adler, a senior research scientist at the University of Maryland and one of the system's developers, says new Nasa satellite data has helped increase the accuracy of the model significantly - particularly useful during the recent Hurricane Harvey.
But he is not complacent.
"We've made a lot of progress and have had success," he says, "but there is still far to go.
Improvements in the satellite rainfall estimates will lead directly to improved flood analysis."
Computational power is useless without accurate data to work with, so groundbreaking new satellites, such as the Japanese Himawari-8, are making a big difference.
More Technology of Business

It generates about 50 times more data than previous satellites, and can analyse average rainfall using thermal infrared images that read the temperature of cloud tops.
As well as advances in satellites, more sophisticated ground-based sensors are also improving modern flood prediction.
For example, the UK's Flood Network is harnessing the "internet of things" with the aim of creating an extensive, localised, early-warning system for flood-prone areas.
It uses wireless sensors monitoring water levels in streams, groundwater and river basins.
The data is transmitted over a Low-Power Wide-Area Network designed for long-range communications at a low bit rate.

The initiative between Oxford-based Nominet and the Oxford Flood Network was launched in 2015, less than a year after the city was hit by floods that cut off major routes and homes for days.
"Although the Environment Agency provides blanket warnings, it has limited resources and uses just a few, expensive, professional sensors," says Adam Leach, Nominet's head of research and development.
"We thought that a higher density of sensors with more detailed data would make a real difference to monitoring water levels in flood-prone areas, particularly in small waterways.
"It's still relatively early days for the Flood Network," he adds, "but it demonstrates the huge potential the internet of things has to deliver the 'smart city' projects we've all heard so much about."
Forewarned is forearmed, they say, but a future Technology of Business feature will look at the technologies helping protect householders and businesses from the damage such floods can cause.

Imagine a hacker remotely turning off a life support machine in a hospital, or shutting down a power station.
These are the nightmare scenarios we face because many organisations haven't a clue how many unsecured devices are connected to their networks, cyber-security experts warn.
It was an ordinary day at a busy hospital - doctors, nurses and surgeons rushed about attending to the health of their patients.
For Hussein Syed, chief information security officer for the largest health provider in New Jersey, it was the health of his IT network that was keeping him busy.
And today, he was in for a surprise.
He knew he presided over a complex web of connected medical devices, computers, and software applications spread across RWJBarnabas Health's 13 hospitals.
This included about 30,000 computers, 300 apps, a data centre, as well as all the mobile phones hooking up to the hospitals' wi-fi networks.
Company mergers had only added to the complexity of these sprawling IT systems.
Image copyright RWJBarnabas Health Image caption Hussein Syed discovered that there were around 70,000 devices connected to his network

But when he used a specialist IoT cyber-security program to carry out a full audit, he discovered that there were in fact 70,000 internet-enabled devices accessing the health firm's network - far more than he'd expected.
"We found a lot of things we were not aware of," Mr Syed tells the BBC, "systems that weren't registered with IT and which didn't meet our security standards."
These included security cameras and seemingly innocuous gadgets such as uninterruptible power supplies (UPSs) - units that provide back-up battery power in the event of a power cut.
"These unidentified devices could definitely have been access points for hackers who could have then found high-value assets on our network," says Mr Syed.
Hack in to a UPS and you could potentially switch off life-critical machines, he explains.
Or hackers could steal patient data, encrypt it, then demand a ransom for its safe return.
On the black market "health data is worth 50 times more than credit card data", says Mr Syed.
Image copyright RWJBarnabas Health Image caption Hospitals like this RWJBarnabas Health one in New Jersey are also complex IT networks

The audit "helped us protect our network," he adds, preferring not to dwell on what might have been.
Mike DeCesare, chief executive of ForeScout, the software provider Mr Syed brought in, says: "Businesses typically underestimate by 30% to 40% how many devices are linked to their network.
It's often a shock when they find out.
"With the proliferation of IoT [internet of things] devices the attack surface for hackers has increased massively.
"Traditional antivirus software was designed on the assumption that there were just a few operating systems.
Now, because of IoT, there are thousands."
ForeScout's software monitors a company's network and indentifies every device trying to access it, "not just from its IP [internet protocol] address, but from 50 other attributes and fingerprints", says Mr DeCesare.
The reason for these other layers of security is that it is "relatively easy" for hackers to mask the identity of a particular device - known as MAC [media access control] spoofing.
So ForeScout's software takes a behavioural approach to monitoring.
Image copyright ForeScout Image caption ForeScout boss Mike DeCesare says his company can spot rogue devices on the network

"We look at the traffic from all those different devices and analyse whether they are behaving like they should," he says.
"Is that printer behaving like a printer?
So why is it trying to access other devices on the network and break in to the system?
"If we spot aberrant behaviour we can disconnect the device from the network automatically."
Services from network monitoring firms - ForeScout, Solar Winds, IBM, SecureWorks, Gigamon and others - are becoming increasingly necessary in a world where everything - from lamp-posts to lawn sensors - is becoming internet-enabled.
According to Verizon's latest State of the Market: Internet of Things report there are now 8.4 billion connected devices - a 31% increase on 2016 - and $2tn (1.5tn) will have been spent on the technologies by the end of 2017.
But as Verizon points out, lack of industry-wide standards for IoT devices is giving businesses major security concerns.
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Technology explained: What is the internet of things?
Stories of cyber-attacks mounted on the back of insecure devices such as video cameras have highlighted the issue.
"IoT security is one of the biggest challenges we're facing right now," says Darren Thomson, chief technology officer and vice president, technology services at cyber-security firm Symantec.
The difficulty is that IoT devices are generally simple, cheap and low-powered, without the capability of running the antivirus programs operated by traditional computers.
"The challenge with critical infrastructure is that it wasn't built with security in mind," says Tom Reilly, chief executive of Cloudera, the IoT and data analytics platform.
"Smart cities are a great playing field for hackers - changing traffic lights, turning elevators on and off - there are many security exposures.
"We need to get ahead of them."
This necessitates a different approach to security, a growing number of experts believe.
In April, telecoms giant Verizon launched what it calls its IoT "security credentialing" service, whereby only trusted, verified devices are allowed to access a company's network.
Meanwhile, Cloudera has formed a strategic partnership with chip maker Intel.

"Intel makes the chips that are being used in many IoT sensors," explains Mr Reilly, "and all that data being created needs to land in a database like ours residing in a data centre.
"We authenticate all the devices - we're creating an end-to-end platform for the IoT world."
Rival GE Digital, a subsidiary of the global engineering giant GE, has also developed its own IoT and data analytics platform called Predix which it is outsourcing to big clients such as British Airways and oil giant Exxon.
IoT sensors are fitted to big machines, from gas turbines to aero engines, and these transmit "petabytes of data in real time that helps us work out how to optimise their maintenance", says Bill Ruh, GE Digital chief executive.
"We get all that data back via virtual private networks mostly in a highly secure encrypted fashion."
But if you don't have the resources to commit to an entire IoT ecosystem operated by a major tech company, behavioural network monitoring may be your next best bet.
Just bear in mind that your organisation's defences are only as strong as the weakest part.
Beware the invisible network.

The UK government's "future partnership" paper made a strong case for "a bespoke relationship with Europol" after the UK leaves the European Union.
It looked at the scenarios of:

no agreement being reached on future cooperation with Europol

current cooperation being wound down before a new arrangement was put in place

It said: "Consideration would need to be given to ensuring that any ongoing investigations would not be affected in such a way that criminals might escape prosecution or vulnerable individuals might be rendered less safe."
And it would be difficult to find anyone in the EU who would disagree with the importance of fighting cross-border crime.
EU funding

Europol, the European Union's law enforcement organisation, was founded in 1999 and employs more than 1,000 people at a cost of about 100m a year.
It is an EU-funded agency, and when the UK completes the Brexit process and no longer pays into the EU budget, it will cease to be a member.
The EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, used an article in the French newspaper Le Monde to make it clear the UK could not continue to be a member.
He said: "The British defence minister will no longer be able to sit at the council of defence ministers, London will leave the European Defence Agency and Europol."
Prime Minister Theresa May has previously said she wants the UK to retain its security co-operation with Europol post-Brexit.
And a number of countries that are not part of the EU, such as Norway, Switzerland and the US, have operational agreements with Europol that allow access to intelligence.
But Europol itself say this does not equate to formal membership, which means these countries do not have a say over operations and decisions.
Europol also points out that such agreements take a number of years to negotiate.
Image caption Every EU member state, plus 14 other nations, has staff in the Europol headquarters in The Hague

One precedent that might act as a future model is Denmark, an EU member but no longer in Europol.
In December 2015, Denmark voted in a referendum against more integration of security operations.
In May this year it formally left Europol, but an agreement was reached that allowed the Danish police and Europol to continue to share information and analysis.
Denmark is able to participate in Europol board meetings, but it has only "observer status" and no decision-making rights.
Could a similar agreement be made with the UK?
Europol seems to think not.
In a statement, it said: "The agreement between both Denmark and Europol is based on the fact that Denmark is a full member of Schengen [group of countries that allow passport-free travel] and has implemented all EU data protection standards.
"It therefore allows for a sufficient level of co-operation, including the exchange of operational data and the deployment of liaison officers."
Prof Alan Woodward, a British cyber-crime expert and adviser to Europol, said the issue of the UK's future relationship with Europol needed to be resolved sooner rather than later.
"I very much hope that a solution is found to allow the UK to remain active participant with Europol - simply because it is in everybody's interest," he said.
"Europol is the best organisation to tackle cross-border law enforcement issues, especially in cyber-crime."

A number of shows at London Fashion Week trialled a system where clothes are made available for sale immediately after appearing on the catwalk.
Gigi Hadid modelled the outfits she'd collaborated on with designer Tommy Hilfiger in Camden.
The brand is one of five which used the "see now, buy now" model.
It's a big change for high fashion brands.
They typically take six months to make collections available to buy but social media's shifted all that.
Collaborating with a celebrity like Gigi Hadid, who has more then 37 million Instagram followers, certainly gets more attention for the brand.
"Fashion Week before was an event that happened behind closed doors.
Technology has smashed open those doors," says Matthew Drinkwater from London College of Fashion.
"Social media has allowed consumers to see in real time what's happening at Fashion Week."
Burberry was one of the first brands to launch see now, buy now, at London fashion week, in its September show last year.
Topshop, Mother of Pearl and Nicopanda also did it this week, the latter in a collaboration with Amazon which made its collection available for delivery in an hour.
Matthew Drinkwater says fast-fashion retailers like Asos and Zara have increased the pressure on luxury brands to make clothes available immediately.
"The time from idea to production in fast fashion is now three weeks," he explains.
"Fashion week has always been more inspirational, more forward thinking than that."
It's too early to know whether see now, buy now is increasing the profits of luxury brands, but the UK's overall spend on fashion online is going up.
The UK spent 12.4bn on fashion online in 2015, up from 10.7bn in 2014, according to researchers Mintel.
Another way designers are trying to guarantee attention for their shows is by filling the front row with online influencers.
The guests at Topshop's show included Kate Moss, Vogue editor Edward Enninful and pop stars like Charli XCX and Anne-Marie.
Matthew says big brands can make clothes available straight away because they've got shops to sell them in, and plenty of money.
Tommy Hilfiger sold $6.5bn (around 4.8bn) of clothes, footwear and accessories in 2015.
Matthew says he's worried about the pressure see now, buy now is putting on smaller designers.
"I don't want our young, emerging talent to be worried about fulfilling mass orders.
I want them to be experimenting.
"If you love what they're making, and the quality, you'll be prepared to wait."

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Toyota blazed a trail in hybrid car design with its Prius

Are electric cars really about to take over from the old-fashioned internal combustion engine?
Judging by some of the headlines we've seen recently, you could be forgiven for thinking petrol and diesel engines were about to be consigned to the scrap heap.
Yet the reality is rather different.
There is no question that the car industry is undergoing a radical change.
At this year's Frankfurt Motor Show - currently under way in the German city - the buzzword throughout the cavernous exhibition halls has been "electrification".
The day before the show, for example, Volkswagen said it would build electrified versions of every model in its range - including those sold under the Audi, Skoda, Seat and Porsche brands - by 2030.
The same evening, Mercedes' parent company Daimler said it would have electrified versions of its own models by 2022.
Image copyright EPA Image caption It's not just new cars, countries will need to invest in new infrastructures for fuelling electric vehicles

Other companies, including Volvo, Jaguar Land Rover and Honda have made similar pledges.
These are undoubtedly ambitious plans - but it is important to recognise their limitations.
They are not saying they will get rid of diesel or petrol cars completely.
They are simply promising to make electrified versions of them available.
It is also important to recognise what "electrified" actually means.
It can, of course, refer to fully electric battery powered vehicles.
But it can also be used to describe hybrids - and hybrids come in many forms.
A plug-in hybrid, for example, has a large battery capacity and is often capable of running entirely on electric power at least part of the time, though it will have a petrol engine as well.
One type of plug-in hybrid, often referred to as a range-extended EV, is essentially an electric car with a small petrol engine that acts as an on-board generator.

A strong or full hybrid, like the Toyota Prius, uses a relatively powerful electric motor alongside a conventional engine, but you don't need to plug it in for a recharge.
A mild hybrid, meanwhile, is effectively a conventional car, equipped with a small electric motor that allows the engine to shut down temporarily when the car is stopped at traffic lights, for example.
It can also be used to improve acceleration and power auxiliary systems.
To fulfil their commitments, carmakers could simply offer a range of mild hybrids.
They are cheaper to produce than full hybrids, yet they can offer significant benefits in terms of performance and fuel consumption.
More and more cars are already being built in this way.
Although their pledges may sound a bit more dramatic than they really are, it is true that carmakers are investing a great deal of money in new electric models.
Volkswagen, for example, says that by 2025, one in four of its cars could be battery powered.
BMW says it will be offering 12 pure-electric models by the same date.
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption "A hydrogen society needs to be created," says Toyota's Johan van Zyl

So what is driving the move towards electric vehicles?
There are several factors at play.
The launch of the Tesla Model S in 2012 proved that electric cars could perform as well as their petrol equivalents and have a decent battery range, albeit at a high price.
Since then the cost of lithium-ion batteries has fallen significantly, while battery management technology has improved, making that kind of performance more affordable.
Secondly, anti-pollution legislation is being tightened in key markets.
Here in Europe, for example, there will be new limits in force for emissions of carbon dioxide from 2021.
Those limits are much stricter than the current ones, and they are based on the average level of pollution produced by a manufacturer's entire fleet.
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption From 2021 there will be new limits on carbon dioxide emissions in Europe

So by producing zero-emissions cars, manufacturers will find it much easier to meet the targets.
The same logic applies to building more hybrids.
Both of these factors were already affecting the major manufacturers' long term thinking, when in September 2015, another factor came into play.
The diesel emissions scandal cast an unwelcome spotlight on the industry - exposing not just sharp practice, but the fact that diesel cars in particular routinely produced far more harmful pollution than official figures would suggest.
The result was a backlash from politicians and consumers - while Volkswagen, the architect of the scandal, tried to restore its reputation by becoming a leader in electric car technology.
As the VW Group chief executive Matthias Mueller told me in Frankfurt: "We've got the message of course.
Consumers want clean vehicles.
People want clean air, and we want to make our contribution."
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption VW is still having to deal with the aftermath of the diesel emissions scandal

Electrification was on the cards long before the VW scandal erupted.
But the events of two years ago may well have helped to accelerate the process.
Now, it seems that carmakers are making a virtue out of a necessity, trying to gain some useful PR mileage from a process that was, in reality, more or less inevitable.
So, too, are politicians.
Talk of banning petrol and diesel cars may sound dramatic, draconian even.
But here in the UK, for example, the proposed ban doesn't cover hybrids.
Industry experts say that by 2040 - the date when the ban is due to take effect - it is highly unlikely there will be any non-hybrid cars left on the market anyway.
Then there is the question of infrastructure.

There are currently about 7,300 charging points for electric cars in the UK, and the number is increasing at a rate of about 10 per day, according to ZapMap.
Globally, the figure is around two million, according to the International Energy Agency.
Clearly, if millions of petrol and diesel cars are to be replaced by electric versions, then we will need a huge investment in charging infrastructure, or they won't be going anywhere.
They will also need batteries - a lot of batteries.
And the power to charge them has to be generated somewhere.
That will take time and money.
Meanwhile, hybrid cars offer a convenient and effective stop-gap.
As BMW's chief executive Harald Krueger puts it, petrol and diesel cars "are not dead yet".
"You will see a transition time, with investments in combustion engines - petrol engines, diesel engines, very efficient engines," he says.
"But long term, we will see sustainable mobility with e-mobility."
Image copyright Reuters Image caption Audi's Aicon autonomous electric concept - but will such concepts really become reality soon?
VW Group's Matthias Mueller agrees.
"There will be a coexistence between internal combustion engines and electric drive systems for a certain period.
I can't tell you how long that will be," he says.
"And that's because we do have to get the right infrastructure in place... we have to create the battery capacity.
"We're talking about enormous capacity here, and it has yet to be created."
Image copyright Sulky Doll Image caption Fashion stylist Donna McCulloch says Instagram "is your shop front"

Instagram, the Facebook-owned photo app, has become a lucrative shop window for many small entrepreneurs.
So what are the secrets of its success?
When Facebook bought the photo app Instagram in 2012 for a cool $1bn (760m), eyebrows were raised at the value the tech giant had placed on this 18-month-old start-up.
Fast forward to 2017, and while Instagram may still be Facebook's little sister, it has built a sizeable community of 700 million users - dwarfing both Twitter and Snapchat.
With improved photo filters and the addition of Instagram Stories, a feature that lets users upload short videos that disappear after 24 hours, the platform has become a big hit with freelancers and small organisations looking to reach new audiences.
So how can you use it to make money?
"Instagram is your shop front," says Donna McCulloch, a fashion stylist who works under the name Sulky Doll.
"People don't ask for business cards any more - they ask for your 'handle' [Instagram nickname].
It's instant - you both get your phones out, and you're connected."
Image copyright Cat Meffan Image caption Yoga enthusiast Cat Meffan was "shocked and excited" by Instagram's marketing power

For yoga instructor Cat Meffan, the glamorous images she posts of herself in impressive yoga positions in picturesque locations around the world are intended to inspire and motivate her 77,000 followers.
But they also help her to build her business.
"I sold out my first yoga retreat in five days and all I did was put up one Instagram post," she says.
"I was extremely shocked and excited.
That's the power of Instagram."
Cat says she'll spend up to an hour crafting the captions alongside her photos - sometimes more than she'll spend on taking the photo itself.
"Sometimes I'll go out and do a photoshoot with my partner.
But usually it's me with a self-timer or holding the phone."
Like Donna, Cat finds adding hashtags to her photos a useful way of reaching a new audience.
A search for #yoga, for example, will bring up her images, along with those of others, while Donna's #OOTD (Outfit of The Day) are by far her most popular.
"It's a nice way of finding like-minded people," says Cat.
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Singer Selena Gomez has 126 million followers on Instagram

Both women also use the Stories feature to post videos which, they say, show them as they really are - an antidote to the artificial gloss that many Instagrammers are notorious for adding to their images.
"Stories allow people to get more of a handle on you as a person and a brand," says Donna.
"Stories are like peeking behind the net curtains.
The biggest compliment is when people say you come across the same in real life as you do on your feed [Instagram page]."
Both Cat and Donna have built their Instagram pages tightly around a very specific theme - yoga/wellness and fashion, respectively.
That's important if you want to grow the number of people who follow you says Danny Coy, a photographer with 173,000 followers who now also works as an Instagram consultant.
For 300 a month his firm Vibrance says it can "typically" grow an account by 2,000 followers every four weeks.
Techniques for attracting followers include posting regularly and having a bank of interesting images to hand.
"You don't have to post every day, but engagement peaks - after 24 hours it's done," he says.
"It's important to stick to your niche."
Image copyright Danny Coy Image caption Photographer Danny Coy thinks Instagrammers should stay focused on what they do best

That's Instagram's advice, too.
"If you tell a different story every time you come to Instagram people will struggle to understand what you're trying to communicate," says Jen Ronan, the firm's head of small business for Europe, Middle East and Africa.
"Make sure you're thoughtful about what you want your customers to know and ensure that you're consistently reinforcing this over time."
Many of Danny's clients are companies, he says, who want to boost their numbers in order to look "legitimate" on the platform.
"From time to time it'll be an up-and-coming photographer who feels they can't get the numbers they deserve," he says.
"Everyone has to start somewhere."
Instagrammers with a significant number of followers may be approached by brands seeking "influencers" or "ambassadors" to represent them - for a fee.

Incorporating brand products and imagery into photos and videos can be a lucrative sideline, although you have to make clear which content is sponsored under Instagram rules.
Donna McCulloch doesn't do it: "I think I would lose my integrity," she says, although she does admit to wearing clothes she's been given.
"But it's because I wanted it," she maintains.
And Cat Meffan says she spends a lot of time "saying no" to brands she doesn't think are right for her - but she does accept some.
"There's no set fee in the Instagram world," she says.
"You have a discussion [with the brand] and you have what you think you're worth."
Danny Coy says: "Eighteen months ago I could easily be turning over 2,000-3,000 a month in terms of influencer content."
But he says the market is tailing off because brands have wised up.
If an Instagrammer tags a brand in a post independently, the brand can use the image without payment.
"Most will ask first," he says.
"But once you've tagged them and put it on Instagram they don't have to ask your permission."
Image copyright Mariann Hardey Image caption Mariann Hardey thinks the Instagram community doesn't mind branded content if it's entertaining

But isn't it a bit of a turn-off being marketed to by people whose content you admire?
And do viewers sometimes not realise they are looking at paid-for content?
Mariann Hardey, assistant professor of marketing at Durham University, thinks the Instagram community isn't that gullible.
"It's easy to get het up that influencers are taking over and people don't understand they are seeing paid content, but the main users of Instagram are extremely savvy at being able to filter content that is branded or sponsored," she says.
What's most important is "whether the post is fun" and the pictures are "pretty", she adds.
So, the consensus seems to be that if the sponsored Instagrammer is well-liked and engaging, and the content is entertaining, Generation Instagram doesn't mind.

LG's latest handset is attracting plaudits at Berlin's Ifa tech expo, where it was unveiled.
Reviewers are praising its OLED display and advanced camera features.
To many it represents a "back to basics" approach after past flagships that focused on unusual features such as second displays and snap-in modules - and then failed to become bestsellers.
The BBC's Joe Miller was given an early look at the handset and quizzed the company about its strategy.
Starting October 1, passengers on most Delta will have free access to WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger and iMessage.
To access the feature, a passenger will have to log into Deltas in-flight wifi portal powered by Gogo.
This is first time an airline has offered such a service throughout its fleet.
Traditional SMS messages will not work.
Only the aforementioned mobile messaging services are supported at launch and users will not be able to send videos or pictures.
Passengers are, thankfully, not able to use this service to live stream from their flight.
I fly a lot and this is a significant free service to me.
Over countless flights, I purchased a costly Gogo internet package just to use iMessage.
Most of the time in a flight I dont want to check my email or Slack or Twitter.
When flying I want some me time, but sometimes, its also nice to just chat with some friends and now that can be done for free.
Even before this, there was some hacks and workarounds to let users access these services without paying.
Not that Im the sort of guy to exploit such loopholes.
Microsoft today announced that it has joined the Open Source Initiative (OSI) as a Premium Sponsor.
The OSI, which launched in 1998, takes a relatively pragmatic approach to open source and advocates for open source in business and government.
The OSI also reviews open source licenses, which are often vendor specific, to ensure that they conform to community norms and expectations.
As a premium sponsor, Microsoft joins the likes of Google, IGM, HPE, AdblockPlus, GitHub and Heptio as top sponsors of the project.
Other sponsors at lower levels include RedHat, The Linux Foundation, Mozilla and HP.
The work that Open Source Initiative does is vital to the evolution and success of open source as a first-class element in the software industry.
As Microsoft engages with open source communities more broadly and deeply, we are excited to support the Open Source Initiatives efforts, writes Jeff McAffer, Director of Microsofts Open Source Programs Office, in todays announcement.
Its worth noting that Microsoft has been working with the OSI for a couple of years now.
It submitted its Microsoft Community License and Microsoft Permission License in 2005 and 2007.
Its also no secret that Microsoft has massively expanded its portfolio of open source projects over the last few years.
Still, there remains a good amount of skepticism in the open source and free software community around why Microsoft is doing this.
The fact that former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer once called Linux a cancer still echoes through the collective unconscious of the open source world.
Microsoft is quite aware of this, but so far, its recent actions show that it now understands how to best engage with and participate in the open source community.

Eden, the office management and tech support platform, has today closed $10 million in Series A funding led by Spectrum 28, with participation from Fifth Wall Ventures, Bessemer Venture Partners, Y Combinator Continuity Fund, Canvas Ventures, Comcast Ventures, Eniac Ventures and other existing investors.
Eden started out as a tech support service for both businesses and consumers.
The original vision centered around helping out your mom or grandpa with their tech support needs in person by sending an on-demand support specialist.
Over time, Eden pivoted into a B2B platform, where businesses could get IT support (as well as cleaning, task management work, handy work, etc.)
from a W2 employee.
Eden called them Wizards.
Eden has now expanded their business to focus on their own software, building out a marketplace for other third-party vendors to connect with businesses for various services like cleaning, handy work, and more.
Founder and CEO Joe Du Bey says that revenue from their own W2 workers represents around 25 percent of their business, compared to before the introduction of third-party vendors, when it was around 75 percent of revenue.
Eden will be using the funding to expand beyond its current markets, which include San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York, and Austin, as well as hiring more engineers and professionals.
Edens current model isnt all that different from that of Managed By Q.
Both companies provide marketplaces for businesses to handle their office management through digital portals that give them access to a host of third-party service providers.
As part of the funding deal, Spectrum 28s Kent Ho will be joining the board.
Comcasts own streaming service aimed at cord cutters and more so the cord nevers who never sign up for cable, has now launched.
The service, Xfinity Instant TV, is only available to Comcasts broadband subscribers, where it aims to take on other over-the-top offerings like Sling TV, YouTube TV, Hulu Live TV and others, by offering a cheaper skinny bundle of local broadcast networks, starting at $18 per month.
The service also includes a video-on-demand library, and DVR with 20 hours of storage.
The differentiator between Xfinity Instant TV and some of its streaming rivals is that it packages all the major broadcast networks into its core offering, including ABC, CBS, CW, Fox, NBC, PBS, Telemundo, Unimas, and Univision, plus all public, education and governmental channels.
But access to top cable networks like ESPN, AMC, A&E, and Disney Channel arent in the introductory package.
This should appeal to those consumers hesitant to cut the cord because they would otherwise be missing live, local sports and news.
But it also largely appeals to those who dont yet pay for cable TV  only broadband  but struggle to find ways to watch live, local programming.
(A digital antenna can offer this, of course, but not everyone gets all the channels clearly, nor do they like the aesthetics of mounting an antenna in their home.)
Cord nevers may also avoid traditional cable because they dont want to pay for larger packages with channels they dont need.
Thats led to the rise of skinny bundles from traditional pay TV providers and over-the-top streaming service alike.
However, Comcasts is different from the skinny bundle Sling TV offers, which makes cheap access (it starts at $20 per month) to several cable channels  like ESPN  a key selling point for its base package.
Meanwhile, Xfinity Instant TV subscribers get broadcast channels to start, then can opt to upgrade their bundle to include the networks they want by buying from a mix of add-ons.
To give you an idea: a $15 per month entertainment add-on will bring A&E, AMC, Comedy Central, Discovery, Food Network, TBS, TNT and USA; the $10 kids and family add-on offers Cartoon Network, Disney Channel, MTV, Nickelodeon, and TLC.
(See bundle charts below).
Premium cable networks HBO ($15 per month) and Starz ($12 per month) are also available as optional upgrades.
The service is largely a rebranding of Comcasts existing Stream service, which has been in testing in select U.S. markets, including Boston and Chicago.
When Comcasts top video exec Matt Strauss confirmed the new services name and a few details earlier this year, he had said that the entry-level pricing would be $15 per month.
But Comcast execs later noted that the pricing was still in flux.
As it turned out, the company decided to inch up the starting price a little more.
Like many of the other live TV streaming services on the market, Xfinity Instant TV will also offer subscribers the ability to watch video-on-demand programming for the channels they pay for, and it lets them record programs to a cloud DVR.
Pay-per-view and the ability to rent or purchase movies and TV shows is not available at launch.
The service supports up to two simultaneous streams, and unlike Hulu, theres no way to pay to add more streams for an additional fee.
But with two streams, you can record two shows at the same time, or watch one while recording another.
Unfortunately, not all channels will stream when youre out of the home  a limitation that most live TV services dont have.
Thats due to the way Comcast has negotiated the rights for its streaming TV service.
(Comcast TV Everywhere rights apply here).
Instead, when youre not connected to your home wi-fi, you can only watch DVR recordings and TV Go content.
Again, the service is something Comcast is hoping to upsell to its broadband-only customers, rather than market more broadly.
Nor is it likely to lure many customers away from rivals like Sling TV, Vue, AT&Ts DirecTV Now, Hulu Live TV, or YouTube TV.
At launch, viewers watch Xfinity Instant TV via a computer, smartphone or Roku player, the website says, though the supported device lineup should improve in time.
The service is currently in beta, but will roll out across Comcasts nationwide footprint over the next two weeks.
Toyota Research Institute (TRI) isnt letting the grass grow long on its autonomous vehicle research platform: The research wing of carmaker Toyota is updating its self-driving test car to version 2.1, and its demonstrating the new architecture on a closed course for the first time ever.
The new self-driving research vehicle incorporates new perception models, enabled in part by new hardware and component suppliers including LiDAR provider Luminar, which emerged from stealth earlier this year.
The other additions to this platform include a new full cockpit in the front passenger seat for drive-by-wire control with steering wheels and pedals.
TRI says that this is useful for the research team in terms of giving them ways to study transferring control back and forth between driver and automated system.
Toyota researchers also created a new UI system that unifies visual elements and graphic language across both its Guardian and Chauffeur system, to help combine the different levels of autonomy the system can provide into one more familiar interface.
Guardian and Chauffeur represent the two different ways Toyota is looking to deploy autonomy: Guardian operates in tandem with a human driver in full control, and acting only to avoid crashes and mitigate accidents, while Chauffeur intends to offer full SAE Level 4 and 5 self-driving  meaning anyone on board is strictly a passenger, and bears no responsibility to take over control.
Both of these projects use the same tech stack including sensors and camera hardware, and this new version of the platform is the first version of its test vehicle that incorporates both Guardian and Chauffeur in one.
Its an interesting advance in terms of research because it could eventually mean that deployed vehicles with autonomous tech from Toyota could incorporate Guardian to begin with, and graduate to Chauffeur later on as the tech advances and becomes available.
When I ask around about who has the most potential to make big waves in the LiDAR industry, one name tops the list: Luminar, the startup that emerged from stealth earlier this year after five years developing its unique LiDAR architecture from the ground up.
Now, Luminar is revealing the first of its four current major partners: Toyota Research Institute (TRI), the research and development organization created by the global automaker to focus on robotics, autonomous vehicles and AI breakthroughs.
TRI is using Luminars LiDAR in its new Platform 2.1 autonomous test vehicle, having selected the solution because of its unmatched capabilities in terms of being able to see at a distance, and to also perceive objects that traditionally have very low reflectivity for laser light, which makes them a lot harder to pick up via LiDAR.
These include common objects on the road including tires, and anything else with a dark, matte surface.
When developing this product, we remained in stealth for five years, ensuring that by the time we came out we were already working with some of the best programs out there, explained Luminar CEO Austin Russell in an interview.
We now have a product that we had the utmost confidence in  something that isnt just an idea on a post-it note with some questionable physics, but actually a real-world system that we believe can truly enable these autonomous vehicle systems to finally have that better-than-human level perception.
Luminar had to got back to basics to develop a LiDAR that fit this description, and owns much of its stack, rather than sourcing anything from off-the-shelf suppliers.
It has a facility in Orlando, Florida where it has managed to recruit some of the worlds leading optical engineering talent (Orlando has a lot of that talent thanks to the aerospace industry presence there, Russell told me) and it has even acquired some of its suppliers along the way to vertically integrate all the pieces that come together to help create its LiDAR.
[Luminar] gives a company such as Toyota or TRI such a huge head start and advantage with this problem, because of the opportunity to leave everybody in the dust with this fundamentally new level and quality of data to be able to work off of, Russell said.
The way the that the software is architected and the autonomous vehicle is built out really changes when you have this new level and quality of data.
Ultimately, everyones going to have to adopt this type of platform if you want to be able to succeed in the long run.
4-6 Stanford 3 4-6 City Streets 8 4-6 City Streets 7 View Slideshow Previous Next Exit

Russell says that theres opportunity for TRI and Toyota to leapfrog the rest of the industry when it comes to the pace of its autonomous vehicle technology because of the sensing advantages that its product provides vs. other industry leading alternatives, including stalwarts like Velodyne, whose large multi-laser arrays adorn most current-generation test cars youll see on roads.
Luminas solution also uses only a single laser to achieve its class-leading results, which is remarkable in term of also offering cost and production scale benefits.
Russell says that even so, it didnt approach the problem from the angle of optimizing for cost efficiency at the sake of performance, as some competitors have done.
In the end, Russell is still very realistic about timeframes for seeing full autonomy on the road  he notes that disengagement rates for even the best performing self-driving test cars in use today are at about one in every 1,000 miles  which compares to accident rates of about one in every 1 million miles for human drivers.
Thats a large delta to make up, but Russell and Luminar think crossing the virtual Rubicon in terms of exceeding human perceptive abilities will be a big part of narrowing that gap.
Dont expect the ARKit app rush to end any time soon.
MojiLala, the betaworks-backed marketplace for emojis and emoticons, is today launching their second app.
Meet Surreal, a marketplace that lets users buy virtual objects.
The app opens up to an outward-facing camera and lets users choose animated virtual objects, which they can place in a photo or video.
Right now, Surreal only offers about 50 items, but founder and CEO Dana Loberg says that there are around 100,000 objects waiting to be added to the platform.
Eventually, the app will understand the context of the situation  if youre out by the pool, in your house, or outside in your backyard  and serve up objects that make sense in that situation.
For example, Surreal has a variety of sea-based animals like jellyfish and octopi and will serve those up to you when it recognizes a body of water.
Once a user has taken a photo or video, they can save that photo and share it across other social networks.
Surreal also has its own feed that lets users share to the platform for other Surreal users to see.
In fact, if you see a post on Surreal that you like, you can use the Mirror feature to copy the objects used in that photo or video to use yourself.
This is an expansion of MojiLalas existing offering, which is an expansive library of emojis.
Artists submit their sticker packs and split the revenue with MojiLala, or receive more visibility by participating in the MojiLala Unlimited subscription (which gives users access to a broader library of stickers for a monthly fee).
Loberg hopes that Surreal will be able to offer the same deal for artists, selling their virtual objects and splitting revenue with the artist (80 percent would go to artists, and 20 percent would go in MojiLalas pocket).
Despite the fact that brands and developers are diving headlong into ARKit, its unclear if your average consumer cares that much about it.
This may very well be a race to the bottom, the same way that Google Glass apps ended up being a big waste of time and resources.
Will the wonder of creating AR photos and videos have a lasting effect with users?
MojiLala and Surreal are set to find out.
Cloudflare has made a name for itself as a content delivery platform and security company, offering services to help keep websites up and running (sometimes running into a little controversy in the process).
Now, as the company marks its 7th birthday  it actually launched on September 27, 2010  its moving into another new area, literally and figuratively.
Cloudflare is today taking the wraps off Stream, a new service designed specifically for websites and apps that want to build businesses hosting and streaming videos, similar to what the likes of YouTube, Vimeo, and around 1,000 other sites do today.
The service is launching in beta today.
Those interested in it can sign up here.
To be clear, Cloudflare has already been working with sites that stream video  some 1 billion people already watch video through Cloudflare daily, the company tells me  but more often than not those videos are either hosted elsewhere, or they are not the central function of the sites themselves.
The idea now will be to let these sites and apps provide a more direct and vastly more simplified video service that what is in the market today, putting Cloudflare head to head with other CDNs and those who host video with an all-in-one package, and giving sites and app publishers the ease of YouTube with the power and control you used to previously only get from bespoke solutions, in the words of the company.
In doing so, Cloudflare is building out a new revenue stream for itself.
The company has raised around $180 million, and it is now is valued at over $3 billion; and now it is hotly tipped as an IPO prospect, so this would help with that.
But beyond its own financial fortunes, Cloudflare is also potentially opening up the market to a lot of more competition and video content, turning  as the company describes it  a landscape of 1,000 sites into a landscape of 100,000.
Cloudflare Stream, the company says, will offer a service that combines encoding, global delivery and a media player into one product (typically, video streaming from the likes of Akamai but also many others often sees sites taking those services from a hodge-podge of providers).
Its also removing some of the technical headache around hosting and streaming video.
You shoot a video, upload it to an API endpoint, and within seconds we make it available globally to adaptively stream via an embeddable link we provide, Cloudflare notes.
Pricing, meanwhile, will be similarly simplified: it will be based on the duration of time that people consume a video  and nothing else.
We have contacted Cloudflare for more details about it, but it seems as if they are not making this too public while the product is still in beta.
For now, the company has said that the basic premise will be to give users a pared-down, single price for everything in the video streaming chain, with a charge that includes encoding, global delivery and player.
As Cloudflare describes it, this is a big shift from how things are done today.
A typical video service could include multiple charges: from encoding companies for CPU usage based on length and quality of the video and the number of streaming formats its converted into; from traditional CDNs that charge different rates for each region of the world based on the number of bytes delivered; and from player vendors charge at tiered levels based on the number of views.
(Here is pretty decent summary of some of the challenges of hosting your own video, and also of another alternative to hosting it on something like Cloudflare.)
There are at least a few clients using the Stream service out of the gate.
Our company is focused on bringing thoughtful and easy-to-use course delivery tools to teachers and learners wherever they are, and a huge part of doing that is through video, said Mark Johnson, co-founder of Pathwright, in a statement.
Weve long been looking for a video solution that is simple to implement and seamless to use, and have not found one that checks all the boxes for us.
Were excited that Cloudflare Stream is being launched with the developer in mind from the beginning.
It sounds like exactly what weve been searching for and we cant wait to get started.
Video is held up by a lot of media and other sites as panacea for their businesses  videos are more engaging than other kinds of content, keeping people on your site for longer, and because of this, they are also a more lucrative platform when it comes to advertising.
The issue is that when you are not Facebook or Google or Twitter, building something like this from scratch can be too cost prohibitive and efficient to do.
Its smart of Cloudflare to tap into the interest in video and see how it can disrupt how things are done by simplifying the whole process on its CDN platform.
Well update this post as we learn more.
In its most recent earnings report, Adobe reported record revenue, but CEO Shantanu Narayen admitted he was a bit disappointed with the Experience Cloud results.
Thats the part of Adobe that includes the Analytics Cloud.
Today, the company is announcing an update to the analytics product aimed specifically at the lucrative retail/ecommerce market.
Perhaps its not a coincidence.
Nor is it a coincidence that Adobe took aim at retail for this specialized product.
Its a sector thats felt the sting of disruption more acutely than perhaps any other in recent years, as competition from Amazon in particular has challenged retailers and forced them to find better ways to understand their customers on and offline.
As Nate Smith, senior product marketing manager for Adobe Analytics puts it, Weve seen a dramatic shift this year in retail with dozens of bankruptcies and store closings  and its due in large part to how digital is disrupting the industry, he told TechCrunch.
As successful online retailers get more sophisticated in understanding their customers and delivering a better experience, it results in a corresponding rise in consumer expectations.
Proper use of analytics can help even the playing field.
Analytics plays a role in helping the retailer to understand who their customers are, especially who the highest value ones are and how they behave, Smith explained.
Its clear that you need to be data-driven, regardless of your business, and this is even more critical in retail, but Smith says those companies that are behind or lack maturity in their analytics approach may feel stuck or overwhelmed by the prospect of playing catch-up.
Thats where Adobe hopes to help with todays announcement.
The company has created analytics workspaces aimed specifically at the retail sector.
These templates are designed to jumpstart retailers analytics and help them to understand their customers better.
But they dont just want to show these companies how well their various online merchandizing plans have been working (or not), they want to expose gaps in the analytics strategy.
That involves helping to guide them to build more complete and smarter analytical approaches.
Specifically, templates have been designed with Adobe Sensei artificial intelligence built in with anomaly detection and contribution analysis.
This provides retailers with real-time access to data like conversion rates, product performance grids, domains driving visits and other data essential for retailers to understand their customers and how well they are doing in getting visitors from entry to purchase.
Adobe hopes the new products give those companies that are not that far along in analytics, a head start, while helping those that have more mature analytics strategies the ability to keep building on that.
Its an iterative process.
You start small and dont try to boil the ocean.
Get some data points, see a blind spot, improve and make it better.
Any type of analytical insight will help advance the ability to engage with customers, Smith said.

We havent heard much out of camp UVify since it showed us its racing drone at CES back in early January.
At the time, the company promised delivery by as early as next quarter.
The Draco is capable of speeds of up to 100 MPH, but actually getting the thing out the door has apparently been a bit less rapid.
Now, after what sounds like a decent rethink/rebuild, the palm-sized drone finally starts shipping today.
The Draco is an attempt to tap into the burgeoning world of racing drones by offering a ready-to-fly solution right out of the box.
We were pretty impressed by what we saw in the parking lot of our Vegas hotel several months back  the thing is an extremely speedy for an off-the-shelf drone and capable of some cool areal maneuvers.
At the time, the products battery didnt seem like much, though we were dealing with a pretty early demo.
Among the biggest changes to the drone from the last time we saw it in action is the move from two separate analog and digital transmission systems to a device that does both.
Analog tends to be preferred by drone racers for its stability, while digital is the preferred solution for people looking to transmit video and stills with the device.
With both on-board, pilots will have a backup system in case one conks out.
Like before, the drone is offered in a modular configuration, making it easier for users to replace pieces like the arms, in the seemingly inevitable event of a crash.
The system also features a swappable battery, because these things tend not to stay in the air for long on a single charge.
Along with global shipping today, the drone will be available at b8ta in San Francisco in the near future, so people can actually see the thing up close before buying.
At $699, the cost doesnt seem crazy, given what the little drone is capable of, but it will be interesting to see if theres a large enough contingent of hobbyist drone racers to support the project.
Not only that, but hobbyist racers who arent interested in building their own drone from components.
Those two things often go hand in hand.
Ford and Lyft are working together on self-driving vehicle technology, but the focus of the collaboration is around Lyfts positioning of itself as an open platform for future autonomous on-demand vehicle services, and likely not something that will do much to accelerate the pace at which self-driving cars are able to be safely deployed on roads.
The focus of the partnership is on laying the groundwork for a future time when Lyft users will be able to open the app and call a car, which will then come from a range of different providers operating their own driverless fleets.
Its the main purpose behind Lyfts launch of its open platform for autonomous tech, and one of the driving motivations for its Level 5 Autonomous driving center in California.
But the Ford and Lyft partnership isnt exclusive and its unlikely to be unique  in fact, its probably going to be something that proves a model for a range of similar partnerships across networks in future.
On-demand vehicle service operators could, in fact, become the cable and internet providers of the future, operating platforms that work with a range of both individually, and fleet-operator owned vehicles.
Ford is also unlikely to give up entirely on the idea of running its own autonomous driving operation  rival GM seems to be preparing for that eventuality itself, having built its own ride hailing app and network for use in San Francisco through self-driving subsidiary Cruise, which is offering on-demand autonomous rides to its employees in a limited beta test.
The automaker stands to learn a lot from operating both human-driven and self-driving test vehicles on Lyfts network, both of which it plans to do as part of this new partnership, because it has precious little experience with operating a ride-hailing service, while Lyft has plenty.
Its going to be able to glean a ton of useful information about user experience and ride planning from the partnership, regardless of what happens in the future with any commercial partnerships.
As for helping get self-driving cars on the road, this could perhaps accelerate progress  but the fact remains that were still quite a ways off from fully autonomous vehicles operating without humans behind the wheel on public roads in any kind of widespread way.
And the limiting factors are on the self-driving technology side, not the network piece of the equation.
Meanwhile, Id expect that Ford wont be the last automaker to make this kind of arrangement with Lyft  theres little to be lost from not joining up with its platform now, and a lot to be gained in terms of planning for a future where mobility looks quite different than it does today.
XO Group has acquired Veri, a startup that allows users to automatically share photos of weddings and other important events.
XO Groups flagship property is The Knot, which has been used by 25 million couples to plan their weddings.
So Veri seems like a pretty natural fit  the digital media company says it paid $3.5 million in cash for the startup.
Both CEO Michael Steib and Executive Vice President of Product Brent Tworetzky praised the Veri app, with Tworetzky describing it as a magical product  for both couples and the guests.
Steib said the acquisition allows The Knot to reach the last mile of wedding planning, so that its not just helping couples get ready for the ceremony but also preserving their memories at the event itself.
We can take this terrific app and make it available to a much broader audience, he said.
Veri doesnt replace the pictures taken by a professional wedding photographer, but using it can mean that the couple and their guests all get access to a much wider array of photos without having to do much extra.
Once users have downloaded the app and given it permission, Veri will automatically share the photos and videos taken by their smartphone cameras.
In fact, according to XO Groups internal research, couples using Veri receive between 800 and 1,000 photos of their wedding, while a wedding hashtag on Instagram only gets 22.
Veri will live by itself in the short term, Tworetzky said  but over time, there are plans to integrate it with XO Group properties, particularly The Knot.
Co-founders Lee Hoffman and Angela Kim, as well as engineers and designers from their team, have joined XO Group and are working out of its New York City office.

Late yesterday Twitter announced the unthinkable for time-pressed journalists everywhere by revealing it is testing doubling the character length of tweets.
Farewell sweet brevity of 140chars.
Hello pointless extra blah-blah-blah #280.
But why oh why is Twitter doing this?
In all markets, when people dont have to cram their thoughts into 140 characters and actually have some to spare, we see more people tweeting, wrote product manager, Aliza Rosen, in a rather wordy blog post explainer about the move  which even included a graph!
Though not a graph of Twitters user growth not growing.
(Here, I fixed Rosens explanation to fit it in far fewer characters: Were trying to fix our growth problem.)
While Rosen talked about Twitter wanting every person around the world to easily express themselves on Twitter, there was no specific discussion about how Twitters 140 constraint might be exacerbating problematic speech in the public domain.
By, for example, turning nuanced discussion into polarized arguments and irascible abuse.
Or shouty crap as a colleague more concisely put it.
(Also not in Rosens post: Any graphs detailing Twitters problem with abusive behavior on its platform.)
But even if Twitter didnt want to explicitly discuss the problem of trolls and bullies on its platform, it may be hoping the expansion to 280 characters encourages people to tweet less, well, shouty crap.
Which is indeed a possibility.
Though there is also the flip-side possibility that  for example  the current president of the U.S. will just get double the amount of newsworthy tweet space with which to threaten nuclear annihilation.
Or, to put it another way

TWITTER USERS: It would be nice if you stopped people making death threats.
TWITTER: OK, but what if those death threats could be LONGER?
Mike Drucker (@MikeDrucker) September 26, 2017

Whether Trump, with 280 characters locked and loaded, will suddenly lose the urge to tweet at Rocket Boy (10chars)  and instead feel moved to address the Chairman of the Workers Party of Korea and supreme leader of the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea (103chars) does seem rather unlikely though.
So sure, the case for 280 posits theres at least an opportunity for nuance to exist inside a (double-sized) tweet.
But the con says that really depends on whos doing the tweeting.
(Or the ttwweeeettiinngg as it should really now be termed.)
Heres my TC colleague Josh Constine demonstrating how its perfectly possible to fit a lot of high quality information into Twitters existing 140 character limit without shouting and/or being otherwise tactless/impolite.
280 character count means less confusing abbreviations & more nuance, lower skimability.
But at least it's easier for Twitter rookies  Josh Constine (@JoshConstine) September 26, 2017

Ergo, it aint tweet size that matters Twitter  its what you do with the characters that counts.
But regardless of whether 280 characters leads to a wider evolution of tone on Twitter  and in the case of Trump, when/if he gets handed the nuclear codes to #280, to a new deal on diplomacy and a less destabilized geopolitical world (we can but hope!)
@Jack & co can at least console themselves that advertisers will find plenty of uses for all the extra marketing real estate Twitter is going to be giving them.
See for e.g.
What do you plan to share with 280 characters on Twitter?
Mi (@xiaomi) September 27, 2017

So, from Twitters point of view at least, there are a fair few potential pros stacking up under the lets kill the tweet nuclear option, alongside their main concern here: Trying to assuage investors.
Pros like being less likely to be blamed for an overly concise tweet triggering nuclear war.
While disrupting the workflow of the (small) hardcore of users who rely on Twitter to be a reliably dense and largely self-manageable digital information network in an increasingly misinformation saturated and algorithmically controlled world is clearly a lesser consideration.
And at this point in the rapidly escalating story of social medias impact on democracy and society who, indeed, can blame them.
Even if more social media doesnt necessary sound like a great solution to problems being exacerbated by social media.
Whatever the social media giants say.
Tech tweets on #280

Below is a flavor of opinions on Twitters #280 experiment surfaced from the tech space  which runs a pretty full gamut of views on mega tweets  from supportive (and/or sarcastic) to indifferent to excited to horrified to snarky to creative to critical to navel-gazing to, well, hopeful that the change might finally break the addictive spell of Twitter

Cant wait for #bringback140.
We expected (and !)
all the snark & critique for #280characters.
Comes with the job.
What matters now is we clearly show why this change is important, and prove to you all its better.

Now imagine Trump using Twitter with 280 characters.
Now close Twitter.

Quite a lot of the rancor on twitter is driven by misunderstanding: no room for nuance or sub clauses.
A little more room might help that.

Take out your name, resume and any other identifying information then hop on the internet and show your skills to a recruiting manager.
Thats the way Interviewing.io does it to ensure a truly blind interview for big tech companies like Facebook and Lyft.
And, says cofounder Aline Lerner, women and minorities are flocking to the platform for that reason.
We are seeing an influx of female and other minority users because of the anonymity and not having to deal with stereotypes, Lerner tells TechCrunch.
Most of the major tech companies have been criticized for their lack of diversity in the engineering department.
Google most recently came under fire when one of its engineers suggested women were not biologically capable to handle the role.
About 20 percent of users on Interviewing.io are female, according to the company.
Not a huge number, but its still higher than the overall percentage of women working in software engineering jobs in Silicon Valley.
The bigger piece of the pie  40 percent  are non-traditional engineers, meaning older folks and those who didnt graduate at a top university.
Interviewing.io levels the playing field for these workers by allowing them to log on, pick a time slot and start anonymously practicing their skills for evaluation in front of an engineer contracted with the company to identify top performers.
If they pass, the job seeker can then go on for a similar interview with a recruiter who will evaluate them based on a set of tasks given.
The person evaluating them on the other end doesnt know anything else about the person trying out other than whether or not they are able to complete the task assigned.
Assuming all goes well with the evaluation, the person hoping for a job might then be asked to come in for an interview  of course, theyll likely still need to meet with the company face-to-face but the startup eliminates at least one major hurdle for minorities and the marginalized by getting that interview based on merit rather than privilege.
Lerner, who worked as a software engineer before starting her own recruiting firm, knows all too well the struggle women face in the job hunt.
One of the main issues is companies rely on recruiters whether in-house or otherwise.
Theyre doing the best they can but they often dont have the technical backgrounds so they have to look at other things like a resume or what school the person went to, Lerner said.
In light of a dire engineering shortage, that strategy doesnt make much sense.
Recalling her early days as a line cook where jobs were based on your cooking skills and not where you came from, Lerner thought up a more anonymized way to level the field and make it easy for recruiters to verify top-notch talent through an anonymized system.
Now, says Lerner, about 3,000 engineers sign up to look for jobs through Interview.io and shes been able to get Facebook, Lyft, Twitch, Yelp and other well-known tech companies to turn to her platform to bring in good engineers in a system that might weed them out otherwise.
The startup recently pulled in $3 million in seed money led by Susa Ventures, with participation from Social Capital, Ulu Ventures, Kapor Capital, TenOneTen Ventures, Manifest Investment Partners, and others.
Lerner says she plans to use the new funds to continue growing the company and to launch a new university platform, out today, which will enable recruiters to find young, eager college talent

We just want to create a system where anyone can show what they can do, Lerner said.
Theres a lot of talk about employees wanting much more flexible work schedules, and a lot of that is thanks to the emergence of companies like Lyft and Uber that allow people to work on their own schedules.
But that ability still doesnt exist for the rest of the world, especially when it comes to hourly jobs with rigid schedules.
But that doesnt mean that employees dont want those kinds of schedules  or that they vary a lot  and thats the reason why Sanish Mondkar started Legion.
The startup uses large amounts of data, all the way down to the weather near a store, to try to predict how busy it will be and how to intelligently staff that store and prepare for the foot traffic.
It also works to sort out the best possible schedule for each employee, whether they want to work a regular shift at the same hours or vary from week to week and trade shifts a lot.
The company is rolling out with Philz, one of Silicon Valleys favorite coffee projects, to try to prove out such a concept.
You can recognize the fact that there are some employees on your roster that are looking for predictable, 40 hours a week, with full benefits, Mondkar said.
Others, today especially, are on the opposite side of the spectrum and want gig-like jobs, owning their schedule.
Legion lets you provide that full spectrum of options.
Employees choose where they want to be on that spectrum.
It leads to better retention, an empowered culture, that to me is very important going forward for any business that employs a large hourly workforce.
To continue to roll this out, Legion has raised a $10.5 million series A led by Norwest Venture Partners, with Norwests Sean Jacobsohn joining the board.
Earlier investors First Round Capital, XYZ Ventures, and Webb Investment Network also participated in the financing round, which has helped flush the enterprise startup with the kinds of capital it needs to expand beyond just a business like Philz and into the larger hourly retail field.
Legions goal at the end of the day is to try to accurately predict traffic and labor forecasts, helping each employee find the slot that fits them best for the schedule and lifestyle they want.
By starting there, Mondkar wants to try to help employees feel better about their jobs and their lives  which, in the end, helps them be happier at their jobs and deliver a better experience to customers.
While there may have been some stabs at intelligent scheduling, its largely been on the managers to spend the nearly dozen hours to ensure that everyone gets what they want.
The solution you would design today, versus three or even five years ago, would be very different because the kinds of enablers that are uniquely available today, Mondkar said.
Machine learning and AI is at a point thats at least accessible in a form that can be applied to solve these problems.
Both need a lot of data, and data now  especially in retail thanks to the adoption of cloud point of sale devices and traffic counters  is available that just wasnt available three or five years ago that would drive these algorithms.
For starters, the company has begun deploying in Philz as a proof-of-concept to show that it ends up having a positive impact on the workforce.
Philz CEO Jacob Jaber wasnt able to articulate exactly why it took up until recently for a product like Legion to exist, but said it was an issue for the company  and any retail company  that was dying for some kind help.
The other part of the equation, he said, was that it had to be constructed with all sides in mind: the business, the manager, and the employee.
You need to think more holistically and you have to have empathy for multiple parties, Jaber said.
Id say there hasnt been a lot of progress in the workforce as a whole and I think theyve been left behind to some extent and working class.
I think [businesses] are now getting to scratch the surface in thinking about them more and how we can make sure as a company and as people were respecting them and giving them a very good environment to work and grow in.
Scheduling is a really big part of that.
There will, of course, be challenges for Legion.
Over time, employee priorities may change and the service will have to keep up with that.
It makes sense for Legion to plug into other HR dashboards like Zenefits for now, but they may see the opportunity to go after the problem with a robust set of data on employees.
There are also a lot of startups trying to create a simple employee scheduling application, such as When I Work, that may see an opportunity in the low-hanging fruit that large public data sets and more accessible machine learning tools have to offer.
Mondkars hope is that starting with Philz as a launching point and eventually gunning for a schedule that fits everyones needs automatically will be the one that wins in the end.
This is basically a very large problem that impacts a lot of lives and a lot of people, Mondkar said.
The core of that problem, scheduling and matching people optimally and in a consistent manner, is a very fundamental step toward solving that problem.
Today, as I was saying before, approaching that problem in a whole new way makes a lot of sense.
Im never not going to feel a pang of sadness thinking about the fact that kids these days require activity trackers to move, but thats just the world we live in.
Garmin got into the market roughly this time last year with the Vivofit Jr., with the promise of getting kids off the couch and into the world, because Pokemon Go cant do all the heavy lifting.
This time around, the companys got a powerful ally in its battle against childhood obesity.
Garmin has enlisted the intellectual property powerhouse of Disney to add some flare to the Vivofit Jr., for three distinct storylines designed to up engagement.Theres a Minnie Mouse band, a Star Wars edition with The Force Awakens favorite BB-8 and an Avengers version featuring Captain America.
Each works with a corresponding mobile app that sends kids out on adventures (read: gets them off their butts), with a goal of an hours worth of active time each day.
The Minnie band asks kids to plan a surprise birthday party for Mickey Mouse, the Star Wars edition revolves around adventures on the planet Jakku, and the Avengers version tasks kids with saving New York City from Ultron, naturally.
Im not going to lie, they look more fun than the fitness bands Ive been testing lately.
Sadly, Im pretty sure they wont fit my wrist, though they do come in two kid-friendly sizes.
Parents can monitor activity from the app and assign reminders for things like chores, homework and brushing their teeth.
The trackers are water resistant for swimming and apparently get around a years worth of battery life.
Vivofit Jr. runs $100 and additional bands run $30.
Theyre definitely not the most affordable kid-friendly fitness trackers, but they do appear to be one of the more engaging.
Also Captain America.
Its still a bit of a bummer that this is what it takes to get kids moving, but hey, who can stay mad at Captain America?
Today, yet another subscription service joins the pack.
Sofia Vergara and Renata Blacks EBY underwear enterprise has just gone live, letting users sign up to receive three pairs of new underwear every three months.
But EBY is much more than your average subscription service.
Just as Warby Parker and Lemonade built a layer of social good right into their businesses, EBY is also using tech for good.
The company will give ten percent of its net sales to the Seven Bar Foundation.
Through Seven Bar Foundation, Eby will be offering micro-loans to underprivileged women across the globe to help start or grow a business.
This can range anywhere from $80 to up to $2,600.
As each woman becomes self-sufficient, her loan is repaid and passed to another woman, creating a multiplier effect and breaking the cycle of poverty, according to the release.
As far as the product is concerned, EBY lets users choose between just thongs, cheekies and briefs, or a mix.
Customers can also choose neutrals, colors and patterns, or a combination of the two.
Its creating the perfect combination, said Sofia Vergara in a TC interview in August.
Theres nothing to be ashamed of when youre being seductive, but women can do it all now.
We can have it all.
And this is the perfect example of spending money to treat yourself while helping other women.
Three pairs of underwear every three months will cost $48, which equals out to $16 per pair.
For reference, you can get bikini panties at the Gap for $9/pair, whereas Calvin Klein underwear costs $22/pair.
The company says that its product is closer to the high-end when it comes to quality, and products are available in sizes from XS to 4X.
Eventually, according to the press release, EBY will sell different subscriptions, letting you get more than one pair a month.
Everything is being done on the phone or the computer, Vergara said.
You dont need to leave the house to shop anymore.
Unlike Uber and Chinas Didi, Lyft isnt developing its own self-driving cars.
But the U.S. company sure is signing up major names to help it bridge the gap.
This week it announced Ford as its latest autonomous car partner.
Ford joins big names Jaguar, GM and Alphabets Waymo as well startups Nutonomy and Drive.ai as Lyft allies.
Recently recognized as top of the industry when it comes to self-driving cars, Ford said recently that it is committed to working with partners to bring its vehicles to market in ways that actually help consumers.
One such early partner is Dominos Pizza  because self-driving cars for pizza deliveries  while has been testing the social aspect of self-driving cars through an interesting trial that featured a man driving a car while disguised as a seat.
Taxis is an obvious areas for the company to push into, but there isnt likely to be any immediate impact.
The duo appear to be taking a slow and steady wins the race approach.
Thats according to a blog post from Fords Sherif Marakby  who heads up autonomous and electric vehicles within the automotive giant  which also appeared to pour shade on Uber, which is also his former employer:

Some view the opportunity with self-driving vehicles as a race to be first.
But we are focusing our efforts on building a service based around actual peoples needs and wants.
We are placing a high priority on safety and dependability so customers will trust the experience that our self-driving technology will one day enable.
2017 has been a year of progress for Lyft, achieved in no small measure thanks to a series of disasters for Uber.
Lyft reached one million daily rides in July and, while that lags Ubers daily average of 5.5 million worldwide, data reported by Bloomberg weeks later suggested that Lyft is actually growing faster than its rival.
Revelations of sexual harassment in the workplace, former CEO Travis Kalanick being caught of video berating a driver, and the use of a controversial greyball program to side-step law enforcement officials are among the disasters that eventual led to Kalanick quitting the company in June.

Youd think that parents being able to find stuff for their kids to do would have been a solved problem by now, but apparently not.
Indeed, the trend is towards more on-demand content on phones in this area which is why the Sawyer, based out of New York managed to close a round of financing recently, that included the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative.
The trend has now hit the UK with Hoop, the family app that helps parents discover and book whats on for their kids securing 2.4 million in a round led by BGF Ventures, the UK-focused fund.
Other investors include ustwo, the company behind hit game Monument Valley.
The key to their interest is that Hoop is aimed at parents with children 11 and under.
In other words, late millennials who now have kids.
They tend to be more demanding of their services and wont sit on Google for hours searching for activities.
They live in an on-demand world.
Hoop appeals to them because it takes privacy seriously (users are asked only for their postcode and also the age, rather than the date of birth, of their children); it uses an app to allow for location-based searching by time, distance from home and age; and there are of course lots of social features.
Launched in London in 2016, Hoop is rapidly expanding across the country with over 600,000 users and 50,000 different activities each month.
The app was picked as one of Apples Top 10 apps in 2016 and was started by the entrepreneurs behind VoucherCodes.
Even in 2017 theres little aggregation of information on childrens events, activities, and classes.
Parents and carers have to check a variety of online listings, noticeboards and council websites, while looking out for posters and flyers in public places like coffee shops and libraries.
Im sure parents will find this a familiar scenario.
Hoop helps families discover fun things theyll love to do in a few taps.
Through personalized lists of events and classes, Hoop identifies those activities best suited for children based on their age, location, and interests.
From local baby and toddler groups and family concerts to drama classes and creative workshops.
Launched in 2016 in London, Hoop has rapidly expanded this year to cover the whole of Britain, now listing more than 50,000 different activities each month.
With 600,000 parents using the app, businesses that run activities for children have a digital marketing platform to reach new customers.
Hoop taps into the multi-billion pound market for family activities and was founded by the entrepreneurs behind VoucherCodes, Europes largest coupon business, acquired by a US voucher business in 2011.
The app responds to the needs of a new generation of parents that manage their life on a smartphone.
Daniel Bower, co-founder of Hoop, says: We believe that the influence of smartphones on modern families is going to increase significantly in the next few years as more Millennials become parents for the first time.
This new generation of parents blend technology seamlessly into their lives and are confident using apps to manage their day to day life.
They have grown up using Deliveroo, Uber and WhatsApp to organise their lives, and want to manage their family time in the same way, expecting information to be accessible at a moments notice.
He says Millennial parents value experiences and activities more than accumulating items, hence why experience apps will win.
Harry Briggs, partner at BGF Ventures, said: Hoop is far and away the best mobile app for solving the age-old question of What shall we do with the children thats fun, interesting and doesnt break the bank?.
Hoop is one of those rare teams who not only have the talent and focus to build a revolutionary product, but are also on a mission to make family time more rewarding on a global scale.
Were incredibly excited to be joining them on that journey.
Fintech startup Revolut is trying so many things at once that its hard to keep track of everything.
This time, the company is partnering with Simplesurance to launch a new insurance product.
You can now insure your cell phone for 1 per week/42 per year, which represents $1.35 per week/$56.50 per year.
Most telecom companies already provide cell phone insurance options.
But they tend to be more expensive than Revoluts offering in the U.K. Revolut already talked about launching phone insurance, but today marks the debut of this new product.
Revoluts insurance covers accidental, water and operational damage everywhere around the world.
It covers cracked screen and you can start insuring your device as long as your phone is less than six months old.
You can usually get it repaired or replaced in less than 48 hours.
Revolut asks you the device youre using.
So it sounds like it could get a bit more expensive than this price tag with super premium phones.
Revolut is going to take advantage of its app to sign up new users to this new product.
You can sign up directly from the companys app and Revolut Premium users will get a 20 percent discount.
Unfortunately, you have to contact Simplesurance directly if you want to find a claim.
Under the hood, Simplesurance and Revolut work with Allianz Worldwide Partners.
Simplesurance usually works with other companies to provide B2B insurance products.
But you can also sign up to a similar phone insurance product on Simplesurances consumer website.
Simplesurance operates in dozens of countries.
So Revolut users in other countries can expect to see todays new insurance product in the future.
Atari has released more details about its upcoming video game console  and its a long way from the pioneering 2600 model that made Atari famous in the 1970s.
The forthcoming Ataribox, whose retro body will be encased in real wood, will run on a Linux-based operating system and promises a full PC experience for the TV that can handle streaming, apps, social media, web browsing and music, Atari said Tuesday.
Most connected TV devices have closed systems and content stores, Ataribox general manager Feargal Mac said in a statement.
Ataribox is an open system, and while our user interface will be easy to use, people will also be free to access and customize the underlying OS.
Ataribox owners will receive a console that is pre-loaded with all-time classic video games, as well as the capabilities to play the newest offerings from modern video game creators.
The Ataribox will cost between $250 and $300, which means it will be in the same price bracket as the Xbox One and PlayStation 4.
The console will forego the traditional development process, and instead be made available first on the crowdfunding platform Indiegogo.
Its campaign is expected to go live before the end of fall, and the console is slated for a global launch in spring 2018.
According to Ataris Mac, the decision to sell the new console on Indiegogo was made due to the platforms presence in over 200 countries, which will allow the console to reach and involve as many Atari fans around the world as possible.

BEIJINGApple Inc. has hit another production snag on its new iPhone X, say people familiar with the situationthis time over a pair of components dubbed Romeo and Juliet.
The star-crossed complication is adding to concerns about extended shortages when sales begin in early November.
The Romeo and Juliet components are yin-and-yang parts of the new facial-recognition system that will allow iPhone X owners to unlock their phones by scanning their faces, these people said.
It has taken more time to assemble the Romeo modules than the Juliet modules, they said, creating an imbalance in supply.
That has served as a bottleneck for the iPhone Xs mass production, according to one person, which could possibly crimp supplies beyond typical initial shortfalls when the phone is released Nov. 3.
This story originally appeared in The Wall Street Journal.
A small number of iPhone 8 units are experiencing a "crackling" noise in the device's earpiece, according to news reports.
Apple says a fix is coming, though.
When a call is made on the affected iPhone 8 units, the user hears a "crackling" or "static" sound, affecting the audio of the call.
Apple has acknowledged the issue, telling tech website The Verge that only a "small number" of users are affected and the problem will be fixed via a software patch.
We are aware of the issue which is affecting customers in a small number of cases, an Apple spokesperson said.
Our team is at work on a fix, which will be included in an upcoming software release.
APPLE'S IPHONE 8: HERE'S HOW MUCH IT REALLY COSTS TO BUILD

It was not immediately clear what is causing the issue, as it does not occur during every call or every FaceTime call.
Apple did not say when the issue would be resolved but it recently released iOS 11.0.1, an update to its iOS 11 operating system, which was released only a week ago.
Twitter announced that it would be testing a new feature "with a small group" that would let them send tweets of up to 280 characters, double the current amount.
"We want every person around the world to easily express themselves on Twitter, so we're doing something new: we're going to try out a longer limit, 280 characters, in languages impacted by cramming (which is all except Japanese, Chinese, and Korean)," Twitter product manager Aliza Rosen wrote in a blog post.
In a tweet, the company's CEO, Jack Dorsey, called it a "small change, but a big move" for the company.
In making the move, Rosen added that the 140 character limit "is a major cause of frustration for people Tweeting in English, but it is not for those Tweeting in Japanese."
TWITTER EXPLAINS WHY TRUMP'S ACCOUNT HASN'T BEEN SUSPENDED

Only four tenths of one percent of Japanese tweets have 140 characters, compared to 9 percent of tweets in English.
Rosen added that the company wanted to try out the change with a small group, before it made a decision to launch the feature site wide.
There's also the potential that the 140 character limit could cause some backlash for the company.
Some users wondered whether President Trump would be part of the test group.
Twitter co-founder Biz Stone said that he was not part of the test group.
"We understand since many of you have been Tweeting for years, there may be an emotional attachment to 140 characters  we felt it, too," Rosen wrote.
"But we tried this, saw the power of what it will do, and fell in love with this new, still brief, constraint.
We are excited to share this today, and we will keep you posted about what we see and what comes next."

Archaeologists have harnessed spy satellite imagery and drones to help identify the site of an ancient lost city in Northern Iraq.
Experts at the Iraq Emergency Heritage Management Training Scheme have been working at the Qalatga Darband site, which is 6.2 miles southeast of Rania in Iraqi Kurdistan.
Backed by U.K. government funding, the project involves archaeologists from the British Museum and their Iraqi counterparts.
Qalatga Darband was first spotted when archaeologists analyzed U.S. spy satellite imagery from the 1960s that was declassified in the 1990s.
Experts at the British Museum used the data to map a large number of carved limestone blocks at the site, indicating substantial remains.
A drone survey highlighted other buildings that may be buried at the site.
EXPERTS HARNESS 3D PRINTING TO RECREATE ANCIENT ARTIFACTS DESTROYED BY ISIS

The site, which overlooks the Lower Zab river at the western edge of the Zagros Mountains, is part of a historic route from ancient Mesopotamia to Iran.
Alexander the Great passed through the area in 331 B.C.
when his army was pursuing Persian King Darius III after defeating him at the battle of Gaugamela.
The site was also at the eastern edge of the Assyrian Empire in the 8th and 7th centuries B.C., according to the British Museum.
Excavations at Qalatga Darband have given archaeologists a fascinating glimpse into the life of the ancient city.
Initial analysis suggests that the city was founded by the Seleucids, who inherited the empire of Alexander the Great.
Hellenist, or Greek, influences, were still strong in the region during the Seleucid era.
The site is thought to have survived the subsequent overthrow of the Seleucid Empire, when Qalatga Darband came under Parthian rule.
A systematic collection of surface ceramics has been carried out, analysis of which has for the first time established that the site can be dated to the first and second centuries BC, explained the British Museum, in a press release.
Excavations revealed a large fortified structure at the north end of the site, stone presses that may have been used for wine production, and Greco-Roman architecture, such as the use of terracotta roof tiles.
CHRISTIAN SAINT'S BONES UNEARTHED IN MONASTERY DESTROYED BY ISIS

When archaeologists investigated a huge stone mound at the southern end of the site, they found the remains of a large building, which given the presence of smashed statuary, may have been a temple for worshipping Greco-Roman deities.
The smashed statues include a seated female figure that may be the Greek goddess Persephone and a half life-sized nude male figure that may be Adonis.
A nearby site, Usu Aska, has revealed a fort tentatively dated to time of the ancient Assyrians.
A grave cut into the Assyrian remains contained a coin dating to the time Parthian King Orodes II, around 57 to 38 B.C.
The discovery of a fort dating to the time of the Assyrian period will generate information on a corner of the empire which is virtually unknown, while the discovery of a city established in the wake of the conquests of Alexander the Great is already yielding evidence for the fundamental changes wrought by the advent of Hellenism, explained the British Museum.
The Iraq Emergency Heritage Management Training Scheme was set up in 2015 in response to the devastation wrought by the Islamic State.
SPHINX, BABOON AND CAT STATUES FOUND IN ANCIENT EGYPTIAN BURIAL

During its reign of terror, ISIS launched a series of wanton attacks on sites of historic and religious importance across a swathe of Iraq and Syria.
Last year, for example, ISIS released a video that showed militants using sledgehammers and drills to destroy artifacts in Iraqs Mosul Museum.
In 2015, ISIS took control of the ancient city of Palmyra in Syria and subsequently demolished some of its best-known monuments, such as the Temple of Ba'al.
The jihadists, who beheaded the citys former antiquities chief, also used Palmyras ancient amphitheater for public executions.
Last year, a Christian saints bones were reportedly unearthed amid the rubble of an ancient Syrian monastery destroyed by ISIS.

Microsoft has added a little spice to its Ignite conference this week, with the announcement that it will introduce Office 2019 as soon as the middle of 2018.
Office 2019 will introduce new versions of Excel and PowerPoint, as well as expanding on features like inking, letting you draw over the top of different document types.
If the news about Microsoft's quantum computing efforts didn't get you excited about its Ignite show, the announcement of a brand-new Office should do the trick.
Aimed at those who don't like the ever-updating subscription service system of Office 365, Office 2019 will bring with it a host of updates, as well as bolstering existing feature sets.
The last standalone office suite of tools Microsoft released was Office 2016, which was initially released in September 2015, so this will be the first big standalone release in nearly three years.
It will look to add a number of new features, most notably inking.
Through the increased collaboration of Microsoft's contemporary software and services, this should make it easier for different contributors to highlight what changes they have made by hand.
Microsoft also made a point of highlighting new PowerPoint animations, which should make the jobs of school teachers across the country a bit easier.
There are also new charts and formulas in Excel for improved data analysis.
One aspect of the new software that Microsoft hopes will be a major boon to IT professionals is the increased usability and security of management systems.
New voice commands could make IT professionals' work a bit more hands-free, too.
"Office 2019 will be a valuable upgrade for customers who feel that they need to keep some or all of their apps and servers on-premises," Microsoft said (via Windows Central).
As exciting as all of those new features are though, what's perhaps most interesting about this announcement is that Microsoft isn't quite ready to ditch the perpetual software license system just yet.
Although it has made great strides in transitioning to more of a software-as-a-service company in recent years, it seems a large enough portion of its user base is still keen to pay for software once and then own it for life, even if it means doing a big upgrade every few years.
Netflix is doing a pretty good job of growing its user base in homes around the world, but apparently that isn't good enough.
The streaming service wants to dominate the skies, too.
More specifically, Netflix wants you streaming its content during flights.
The problem with streaming Netflix on a flight, as with any other streaming service, is bandwidth.
In-flight Internet access is improving, but providing it for hundreds of passengers flying at 30,000 feet still has its limits.
Netflix's solution is to offer its very efficient streaming technology to the airlines.
According to Variety, Netflix is claiming it can offer high quality streaming on flights while cutting bandwidth costs by 75 percent.
That's enough to make any airline executive sit up and take notice.
The saving would be due to the mobile-encoding technology Netflix already employs to get its streams efficiently flowing on to our mobile devices.
Netflix already has free in-flight Wi-Fi deals with Virgin America, Virgin Australia, Aeromexico, and Qantas, but clearly wants to expand the reach of its service in the skies.
And I'm sure passengers won't be complaining if they are offered high-quality streams, especially during long haul flights.
The airlines can also market their flights as offering a healthy package of entertainment that's free for passengers.
For Netflix, the costs of doing this will be worth it for the potential to sign up new subscribers.
Existing Netflix subscribers will gain free access through their devices while flying, but non-members will be offered a 30-day free trial so they can be entertained during their flight (and the return journey) and hopefully decide to continue subscribing the following month.

Data is the new oil, or so the saying goes.
So why are we giving it away for nothing more than ostensibly free email, better movie recommendations, and more accurate search results?
It's an important question to ask in a world where the accumulation and scraping of data is worth billions of dollars -- and even a money-losing company with enough data about its users can be worth well into the eight-figure region.
The essential bargain that's driven by today's tech giants is the purest form of cognitive capitalism: users feed in their brains -- whether this means solving a CAPTCHA to train AI systems or clicking links on Google to help it learn which websites are more important than others.
In exchange for this, we get access to ostensibly free services, while simultaneously helping to train new technologies which may one day put large numbers of us out of business.
Viewed uncharitably, companies like Google and Facebook can appear almost like the unscrupulous oil man Daniel Plainview from Paul Thomas Anderson's 2007 movie, There Will Be Blood; offering little more than tokenistic gestures in exchange for what amounts to a goldmine.
"The defense of this practice is that these companies provide 'free' services, and that they deserve some reward for their innovation and ingenuity," Dr. John Danaher, a lecturer at the School of Law at NUI Galway, who writes about the intersection of the law and emerging technology, told Digital Trends.
"That may well be true, but I would argue that the rewards they receive are disproportionate.
The other defense is that many companies provide for some revenue-sharing agreements with more popular users, such as YouTube.
That's becoming more true, too, but it's only a handful of users who can make decent money from this."
This problem becomes more crucial in a world in which AI is threatening jobs.
According to a famous 2013 study carried out by the U.K.s Oxford Martin School, 47 percent of jobs in the U.S. are susceptible to automation within the next 20 twenty years.
Could rethinking the way that data is gathered -- and, more crucially, remunerated -- offer one possible solution?
Paid for your data

In an age in which concepts like universal basic income are increasingly widely discussed, one of the most intriguing solutions is one first put forward by virtual reality pioneer Jaron Lanier.
In his book Who Owns the Future?, Lanier suggests that users should receive a micropayment every time their data is used to earn a company money.
For example, consider the user who signs up to an online dating service.
Here, the user provides data that the dating company uses to match them with a potential data.
This matching process is, itself, based on algorithms honed by the data coming from previous users.
The data resulting from the new user will further perfect the algorithms for later users of the service.
In the case that your data somehow matches someone else successfully in a relationship, Lanier says you would be entitled to a micropayment.
In scenarios like this, a formula could easily be established to determine both where data originated and how important the data was in shaping certain decisions.
Not all data is created equal.
While some of the systems human data helps train just requires us to click a link or upvote a comedy special, other types require high levels of expertise.
One illustration of this is translating a document from one language to another.Although tools like Google Translate are increasingly effective, the reason these machines are able to work as they do is because they draw on data that was previously provided by human users.
That means taking individual words and phrases that have been painstakingly matched up previously by human translators, and then applying these micro-translations to new pieces of text.
Translation isn't about literally translating each word in turn, as illustrated by the (possibly apocryphal) story of early machine translation systems which turned, "The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak" into, "The liquor is holding out all right, but the meat has spoiled," or "Out of sight, out of mind" into "Invisible idiot."
In his introduction to the English translation of Dante's Inferno, translator John Ciardi likens good translation to playing the same tune on two different instruments.
When the violin repeats what the piano has just played, it cannot make the same sounds and it can only approximate the same chords," he writes.
"It can, however, make recognizably the same music, the same air.
But it can only do so when it as faithful to the self-logic of the violin as it is to the self-logic of the piano.
At present, translators are not paid for the overwhelming bulk of their translation tasks.
Hanna Ltzen, who translates the Harry Potter books into Danish gets paid for that particular job by a publishing house, but Google then pays her nothing if those combined 1 million+ words help make its language translation system smarter so it can translate your love letter to a girlfriend in Denmark.
With a universal micropayment system, it may be possible for certain types of data to carry higher remuneration than others -- much as a lawyer currently commands a higher hourly rate than a bricklayer.
A moral, not legal argument

While it sounds an extreme proposal, in some ways a revenue split such as this is no different to the one currently offered by companies like Apple and Google to the content creators who help prop up their services.
As John Danaher notes, YouTube personalities are rewarded for the number of viewers they can attract to their videos, because this helps make Google money.
Apple gives developers 70 percent of money they generate in the App Store, since this drives more people to use Apple's services.
Micropayments would be this, but on a more widespread basis.
The amount of money per usage of data would be tiny, but -- combined -- it could add up to a reasonable amount.
This micropayment idea isn't wholly without legal precedent, and isn't totally dissimilar to the way musicians are paid when their music is sampled by another artist.
This also once sounded an unlikely idea, but has now been the subject of successful lawsuits -- such as when German electronica band Kraftwerk argued in court that even a few bars of a drum beat was sufficient to be protected by copyright.
Precedents like the E.U.
's right to be forgotten ruling against Google show how laws are still catching up with the realities of new digital technology.
But according to John Danaher, enforcing this may be a tough legal case to argue.
"The case I would make against the practice is moral, not legal," Danaher continued.
"General rules of contract law are taken to apply to the agreements that users click when signing up for a service like Facebook.
As long as Facebook draws the user's attention to their terms and conditions, and as long as those terms and conditions do not breach public policy and unfair terms rules, they are held to be binding on the user.
In my opinion, this just shows the inadequacy of current approaches to contract law, since it is well-known that people are willing to accept even the most outlandish terms and conditions."
(During a 2014 experiment, unwitting participants in London agreed to give up their eldest child by agreeing to public Wi-Fi terms.)
This wouldn't necessarily be bad news for companies though.
While it would initially cut into the profits made by tech giants, such a scheme could also encourage greater levels of engagement with services.
If using internet services -- and therefore helping make them smarter and their creators more competitive in the marketplace -- was able to provide a living wage it would likely have a significant impact on the number of users using a particular service.
Users, on the other hand, would get a new robot-proof (for now!)
job out of the equation.Everyones a winner.
Right?
Twitter for the first time is explaining why President Trump's tweets don't get pulled when they seem to at least skirt the site's rules.
Short version: It's because he's the president.
In a blog post and series of tweets, the company said that it considers "a number of factors" in deciding whether a tweet violates the rules, including "'newsworthiness and whether a Tweet is of public interest."
Given that Trump is, in fact, president and that everything he tweets could thus be considered newsworthy, that would seem to provide blanket protection for all his tweets, notes Recode.
Co-founder Biz Stone said the company had gotten a lot of questions in particular about Trump's weekend tweet in which he warned that North Korea's leader might not "be around much longer."
North Korea considered it a declaration of war and Trump's critics thought it at least violated Twitter's rules prohibiting tweets that include "threats of violence or (that) promote violence."
The company did not elaborate on whether the tweet would have been out of bounds had it come from someone who isn't the president, but it promised to clarify its public rules soon.
"We need to do better on this, and we will."
This is the first time Twitter has mentioned "newsworthiness" and the "public interest" as part of the calculus it uses to judge tweets, notes Mashable.
"By doing so, Twitter's admitting it exercises at least some degree of editorial judgment and acts more like a media company, a label most social platforms have long tried to avoid," writes Patrick Kulp.
(Trump took to Twitter on Tuesday to discuss the NFL, specifically the Cowboys.)

Following Apple's latest event announcing new iPhones and other products, some have bemoaned the high-cost of the products.
A breakdown of the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus detail just how much it costs Apple to build the devices.
According to estimates from research firm IHS Markit, the bill of materials for the iPhone 8 is $247.51.
Apple sells the device, unsubsidized, for $699, $50 more than the starting price for the iPhone 7 at launch.
The bill of materials (BOM) for a 64 GB iPhone 8 Plus comes out to $288.08.
After $7.36 in "basic manufacturing costs" are added, the iPhone 8 Plus costs Apple $295.44 to build.
The 8 Plus costs $799, $30 more than the iPhone 7 Plus at launch.
APPLE UNVEILS IPHONE 8, IPHONE X

Most iPhone buyers do not pay the full freight for the phones.
They are purchased via a contract with a carrier which often subsidizes a part of the cost.
There is also a way to pay for the phone over time, either through Apple's iPhone upgrade program or other promotions run by various carriers.
The higher total BOM cost for the iPhone 8 Plus cant be tied to a single area or feature.
The higher cost is the result of slower annual component cost erosion tied in with additional features, Andrew Rassweiler, senior director of cost benchmarking services for IHS Markit, said in a statement.
From a teardown perspective, the biggest cost adders would be the increased NAND flash memory content and new wireless charging components.
Apple CEO Tim Cook has defended the cost of the Apple products, saying they are not only for rich people.
"If you look across our product lines, you can buy an iPad today for under $300," Cook told Fortune in a recent interview.
"You can buy an iPhone, depending upon which one you select, for in that same kind of ballpark.
And so these are not for the rich.
We obviously wouldn't have over a billion products that are in our active installed base if we were making them for the rich."
In the past, Cook has bemoaned the product cost breakdowns.
On a 2015 earnings call, Cook said that he has "never seen one that is anywhere close to being accurate."
IHS attributes the rise in the cost of the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus to several features, including the new A11 Bionic chip, the neural engine (utilized for artificial intelligence) and especially the camera components.
WILL CONSUMERS PAY $1,000 (OR MORE) FOR THE NEXT IPHONE?
"From our [bill of materials] analysis, we can see that Apple invested heavily in the camera capabilities of the iPhone 8 Plus due to the increase in component costs, said Wayne Lam, principal analyst, mobile devices and networks for IHS Markit.
Based on these investments, we expect improvements not only in the optics in the dual camera module, but also in computationally intensive requirements of the portrait lighting capture feature that rely on the graphical horsepower and neural engine (AI) of the A11 Bionic chip.
In addition to the aforementioned iPhones, Apple also announced the iPhone X (pronounced "ten"), which will start at $999 unsubsidized.
IHS has not done a breakdown analysis of the iPhone X yet, which is slated to go on sale in early November.

Some of the world's most valuable technology companies are moving into the regulated medical sector.
And now they have found an important ally from within the federal government.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration this week said that it will work with 9 companies  including Alphabet, Apple, Fitbit and Samsung  to make it easier to fast-track medical software that is deemed to be of low risk through the regulatory approval process.
The program is known as the "precertification pilot."
What that means, according to regulatory experts, is that these companies are moving from wellness (fitness, nutrition and so on) and into the medical market.
In other words, if the program proves successful, the Fitbit and Apple Watch of the future won't simply track step counts, but also screen for medical conditions so users can seek medical help before it's too late.
Of course, that will require a lot of clinical studies to prove that these tools are both accurate and sensitive.
And the companies still need to figure out whether they'll target a general population, or only those at high-risk for a disease.
CNBC reported this month that Apple is teaming up with Stanford to study whether the Apple Watch can detect a heart rhythm disorder called atrial fibrillation.
Apple is also working on other novel medical sensors for its devices, CNBC reported, including technologies to track blood glucose.
Apple rival Fitbit is also looking at some of these areas, with an initial focus on both atrial fibrillation and a medical condition called sleep apnea.
In both cases, it's not yet clear if these companies will claim to "screen for" or actually "diagnose" disease  a subtle difference, but not a trivial one.
Regulatory experts say that the participation of these tech companies in the pilot program suggests that health is a priority, rather than a temporary fascination.
"There's no point in doing this for one product," said Bradley Merrill Thompson, an FDA specialist with the firm Epstein Becker & Green.
It makes sense to get involved, he said, for companies that intend to be in it for the long term.
"That's apparently where these companies see themselves," he added.
Here is the full list of companies in the program:
When The Dodo founder and editor-at-large Izzie Lerer started her animal-focused media company, she always aimed to be a social-first publisher.
Thanks to early pivoting to online video, the company is among the top Facebook video publishers with an average of 2.1 billion views a month and runs one of Facebook Watch's most viewed shows.
"It became pretty clear [social video] was the way of the world, animal content in particular," Lerer said.
"People connect to animals visually and how they move.
Video is a pretty obvious intuitive thing for the kind of work we do."
Though The Dodo has a website, the majority of its views and traffic come from Facebook.
Its video "Kids Growing Up with Dogs" is still one of the top videos on Facebook to date at 360 million views.
And it's found success on Facebook's new TV initiative Facebook Watch with "Comeback Kids: Animal Edition," the second most watched show on the platform, according to public view counts.
The third episode  which centers around a neglected pony which is nursed back to health  is currently the most viewed Facebook Watch video at 55 million views to date.
"In the earlier days, our views were shorter, I would say sub 7 seconds," The Dodo president YuJung Kim said.
"Now we're looking at 5 to 7 minute video episodes we produce, where over 15 percent of the audience makes it to the very end.
As users familiarity with Facebook grows, we've kind of ridden that wave and set the bar higher for how long people should watch a given video."
On the outside, Impossible Foods' brand-new manufacturing plant in Oakland, California, looks like all of the other nondescript warehouses bordering the massive building.
But inside, the company's founder, Pat Brown, believes a revolution is happening.
Brown, a former Stanford biochemist, used his scientific background to create fake "meat" using the active ingredient soy leghemoglobin, which he says makes the burger appealing to meat-lovers.
"We're targeting only exclusively meat lovers," says Brown.
"Those are the only ones we care about."
The venture-backed company recently received $75 million in funding and is backed by some of Silicon Valley's top investors, including Alphabet's GV (formerly Google Ventures), Bill Gates and Khosla Ventures.
The new plant makes one million pounds of "meat" every month, which is 250 times the volume the company was producing before.
The company says demand for the burgers is as red-hot as the burgers.
The Impossible Burger is currently in 50 restaurants across the U.S., including Umami Burger and Momufuku.
Company officials say foot traffic at some of those restaurants have increased 130% because of the Impossible Burger.
Impossible Foods' success highlights the growth of the alternative proteins market, as companies like Clara Foods, Kite Hill, and Beyond Meat have all raised significant funding, according to CB Insights.
Brown has bigger plans in the works.
Ultimately, he hopes to create more food alternatives in the lab, including fish, eggs, and dairy.
"Our mission is to completely replace animals in the food system," says Brown.
Certainly, with the recent breach of their data and executives jumping ship, to say Equifax isn't popular might be the understatement of the century.
In fact, when asked for comment on the company, Andy Swan, founder of LikeFolio, a technology company that uses social data about consumers to produce investing insights, told me that Equifax is one of the most hated companies in the LikeFolio universe, posting worse consumer happiness scores than United Airlines after their recent incident involving a man being dragged from a plane.
However, apart from the direct impact of having sensitive personal data exposeddata that wasn't even given to the company by the consumersconsumers have another beef with Equifax and its counterparts and that is its shoddy business methodology and model.
Credit scores lie at the center of Equifax's model, both directly by providing them to would-be lenders and indirectly by allowing consumers to monitor those scores.
However, these scores don't make a lot of financial sense in many regards.
Based on their convoluted calculations, a very wealthy individual that doesn't use credit often could have a lower credit rating than someone who has few assets but lots of credit with low utilization.
From Equifax's own website, it lists the factors used to calculate credit scores as:

The number of accounts you have

The types of accounts

Your used credit vs. your available credit

The length of your credit history

Your payment history

Notice no mention of details you might find important in finding someone creditworthy, like say, their net worth-and this is the crux of the issue.
"Consumers don't trust credit rating agencies and don't want their financial freedom impacted by a score that can be artificially raised by something as silly as opening a third credit card account they don't want," Swan said.
And it is ridiculous.
An article at Bankrate talks about how your score is impacted by the amount of credit you have versus how much you use.
This is a fancy way of saying take on credit but don't use it.
The article goes on to say, "Even if you're paying balances in full every month, your credit score will still weigh your monthly balances" and then suggests that maybe you could pay down your balance in chunks during the course of a month!
If this all sounds like a game to you, you are not crazy, the system is.
While financial services companies are often slower to adopt innovation, it's clear that the one possible bright spot that could come from the Equifax mess could be to highlight how out-of-touch and out-of-date these current credit scores and agencies are and create a desire for more innovative ways to assess financial responsibility and creditworthiness.
Fiscal responsibility is inconsistent with taking on any more credit than you need.
Let's push for creating rankings that look at the whole, not a skewed part of your entire financial situation.

The news that music streaming service Spotify will go public later this year or early next using the relatively uncommon method of a direct listing has everyone in the tech and finance communities talking.
Even the SEC is studying Spotify's plan to skip a traditional IPO in favor of a direct public offering, or DPO.
The big questions on everyone's minds are: Why?
Will it work for Spotify?
And what does this mean for other tech start-ups looking to go public?
Before diving in, it's worth considering why a company goes public in the first place.
There are three principal reasons.
First and foremost, it's a financing transaction.
In an IPO a company sells newly issued shares to the public for cash and uses that money to run its business, develop new products, hire more people and pay off debt.
In almost all cases, companies hire Wall Street underwriters to conduct the public offering by curating investors, building the book of orders, pricing the stock and trading it after the IPO.
Second, going public provides liquidity to the company's stakeholders.
Typically, venture capital investors in the company may sell some shares in the IPO or they may distribute shares to their fund investors, who can then sell or hold their stake.
Company employees with stock or options also have a way to cash out, at least in part, either at the time of the IPO or more commonly after the traditional underwriter lock-up expires six months later.
Third, going public gives the company another form of currency to make acquisitions.
Once public, it's much easier for a company to use its own stock to acquire another company because the stock has a determined value.
Based on my conversations with various Wall Street bankers, the first rationale  raising money  doesn't apply to Spotify, because it doesn't look like the company will be selling any of its primary shares to raise cash, at least not for a while.
While some investors may be optimistic on Tesla's Model 3, one Wall Street firm is concerned over the company's ability to profitably manufacture the new vehicle.
Bernstein reiterated its market-perform rating for Tesla shares, telling investors to avoid buying the stock at its current valuation due to production risk.
"Tesla's persistent cash burn has been a major investor controversy  In fact, Tesla may be the largest public company in history to have never generated either positive annual cash flow or positive annual profit," Toni Sacconaghi wrote in a note to clients Wednesday.
"Even if we can disregard Tesla's cash burn, we continue to worry about the company's ability to deliver upon its long-term vision of profitability.
Specifically, we worry about whether Tesla can successfully build the mass-market Model 3: (1) with good gross margins, (2) with good quality, and (3) on time."
Sacconaghi reaffirmed his $265 price target for Tesla shares, representing 23 percent downside to Tuesday's close.
The analyst estimates Tesla will burn through $4.7 billion of cash this year reaching a total $10.6 billion of cash burn as a public company by the end of 2017, which is unprecedented for a nearly $60 billion market cap company.
In comparison, he cited how Amazon burned $1.1 billion of cash over three years and was generating billions of dollars of cash when it reached a $60 billion valuation.
Costco burned through $1.9 billion of cash over eight years, but its value topped out at roughly $15 billion during the time period, according to the analyst.
"We believe the essential issue with Tesla's stock is not how much cash the company burns right now, but rather how well the company can execute upon its Model 3 launch  specifically around gross margins - and demonstrate that it has a clear path to long-term profitability," he wrote.
"We are fairly bullish on the evolution of the EV [electric vehicle] market, but we worry about several near-term issues for Tesla, and would not be chasing the stock at current levels."
Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment on this story.
Its shares are up 62 percent this year versus the S&P 500's 12 percent return through Tuesday.
The company's stock rose 0.4 percent shortly after Wednesday's market open after the report.
Twitter said on Tuesday that it's testing the ability for its users to send 280-character tweets, twice the current 140-character limitation.
But you don't need to wait for Twitter to upgrade your account to take advantage of this.
Instead, you'll just have to jump through a couple of hoops.
Twitter users Rob Graham (@ErrataRob) posted the following tweets, which explain exactly how to post 280-character tweets now.
It's tricky and involves a bit of changing code in your browser and using the command line interface on your computer.
Even your author got lost along the way, though it appears to work if you're willing to put in the effort and have a bit of know-how.
If you don't want to jump through these hoops, you can wait until Twitter enables your account to send 280-character tweets.
President Donald Trump took aim at Facebook on Wednesday, suggesting the social media company was in cahoots with "Fake News" networks.
Facebook is already under pressure in Washington, where investigators and Congress are examining thousands of Facebook advertisements from the 2016 election.
Chief executive Mark Zuckerberg also recently announced plans to sell millions of shares over the next 1 years for his Chan Zuckerberg Initiative.
Its beneficiaries include programs for immigration and prison reform and affordable housing.
Facebook was not immediately available to comment on Trump's tweet.
The company's curation of news articles has drawn ire from both political parties.
Last year, Zuckerberg agreed to meet with conservative leaders after accusations that Facebook had suppressed right-leaning news.
But Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, has also pressed Facebook and other social media companies on accusations they enabled Russian tampering in the U.S. election, calling recent disclosures the "tip of the iceberg."
News organizations, too, have a fraught relationship with the social network.
While Facebook and Google offer tools for journalists, a group of news organizations has said the near-duopoly of online advertising is a threat to free press.
Zuckerberg and Trump's relationship has not seen the same public scrutiny as, say, Washington Post owner and Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos.
But one of Facebook's most influential investors, Peter Thiel, is a Trump ally.
A recent profile in Vanity Fair suggested Thiel is leaning toward more oversight of large technology companies.
(Thiel was not immediately available to comment to CNBC).
Nonetheless, Facebook's share price has risen nearly 45 percent so far this year, amid broad gains in the technology industry.
Aside from being avid users of social media, Zuckerberg and Trump have something else in common.
Zuckerberg's 2017 tour of America  often compared to a political campaign  has focused on some of the same core issues as Trump's campaign.
Zuckerberg has said he hopes to visit 30 states this year because Americans "need to find a way to change the game so it works for everyone."
Correction: This story was revised to correct Sen. Mark Warner's position on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence.
He is vice chairman.
Delta Air Lines said Wednesday that customers will be able to send free messages with popular chat platforms while in the air, beginning Sunday.
Customers will be able to use iMessage, WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger while in the air on a Gogo-equipped flight.
Gogo is a popular Wi-Fi platform that costs money, but customers won't need to pay for access to send and receive messages on those three platforms.
Standard SMS text messages, which use cellular networks, will not work.
Delta said users won't be able to send photos and videos, likely because such content could slow down the data network.
T-Mobile in-flight texts are already available on several airlines.
The appeal follows a case in October 2016 in which two Uber drivers argued to a U.K. employment tribunal that their actions were controlled by the ride hailing firm and therefore they should be treated as workers rather than contractors.
This would entitle them to benefits such as a minimum wage.
The employment tribunal sided with the two drivers, James Farrar and Yaseen Aslam.
In the judgment, Judge Anthony Snelson said that it is "unreal to deny that Uber is in business as a supplier of transportation services."
What is Uber arguing?
Uber says that it is no different from traditional taxi firms that have self-employed drivers.
The San Francisco-based company says that its drivers have a choice on when to work and that makes them self-employed.
"Almost all taxi and private hire drivers have been self-employed for decades before our app existed.
With Uber, drivers have more control and are totally free to choose if, when and where they drive with no shifts or minimum hours.
The overwhelming majority of drivers say they want to keep the freedom of being their own boss," an Uber spokesperson told CNBC in a statement Wednesday.
"Last year, drivers using our app made average fares of 15 per hour after our service fee.
We've recently invested in a number of changes, including discounted illness and injury cover, paid waiting time and the ability to cash out fares at any time."
The employment tribunal, however, countered that it's implausible that each individual driver on Uber's platform is a small business.
"The notion that Uber in London is a mosaic of 30,000 small businesses linked by a common 'platform' is to our minds faintly ridiculous," Snelson said in the October ruling.
Amazon shares are faltering this month along with many of its large cap technology company peers.
But the pullback is a buying opportunity, according to one Wall Street firm.
Wells Fargo Securities began coverage of Amazon with an outperform rating on its shares and a price target of $1,400, which is 49 percent above Tuesday's closing price.
It is also the highest target out of the 42 analysts who cover Amazon, according to FactSet.
Wells' analyst predicts the internet giant will be able to use artificial intelligence and data analysis to dominate new industries.
"Given a strong customer experience, scaled infrastructure investments, high user engagement, and lead within Cloud, we believe AMZN is among the best positioned to apply these neural network advances [artificial intelligence] across new verticals/industries," analyst Ken Sena wrote in a note to clients Tuesday.
"We see this lead in data, coupled with the company's edge in compute efficiency, as increasingly feeding insights into supply chain, for its retail, video, and other efforts, and through AWS, for its partners."
Amazon shares have rallied 25 percent this year through Tuesday, compared with the market's 12 percent gain.
But the stock is down 4 percent this month compared to the S&P 500's 1 percent gain.
Amazon Web Services has 46 percent of the "infrastructure-as-a-service" commercial cloud computing market.
He noted that the research firm IDC estimates the total public cloud computing market will grow to more than $200 billion by 2020.
Sena also predicts that the company can gain market share in the apparel, over-the-counter medicine and grocery product categories, which represent another $130 billion of potential sales in the U.S.
The e-commerce giant operates on a so-called flywheel model in which low prices, repeat shoppers and a positive experience for buyers and sellers create a self-perpetuating cycle of growth.
"We see Amazon's famous flywheel as spinning with increasingly impenetrable force, where customer experience, frequency, and data will only grow," he wrote.
Amazon shares are up 0.7 percent in the Wednesday premarket session after the report.
CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed to this story.
NFL players taking a knee to raise awareness for social injustice has turned into a controversy that might cause the league to lose money.
DirecTV, the host network for the NFL Sunday Ticket, which is a package for viewers to watch any game around the league, is going to allow some of its customers to cancel their subscriptions and get a refund if they cite the players' protests during the national anthem as a reason, according to a report by the Wall Street Journal.
Sunday Ticket is one of the NFL's premier franchises, earning it $1.5 billion a year in licensing revenue, the Journal said.
If a large number of customers cancel, it could hurt the NFL as it tries to build back up its TV ratings, which have been going down for the past couple of seasons.

How national anthem became essential part of sports

NFL is winning in fight against President Trump

Dallas Cowboys' pre-anthem compromise was classic Jerry Jones

AT&T, DirecTV's parent company, did not respond to messages left by USA TODAY Sports on Tuesday.
Controversy over players kneeling during the national anthem picked up steam after President Trump called out the league during a speech in Alabama over the weekend.
Trump then followed up over the next few days with a series of tweets.
Several NFL owners and Commissioner Roger Goodell responded by saying they supported their players' rights to free speech.
Some industry experts believe this wasn't a good move by the league.
"The NFL made the worst branding move in the modern history of sports," brand and reputation, management expert Eric Schiffer told USA TODAY Sports.
"Their move alienates conservatives who view respect for the flag with fervent love."
Still, the NFL announced ratings were up for last week's games.
The largest increase was for Monday Night Football, which saw a 63 percent increase in viewers over the same week last year.
Overall, ratings were up 3 percent for the weekend.
The Apple iPhone X is delayed because of two parts, dubbed Romeo and Juliet, that are used for facial recognition, The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday.
The iPhone X will sport a feature that allows it to unlock when a user looks at the phone, though it appears it's this compelling new function that has limited Apple's ability to build enough units.
It may also explain why Apple will begin taking orders for the phone next month before launching it in November instead of releasing it earlier this month with the iPhone 8 series devices.
The Journal said assembly of the two modules is creating an "imbalance in supply" and is a "bottleneck."
The report echoes a similar one from earlier this week, in which KGI analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said that Apple's iPhone X is facing production issues related to facial recognition technology.
CNBC reached out to Apple for comment but a spokesperson was not immediately available.
Read the full report at The Wall Street Journal here.
Reports suggesting that sales of Apple's new iPhone 8 series are weak are "excessively negative," according to KGI Securities analyst and authoritative Apple watcher Ming-Chi Kuo.
Earlier this week, Citi Research said sales of the phones are expected to fall short.
Citi cited thinner lines and quicker shipping times as evidence that demand for the new devices might not be as high as in earlier years.
Kuo said bearish reports are "overdone," according to blog MacRumors.
"We previously estimated the production weighting of new 2017 iPhone models at roughly 50% iPhone X and 50% iPhone 8/ 8 Plus," Kuo said.
"This matches what we believe is Apple's (US) estimate for demand.
At first glance, the combined first-week adoption rate for the iPhone 8/ 8 Plus might appear low (about half that of iPhone 6s/ 6s Plus and 7/ 7 Plus).
However, this is due to the fact that the iPhone X is not included, not because iPhone 8/ 8 Plus first weekend sales have been weak."
Citi suggested that sales will be lower during the fiscal fourth quarter as customers wait for the iPhone X to release in November before making a purchase decision.

Social Security numbers were first handed out in 1936 as a way to keep track of earnings history.
They were not meant to be a source of identification.
It used to say that right on the Social Security cards.
To date, more than 450,000,000 nine-digit combinations have been issued; there are about 1 billion combinations, so no need as of yet for any to be recycled.
Do you know what happens to your SS number when you die?
It's enough to know that it outlives you.
This pre-WWII relic, nine digits  no letters or symbols  is the primary target of hackers for obvious reason.
Everything about us  credit history, tax filings, insurance applications, Medicare/Medicaid applications, credit applications, college admissions applications, hospital admissions, assisted-living facility admissions, DMV, etc.
is attached to your Social Security number.
And the worst part?
We're stuck with the same nine-digit number for life.
It is very difficult to change your number, and only by meeting very strict, onerous guidelines put out by the Social Security Administration can it be done.
According to Consumer Reports, in 2014 only 249 Americans got their Social Security number changed.

Sen. Bob Corker advises his own family to avoid everything Equifax

The recent Equifax hack early this month is a case in point.
143 million people had their Social Security numbers, along with other private data, stolen.
Did you visit www.equifaxsecurity2017.com to see if your private info was stolen?
I did, and I'm on the list, which really didn't surprise me at all.
Even if you did check, thieves could save your info for years and use it down the road when you think the Equifax hack is old news.
And if you were spared the Equifax hack and think your Social Security number is secret, think again.
Among reasons given why Social Security numbers can't be changed:

An individual's entire credit history is attached to it.
It won't be updated automatically at all government agencies.
Even if you could get a new one, the old one will still be active and used for your credit and IRS history.
Basically, we're stuck with it.
U.S. fast-food chain operator Sonic said on Tuesday it had been notified of unusual activity regarding credit cards used at its drive-in outlets.
Sonic's credit card processor informed the company earlier this week of the activity, which could have affected an unknown number of its payment systems.
Cyber security blog KrebsOnSecurity first reported the news and added that the activity may have led to millions of stolen credit and debit card numbers being sold in underground exchanges.
Japanese banks are looking to launch their own digital currency called the J-Coin to wean consumers off cash.
Mizuho Financial Group is one of the institutions spearheading the move.
"The project is in the early stages, and we have just held study meetings with other institutions," a spokesperson for the bank told CNBC via email Wednesday.
The Financial Times reported Tuesday that a consortium of banks including Japan Post Bank was involved and that the J-Coin would launch in time for the Tokyo Olympics in 2020.
The Mizuho spokesperson declined to comment on the involvement of other banks or the timeline.
However, the spokesperson told CNBC that there hasn't been any approval from regulators yet and provided more details on the plans for the digital currency.
"This will be pegged with Japanese Yen, and hopefully used to make payments and transfers through a mobile phone app," the bank said.
Mizuho has been exploring the digital currency space for the past few months.
It has had a particular interest in blockchain technology that underpins the cryptocurrencies currently on the market.
Blockchain is a distributed ledger system that promises to revolutionize many processes at large financial institutions, such as money transfers and trade finance, for example.
In a rare public feud between large technology companies, Amazon.com Inc said on Tuesday its Echo Show devices could no longer play videos from YouTube because the site's parent, Google, stopped supporting the service.
The spat is the latest in Silicon Valley in which competitive tensions stood in the way of customers.
Amazon and Google square off in many areas, from cloud computing and online search, to selling voice-controlled gadgets like the Echo Show.
In a statement, Amazon said, "As of this afternoon, Google has chosen to no longer make YouTube available on Echo Show, without explanation and without notification to customers.
There is no technical reason for that decision, which is disappointing and hurts both of our customers."
Google, owned by Alphabet Inc, said instead that the development was no surprise.
"We've been in negotiations with Amazon for a long time, working towards an agreement that provides great experiences for customers on both platforms," it said in a statement.
"Amazon's implementation of YouTube on the Echo Show violates our terms of service, creating a broken user experience.
We hope to be able to reach an agreement and resolve these issues soon."
The Echo Show had displayed YouTube videos without integral features, from video recommendations to channel subscriptions.
Google has been in a similar dispute with Microsoft Corp in the past

It was not clear how many customers were affected.
Amazon only started selling the Echo Show in June, which comes with a touchscreen and responds by voice command.
Amazon's suite of Echo devices, including the Echo and Echo Dot, have outsold the voice-controlled Google Home, according to research firm eMarketer.
Amazon has ambitions to make it normal for people to control computers by voice - and to place orders for its online retail business by voice, too.
"It's a bit of a blow to Amazon," said analyst Jan Dawson of Jackdaw Research.
"YouTube is one of the big video services that they had in addition to their own.
For that to disappear means a big chunk of the possible video content you could watch on Echo Show is now gone."
The Verge, a technology news website, earlier reported the news.
Among recent tech standoffs, Amazon had stopped selling Apple Inc's TV players in 2015 because they did not support its Prime Video service.
The two finally reached an agreement earlier this year.
"Things get harder for end users because these companies can't get along," Dawson said.
Ford, which has been criticized for not moving faster to develop a strategy for developing autonomous-drive vehicles, is turning to Lyft for help in testing self-driving cars.
The automaker is partnering with Lyft by initially offering human-driven vehicles on the ride-share operator's fleet.
Eventually, Ford plans to make its autonomous-drive vehicles available to Lyft customers.
Ford's partnership with Lyft creates the unique situation where the automaker is working with a company that is partially owned by its rival General Motors.
"We don't, however, plan to put customers in them (autonomous drive vehicles) until we are certain our technology delivers a positive, reassuring experience where we can gain meaningful feedback," wrote Sherif Marakby, Ford vice president for autonomous vehicles and electrification in a post on Medium on Wednesday.
"When ready, we'll have self-driving cars operating alongside Lyft's current community of drivers to help accommodate times of significant consumer demand to ensure that transportation remains timely and affordable," he said.
The announcement comes one week before Ford CEO Jim Hackett unveils his strategy for transforming the country's second largest automaker.
Hackett became the automaker's CEO earlier this year after Chairman Bill Ford decided the company needed a new approach to compete in a world where transportation is rapidly changing.
San Francisco City Attorney Dennis Herrera filed a lawsuit on Tuesday against Equifax, the credit reporting firm which suffered a massive data breach affecting personal identifying information of 143 million people  more than half the country's adult population.
The city attorney's office said in a notice that the lawsuit was filed against Equifax for failing to protect the personal data of more than 15 million Californians.
That data included details such as Social Security numbers, names and birth dates.
San Francisco is the first city in the U.S. to sue the company over the data breach that eventually saw Equifax CEO and Chairman, Richard Smith, abruptly retire on Tuesday.
"Equifax's incompetence would be comical if the subject matter weren't so serious," Herrera said in a prepared statement.
"This company fell asleep at the switch and upended the lives of millions of people."
Equifax did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment, which was sent outside office hours.
Equifax is one of the three major credit reporting firms in the U.S.
The company said on September 7 that it discovered a breach on July 29, affecting millions, including some outside the United States.
The breach has sparked multiple investigations at the state and federal level, including the Department of Justice in Atlanta, where Equifax is based, and the Federal Trade Commission.
"The information that Equifax failed to safeguard is what people need to open a bank account, buy a home or rent an apartment," Herrera said.
"Now Californians have been put at risk of identity theft for years to come."
The lawsuit was filed in San Francisco Superior Court and it stated that Equifax violated "state law governing unlawful, unfair or fraudulent business practices," according to Herrera's office.
The statement from Herrera's office accused Equifax of failing to implement and maintain reasonable security procedures and practices, not providing timely notice of the data breach to affected users in California and giving incomplete information when the disclosure was finally made.
The lawsuit is seeking restitution for affected consumers in California who purchased credit monitoring services from Equifax before Sept. 7, 2017.
It also seeks civil penalties of up to $2,500 per violation of the law and a court order requiring Equifax to implement and maintain appropriate security procedures for highly sensitive information.
"When you're dealing with highly sensitive information, keeping your software up to date is such a basic step," Herrera said, adding the company's delay in informing users about the breach "made a bad situation worse."
"Their delay prevented more than 15 million California consumers from taking immediate action to protect themselves from the risk of identity theft and fraud," he said.
CNBC's Liz Moyer contributed to this report.
Apple told CNBC it will be releasing a fix for a disruptive sound in the earpieces of some iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus smartphones during phone calls, an issue reported by The Verge.
"Dozens" of users are reporting online that the earpieces makes a "crackling" or "static" sound that "disrupts the audio" when they make calls, the technology website reported.
The problem seems to affect both the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus across different carriers in various regions, The Verge added.
Apple said in a statement to CNBC on Tuesday that a fix is coming.
"We are aware of the issue which is affecting customers in a small number of cases.
Our team is at work on a fix, which will be included in an upcoming software release," Apple said.
Is Uber in trouble?
8:02 AM ET Thu, 27 July 2017 | 04:41

Ride-hailing service Uber said on Tuesday it will stop operating in the Canadian province of

Quebec next month, pulling out to avoid following tough new regulations announced last week.
Uber is withdrawing from Canada's second-most populous province as it also battles a decision to strip the company of its license to operate in London, the latest in a series of regulatory attacks on Uber as new Chief Executive Dara Khosrowshahi seeks to rebuild the company's image.
Uber's Quebec general manager, Jean-Nicolas Guillemette, said the company would cease operations in the province on Oct. 14.
Uber employs more than 50 office workers in the province, where more than 10,000 drivers have worked for the company, he said.
The company left room to reverse its decision, calling on the government to reconsider regulations announced on Friday that tightened up the rules of a pilot project that had let Uber operate since October last year.
"We're asking the government to renew the pilot project and let's sit down and find a solution to this," Guillemette said.
Declines in some of the stock market's highest-flying technology stocks may have investors second-guessing, so CNBC's Jim Cramer took to the fundamentals to help explain the drops.
For example, recent talk of Apple's iPhone 8 sales being worse than expected has weighed on shares of Apple as well as its suppliers.
But Cramer said the worries were overblown, comparing the stock of Apple to legendary boxer Muhammad Ali, who inspired the term "GOAT," or "Greatest of All Time."
"Apple is GSOAT, the greatest stock of all time.
Alright, it's no FANG, GSOAT, but come on, you get it," the "Mad Money" host said.
"When you flit in and out of it based on rumors, just like betting against Ali, you'll most likely lose.
Hey, you know, Ali had 56 wins, five losses, 37 knock-outs.
By my count, Apple's got a much better record."
Overall, Cramer attributed the selling in top-performing tech stocks like Apple to mutual and hedge funds wanting to rake in solid quarterly profits, not critical problems at the companies.
"Let's ask ourselves, did these high-flying tech stocks get too expensive?
You could argue that at various times, like Muhammad Ali, they're going to lose a few rounds.
Hey, listen, every stock occasionally gets knocked to the darned canvas," Cramer said.
"But then they're going to go back up, because there's no issues that I've been able to find involving the fundamentals."
Twenty years ago, the hardware economy was responsible for massive hard drives and clunky PCs.
But one VMware executive told CNBC that there's a new iteration at work.
As more and more companies turn to cloud-based solutions in order to cut costs and connect with an increasingly digital world, Sanjay Poonen, VMware's chief operating officer of customer operations, said many are embracing a hybrid approach to the new technology.
"As you think about companies and their future, they have to decide how much data center capacity they want to use now," Poonen told "Mad Money" host Jim Cramer on Tuesday.
"Some people feel they run a data center very well.
We can help them modernize it with software, and that's what we do very well.
Some of the companies say, 'Listen, I don't want to expand a lot of my data centers.
I want to use the new hardware economy.'
If you talked about the hardware economy 20 years ago it was Dell, HP, IBM, Fujitsu, Cisco.
The new hardware economy is not just those players, but [Amazon Web Services], [Microsoft] Azure, Google, IBM."
VMware, a cloud infrastructure, data center and virtualization company, recently partnered with Amazon Web Services, the online giant's cloud computing arm, to provide customers with a more integrated solution.
"If you could get the benefit of both worlds, the same tools that you've known at VMware for managing and automating that, but get the data center capacity on the fly, that's what we've brilliantly innovated here," Poonen said.
VMware's central aim is to help high-profile customers like Coca-Cola and Nike manage on-premise and private cloud operations, pair those functions with the public cloud and develop technology across the data center, the cloud and the mobile landscape.
The company's 500,000 customers include an assortment of retailers, almost all of whom use the cloud giant's AirWatch technology in their stores to help secure devices they sell, the COO said.
Poonen added that Nike plans to build out data centers and many of its "next generation, consumer-facing apps" with VMware.
"The key thing ... is to become a trusted advisor to your customer, and that's what we're doing," he said.
And when it comes to concern about a slowdown in cloud growth or companies' hesitation to make the move to "new hardware," Poonen said it's overblown, especially considering VMware's position.
"We think there's going to be a good amount of spending in the private cloud on-premise and into the public cloud.
And we feel we're one of those quintessential companies that can bridge both sides of that chasm.
And, you know, we'll have to see [what] the future holds in terms of public spending and also private spending, but we feel optimistic and that's what we've seen in both our results the last several quarters and how we look into the future," Poonen told Cramer.
"I think there's innovation to be had in tech."
The Initiative announced earlier this month that it's giving grants to three advocacy groups that argue America's rates of incarceration are an impediment to economic and human development:

The Alliance for Safety and Justice , a group launched in 2016 to reduce incarceration, "replace prison waste with new safety priorities."
Advance state reform through education and advocacy.
JustLeadershipUSA , based in New York, is "dedicated to cutting the U.S. correctional population in half by 2030," according to its website.
FAMM , based in Washington, describes itself as "the most effective sentencing reform advocacy group in the U.S.," and "fighting for smart sentencing laws."
The Initiative is also funding groups advocating for immigration reform, affordable housing and better standards for criminal investgations into sexual violence, according to a September 19 post from David Plouffe, the Initiative's head of advocacy and a former political campaign manager who helped get President Barack Obama elected in 2008.
"We believe grassroots movements are key to sustained social change.
We're committed to supporting proven and promising advocacy models grounded in community, including the six organizations we will be highlighting this week," Plouffe wrote.
The organization advocating for victims of sexual assault, called Rise, has successfully pushed for new laws in 10 states.
Declines in some of the stock market's highest-flying technology stocks may have investors second-guessing, so CNBC's Jim Cramer took to the fundamentals to help explain the drops.
"Let me give you my take on the dramatic see-saw-like action in the leaders of this market," the "Mad Money" host said.
"First, let's tackle the real cause of the weakness that started last week: technology.
Come on, you all know the epicenter here.
It's Apple."
Recent talk of the tech giant's iPhone 8 sales being worse than expected has weighed on shares of Apple as well as its suppliers.
Cramer said the worries were overblown, particularly since Apple can't possibly know how many phones it will sell before it sells them.
"Needless to say, the bias on Wall Street always seems to be not that you should own Apple, but you should trade it.
In the end, most people who try to trade Apple end up buying high and selling low  the opposite of what you're supposed to do," Cramer said.
The "Mad Money" host compared the stock of Apple to legendary boxer Muhammad Ali, who inspired the term "GOAT," or "Greatest of All Time."
Betting against Apple would be like betting against Ali, he said  odds are, you'll lose.
Cramer added that, next to other consumer product companies like Clorox, Procter & Gamble and Colgate-Palmolive, Apple's valuation is still the cheapest of the cohort.
"So, the proximate sell-off cause, at least number one?
Apple.
Now, I am saying it's been pretty neutralized.
Sure, the stock can go lower, but at these levels, it's beginning to reflect the failure of the iPhone 9, and that product doesn't exist," Cramer said.
The second issue plaguing the market is concern over a slowdown in the cloud, a central feature of FAANNG, Cramer's extended acronym for the high-flying stocks of Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Nvidia and Google, now Alphabet.
Analysts were struck by Adobe CEO Shantanu Narayen's comments in a conference call that suggested cloud growth was temporarily slowing in one line of Adobe's business.
To add to the pressure, Tesla announced a partnership with Advanced Micro Devices to build an artificial intelligence chip for self-driving cars, a relationship that could curb Tesla's existing rapport with Nvidia.
But Cramer said the market was exaggerating that loss as well.
"Remember, the cloud lives in the data center.
So if the cloud's slowing, the data center should be slowing, too," he said.
"Yet last night Nvidia announced that its new line of chips won business from three of the largest Chinese data center operators out there: Alibaba, TenCent and Baidu, which are growing like mad.
I'll match those orders against a defeat at Tesla any day of the week."
Overall, Cramer attributed the selling in these stocks to mutual and hedge funds wanting to rake in solid quarterly profits and some large hedge funds facing redemption, in which managers are required to raise capital to cover costs.
"Bottom line?
We're at the end of a good quarter in a good year, and we're seeing profit-taking and forced selling of the winners while some money's going into cheaper stocks and, when you put it that way, there's a kernel of rationality to the entire move," the "Mad Money" host concluded.
"Does it mean the selling is over in the high fliers?
Nope, it's not the end of the month yet.
Does it mean it could be over soon?
Maybe, but only when we hear all of those scary stories about crashes of yore in the month of October.
But alas, that could give you an even better buying opportunity."
Investing giant Mike Novogratz may soon join the rush of new digital asset funds as the largest of them all.
The head of Galaxy Investment Partners and former macro hedge fund manager at Fortress Investment is launching a $500 million fund to invest in digital assets like bitcoin, Bloomberg reported Tuesday, citing a person familiar with the matter.
Novogratz told CNBC he can't comment on the news due to regulations from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
When it launches, Novogratz's fund will be by far the largest in a growing world of funds investing in digital products like bitcoin, ethereum and initial coin offerings.
Financial research firm Autonomous Next estimated this summer that about 70 such "crytpo-funds" now exist.
"The pace is frantic right now," said Brian Kelly, a CNBC contributor and head of BKCM, which officially launched a digital assets strategy in July.
"This is a brand new asset class for investors and this is just beginning."
Kelly estimated the cryptofunds have raised a total of $1 billion to $2 billion so far.
His own fund has less than $50 million in assets under management and is up more than 2,090 percent since it began tracking returns in March, Kelly said.
Major draws for investors into highly volatile digital currencies are their exponential surge in price this year and their lack of correlation to traditional investment assets.
Shares of Twilio were sharply lower on Tuesday afternoon after an announcement from Amazon saying that its Pinpoint system now allows users to trigger 2-way SMS messaging.
Twilio fell 6.6 percent into the closing bell, though shares pared losses after hours.
Amazon's Pinpoint lets app managers "determine which push notifications to send, decide when to deliver the notifications, and track the results of your campaign."
(It's worth noting that AWS has had SMS texting capability through its Simple Notification Service since 2011.)
"This is a continuation of our technology partnership with Amazon.
Two-way SMS is another capability being utilized by Amazon Pinpoint as part of our existing relationship," said a Twilio spokesperson.
Twilio CEO Jeff Lawson, who used to work at Amazon, said in a tweet that he's "excited that Twilio is now helping to power engagement on @AWS Pinpoint."
Twilio was heralded as one of the major IPOs of 2016 when it went public.
But, despite some strong quarterly earnings reports, shares have fallen more than 57 percent over the past 12 months, as the company lowered its revenue expectations after its largest customer, Uber, said it would change the way it handled in-app communications, according to Drexel Hamilton analyst Brian White.
Tesla may be choosing Intel over Nvidia to make chips for the "infotainment" system in Tesla cars, Bloomberg reported Tuesday, citing unnamed sources.
Intel shares were up slightly following the news.
Intel chips will now power the on-board information and entertainment system behind the large screens in the center console of Tesla cars.
Drivers control most of the car's features through those screens.
Tesla's Model 3 sedan, for example is practically devoid of any switches or dials on its dashboard, requiring users to do just about everything through the on-screen system.
Pinterest, which makes money through advertising, announced that Target's app will use Pinterest's "visual search" tool.
In essence, it would let users who are out and about take a picture of any product and receive a list of similar items at Target.
Silbermann declined to share Pinterest's revenue figures (which would be revealed during a public offering).
But he said the Target partnership is an example of the kind of deal that supports Pinterest's massive valuation  pegged at $12.3 billion by CB Insights.
"Target was one of the earliest advertisers on the platform," Silbermann said.
"It means they've seen really good results."
Pinterest's concept  which allows users to collect and categorize images, the way one might use a corkboard  is often adopted by users planning big events like a wedding or a remodel.
But Silbermann said Pinterest's technology learns users' tastes, and generates suggestions to keep users hooked.
Earlier this month, Pinterest said it had 200 million monthly users.
Silbermann also said Pinterest's "safe" and "positive" environment  which tends more toward culture, recipes and fashion and away from politics and "memes"  has been an attraction for advertisers "over the last couple of years."
"It's been one of the reasons why we've been able to make a lot of progress with our advertisers," Silbermann said.
Its companies  especially the Frightful Five of Apple, Amazon, Google, Facebook and Microsoft, which employ a select and privileged few  look poised to systematically gut much of the rest of the economy.
And while Silicon Valleys technologies could vastly improve our lives, we are now learning that they may also destabilize great portions of the social fabric  letting outsiders wreak havoc on our elections, fostering distrust and conspiracy theories in the media, sowing ever-greater levels of inequality, and cementing a level of corporate control over culture and society unseen since the days of the Robber Barons.
People in tech have been discussing these issues since the 2016 presidential election, and they are now pushing many initiatives to broaden their industrys gains.
Just this week, many of the largest tech companies pledged $300 million for computer science education.
Still, Mr. Calacanis is offering a much more dismal view of the disruptions caused by tech  and a more radical, if also self-serving, plan for dealing with it.
To survive the coming earthquake, he advises, you need to radically re-examine your plan for the future  and you need to learn Silicon Valleys ways rather than expect to defeat it.

Most of you are screwed, he writes in Angel, arguing that a coming revolution in robotics and artificial intelligence will eliminate millions of jobs and destroy the old ways of getting ahead in America.
The world is becoming controlled by the few, powerful, and clever people who know how to create those robots, or how to design the software and the tablet on which youre reading this.
Mr. Calacanis is not wholly optimistic about where all this change will lead.
In my mind, candidly, weve got a 70 percent chance of figuring out this massive sea change without starting a full-on revolution in the streets, like we saw in Greece or Egypt, or any other place where unemployment among young adults breaks 20 percent, he writes in Angel.
Be warned: One reason that Mr. Calacanis is willing to diagnose this economic ill is that he is also selling a prescription that he claims will alleviate it.
His book is intended as a guide for getting into the business of investing in very young tech companies at their earliest stages, known as angel investing.
Mr. Calacanis is peddling a kind of populist movement for investing  he wants doctors, lawyers and other wealthy people, and even some in the middle class, to bet on start-ups, which he says is the best way to prepare financially for tech change.

I want to inspire 10,000 people to become full-time angel investors, he says.
Financial advisers I spoke to were not won over by Mr. Calacaniss advice.
They called his method indistinguishable from gambling, and they warned that the potential gains were not worth the risks.
Invest in start-ups with your fun money but not the money you are counting on for your future, advised Spencer Sherman, the founder of Abacus Wealth Partners.
Even other tech investors arent sold on Mr. Calacaniss movement.
Hunter Walk, a partner at the seed-stage fund Homebrew, said ordinary investors would be better off putting their money into public tech giants rather than gambling on small firms.
Unless youre willing to lose all your money, you shouldnt do that, Mr.
Walk said.
Mr. Calacanis genuinely believes that investing in start-ups is good advice; he has even offered his three children a chance to skip college and to use the tuition money on betting on start-ups.
His 7-year-old daughter, he said, is leaning toward taking the deal.
But like other recent populist movements, Mr. Calacaniss isnt without its apparent grifts.
Mr. Calacanis runs a syndicate, a kind of investing club in which people co-invest their money alongside his bets.
The book, he says, led to a surge in new investors on his syndicate  and if those investments pay off, Mr. Calacanis gets a 20 percent cut of his co-investors returns.
Not that hes shy about any of this.
Of course, I plan to make a great deal of money in these revolutions, he writes in Angel.

You could call his attitude chutzpah, or you could call it hustle, which is a quality Mr. Calacanis has in spades.
He grew up in a working-class family in Brooklyn and writes that he spent much of his youth wondering, What would it be like to be rich?
He got his start in the 1990s as a reporter covering the budding internet industry in New York.
Later, he helped found Weblogs, one of the early digital media companies, which, in 2005, he sold to AOL for $30 million.
Along the way, he made dozens of connections  he casually name-drops every big name in tech  and now, as an angel, he parlays those connections into deal flow, getting early access to invest in the best start-ups.
In 2009, the venture capital firm Sequoia enlisted Mr. Calacanis as one of its scouts, an informal network of entrepreneurs who look for promising companies on the firms behalf.
As part of that program, Mr. Calacanis invested $25,000 on a friends crazy-sounding tech-enabled cab company.
The friend was Travis Kalanick; the company was Uber.
And despite that companys recent turmoil, the deal has turned into Mr. Calacaniss biggest win as an angel by far, worth about $100 million on paper.

One charge against Mr. Calacaniss advice is that his wins arent widely replicable  not everyone can make a fortune off their friends billion-dollar ideas, after all.
But Mr. Calacanis isnt suggesting that people enter the angel business expecting to get rich quickly.
Look, Im going to wind up being the GOAT, he said, using internet-speak for Greatest Of All Time.
You dont read a book by Michael Jordan or LeBron James and expect to start playing basketball like Michael Jordan or LeBron James.
Instead, he outlines a careful and systematic approach for newcomers to the angel business.
He said people should start slowly, first as part of syndicates like his.
Those deals will help newbie investors get exposed to other investors and tech founders, which will bring them access to bigger and better deals.
He said repeatedly that this would take time and effort  people should be willing to spend 20 hours a week on their investments, and if they really want to hit it big, they should be willing to move to Silicon Valley.
And he is frank about the risks.
The book begins with an all-caps disclaimer warning, DONT READ THIS BOOK IF YOU CANT HANDLE LOSING YOUR MONEY INVESTING IN THE RISKIEST ASSET CLASS ON THE PLANET: START-UPS.
But to Mr. Calacanis, the risks are worth taking.
The world seems to have lost its moorings; its changing in ways that none of us can predict anymore.
So shouldnt you do something big?
As Mr. Calacanis argues: No gamble, no future.
Theyre really skating on thin ice, said Michael Bertini, a search strategist at iQuanti, a digital marketing agency.
Theyre controlling what users see.
If Google is controlling what they deem to be fake news, I think thats bias.
Despite Googles insistence that its search algorithm undergoes a rigorous testing process to ensure that its results do not reflect political, gender, racial or ethnic bias, there is growing political support for regulating Google and other tech giants like public utilities and forcing it to disclose how exactly its arrives at search results.
Most people have little understanding of how Googles search engine ranks different sites, what it chooses to include or exclude, and how it picks the top results among hundreds of billions of pages.
And Google tightly guards the mathematical equations behind it all  the rest of the world has to take their word that it is done in an unbiased manner.
The complexity of ranking and rating is always going to lead to some lack of understanding for people outside of the company, said Frank Pasquale, an information law professor at the University of Maryland.
The problem is that a lot of people arent willing to give them the benefit of the doubt.
In his book, The Black Box Society, Mr. Pasquale warned about the potential risks from an overreliance on secret algorithms that control what information we see and how critical decisions are made.
As the dominant search engine, with an estimated 90 percent global market share, Google was criticized by both the right and the left of the political world during the 2016 election.
In June 2016, a video from the pop culture site SourceFed accused Google of manipulating automatically completed search suggestions to favor Hillary Clinton.
Google denied the claim, but right-wing media seized on the video as an example that the company was tipping the scales in her favor.
In the days after the election, the top Google search results for final election vote count 2016 was a link to a story that wrongly stated that Mr. Trump, who won the Electoral College, had also defeated Mrs. Clinton in the popular vote.

In the research that led to the creation of Project Owl, Google found that a small fraction of its search results  about 0.25 percent of daily traffic  were linking to intentionally misleading, false or offensive information.
For a company that aims to deliver the most relevant information for all queries, that constituted a crisis.

Google said it had added more detailed examples of problematic pages into the guidelines used by human raters to determine what is a good search result and what is a bad one.
Google said its global staff of more than 10,000 raters do not determine search rankings, but their judgments help inform how the algorithm performs in the future.
Google has often said that it cannot reveal too much or people would use that information to try to game the rankings.
The opacity around Googles algorithm has given birth to a cottage industry of search engine optimization experts who dissect the companys comments.
To assuage criticism about that lack of transparency, Google made public its guidelines for search quality in 2013.
Pandu Nayak, a Google fellow who focuses on search quality, said disclosing the guidelines is more meaningful.

The actual algorithm is not as important as what the algorithm is trying to do, said Mr. Nayak.
Being completely transparent of what youre trying to achieve is the central goal because how you accomplish that can change.
Google said hundreds of factors go into its search algorithm and the formula is also constantly evolving.
The company said it conducted 150,000 search experiments and implemented 1,600 changes last year.
This is why its hard to pinpoint exactly why search traffic plummets for a site like the World Socialist Web Site, which calls itself the online newspaper of the international Trotskyist movement.
Mr. North, the sites chairman, said traffic coming in from search is down 70 percent since April, citing data from Alexa, a web traffic analytics firm owned by Amazon.com.
In an open letter to Google last month, Mr. North traced his sites traffic decline to Project Owl.
Mr. North said he believed that Google was blacklisting the site, using concerns over fake news as a cover to suppress opinions from socialist, antiwar or left-wing websites and block news that Google doesnt want covered.
In mid-April, a Google search for socialism vs. capitalism brought back one of the sites links on the first results page but, by August, that same search didnt feature any of its links.
The site said 145 of the top 150 search terms that had redirected people to the site in April are now devoid of its links.

They should be asked to explain how theyre doing it, Mr. North said.
If they say were not doing anything, thats simply not credible.
Mr. North said that Google has not responded to his claims.
Google declined to comment on the World Socialist Web Site.
Mr. North argued the drop-off in traffic is the result of Google directing users toward mainstream media organizations, including The New York Times.
The World Socialist Web Site claimed that search referral traffic had fallen since April at a variety of other left-wing, progressive, socialist or antiwar publications like AlterNet and Consortiumnews.
The New York Times could not find the same level of traffic declines at all of those publications, based on data from SimilarWeb, a web analytics firm.
Traffic coming from search engines for the World Socialist Web Site was down 34 percent during the months of May to July, compared with the preceding three months, according to SimilarWeb.
Traffic that did not come from search was up 1 percent during the same period.
Mr. North said his site provides critical analysis for current events and it has nothing in common with sites peddling blatantly untrue stories.
But he said he is opposed to any actions taken by Google under the pretext of stopping fake news.
Im against censorship in any form, he said.
Its up to people what they want to read.
Its not going to stop with the World Socialist Web Site.
Its going to expand and spread.
Heres a taste of what Caroline and I experienced playing the Super NES Classic Edition.
Installing the System

The console is easy to set up: Just plug it into a TV via the included HDMI cable.
After that, I had a blast exploring the dungeons of Hyrule in The Legend of Zelda and tossing TNT barrels in Donkey Kong Country.
In fact, I played so long, a creeping ache lead to worries about the onset of the dreaded Nintendo thumb.
But as fun as the retro games are, Nintendo did little to update the gameplay for modern audiences.
The Super NES Classic has no internet connection, so there is no way to compete online with friends.
(The console does come with a pair of controllers, allowing for two-player mode at home.)
And in a time of wireless technology that allows controllers to be used in any spot in a room, the Super NES Classic controllers are wired and plug into the console, which limits a players mobility and leaves a mess of cables draped over the floor.
The cables are longer than those of the NES Classic, but they are still only about five feet long.
I had to place the console on a chair in the middle of the room to play from the comfort of my couch.
Another limitation: The Super NES Classic has no slot for game cartridges, so if you hung on to your old Super NES games in the hopes of using them again, you are out of luck.
They will not work on this system.

Nintendo does offer games from past consoles for download for the Wii U through its Virtual Console service and, starting Wednesday, arcade games for the Switch through its Arcade Archives service.
Standout Features

But the Super NES Classic does have a few new and nifty features.
One is called Rewind, which lets players back up a minute or so in a game to restart difficult challenges.
And each game has four suspend points, allowing players to save a game midlevel  unlike in the original system, which forced you to rush to finish a level because your mother was calling you to dinner.
A feature called Frame also allows players to pick a border around games to fit todays wider-screen TVs.
The console also offers three display choices: the original 4:3 aspect ratio of the games, a CRT filter that replicates the same blurry look of cathode-ray tube TVs, and a Pixel Perfect mode that makes the games look crisp and clean.

Carolines Experience

Its hard to imagine that todays youth would want to play 16-bit games on an outmoded system when they are accustomed to ergonomic controllers, powerful processors, surround-sound audio and high-definition screens.
And the simple, side-scrolling gameplay of the past is no match for the interactive worlds created by augmented and virtual reality games.
So the real draw of the Super NES Classic is nostalgia.
Thats a theory I tested with Caroline.
Over the hour we played with the console together, she was drawn to the characters she recognized (Mario, yes; Samus Aran of Super Metroid, not so much).
She wanted to play Super Mario World, which she loved once she learned how to make Mario ride Yoshi.
But for a child used to touch controls on mobile devices, other games were harder.
Maneuvering Luigi around the track in Super Mario Kart proved to be too difficult, and she put the controller down after the first race and switched back to Minecraft on her Kindle.
I couldnt see what I was doing, she said of the fast and furious racing game.
Minecraft is simpler.
Bottom Line

The target for the Super NES Classic Edition is adults who grew up with the original console, which is still a big audience.
Learning a lesson after many outraged fans who sought the NES Classic last year were left empty-handed, Nintendo said it would increase inventory of the Super NES Classic this year.
It also said that the NES Classic would return to retail shelves next year.
The games of the Super NES Classic still stand the test of time as some of Nintendos finest.
But they feel trapped in the amber of an outdated console.

SAN FRANCISCO  For Lyft, winning the race to create the first fully self-driving vehicles on the road is a far from lonely pursuit.
The companys ethos is the more partners, the merrier.
That approach explains the new tie-up between Lyft and Ford Motor.
On Wednesday, the companies said they had struck a partnership to develop and test autonomous vehicle designs and technology, with the aim of putting Fords self-driving vehicles on Lyfts ride-hailing network in the future.
As part of the agreement, the companies plan to focus on issues such as software design, customer experience and user interfaces.
Were focused on partnering with the auto industry because frankly, we think we cant do this alone and need each other to be successful, said Raj Kapoor, Lyfts chief strategy officer.
Its one thing to do tests with one or two cars.
Its a whole different world doing this on a large scale.
The partnership represents another shift on the rapidly changing landscape for self-driving cars, where traditional automakers like General Motors and Silicon Valley companies including Waymo and Uber are all jockeying for the lead.

Lyft has tried to position itself as an agnostic player in the autonomous vehicle industry with its Open Platform Initiative, under which it will cooperate with car manufacturers to test their self-driving cars and use their technology on its ride-hailing network.
The self-driving start-up nuTonomy and Land Rover, among others, have already joined.
It is a significant moment for the 11-year-old Twitter, which has been trying to figure out how to change the social media service without alienating the people who have embraced its short format.
The idea of extending the length of Twitter posts has been contentious internally, batted around among product groups that are trying to find ways to persuade people to use the service more frequently.
At 328 million users, Twitter has been criticized for its inability to attract more people.
Investors have grown nervous, as that slowing of user growth has affected the companys revenue.

Last year, Twitter tried extending its character count by allowing people to post photos and GIFs without counting them against the overall character limit.
It also toyed with longer posts exceeding 140 characters, until criticism from users prompted Jack Dorsey, Twitters chief executive, to proclaim that the limit was here to stay.
Twitter is now preparing for a backlash from those who might take issue with a 280-character tweet.
We understand since many of you have been tweeting for years, there may be an emotional attachment to 140 characters, the company said.
But we tried this, saw the power of what it will do, and fell in love with this new, still brief, constraint.
The negative reaction was swift, however.
Some on Twitter proclaimed it a terrible idea.
Still, Twitter pointed to people who post primarily in Japanese, Chinese and Korean, languages with alphabets that allow the expression of more thoughts in fewer characters.
Those users tend to bump up against the character limits less often, which Twitter said leads to more frequent messages.
As a result, Twitter said, if rules around characters are loosened, English-speaking users  who tend to use more characters in tweets  will also hit character limits less frequently.
That may, in turn, lead English-speaking users to post more regularly.
The test will begin in small groups around the world.
The company has not said whether it will roll the change out to all users in the future.

Twitter said the people who will get to test the 280-character tweets will be randomly selected.
Whether that may include prominent Twitter users like President Trump is unclear.
Mr. Trump has often used Twitter to announce policy decisions, which has sometimes led to heat on the service.
This week, there was a renewed call to bar Mr. Trump from using Twitter after Kim Jong-un, the leader of North Korea, said recent inflammatory tweets from Mr. Trump should be considered a declaration of war.
On Monday, Twitter issued a statement from its policy team saying that it took a number of factors into account when dealing with violations of the companys user agreement, including the newsworthiness of the tweet.
In the end, Tweets get right to the point with the information or thoughts that matter, the company said of the 280-character tweet test.
That is something we will never change.
Jean-Nicolas Guillemette, the general manager of Uber Montreal, said on Tuesday that the company could not accept the governments plan to increase the minimum training for Uber drivers to 35 hours, up from 20 hours.
The higher level matches the rule in Montreal for taxi drivers.
Unless the government withdraws its plan, Mr. Guillemette said, Uber would quit the province on Oct. 14.
The minister is attempting to impose old rules on a new model, Mr. Guillemette told a news conference.
These are major changes.
Uber has about 10,000 drivers in Montreal.
Mr. Guillemette said that the increased training would make it difficult to recruit new drivers, particularly those who only want to work part time.
Mr. Guillemette added that Uber can provide sufficient training in less time through alternate methods.

We firmly believe that technology allows us to provide what the government wants in terms of training, he said.
Uber hopes to continue discussions with the province leading up to the deadline, Mr. Guillemette.
But if the government sticks by its 35-hour rule, he added, well need to leave.
Mathieu Goudrault, a spokesman for the transport minister, said that the 35-hour minimum would now apply to all taxi drivers in Quebec, adding that the government would not consider a lower threshold for Uber drivers.
For licensed taxi drivers, the new minimum represents a considerable reduction from the previous requirement of 150 hours.

The province also wants criminal background checks on Uber drivers to be made by the police rather than by private firms.
It will also require mandatory, annual vehicle inspections.
In London, Uber is appealing the decision by the transport authority to not renew the ride-hailing services license to operate in the city.
Mr. Khosrowshahi, Ubers chief, apologized in an open letter on Monday for the companys mistakes.
Georges Malouf, a taxi company owner speaking on behalf of the industry in Montreal, characterized Ubers decision as negotiating tactic.
Uber is not obliged to stop its operations, its only doing it to frustrate users and to put pressure on the government, he said in a statement.
He added that it now remains to be seen if the provincial government will stand up to the company or fall flat under Ubers pressure.
Taxi drivers in Montreal and Quebec City have staged several large protests against Uber.
Last October, about 1,500 cabs brought traffic in downtown Montreal to a halt.
Cabdrivers and owners also made unsuccessful attempts to obtain court injunctions to shut Uber down.
This is the kind of corporation we dont need in Quebec, said Alain Croteau, the Quebec director of the United Steelworkers, which represents most of Montreals cabdrivers.
They gave a chance to Uber with the pilot project.
The government of Quebec needs to keep its position.

Q. I thought Instagram now lets you post photos that arent in the standard square format, but its still cropping my pictures.
Also, is it changing the resolution of my original image when I upload it?
A. Instagram supports photos in the rectangular landscape and portrait orientations  as long as you switch it from the default square shape before you upload the file.
To do that, tap the round gray arrow icon in the bottom corner of the image preview.

Instagrams help guide says the service supports photos and videos only with aspect ratios between 1.91:1 (a horizontal wide-screen/landscape shape) and 4:5 (a vertical portrait shape); the traditional square shape has an aspect ratio of 1:1.
If the photo you upload is not in one of Instagrams supported aspect ratios, it will be cropped automatically.
As for the image quality, Instagram does not change the picture resolution if the photo has a width from 320 to 1,080 pixels, as long as the file is in one of the supported aspect ratios.
Small, low-resolution photos are enlarged to a width of 320 pixels when you upload them to the service, which may distort them.
Most decent smartphones these days take fairly high-resolution resolution photos  12-megapixel (or better) cameras are common now in the flagship models from Apple, Google, LG, Samsung and other companies.
The photos these mobile cameras can produce are typically much larger than 1,080 pixels wide, but if you upload a picture that is bigger than Instagrams requirements, the service resizes the image to meet the maximum 1,080-pixel width.
I bought a multicooker almost a year ago to report on for this newspaper.
I figured that after publishing my article, Id stick the machine in the basement with all the other once-in-a-while appliances (like that electric deep fryer).
Then Id dig it out for braising the occasional large hunk of meat to tender perfection, which, as I immediately discovered, it does better than any other piece of equipment  Dutch ovens and slow cookers included.
Over time, though, the multicooker became so embedded in the rhythm of my everyday cooking that I never unplugged it.
I ended up writing my new cookbook for it, Dinner in an Instant (Clarkson Potter), as well as an in-depth guide at NYT Cooking.
It was the slow cooker that went into storage, where it will remain until my next stoop sale.
What I especially love about the multicooker is its inherent flexibility, pleasing cooks of all temperaments.
Photo

If youre an organized, plan-ahead type of person, you can use your multicooker exactly like a slow cooker.
Just use the slow-cook setting with any of your old favorite slow-cooker recipes without even having to adjust them.
Culinary procrastinators, on the other hand, can take full advantage of the pressure setting, which cooks food in minutes instead of hours.
Im in the latter camp, and so this is my routine: On the way home from work, I stop at the store for some beans or grains or a package of chicken thighs.
I throw them into the pot with a mix of interesting seasonings.
Then I make a salad while the pot does its thing.
Photo

Thats it.
A satisfying dish that would normally take an hour or more is on the table in 20 to 30 minutes.

Now earthy soups, supple stews and luscious braises are within reach for winter weeknights, instead of being relegated to weekends when I have hours to let them simmer.
In the summer I can quickly cook beans and grains for salads without heating up the kitchen, or steam artichokes without having to stare at a pot on the stove.
I dont even have to be home.
No matter the season, my basic strategy for using my multicooker on weeknights remains constant: I estimate how many minutes I have before I want dinner to be on the table, and work backward from there.
Often, getting my meal done in the shortest amount of time is simply a matter of how you cut up the ingredients  the smaller the pieces, the faster they will cook.
So while a whole brisket or boneless pork shoulder might take 90 minutes to braise under pressure, beef stew meat cut into 1-inch pieces, or pork ribs cut into two or three rib sections, will be tender in 20 to 25 minutes.
Save the large, impressive, company-worthy pieces of meat for when you have more time.
You can apply the same method for dense root vegetables like beets and potatoes.
While whole roots usually need about 20 to 30 minutes to cook, slices or cubes take 5 to 10 minutes.
Because I rarely plan ahead, one of my favorite multicooker tricks is to cook dried beans on a weeknight without soaking them first.
Of course, you cant cut them up to make them cook more quickly, but you can select smaller beans.
When time is tight, buy lentils, split peas or adzuki beans, which cook from their dried, unsoaked state in under 20 minutes.
Save the chickpeas, kidney beans and cannellinis for when youve got close to an hour.
The companies have said that donating money, technology and volunteers to schools is often the only way to fill gaps in American school systems STEM offerings.
Half of all schools in the country with students in kindergarten through 12th grade, where the money announced on Tuesday is to go, offer computer science education.
In rural areas, the percentage is even smaller.
Its essential that the public and private sectors work together to ensure all American students have the opportunity to learn computer science and take part in the fastest growing sector of our economy, Michael Beckerman, chief executive of the Internet Association, a trade group that announced the new donations, said in a statement.
The money will be disbursed over a five-year period, with Amazon, Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Salesforce contributing $50 million each.
Lockheed Martin said it would donate $25 million and Accenture, General Motors and Pluralsight, an online education company, said they would give $10 million apiece.

Some companies will also donate software and other technology as part of the initiative.
Salesforce.org, Salesforces philanthropy arm, said it would give 10 software subscriptions to every school in the country.
Ivanka Trump, Mr. Trumps eldest daughter and one of his senior advisers, began organizing the effort about two months ago.
She said the $500 million in combined federal and corporate money would be directed to all schools with the goal of trying to bridge a skills divide that she said was hurting the American economy.
Ms. Trump said that six million jobs in the United States were going unfilled largely because not enough students were being educated in computer science and other STEM-related skills.
And nine out of every 10 software-related jobs in the country are outside Silicon Valley, according to Code.org, an organization working on the initiative with the Trump administration, and two-thirds of the companies that employ computer science professionals are banks, hospitals and other firms not strictly considered part of the tech industry.
Its easy to classify computer science as tech to enable getting a job in Silicon Valley or New York, Ms. Trump said in an interview, but the reality is that computer skills and coding is relevant and foundational for every sector and every industry across the economy and tech is increasingly the way we work.
Ms. Trump said the Education Department would focus its attention on grant applications related to computer science and to proposals that catered to computer science education for girls and students from minority backgrounds.
Mr. Trumps memorandum on the financing did not guarantee that $200 million in annual grants would go entirely toward computer science education.
In a news release, the Education Department said it had a goal of devoting that sum each year toward STEM and computer science education.
On Monday, Ms. Trump called 20 state governors and dozens of school superintendents to encourage them to submit grant applications.

Mr. Trumps order could take effect more quickly than an initiative the Obama administration announced last year to spend $4 billion on STEM and computer science education over several years, experts said.
Congress did not approve that plan.
The AMC deal, which brings total investment in Dreamscape to more than $40 million, calls for up to six Dreamscape locations to open over the next 18 months.
Some will be inside existing AMC theaters, and some will be stand-alone centers nearby.
Additionally, Dreamscape will open a flagship location in the first quarter of next year at the Westfield Century City mall in Los Angeles.
Westfield is another Dreamscape investor.

In many cases, we have surplus space, and we think Dreamscape will add energy and excitement to our theaters, especially during the week, Mr. Aron said.
But this isnt a replacement for movies.
Its a complement.
Tickets are expected to cost from $15 to $20.
Dreamscape joins a cluster of companies that are trying to take advantage of the still-untapped consumer promise of virtual-reality technology, the desperate need by shopping malls to reinvent themselves in the online retail age and the pressure on movie studios (and theater companies) to find new avenues of growth.
The Void, a Utah start-up, recently announced a partnership with the Walt Disney Company to open Star Wars-themed virtual-reality experiences at Disney malls outside theme parks in California and Florida.
Already operating are two Imax V.R.
Centres in Los Angeles and New York; tickets start at $7, and the Los Angeles location has attracted 50,000 people over the last nine months.
Imax said it planned to expand the concept to Canada, Britain and Shanghai this fall.
The Hollywood players behind Dreamscape give it immediate cachet.
Joining Mr. Spielberg are people like Hans Zimmer, the movie music composer, and the director Gore Verbinski.
But their involvement does not guarantee success.
Mr. Spielberg, for one, has been down this road before, with mixed results.
In the late 1990s, his DreamWorks SKG invested alongside Universal Pictures in a heavily promoted venture called GameWorks, which was supposed to use new technology to revolutionize the arcade business.
GameWorks never lived up to its billing.
Around the same time, Disney encountered similar disappointment with DisneyQuest, which was envisioned as a worldwide chain offering virtual-reality experiences.
Only two were built.
Two members of the Dreamscape management team, Walter Parkes, a co-chairman, and Bruce Vaughn, the chief executive, are very familiar with those efforts.
Mr. Parkes, a movie producer whose credits include the Men in Black series, worked for Mr. Spielberg as a senior DreamWorks executive at the time.
Mr. Vaughn spent 23 years at Disney, most recently serving as chief creative officer of its Imagineering research and design unit.

Even big-name brands can have a hard time getting people to go here instead of there, Mr. Vaughn acknowledged.

Mr. Vaughn was sitting in the Dreamscape warehouse last week with Mr. Parkes and Kevin Wall, an Emmy-winning producer of world-spanning music events like Live 8 and another Dreamscape co-chairman.
The men, together with Aaron Grosky, the chief operating officer, said Dreamscapes fate would be different, partly because virtual-reality technology has advanced so significantly.
This is truly the birth of a new storytelling medium, Mr. Parkes said.
As if to prove it, Mr. Parkes took a reporter through a prototype Dreamscape experience.
The company uses more than a dozen cameras and sensors to transport people into various settings  home plate in a sold-out baseball stadium, the spider-filled ruins of an ancient temple or a futuristic, neon-lit city flooded with water.

Inside Dreamscape experiences, which will last about nine minutes and cost about $1.5 million to $2 million to produce, participants can handle objects and  as avatars  even pass them between one another.
A shared experience is what makes the lasting emotional impact, said Mr. Vaughn, noting his track record in creating Disney theme park attractions.
Dreamscape is developing original content.
Mr. Parkes said the company was also negotiating with various studios and filmmakers to create experiences that put people inside movie franchises.
If you enjoy our experience, youll be more likely to see the movie, and vice versa, he said.
Q. Microsoft Word 2016 comes with plenty of templates, but none of them are quite what I want.
Is there a way to modify one of the stock business letters into a multipage document with my own letterhead?
A. Microsoft Word 2016 for Windows and Mac comes with a variety of page templates you can use to create different types of documents like letters, reports, rsums, brochures, labels and fliers.
If you have not found a template that suits your needs, you can modify one and save it.
You can also look in the online template library on Microsofts site at templates.office.com, or you can create your own template from scratch.
Photo

To design your own template, create a new Word document just as you normally would and set it up as letterhead with your name, address, logo graphics, headers and footers, and anything else you want.
You can insert a page break and put in placeholder text to create a multipage file.
When the document looks the way you want it, go to the File menu and select Save As.
In the Save As box in the Windows version of Word, choose the option to store the file on your computer and give it a recognizable name, as you normally would with a new document.
In the Save as Type menu, click the drop-down menu and choose Word Template instead of the regular document format.
Click the Save button to store the new template in Words folder for custom Office templates.
(In Word 2016 for Mac, go to the File menu and choose Save as Template.)
Later, when you want to use your new letterhead template, open Word.
In the Windows version, go into the File menu to New, choose Personal and select your template.
In the Mac edition, go to the File menu, choose New from Template and select your creation from the thumbnails.
A new document opens based on your template design, and this time you can save it as a standard Word document and start writing.
Facebook declined to comment, following past practice when asked about WhatsApps difficulties in China.
Lokman Tsui, an internet communications specialist at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, said that WhatsApp seemed to have been severely disrupted starting on Sunday.
But he said that some WhatsApp users might still be able to use the service.
The Chinese authorities have a history of mostly, but not entirely, blocking internet services, as well as slowing them down so much that they become useless.
The censorship has prompted many in China to switch to communications methods that function smoothly and quickly but that are easily monitored by the Chinese authorities, like the WeChat app of the Chinese internet company Tencent, which is based in Shenzhen.
If youre only allowed to drive one mile per hour, youre not going to drive on that road, even if its not technically blocked, Mr. Tsui said.
The disruption of WhatsApp comes as Beijing prepares for the Communist Partys congress, which starts Oct. 18.
Held once every five years, the congress chooses the partys leadership, which in turn runs the country.
Next months meeting is expected to reconfirm President Xi Jinpings nearly absolute grip on power, but considerable uncertainty remains over who will join him on the Standing Committee of the Politburo, the partys highest-ranking group.
Over the past several years, China has not only stepped up censorship but also closed numerous churches and jailed large numbers of human rights activists, lawyers and advocates for ethnic minorities.
The shutdown of WhatsApp prompted considerable dismay on Chinese social media.
Losing contact with my clients, forced back to the age of telephone and email for work now, one user complained on Weibo, a Twitter-like microblogging site.

Even WhatsApp is blocked now?
Im going to be out of business soon, another Chinese social media user said on Weibo.

In China, even the use of email is fading as residents embrace the convenience of WeChat.
The messaging service, which has 963 million active users, bears some similarities to WhatsApp but has a wider array of features and one crucial difference: close ties to the government.
This month, WeChat sent a notice to users reminding them that it complied with official requests for information.
When China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001, it agreed to open online data services and other enhanced telecommunications services to international competition.
But it obtained the assent of other W.T.O.
members to retain restrictions on the media.
Technology multinationals, heavily dependent on the Chinese market, have been reluctant to accuse Beijing of falling short of its W.T.O.
commitments.
The Office of the United States Trade Representative has opened a formal investigation into whether China is violating the intellectual property of American companies, but it has released few details.
The trade office has not said whether the inquiry will include the blocking of products that rely on American intellectual property, or whether it will focus more narrowly on cases in which China has allegedly purloined or otherwise copied it.
WhatsApp has a strong reputation among cryptographers for security, which may have been what drew the attention of Chinese censors.
The app provides so-called end-to-end encryption, which effectively means that even Facebook does not know what is being said in the text, voice and video conversations passing through its servers.
WhatsApps video, file sharing and other advanced features rely partly on broadly used internet data transfer protocols, and were disrupted over the summer.
But its text messaging function relies on a different, heavily encrypted method for moving data that has seldom been used by companies.
The latest disruption of the WhatsApp messaging system suggests that Chinas censorship apparatus may have figured out how to target the more uncommon and heavily encrypted data transport protocol as well, Mr. Kobeissi said.
Other services provided by American technology companies are available in mainland China.
The country tolerates Microsofts Skype service for phone calls, which does not provide end-to-end encryption and as a result is easier for governments to monitor.
Beijing also allows Apples FaceTime service, which has end-to-end encryption but does not have a WhatsApp-like feature allowing users to exchange secret codes  letting WhatsApp users combat what are known as man in the middle attacks.
By blocking the heavily encrypted WhatsApp service while making less secure applications like WeChat available to the public, the Chinese government has herded its internet users toward methods of communication that it can reliably monitor.
Residents of mainland China can still use services like WhatsApp if they first connect to virtual private networks that provide them with communications channels to servers outside the Chinese mainland.
But the government has also been cracking down on virtual private networks in recent months  and even when those networks appear to be working, they sometimes do not allow access to services that the government is particularly targeting.
Obviously I am pleased that he has acknowledged the issues that Uber faces in London, Mr. Khan said in a statement.
Even though there is a legal process in place, I have asked TfL to make themselves available to meet with him, he added, using the abbreviation for the transit agency.
Mr. Khan had said on BBC Radio earlier that Uber was not playing by the rules and had made aggressive threats to take Londons transport authorities to court.
You cant have it both ways  on the one hand acting in an aggressive manner and threatening all sorts of things, on the other hand brief to journalists that they want to do a deal with TfL, he said.
Fred Jones, a senior executive for Uber in Britain, told BBC radio that Uber was eager to meet with London travel authorities and that the company was not clear about the issues the transit agency had raised.
In its decision on Friday, the agency cited problems with the companys approach to background checks and to reporting criminal offenses.
Providing an innovative service is not an excuse for not following the rules, Mr. Khan said in a statement on Friday.
I have every sympathy with Uber drivers and customers affected by this decision, but their anger really should be directed at Uber, Mr. Khan added.
They have let down their drivers and customers by failing, in the view of TfL, to act as a fit and proper operator.

The decision was divisive, winning praise from unions and the drivers of Londons iconic black cabs, who view Uber as a threat to their business.
A petition started by Uber, which criticizes the move, has received the support of more than 750,000 people.
In it, the company accused Transport for London of wanting to restrict consumer choice and making a decision that would affect the lives of hard-working drivers.
Uber will face more scrutiny of its working model in Britain on Wednesday, when a court will hear its appeal against a case it lost in October.
A judge had ruled then that Uber drivers should be classified as employees and should be treated as such.
Uber says its drivers prefer to be self-employed.

If upheld, the judgment would drastically change the dynamics of the so-called gig economy in Britain, forcing companies like Uber to provide workers with the payment, protections and benefits to which full employees are entitled, rather than treating them as contractors.
That sometimes means going to extreme lengths to draw Mr. Bezos eye.
Is Mr. Bezos impressed?
Were energized by the response, said Adam Sedo, an Amazon spokesman.
We invited cities to think big, and we are starting to see their creativity.

For Jeff Cheney, the mayor of Frisco, Tex., a city of 160,000 about a half-hour drive from Dallas, the courtship includes offering to build his city around Amazon.
Our citys only about 60 percent built out, so weve got a lot of available land where we can build to suit, Mr. Cheney said.
We play to win.
Were innovators.
Were forward thinkers, and were serious.
City applications are not due until Oct. 19, but Mr. Cheney has already sent a video letter to Amazon.
The video opens on him holding an Amazon box and saying, Amazon, youre growing your business, and we want to grow with you.
Jerry Jones, the owner of the Dallas Cowboys, is seen talking about catching the Frisco Flu, which the mayors office said was a phrase Mr. Jones came up with.
Mr. Cheney also gets a Jamba Juice (Jamba Juice is based in Frisco).
Mayoral letters to Amazon are actually becoming a YouTube subgenre.
Mark D. Boughton, the mayor of Danbury, Conn., posted a video on Sept. 14 calling himself a proud Amazon customer and asking Alexa, the Amazon virtual assistant, where Amazon should build its second headquarters.
Danbury, a female voice responds.
It seems Alexa might be suffering a software glitch, because when Muriel Bowser, the mayor of Washington, posted a video on Sept. 15 asking, Alexa, where is the most interesting company in the world going to locate?
there was a different response.
Obviously, Washington, D.C., said Alexa.
In Canada, the selling point is, well, Canada.
Amazon has something like 9,000 engineering jobs they cant fill.
Our immigration policy is much more liberal, said Mr. Watson, Ottawas mayor.
Thats where we have an advantage.

Another city offering access to Canadian immigration as part of its deal is, surprisingly, Detroit.
Working with nearby Windsor, Ontario, which is an eight-minute drive away, Detroit is portraying itself as the best of both worlds.

Theres, you know, the immigration issue  we avoid that, said Dan Gilbert, a local business leader in Detroit who was asked by the citys mayor, Mike Duggan, to lead the effort to land Amazon.
Youve got Canada and the U.S. And people will come from all over.
Mr. Gilbert, the founder of Quicken Loans, has also built an Amazon war room, where more than 40 people are trying to analyze what the online retailer likes and doesnt like.
They are also trying to read Mr. Bezos psyche.
Hes got hundreds of hours of videos on YouTube you can watch, Mr. Gilbert said.
Mr. Gilbert is the largest private property owner in downtown Detroit, and he said he would move his tenants to temporary locations to make room for Amazon so the company did not have to wait for new offices to be built.
Competitions for factories or stadiums are typically more private, but this one is playing out in the court of public opinion, said Lauren Hitt, who is managing the public side of the campaign for Philadelphia.
The competition started that Thursday morning when he announced it, Ms. Hitt said of Mr. Bezos.
The next weeks are basically going to be a sustained campaign.

Philadelphias effort includes students from the Wharton School writing variations on the very same pitch: why Amazon should come to Philadelphia.
This was the schools idea, said Ms. Hitt.
Dozens of start-ups have also been asked to submit testimonials about the citys innovation economy and advice on how to approach Amazon.
And Philadelphia, which sent a delegation to Seattle last week, is sending a larger delegation this week to get into the Jeff Bezos mind-set and ethos, Ms. Hitt said.

The city would also consider overhauling its tax system for Amazon.
Having Amazon would mean global things for our tax system, Ms. Hitt said.
We do have business taxes, but thats something that could be looked at in the scope of Amazon coming here.
G. T. Bynum, the mayor of Tulsa, which set up its own Amazon war room in his office, echoed Philadelphias sentiment on taxes.
He said he doesnt worry at all about tax incentives going too far.
These are 50,000 jobs with the most innovative company in the world.
Whatever it takes, he said.
Tax policy experts are more skeptical of Amazons bidding process and how much cities stand to benefit.
Why are they doing this whole dog and pony show?
Amazon wants something for nothing, said Matthew Gardner, a senior fellow at the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, a nonpartisan think tank.
They would like a package of tax incentives for something they were going to do anyway.

Art Rolnick, an economist at the University of Minnesota, called Amazons bidding process  and the broader practice of cities competing for stadiums and factories  blackmail.
If you look at it from a national perspective, its zero returns.
Minnesota might win one, Wisconsin wins the next one.
The company wins each time, Mr. Rolnick said.
Its corporate welfare.
But Mr. Gardner acknowledged that many cities really had no other course than to try to win Amazon.
If you ask any mayor, theyll say their first job is to bring good jobs to the city, he said.
And Amazon is promising to bring a lot of jobs.
Joe Snell, a business leader with an economic development group in Tucson, was behind the recent shipment to Mr. Bezos of the local saguaro cactus, which he said was symbolic of the regions people.

Its a hardy plant.
It can grow up to 40 feet.
And thats Tucson, Mr. Snell said.
Were a community thats growing.
Were adaptive.
And were durable.
Amazon said it could not accept gifts but thanked Tucson on Twitter.
The company then returned the plant to the city.
That was a good outcome for the cactus, which would suffer in the Seattle rain.
Still, Mr. Snell had achieved his goal.
We wanted to cut through the noise, and they definitely noticed it, he said.
And when they choose Tucson, they can come out and experience a million saguaros.
Detailed plots involving prostitution, rape and masturbation are also forbidden.
So are displays of unhealthy marital values, which the guidelines catalog as affairs, one-night stands, partner swapping and, simply but vaguely, sexual liberation.
Despite the efforts of censors, the internet has long been the most freewheeling of Chinas mass media, a platform where authors and artists  as well as entertainment studios  could reach audiences largely free of the Propaganda Departments traditional controls on broadcasting, publishing, cinema and stage.
But the new restrictions  which expanded and updated a set of prohibitions issued five years ago  reflect an ambitious effort by President Xi Jinpings government to impose discipline and rein in the web.
They were issued by the China Netcasting Services Association, which includes as members more than 600 companies, including the official Xinhua News Agency, the social media giants Sina and Tencent, the dominant search engine Baidu and the news aggregator Jinri Toutiao.

David Bandurski, an analyst and editor for the University of Hong Kongs China Media Project, said the associations rules created the illusion of industry consensus as the companys acquiesced to what party officials call self-discipline.
Many of these companies are private, so its important for the leadership to have a means of bringing them together and creating a means of applying pressure on the collective, he wrote in an email.
It is a tactic of co-option.
Writers, filmmakers, podcasters and others attributed the guidelines and other measures to a new prim and paternalistic ideology taking shape under Mr. Xi, who has called on party members to be paragons of morality in pursuit of what he calls the China Dream.

Many also attributed the tightening of controls to official nervousness ahead of a major Communist Party congress scheduled for October.
The congress is expected to reshuffle the countrys leadership and consolidate President Xis already formidable power.
I feel like people say all the time that after the big congress, things will be O.K., said Fan Popo, a documentary filmmaker whose work has run afoul of online censorship because it explores the countrys conflicted views about homosexuality.
But then he noted how online censorship has also spiked ahead of important state holidays and following unexpected events like the death of the Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo.
Its still going on, he said, and its getting worse.
In June, the State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television announced a new rating system for online bookstores and publishers based on criteria that included upholding moral values.
The powerful Cyberspace Administration  the ultimate authority over what is online in China  also shut down dozens of blogs and social media accounts for covering celebrity news and gossip that month.

Regulators also ordered two popular video streaming sites, AcFun and Bilibili, to stop showing hundreds of foreign television programs, while other state agencies issued a new rule this month prohibiting video sites from streaming even domestically produced shows without a license.
That essentially subjects online programs  often considered edgier  to the same restrictions governing what is broadcast on television, which critics say is dominated by trifles and propaganda.
The directive also ordered online producers to submit plans for creating new dramas between now and 2021 that praise the party, the nation and heroes so as to set a good example.

The new industry regulations provoked outrage  online, of course.
The countrys leading scholar of sexuality, Li Yinhe, wrote in a scathing commentary on Sina Weibo, Chinas version of Twitter, that the new regulations violated two basic freedoms.
The first is a citizens constitutionally protected right to freedom of creativity; the second is the constitutionally protected right to sexual freedom of sexual minorities.
When Ms. Li called on people to work toward abolishing screening and censorship rules, her posts were deleted, too.

Much of the online discussion has focused on the new prohibitions of sexual content and the inclusion of homosexuality among a list of abnormal sexual relations that also included incest and sexual assault.
Critics said the regulation appeared to contradict the governments own position on homosexuality, which it decriminalized in 1997 and removed from an official list of mental disorders in 2001.
Chinas censorship agencies exercise overlapping jurisdiction over the internet and often employ policies that create confusion.
The result has been a layered system of control that begins with self-censorship by those who create online content, followed by policing by web platforms, which are often private enterprises, and finally, when necessary, intervention by government regulators or the police.
Some regulations are explicit  no depiction of killing endangered species or underage drinking, for example.
Others are imprecise.
One, for example, prohibits blurring the lines between truth and falsity, good and evil, beauty and ugliness.
Critics say the rules are meant to be so vague that the authorities can justify blocking anything, as circumstances dictate.
The tightening of content censorship is the general trend, but for content creators, they never know where exactly the lines lie, said Gao Ming, who until recently produced a satirical podcast on current affairs called Radio HiLight.
Like others, Mr. Gao acknowledged softening his commentaries to avoid trouble, trying to work around, or one step ahead of, the censors.
For profit or in pursuit of art, many performers and producers have learn to live with the partys limitations.
Ms. Song, the writer, works mostly in a literary genre known as danmei that has become hugely popular among young women.
Taking its inspiration from Japanese stories and manga, it typically involves homoerotic romances.
Songs work is often serialized, with readers paying for new chapters as they are posted on one of the biggest publishing sites, Jinjiang Literature City.
If I want to publish it, she said of her work, then I need to follow the rules.
Ms. Song, who lives in Wuhan, an enormous city in central China, said some of her chapters have been blocked because sensitive keywords appeared in high frequency.
Usually, she then edits enough of those words out to get her writing past the censors and to her readers.
Ms. Song said she was not particularly worried about the new regulations.
Authors cannot use their works to encourage or incite criminal acts, especially among younger readers, she said.
Literature, after all, has a guiding effect.
There is also the threat of Amazon, which has tried food delivery in a few markets.
The Seattle retail giants recent acquisition of Whole Foods provides hundreds of potential bases for drivers to pick up prepared food for delivery in major urban areas, where takeout orders are popular.
The number-one concern for all of these delivery companies is Amazon, said James Cakmak, an analyst at the equity research firm Monness, Crespi, Hardt & Company who follows the food delivery space.
How could Amazon use its network to crush our business?
They have the logistical network and the balance sheet to be able to compete on the price side with all of these players.
Matt Maloney, the founder and chief executive of Grubhub, said his companys focus on food orders set it apart.
Uber has built a great company focused on black car service and human transportation, but succeeding in food delivery is a different game, Mr. Maloney said in a statement.
We are known for one thing only  takeout ordering  and we have engineered our entire product around this purpose.

Both Amazon and Postmates declined to comment on UberEats.
Uber first dabbled in food delivery in Los Angeles in 2014 under the name UberFresh, offering prepackaged lunches and dinners from restaurants.
Uber also tried other experiments, like UberEssentials, a way to deliver pantry and drugstore items quickly.
If you can hit a button and get a car in a few minutes, what else can you get in a few minutes?
Mr. Droege said.

But the situation wasnt ideal, with drivers usually carting food around in a safe storage container in their car trunks.
That led to issues with food quality, and customers were unhappy when their food arrived cold.
People also wanted a greater selection of restaurants, something that competitors like Postmates provided.
In December 2015, Mr. Droeges division introduced a separate app, UberEats, in Toronto, working with restaurants to provide freshly cooked meals that could be ordered with a few touches of a smartphone button.
The service took off, and over the next 18 months UberEats expanded its sales force to bring more restaurants on board and to open in new cities.
Photo

Uber executives said UberEats, which is now in more than 120 cities, had several advantages over rivals.
For one, Uber has a network of more than two million drivers who can also deliver food.
Cars used for UberEats also do not need to pass all of the inspection standards required to carry passengers, widening the potential delivery labor pool.
(Drivers need not own a car at all; UberBike is a popular delivery method for food orders.)
Uber has also spent the better part of a decade mapping cities and finding the most efficient routes, which the company said may help improve delivery times.
And since the problems with UberFresh, it has invested in better technology and added more drivers in participating cities.
The ideal UberEats delivery has the driver arrive at the restaurant just as the food has finished cooking, and has it delivered to the customer while still warm.
What Uber has are the last-mile logistics, and thats crucial, Mr. Cakmak said.
Uber has taken the partnership approach to speed up the growth of UberEats, echoing a strategy of companies like Postmates.
Uber struck a deal with McDonalds this year to offer delivery from thousands of its restaurants.
Lucy Brady, a McDonalds executive, said on an investor call in July that the initial results of the partnership were positive.
The service has stumbled at times, including this month when it faced complaints that an ad in India  telling husbands to use UberEats so their wives could take a day off from cooking  was sexist.
The company apologized for the ad.
Uber said it had invested in increasing its UberEats sales force, as well as hiring data scientists to analyze daily information on customer orders and preferences to help restaurants improve their service or promote their more popular menu items.
For Mr. Gordon, the owner of Footprints Cafe, Ubers investments have been a boon for business.
He said the delivery service had helped his restaurant reach new customers outside its loyal Caribbean community, without spending on advertising or promotion on Facebook or Groupon, as he did in the past.
Weve employed people who just work on Uber deliveries, and have a counter just for Uber driver pickup, Mr. Gordon said.
It has definitely been worth it.
He added, The whole idea that diversity improves workplace output, its not scientifically decided that thats true.
Mr. Damore filed a labor complaint against Google in August and said more than 20 people had reached out about joining together for a class-action suit about systemic discrimination against men.
He is represented by Harmeet Dhillon, a local firebrand lawyer.
Its become fashionable in Silicon Valley for people like James, a white man, to be put into a category of less desirable for promotion and advancement, Ms. Dhillon said.
Some companies have hiring goals like Well give you a bonus if youre a hiring manager and you hire 70 percent women to this organization.
Thats illegal.

Google declined to comment.
Two men who worked at Yahoo sued the company for gender discrimination last year.
Their lawyer, Jon Parsons, said the female leadership  Yahoos chief executive was Marissa Mayer, before Verizon bought the company  had gone too far in trying to hire and promote women.
He tied the suit into todays women-in-tech movement.
When youre on a mission from God to set the world straight, its easy to go too far, Mr. Parsons said.
There was no control over women hiring women.

He said that his clients, Greg Anderson and Scott Ard, had faced gender discrimination in Yahoos media teams and that other teams like cars were headed by women, which to Mr. Parsons was a sign of problems.
No eyebrows are going to rise if a woman heads up fashion, Mr. Parsons said.
But were talking about women staffing positions  things like autos  where it cannot be explained other than manipulation.
Those leading Silicon Valleys gender equality push said they were astonished that just as the movement was having an impact, it opened up an even more radical mens rights perspective.
Its exhausting, said Joelle Emerson, who runs Paradigm, a company that designs diversity strategies.
Its created divides that I didnt anticipate.
One radical fringe that is growing is Mgtow, which stands for Men Going Their Own Way and pronounced MIG-tow.
Mgtow aims for total male separatism, including forgoing children, avoiding marriage and limiting involvement with women.
Its message boards are brimming with activity from Silicon Valley, Mr. Altizer said.

Cassie Jaye, who lives in Marin County and made a documentary about the mens rights movement called The Red Pill, said that the tech world and the mens rights community had snowballed together and that the rise in the number of people in Mgtow is new.

On the Mgtow message boards, members discuss work (Ever work for a woman?
Roll up your sleeves and share your horror story), technology (The stuff girlfriends and wives cant stand  computers, games, consoles) and dating (mostly best practices to avoid commitment).
I think there are a lot of guys living this lifestyle without naming it, and then they find Mgtow, said Ms. Jaye, who calls herself a former feminist.
Mr. Altizer leads Bay Area Fathers Rights, a monthly support group for men to talk about the issues they uniquely face.
He became interested in the community after a divorce and said his eyes were opened to how few rights men have.
As for the numbers of women in tech, the effort for parity is absurd, he said.
Ive been on the hiring side for years, Mr. Altizer said, adding that he is not currently hiring people.
It would be nice to have women, but you cannot find applicants.
Vanessa Chan, a spokeswoman for Facebook, said the board had determined that withdrawing the reclassification was in the best interests of Facebook and its shareholders.

The decision to drop the stock reclassification bucks a trend for technology chief executives who have structured their stock to gain outsize control over their company, often at the cost of common shareholder input.
Larry Page and Sergey Brin, who founded Google, and Evan Spiegel and Bobby Murphy of Snap are among those who hold a disproportionate share of voting power over their companies.
The impetus for the stock reclassification came after Mr. Zuckerberg and Dr. Priscilla Chan, his wife, celebrated the birth of their first daughter, Maxima.
The couple used the occasion to found the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, a limited liability company that acts as the main vehicle for the couple to give away their wealth over the coming years.
The idea was that it would allow me to keep voting control of Facebook so we can continue to build for the long term, but also allow Priscilla and me to fund the work were doing through the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, Mr. Zuckerberg said in a statement posted on his personal Facebook page on Friday.
At the time, I felt that this reclassification was the best way to do both of these things, he said.
In fact, I thought it was the only way.
But I also knew it was going to be complicated and it wasnt a perfect solution.
Mr. Zuckerberg and a spokeswoman for the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative said the stock reclassification was no longer necessary.
The chief executive noted that because of Facebooks strong stock performance, I can fully fund our philanthropy and retain voting control of Facebook for 20 years or more.
He said he planned to sell 35 million to 75 million shares over the next 18 months to finance work in fields like education and science.
This path offers a way to do all of this, and Im looking forward to making more progress together, Mr. Zuckerberg said.

Chastened by criticism that Facebook had turned a blind eye to Russias manipulation of the social network to interfere in the 2016 election, the companys executives now acknowledge a need to do better and have promised to be more transparent about who is paying for political ads.
Thats a good start, but more is required  of Facebook, of social media giants generally and of Congress.
Mark Zuckerberg, a co-founder and the chief executive of Facebook, said on Thursday that the company would give congressional investigators more than 3,000 Russia-linked ads and would begin disclosing the names of Facebook business accounts that place political ads on the site.
He also said the company would hire more people to improve security, work more closely with election regulators and crack down on political harassment.
I dont want anyone to use our tools to undermine democracy, he said.
Thats not what we stand for.
A day earlier his top lieutenant, Sheryl Sandberg, pledged to change the companys systems so ad buyers couldnt target their missives to racists and anti-Semites.
These statements came two weeks after Facebook said that a business linked to the Russian government had placed $100,000 worth of divisive ads on the site between 2015 and May of this year.

Companies like Facebook, Twitter and Google have become a huge force in the political system and in society broadly.
While their executives have eagerly embraced their status as disrupters and innovators, they have been reluctant to acknowledge that their creations have been used to do harm.
Technology executives have been loath to accept much or any responsibility for the power they and their businesses wield.
In fact, many of them have gone out of their way to avoid or evade rules that apply to the traditional businesses that they are trying to displace.
For example, Facebook argued in a 2011 letter to the Federal Election Commission that it and other internet companies should not be subject to regulations on political ads that radio and TV stations have to abide by.

Mr. Zuckerbergs concern about democracy is commendable, and some of the changes he announced could have a positive impact.
But they apply only to his company and can be easily evaded.
Disclosing the name of Facebook business accounts placing political ads, for instance, will be of little value if purchasers can disguise their real identity  calling themselves, say, Americans for Motherhood and Apple Pie.
Further, even if Facebook succeeds in driving away foreign propaganda, the same material could pop up on Twitter or other social media sites.
Like all tech leaders, Mr. Zuckerberg is often hailed as a visionary, but his primary talent is as a reactor.
His true skill is not in seeing ahead, but in looking back and fixing where Facebook has failed.
And whats noteworthy is that when he marshals Facebooks considerable resources to address a problem, Mr. Zuckerberg has a track record of making things right.
I am not asking you to blindly accept that Facebook will be able to completely address the role it plays in modern propaganda wars.
On Russian meddling specifically, it took Facebook more than 10 months after the election to reveal that Russian trolls had bought ads through Facebook, and then it further dragged its feet on deciding to make those ads available to Congress.
Whats more, Mr. Zuckerbergs initial reaction to the question of Facebooks role in the election was marked by a reflexive defensiveness.
Personally, I think the idea that fake news on Facebook, which is a very small amount of the content, influenced the election in any way  I think is a pretty crazy idea, he said at a tech conference days after last years presidential election.
Since then, he has slowly  too slowly  come around to the idea that social media may not be the force for good in the world that he and other optimists always promised.

But it is worth noting that this sort of thing has happened before.
Throughout Facebooks history, on questions of privacy and advertising and business strategy, he has repeatedly fallen behind, then issued blog posts begging for another chance to put things right.
Often these messages conform to a template that he has honed over the years.
He will usually begin with a note of reflection, sometimes issuing an outright apology.
Often, he will underline Facebooks central tenet of transparency and openness: Calm down.
Breathe.
We hear you, he wrote in 2006, in one of the earliest of these addresses (people were very upset that Facebook had begun News Feed; what innocent times).
Next, he will offer a specific plan for the future, often soliciting feedback from users.
And he tends to end on a ringing plea for another chance, as he did this week: It is a new challenge for internet communities to deal with nation states attempting to subvert elections, he said in his address on Thursday.
But if thats what we must do, we are committed to rising to the occasion.

This promise reminded me of a very different but equally daunting problem that Facebook faced five years ago.
It had just floated its stock on the public markets, and things were not looking good.
For the first time in its blessed rise, experts were questioning the social networks future.
Facebook was born as a website on desktop browsers, but the world was moving to mobile phones  and there was little evidence that Facebook had the technical or cultural expertise to move along with them.
Mr. Zuckerberg has admitted that he was late to notice the problem; as late as 2012, the company had fewer than 20 people on its mobile team.
Then, finally, after much prodding by investors, Mr. Zuckerberg came around.
He tore up the companys old mobile strategy and brought in new leadership to manage a new one.
Getting Facebooks mobile apps working perfectly became the companys top priority  not just for a handful of teams, but for everyone who worked at Facebook, from Mr. Zuckerberg and Ms. Sandberg on down.
Mobile is everyones job, Mr. Zuckerberg told the company.
It was a do-or-die moment  and Facebook did.
At first slowly and then quicker than anyone might have guessed, more people began to use Facebook on their phones  which drove more advertisers to place ads on Facebooks mobile apps.
Soon, Facebooks mobile growth eclipsed that of every other social app, and it became indomitable.
Today, of the more than two billion people who use Facebook every month, most use it on their phones  and nearly 90 percent of Facebooks advertising revenue comes from mobile devices.
The latest series of scandals engulfing Facebook has not affected its business, which under Ms. Sandbergs leadership remains brisk.
But they present no less of an existential problem.
Facebooks main asset is us, its users; how we users and lawmakers perceive Facebooks effect on our lives  and on our democracies and national security  is a crucial factor in its future.
In addition to possible regulatory oversight of its advertising engine, theres a more straightforward worry that we will all become wary of the companys might  and will think twice about letting it get ever deeper into our lives, as it is wont to do.
A friend and mentor who knows Mr. Zuckerberg well told me recently that his greatest skill is his ability to learn from his mistakes.
He was late to appreciate how the worlds most-used social service might be used for ill. Now that he finally seems to understand the problem, there may be hope that he can do something about it.
When it comes to streaming and downloading movies, do you really notice that much of a difference between standard definition and the high-definition version?
A. High-definition (HD) files pack considerably more pixels into the video than those classified as standard definition (SD), and in side-by-side comparisons, the sharpness of the picture and depth of the colors in an HD video can stand out.
You may want to sample both formats on a similar type of movie and see which version you prefer.
Photo

Online video services typically label movies by the number of pixels in their vertical dimension; more pixels generally mean a sharper picture.
HD movies are usually classified as 1,080p or 720p (referring to the resolutions of 1,280 by 720 pixels or 1,920 by 1,080 pixels).
Movies in standard definition have lower resolutions and can vary based on the provider, but a sample SD movie downloaded from iTunes has a resolution of 853 by 352 pixels.
If you are watching the movie on a small tablet, phone or other screen, SD video quality is usually just fine.
Standard-definition videos are less expensive to buy, often by about $5, and $1 or $2 less to rent in some online stores.
Certain devices cannot fully display HD video anyway because the screens lack the needed resolution or the hardware is not compatible.
(Some files may automatically download in standard definition anyway depending on the device you are using.)
Because they contain more data, downloaded HD videos need more bandwidth to stream and, when downloaded, take up more space on your device.
For example, the 720p HD version of The Martian in Apples iTunes Store is a 5.36-gigabyte file, while the SD edition weighs in at 2.54 gigabytes.
If you are downloading a movie to a mobile device to watch offline, the SD edition is a space saver.
If you plan to watch the movie on a high-definition television or high-resolution computer monitor, though, SD video can look flatter and less vibrant than the HD version.
Many video services are now offering movies and television shows in yet another format: ultra high-definition, also known as 4K for its 3,840 by 2,160 pixels of resolution.
Amazon, Apple, Google, Microsoft, Netflix, Roku, Vudu and YouTube are among the services with 4K content or devices; video in the 4K H.D.R.
(high dynamic range) format is also available from some services.
To properly appreciate the clarity and color depth of the newer formats, you need a TV or monitor that can actually display 4K or 4K H.D.R.
video  and a lot more bandwidth to stream or store the file.
In a phone conversation, Professor Bessembinder reminded me that the stock market is a moving target and that his rankings, while valid through the end of 2016, dont capture the sharp movements of this calendar year.
In his 2016 rankings, Exxon Mobil, not Apple, appears at the top, with net wealth creation of more than $1 trillion.
Apple lags at about $745 billion.
But it has been a wild year.
Exxon Mobil shares have declined more than 11 percent at a time of weak energy prices, while Apple, which just introduced a raft of new iPhones, is on a spectacular stock surge, gaining more than 37 percent.
Run the numbers as I did, and its clear that at this moment, Apple has pulled ahead of Exxon Mobil, with total net wealth creation of somewhere in the vicinity of $1 trillion.
Counting dividends, Exxon Mobils losses in the stock market have reduced its total to a bit over $910 billion.
(Note that, as a technical matter, Professor Bessembinder defines net wealth creation as total stock returns in excess of one-month Treasury bill returns, which averaged an annualized 3.38 percent, so the actual stock returns for Apple, Exxon, and the others are even higher than indicated.)
Its remarkable that Apple has generated so much wealth in such a short period of time, he said.
Exxon has had decades to pile up those returns.
Exxon is among the top wealth-creating companies that have been publicly trading  under the name of a predecessor, Standard Oil of New Jersey  since the inception of Professor Bessembinders tally in July 1926.
Others include General Electric, IBM, Altria, Coca-Cola, DuPont, PepsiCo and Schlumberger.
He relied on a database developed at the University of Chicago, known as CRSP, for the Center for Research in Security Prices, that contains virtually all publicly traded stocks in the United States.
The Center for Research uses rigorous and logical criteria to determine when stocks enter and depart its listings, with some results that may seem surprising at first glance.
General Motors, for example, ranks eighth.
It was publicly traded in 1926, but the list says it ceased to exist in June 2009.
A company called General Motors exists today, of course, but as Chloe Fu, senior support and relationship manager at the Center for Research in Security Prices, explained it, G.M.s bailout and bankruptcy led the center to declare the old company terminated, with a new G.M.
coming to life in June 2009.
Consequently, the new G.M.
returns arent included in the total for G.M.
on the list.

The list is a fascinating ranking of big winners in the stock market.
But for a variety of technical reasons, it isnt a straightforward table of the greatest wealth generators in market history.
For example, the long-term gains generated by Exxon Mobil and its predecessors are understated because of the databases limited duration and strict criteria.

Exxon Mobils wealth in the list doesnt include Mobils, which Professor Bessembinders listing says, ceased to exist in November 1999, when it merged with Exxon.
And going back further, both Exxon and Mobil were among the descendants of the Standard Oil trust, established by John D. Rockefeller and his partners in the 19th century.
The total wealth generated by the cluster of companies derived at least partially from the trust  which also include Amoco and Chevron  doesnt appear in a single notation, because of the lists logic.
Other apparent oddities are explained by Professor Bessembinders application of the centers criteria.
There are two companies on the list called AT&T, for example, neither capturing the total net wealth generated by an investment in the old American Telephone and Telegraph Company at its 19th century inception.
To start with, the old AT&T, a.k.a.
Ma Bell, is ranked 17th.
It is said to have gone out of existence in November 2005.
Another AT&T appears in the 33rd spot.
That company came to life in March 1984 as Southwestern Bell, spun off from the old AT&T as a result of an antitrust suit.
A descendant of Southwestern Bell bought the AT&T name in 2005 and operates under it today.
Other AT&T cousins are on the list: Verizon, as well as Comcast, which resulted from a merger between AT&T Broadband and an older company also known as Comcast.
The listings for most of the recently created companies are less tangled.
As I wrote in July, Amazon, which started trading in 1997, has soared to the 14th spot.
Although it hasnt been in existence long compared with Exxon Mobil, its annualized return is the highest in the list, 37.4 percent through December.
A group of young companies have also had remarkable results.
Facebook, which started trading in June 2012, is the youngest on the list, with an annualized return of 34.5 percent.
Visa, which had its initial public offering of stock in 2008, is the second-newest company, with a 21 percent annualized return, followed by Alphabet (Google), ranked 11th with a 24.9 percent annualized return.
And then there is that great wealth machine, Microsoft, ranked as the third-greatest wealth creator.
Since 1986, it has had an annualized return of 25 percent, making its founder, Bill Gates, the richest man in the world, with a net worth of more than $87 billion, according to Bloomberg.
No list of wealth-generating companies is complete without Berkshire Hathaway.
It ranks 12th, just behind Alphabet, with an annualized return of 22.6 percent.
By comparison, Exxon Mobils annualized return was only 11.94 percent.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Why is Berkshires annualized return so much higher?
It is because the return doesnt include decades of mediocre performance for the old textile company Berkshire Hathaway, which started in 1929.
The Center for Research says the Berkshire on this list started in November 1976.
It was a holding company for Warren E. Buffett, who guided it to fabulous gains.
Thanks to Berkshire, Mr. Buffett is a rich man, with a net worth estimated by Bloomberg at $79 billion.
Anyone who invested in Apple or Microsoft or, really, in any of these companies at their inception and just held on did extraordinarily well.
You might look at that record and conclude that you should just buy the best companies as a foolproof way to get rich.
If only it were that easy.
How do you find those companies?
Not here.
The problem is, I have no idea which companies will generate the best returns over the next 10 or 20 or 30 years,  Professor Bessembinder said.
Probably it will be some companies weve never heard of.
Maybe it will be companies that dont even exist now.
This list is worth studying for understanding the past.
But, unfortunately, its not a guide to the future, except for this: In a market where most of the gains are attributable to a few big winners that are hard to identify in advance, Professor Bessembinder said, it makes a lot of sense to diversify your position  to avoid the danger of omitting the big winners from your portfolio.
Mike: I honestly am a bit confused here.
Remember the Motorola debacle from a few years back?
Google paid more than $12 billion to buy Motorola Mobility, another struggling handset maker, in an attempt to take on Apple more directly and own the hardware stack from top to bottom.
That didnt work out so well.
Google ended up selling Motorola for parts after it realized that, uh, no one wanted to buy Motorola phones.
Some people are saying this is about gaining more expertise inside Google for building hardware.
O.K., I guess.
But lets hope it works out better than last time.
Tough Week for Big Tech

Farhad: Lets turn to Apple, Facebook and Amazon, since they all had a rough week.
For Apple, it was about a buggy smartwatch.
The new Apple Watch is supposed to work on cellular networks, meaning it can reach the internet even if youre away from your phone.
Our own reviewer, Brian X. Chen, found that it worked quite well, but reviewers at The Wall Street Journal and The Verge discovered a flaw in the devices that prevented them from reaching cellular networks in some instances.
Apple said it would fix the bug in a software update, but its still an embarrassing slip from a company that prides itself on getting things perfect.

Mike: Do we have to call this one Watchgate?
I swear, every few iPhone launches we see some damning flaw in the hardware, and it takes a little shine off their huge annual product introductions.
However, people will still buy their new iPhones in droves, as they always do.
Probably the new watch, too.
And to be fair to Apple, at least they arent shipping phones that explode in your pants pocket.
Farhad: Facebook, meanwhile, had to scramble to fix its ad targeting engine after ProPublica found that advertisers could use the system to target ads using racial slursfor instance, people could show ads to Jew haters.
Other reporters soon found that Googles and Twitters ad systems could also be used to target heinous categories.
Coming on top of reports that Russia used Facebooks ad system to manipulate the American election, the stories fed the perception that these companies just dont know how their systems are being used.

Mike: And dont forget that Facebook finally came out with a nine-point list on how the company plans to comply with continuing investigations into Russian-linked ads and even begin some forms of self-regulation for political ads on Facebook.
Its a huge story.
Farhad: Oh, for further evidence of the cluelessness of tech companies over their platforms, Amazons website has been recommending bomb-making materials to people, a British report found.
Boy oh boy.
Remember when tech was fun and zany, when it was all about getting cool gadgets?
Were long past that.
Mike: I started playing a video game the other day thats basically Grand Theft Auto meets San Francisco hackers.
Part of the game includes making guns from a 3-D printer.
The future is terrifying.
A Tainted Image

Farhad: The rapidly deteriorating image of tech companies is having real-world consequences.
Our colleague Cecilia Kang reported that Facebook and Google have lost so much clout in Washington that theyve all but given up trying to stop a sex-trafficking bill that they think could have negative consequences for their businesses.
The bill would allow people to sue some websites for the content they host  a huge change to existing law, which doesnt hold companies responsible for stuff their users post on their sites, as long as they work to take down illegal material.
Internet giants were gearing up to fight the law, but theyve determined that the growing anti-tech sentiment makes it too difficult.
Its hard out there for a tech giant  other than all those billions of dollars they keep raking in.
Mike: Right, and I think tech companies have grown wise to where the tide is turning.
Right now, were seeing Facebook try to get ahead of Congress by announcing that it wants to essentially regulate its own political ads, largely because it doesnt want Congress to intervene.
Also, I can only imagine that Google, Twitter and Amazon are bracing for the possibility of this story picking apart their businesses, too.
In any case, the future is scary!
Should we trust these tech companies that say theyve got it covered, and have our best interests in hand?
Farhad: Um  probably not?
O.K., see ya.
Mike: Ta ta for now!
A ban on operating in one of its largest markets would certainly hit Ubers bottom line.
The company said it had 40,000 drivers and 3.5 million customers in London who used its app at least once every three months.
Mr. Khosrowshahi, in a Twitter post on Friday afternoon, acknowledged that Uber was far from perfect and urged city regulators to work out a solution with the company.
Less than a year ago, a British tribunal ruled that Uber could no longer treat its drivers as self-employed contractors and would have to meet tougher labor standards, including offering holiday pay and pensions.
Fit and proper is a benchmark that Britain applies across different industries and its charitable organizations to ensure that people or organizations meet the requirements of their industry or specialty.
Ubers approach and conduct demonstrate a lack of corporate responsibility in relation to a number of issues which have potential public safety and security implications, Transport for London said in a statement.
Tests typically assess factors like an individual or companys honesty, transparency and competence, though there is no formal exam.
In Ubers case, Transport for London said it had examined issues of how the company dealt with serious criminal offenses, how it conducted background checks on drivers and its justification for a software program called Greyball, which could be used to block regulatory bodies from gaining full access to the app.
In May, Transport for London extended Ubers license by four months as it considered whether the company met that threshold.

Providing an innovative service is not an excuse for it being unsafe, Londons mayor, Sadiq Khan, wrote in The Guardian soon after the ruling was announced.
The regulatory environment is critical in protecting Londoners safety, maintaining workplace standards for drivers and sustaining a vibrant taxi and private hire market with space for a range of providers to flourish.
Ubers London license will now expire on Sept. 30.
But it can continue to operate in the city during the appeal process in Britains courts.
Tom Elvidge, Ubers general manager in London, said the agency and Mr. Khan had caved in to a small number of people who want to restrict consumer choice.
Uber conducted background checks using the methods used for black-cab drivers, he said.
Our pioneering technology has gone further to enhance safety with every trip tracked and recorded by GPS, Mr. Elvidge said, adding that the company had a dedicated team who work closely with the Metropolitan Police.
He also said Greyball had not been used to block scrutiny by regulators or the police in London.
The move by regulators in London picks up the political mood of the times, said Tony Travers, a professor at the London School of Economics.
London, like New York and Paris, is full of urban progressives who, even if they use Uber, feel guilty when they read things about it that they dont like.

On Thursday, a Dutch appeals court upheld a ban of an Uber service in the Netherlands, saying the companys low-cost UberPop ride-hailing offering had been operated illegally.
The French authorities took a similar case to the Court of Justice of the European Union, and last year Uber and two executives were convicted and fined the equivalent of nearly $500,000 in France in relation to UberPop.
In New York, Mayor Bill de Blasio has criticized Ubers rapid expansion for making congestion worse on city streets.
But in 2015, his administration backed down from a fight with Uber by abruptly dropping a plan for a cap on the number of Uber vehicles operating within the city.
Until now, London had been one of Ubers most notable success stories outside the United States.
It debuted in the city in 2012, just before the Summer Olympics, initially with a luxury service.
It added UberX, which competes more directly with the citys storied black taxis, a year later.
The company now operates in more than 40 cities and towns across Britain.
Its arrival here, however, created a clash almost immediately with the black cabs, which trace their roots to 1634.

Black-cab drivers, who earn licenses by memorizing some 25,000 streets and 100,000 landmarks for an exacting test known as The Knowledge, complain that Uber drivers are under-regulated.
Many fear that the rivalry will put them out of business: Uber fares are about 30 percent lower than those of black cabs.
The conflict also involves tensions over ethnicity and class.
Most black-cab drivers are white native-born Britons, while many Uber drivers are immigrants.
Uber has said it receives hundreds of complaints a month from its drivers about remarks from black-cab drivers.
Among the insults hurled are Uber slave!
and Go back to your country!
Many black-cab drivers have now signed up with competing apps like Gett and MyTaxi, which like Uber allow passengers to hail rides via their smartphones.
Londoners can also choose from a wide variety of private-hire services, known as minicabs.
Black-cab drivers, and the unions representing them, cheered Fridays ruling.
Jeffrey Marcus, who has been driving a London taxi for 42 years, described it as long overdue.
Weve got a brilliant taxi service here, Mr. Marcus, 67, said.
You pay a little more for a licensed taxi, but you get the service.
The reaction online to the Transport for London ruling, however, was generally negative.
Hours after the decision was announced, a Change.org petition that was started and heavily promoted by Uber within its app and via emails to customers had over 200,000 signatures.
Ahmad Shoaib, an Uber driver, said the service was being unfairly targeted.
I know there have been some problems with drivers, but most of us are good and reliable and play by the rules, he said.
It is not fair to punish everyone because of the mistakes of one or two people.
Mr. Shoaib switched to Uber from a minicab company in Croydon, in South London, after he saw how much work friends were getting from the ride-hailing service.

London needs Uber, he said, its cheap and easy.
Facebook is fighting through a tangled morass of privacy, free-speech and moderation issues with governments all over the world.
Congress is investigating reports that Russian operatives used targeted Facebook ads to influence the 2016 presidential election.
In Myanmar, activists are accusing Facebook of censoring Rohingya Muslims, who are under attack from the countrys military.
In Africa, the social network faces accusations that it helped human traffickers extort victims families by leaving up abusive videos.
Few of these issues stem from willful malice on the companys part.
Its not as if a Facebook engineer in Menlo Park personally greenlighted Russian propaganda, for example.
On Thursday, the company said it would release political advertisements bought by Russians for the 2016 election, as well as some information related to the ads, to congressional investigators.
But the troubles do make it clear that Facebook was simply not built to handle problems of this magnitude.
Its a technology company, not an intelligence agency or an international diplomatic corps.
Its engineers are in the business of building apps and selling advertising, not determining what constitutes hate speech in Myanmar.
And with two billion users, including 1.3 billion who use it every day, moving ever greater amounts of their social and political activity onto Facebook, its possible that the company is simply too big to understand all of the harmful ways people might use its products.
The reality is that if youre at the helm of a machine that has two billion screaming, whiny humans, its basically impossible to predict each and every possible nefarious use case, said Antonio Garca Martnez, author of the book Chaos Monkeys and a former Facebook advertising executive.
Its a Whac-a-Mole problem.
Elliot Schrage, Facebooks vice president of communications and public policy, said in a statement: We work very hard to support our millions of advertisers worldwide, but sometimes  rarely  bad actors win.
We invest a lot of time, energy and resources to make these rare events extinct, and were grateful to our community for calling out where we can do better.

When Mark Zuckerberg built Facebook in his Harvard dorm room in 2004, nobody could have imagined its becoming a censorship tool for repressive regimes, an arbiter of global speech standards or a vehicle for foreign propagandists.
But as Facebook has grown into the global town square, it has had to adapt to its own influence.
Many of its users view the social network as an essential utility, and the companys decisions  which posts to take down, which ads to allow, which videos to show  can have real life-or-death consequences around the world.
The company has outsourced some decisions to complex algorithms, which carries its own risks, but many of the toughest choices Facebook faces are still made by humans.

They still see themselves as a technology middleman, said Mr. Garca Martnez.
Facebook is not supposed to be an element of a propaganda war.
Theyre completely not equipped to deal with that.

Even if Mr. Zuckerberg and Ms. Sandberg dont have personal political aspirations, as has been rumored, they are already leaders of an organization that influences politics all over the world.
And there are signs that Facebook is starting to understand its responsibilities.
It has hired a slew of counterterrorism experts and is expanding teams of moderators around the world to look for and remove harmful content.
On Thursday, Mr. Zuckerberg said in a video posted on Facebook that the company would take several steps to help protect the integrity of elections, like making political ads more transparent and expanding partnerships with election commissions.
We will do our part not only to ensure the integrity of free and fair elections around the world, but also to give everyone a voice and to be a force for good in democracy everywhere, he said.
But there may not be enough guardrails in the world to prevent bad outcomes on Facebook, whose scale is nearly inconceivable.
Alex Stamos, Facebooks security chief, said last month that the company shuts down more than a million user accounts every day for violating Facebooks community standards.
Even if only 1 percent of Facebooks daily active users misbehaved, it would still mean 13 million rule breakers, about the number of people in Pennsylvania.
In addition to challenges of size, Facebooks corporate culture is one of cheery optimism.
That may have suited the company when it was an upstart, but it could hamper its ability to accurately predict risk now that its a setting for large-scale global conflicts.
Several current and former employees described Facebook to me as a place where engineers and executives generally assume the best of users, rather than preparing for the worst.
Even the companys mission statement  Give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together  implies that people who are given powerful tools will use those tools for socially constructive purposes.
Clearly, that is not always the case.
Hiring people with darker views of the world could help Facebook anticipate conflicts and misuse.
But pessimism alone wont fix all of Facebooks issues.
It will need to keep investing heavily in defensive tools, including artificial intelligence and teams of human moderators, to shut down bad actors.
It would also be wise to deepen its knowledge of the countries where it operates, hiring more regional experts who understand the nuances of the local political and cultural environment.
Facebook could even take a page from Wall Streets book, and create a risk department that would watch over its engineering teams, assessing new products and features for potential misuse before launching them to the world.
Now that Facebook is aware of its own influence, the company cant dodge responsibility for the world it has helped to build.
In the future, blaming the monster wont be enough.
Dmitri S. Peskov, a spokesman for President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, denied on Friday that Russia had been involved in any way.
The Kremlin, he said, does not even know how to put advertisements on Facebook, adding, We have never done it, and the Russian side has never been involved in this.
For Facebook, the move to work with the congressional committees underscored how far the social network has strayed from being a mere technology company and how it has increasingly had to deal with the unintended consequences of the tools it provides to reach the more than two billion people who use the site regularly.
The company became more proactive in deflecting criticism this week, with its chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, describing on Wednesday the steps Facebook would take to strengthen its ad system so that it could not be misused to target racists.
On Thursday, in a move clearly intended to pre-empt government intervention, Mr. Zuckerberg outlined the list of actions Facebook planned to take in the coming weeks to make political advertising more transparent.
He said each ad will show which Facebook Page  a kind of account required for businesses to create an ad  had paid for the ad, although that would not necessarily identify the people behind the Facebook Page.
In addition, Facebook plans to invest more heavily in its security teams, expand its coordination with global election commissions, and work closely with other tech companies to share threat information as it arises.
In his seven-minute talk from Facebooks headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif., Mr. Zuckerberg suggested there may be additional fake accounts linked to Russia or other foreign countries.
We are looking into foreign actors, including additional Russian groups and other former Soviet states, he said.
Mr. Zuckerberg, 33, noted that Thursday was his first day back from parental leave after the birth of a daughter.
But despite that folksy touch, he had the look of an improbably young leader addressing his people at a moment of crisis.
With his talk of the democratic process, foreign actors, and election integrity  mentioning Germanys elections this weekend in particular  Mr. Zuckerberg reinforced Facebooks status as a transnational global behemoth whose power reaches into every corner of contemporary life.
We are in a new world, he said.
It is a new challenge for internet communities to deal with nation-states attempting to subvert elections.
But if thats what we must do, we are committed to rising to the occasion.

Despite Russias stealth attack, Mr. Zuckerberg argued that Facebook remained a force for good in democracy, promoting billions of online discussions, linking voters to candidates and helping two million Americans register to vote.
He said that positive role was 100 or 1,000 times bigger than the illicit activity.
Twitter, which has kept a low profile since Facebooks disclosure of the Russian intrusion, has announced that it will brief the Senate Intelligence Committee next Wednesday behind closed doors.
In a statement, Twitter did not address illicit Russian activity on its platform but said it deeply respects the integrity of the election process, a cornerstone of all democracies and vowed to continue to strengthen our platform against bots and other forms of manipulation.
Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the intelligence committee, praised Facebooks announcement but said he still believed regulation was needed to ensure that voters know more about who is behind ads on social media.

This is a good first step, he said.
Im disappointed its taken 10 months of raising this issue before theyve become much more transparent.
He said he believed there were additional troll farms in both Russia and Eastern Europe, and its really important that Facebook work with us to investigate other sources of advertising and fake accounts.
Mr. Warner said he believed the 3,000 ads, which the committees had not yet received, should be made public with protections for the privacy of any innocent people whose names may be in the material.
Mr. Warner and Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota, circulated a letter inviting colleagues to co-sponsor a bill that would require greater transparency for online political ads, according to a copy of the letter seen by The New York Times.
A spokeswoman for Senator Richard Burr, Republican of North Carolina, who is chairman of the intelligence panel, said he had no comment Thursday night.
The Times reported this month that Russian intelligence appeared to have been behind an infestation of Twitter with automated accounts, called bots, that spread messages against Mrs. Clinton last year.
The cybersecurity company FireEye identified what it called warlists of hundreds of fake accounts that fired off identical political messages.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story

The Times also found Facebook accounts that appeared to have been created by ordinary Americans but were actually concocted by Russian agents.
Facebook, which had said as recently as July that it had found no evidence of fraudulent Russian ad purchases, reversed itself this month and said it had removed 470 profiles and pages that it said were linked to the Internet Research Agency, a Russian company with ties to the Kremlin.
Facebook found $100,000 of ad purchases that were linked to the fake pages  designed to look like the pages of Americans animated by particular issues  that spread inflammatory messages about immigration, guns and other topics; derided Mrs. Clinton and supported Mr. Trump.
Facebook shut the accounts down in recent weeks but declined to name or describe them publicly, saying federal law prohibited it from making customer communications public.
Although Facebook had declined to identify the fake Russian pages, The Daily Beast and other news organizations ferreted out a few of them, including one called Secured Borders on immigration and another called Being Patriotic that promoted pro-Trump rallies in Florida last year.
The illicit Russian exploitation of social media fits squarely into Mr. Muellers wide-ranging investigation, and the companies said they have fully cooperated with his requests for detailed data.
Though most public attention has been focused on whether the Trump campaign helped with the Russian hacking, leaking and other intrusions, the special counsels assignment is a full and thorough investigation of the Russian governments efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election.
One question for Mr. Mueller is certain to be whether the Russian Facebook advertising  and any other promotions using Twitter or other services  showed evidence of the kind of sophisticated targeting that might indicate that Americans had provided assistance.
Facebook has said some of the ads were targeted to particular geographic areas but has not given details.
For the social media companies, the furor over Russias interference raises a possibility that they deeply fear: government regulation, at least for the part of their business that involves political advertising.
Political ads on social media have thus far escaped the rules that require, for instance, the familiar I approve this message tagline on candidates television spots.
Tech executives worry that new rules could hinder the worlds largest digital advertising businesses.
Because of the self-service advertising system these tech giants have created, anyone who has an account and a credit card can buy an ad.
That has made for a long tail of small-ticket advertisers who add up to millions of dollars in spending.
Facebooks number one priority is ad revenue, said Ian Schafer, chief experience officer of Engine USA, a digital advertising holding company.
The last thing Facebook wants to do is give the government an inch, because then theyll probably take a mile.
Last year, Facebook made nearly $28 billion in annual revenue, up 57 percent from a year earlier, and the trajectory remains bright.
Roughly 97 percent of that revenue came from the companys ad business.
Is it true that Google Drive is being discontinued?
A. Google announced this month that it will end support for the Google Drive desktop apps for Windows and Mac computers on Dec. 11 and that the software will be shut down for good on March 12.
But while those handy desktop programs for managing your files in the cloud are destined for retirement, Googles online backup service is not going anywhere soon.
You just get to it through different desktop programs.
(You can also continue to just upload and download stored files through your Google Account in a web browser.)
For desktop users who backed up files to cloud servers with the Google Drive app, the company has two newer programs to do the job instead.
The Backup and Sync app for Windows and Mac, introduced in July, is Googles software for users of its free services.
The program can be set to synchronize copies of locally stored photos and other files on the computer to Googles cloud servers.
(Note that you get a free 15 gigabytes of storage from Google, but if you max it out, you need to buy more space if you want to keep storing all your files on the companys servers.)
Photo

Business customers using the paid G Suite version of Googles Gmail, calendar and business programs have a choice.
They can use Backup and Sync, too, or switch to the new Drive File Stream app for Windows or Mac.
Drive File Stream has been available since March for early adopters and officially arrives on Tuesday.
Google recommends that its business customers use the Drive File Stream for a few reasons, including faster data-sync times.
Additionally, the app stores the files online for direct use and puts less corporate data on the users hard drives; specific files and folders can be marked for local storage and use offline when an internet connection is not available.
Users running both Backup and Sync and Drive File Stream on the same computer will get a nudge from Google to switch to the latter app to save disk space.
Those still using the Google Drive app will begin to see alerts next month announcing that the software is headed to the digital dustbin.
To fulfill his flow-finding mission, Mr. Wheal wants to bring what he calls his Dojo Domes to locations around the world.
Next year, he and his partners hope to build a one-million-square-foot complex in Vancouver, British Columbia, with a medical emphasis, combining brain-imaging technology with simpler equipment.

Mr. Wheal began to envision gatherings of this sort in 2007, while he was teaching at Esalen, the spiritual retreat in California.
With Steven Kotler, a journalist, he founded the Flow Genome Project, based in Austin, Tex., and dedicated to gathering the latest science behind flow states.
Its board of advisers includes neuroscientists, filmmakers and a kiteboarder.
It was his book, Stealing Fire, written with Mr. Kotler and published earlier this year, that attracted many of the flow campers to Utah.
In it, Mr. Wheal and Mr. Kotler consider the question of peak human performance, describing how so many powerful companies and individuals are now trying to optimize their own brains, in ways both legal and illegal.
They offer case studies from the Navy SEALs and Google, arguing that what the world today faces wicked problems, unprecedented and complex, that require creative solutions, the kinds that are most likely to come not from staid meetings in conference rooms but rather from non-ordinary states.
Flow, they write, is associated with six neurotransmitters: dopamine, serotonin, oxytocin, norepinephrine, anandamide and endorphins.
Knowing the neurochemical profile of flow means, in theory, people can devise ways of achieving it more often, more reliably and more quickly.
The new generation of flowsters are excited, perhaps, that using the advances of neuroscience, they might not have to meditate every day for 10 years to gain access to these layers of their brains.

This was a significant investment of time and money for me  this tells you how compelled I was to come here, said Alexandre Lang-Willar.
At 28, Mr. Lang-Willar is in some ways the embodiment of Mr. Wheals target demographic: the high achiever who grasps the brass ring, only to discover he craves something more.
Mr. Lang-Willar quit his job as a Goldman Sachs analyst and has created a dating app with his father called Invite and Meet, centered on live activities, that will be introduced later this year.
Reading Stealing Fire, Mr. Lang-Willar said, he became convinced that nothing less than a cultural awakening was underway.

By 8 a.m. each morning, the flow campers lay prone and shoeless in the Dojo Dome, moving back and forth on brightly colored foam rollers.
Other daily activities included balancing and bouncing on big yellow balls; acro-yoga, in which partners learn to lift each other in the air; and strapping into special contraptions, like Mr. Wheals 360 Swing, which allows those courageous enough to propel themselves, standing up, all the way around the swings axle in a complete loop.

All of these undertakings were in the service of honing a crucial element in flow, what Mr. Wheal refers to as embodied cognition: integrating our whole minds and bodies through specific exercise, based on the science showing that physical movement directly affects how we think and feel.
They are tapping into spiritual intelligence that before now was only really talked about in a religious context, Kristen Ulmer said, sitting outside the Dojo Dome one morning.
Ms. Ulmer, formerly the top ranked extreme skier in the world, has also written a book, The Art of Fear.
She went on: A lot more people are saying theyre spiritual but not religious  but what does that really mean?
I would say sports and movement are the most oft way we access a spiritual experience and transcend our ego, but theyre the least discussed and least understood.
The two sides did not disclose how many engineers and other key employees would head to Google as part of the deal.
But Peter Shen, HTCs chief financial officer, said the remaining company would still have more than 2,000 research and design staffers, down from about 4,000.
As part of the agreement, Google will also secure a nonexclusive licensing deal for some of HTCs intellectual property.
HTC said it will continue to make its own smartphones  including a new premium model  although it plans to streamline its handset portfolio.
By acquiring the HTC engineering group that had already been working with the company, Google secured hardware talent without taking on expensive assets, like manufacturing facilities.
The deal marks a reversal for Google.
The company abandoned its plans to own a smartphone manufacturer when it sold Motorola to Chinas Lenovo Group for $2.9 billion in 2014, less than three years after acquiring the handset business for $12.5 billion.

But Google, which makes the Android operating system for smartphones, retained many of Motorolas patents  an important asset to fend off potential intellectual property lawsuits from Apple.
As the Android software world has become dominated by Samsung Electronics, Google has wanted more say in the manufacturing of the phones that use its operating system.
Currently, most of Googles smartphone software runs on devices manufactured by companies like Samsung and LG Electronics, and Google has only a limited say in what those companies produce.
With the introduction of the first Pixel smartphone last year, Google said it was creating the smartphone it had always intended to build.
Google took control of the entire development process of the device, from the industrial design to the procurement of components.
The Pixel received positive reviews, but it hasnt made much of a dent in the smartphone market.
HTC was an early leader in smartphones.
But it has struggled against more popular competitors while trying to fend off pressure from low-end Chinese manufacturers.
Its decline is another indication of the challenges facing many smartphone manufacturers, who are struggling to make profits while competing against Apple and Samsung.

Operating losses piled up at HTC in recent years, forcing it to slash research and marketing spending, exacerbating the challenge of keeping pace with the bigger companies.
HTC said it will continue with its virtual-reality business centered around its Vive VR headsets.
Google and HTC have a long history of working together.
HTC sold the first smartphone to run Android software, in 2008, and it produced Googles first-generation Nexus smartphone  the predecessor to the Pixel.
The transaction is scheduled to close, pending regulatory approval, in early 2018.
The Equifax breach, which focused on a database that contained the personal information of 143 million Americans, focused attention on the vulnerabilities of private companies that handle sensitive personal financial information.
The S.E.C.
sometimes handles its own sensitive information, including disclosures that companies are allowed to keep away from investors.
Such information could give traders an edge.
The S.E.C.
may have presented a ripe target.
The Government Accountability Office in July released a 27-page report that found deficiencies in the S.E.C.s information systems that limited the effectiveness of the S.E.Cs controls for protecting confidentiality, integrity and availability.
It also found that the S.E.C.
did not always encrypt information and had failed to fully implement recommendations from the G.A.O.
that would help detect intrusion.
In its response, the S.E.C.
said it agreed with the recommendations of the report but added that it had implemented a number of its suggestions.
The S.E.C.s new director, Walter J. Clayton, has said the agency would work to improve its cybersecurity protections.
Information sharing and coordination are essential for regulators to assess potential cyberthreats and respond to a major cyberattack, should one arise, he said in July in a speech.
We at the S.E.C.
are working closely with our fellow financial regulators to improve our ability to receive critical information and alerts and react to cyberthreats.
If the data stolen from the S.E.C.s Edgar system was used by hackers to trade in stocks and reap profits, it would represent the latest in a new area of concern for regulators in the United States  an area in which the underbelly of the internet is joining forces with the darker corners of Wall Street.
In 2015, the S.E.C.
brought the first insider trading case of its kind against a group of rogue stock traders who used hackers in Ukraine to get nonpublic information about companies.
Insider trading refers to buying or selling of a stock by a trader who has inside knowledge that the investing public is not aware of, creating an unfair advantage.
Typically, insider trading cases concern corporate insiders who leak information to friends, family or business associates in return for a personal benefit.

In this case, the men were accused of using hackers to break into companies like Business Wire and PR Newswire over a period of five years to steal 150,000 not-yet-public news releases of publicly traded companies.
Federal prosecutors alleged that 32 traders and hackers reaped more than $100 million in illegal proceeds in a scheme so brazen that the traders would send shopping lists of corporate news releases for sneak-peeking purposes to the hackers in order to place trades.
The agency said it did not believe that the breach had involved personal information or that it would jeopardize the agencys activities.
Cybersecurity is critical to the operations of our markets, and the risks are significant and, in many cases, systemic, said Mr. Clayton, the agencys chairman, in the statement.
We must be vigilant.
We also must recognize  in both the public and private sectors, including the S.E.C.
that there will be intrusions, and that a key component of cyber risk management is resilience and recovery.
There is much stronger agreement among me and my colleagues that there needs to be more aggressive enforcement action on tech companies like Google, said Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat from Connecticut and a sponsor of the sex trafficking bill.
The companies, recognizing the new environment in Washington, have started to fortify their lobbying forces and recalibrate their positions.
In the last year, Amazon has added antitrust to its roster of issues, hiring a former senior Senate staff member who helped shape antitrust policies.
Google has paid several outside lobbying firms to argue against the sex trafficking bill, according to recent federal filings.

We are disruptive, and that creates a lot of tension, concern, worry and jealousy and sometimes rightfully identifies real problems that need solutions, said Ed Black, president of the Computer and Communications Industry Association, which represents Facebook, Google, Amazon and other tech companies.
Tech companies have faced political pressure in Europe for years.
That is expected to continue, with regulators prepared to push a new set of proposals to get the tech companies to pay more in taxes.
The politics for the companies in the United States began to change after the 2016 presidential election, when attention turned to the role social media sites play in shaping public opinion.
The scrutiny grew after companies struggled to eliminate fake content from their sites, raising fears that the platforms were too big to manage.
After Facebook revealed to Congress that it had accepted money for political ads from fake accounts linked to Russia, Senator Mark Warner, a Democrat from Virginia, started calling for new disclosure laws for the companies.
He plans to begin writing a bill this week that requires Facebook and other social media companies to release funding sources for political ads, as is required for television broadcasters.
This is uncharted territory, Mr. Warner said in an interview.
The growth in political advertising is in the digital world, and if this is the most targeted and potentially most effective way into politics, the paid advertising rules that broadcasters rely upon should also apply in the social media world.

Perhaps no issue in Washington has exposed the vulnerability of the tech companies as much as the sex trafficking bill.
At the heart of the debate for the tech companies is a change to a 20-year-old law that prevents people from suing internet companies for things people post on websites.
The companies, supported by some civil liberties groups, say the existing law has protected free speech and allowed internet companies to grow without fear of lawsuits.
The bill being debated, written by Senator Rob Portman, a Republican from Ohio, and Mr. Blumenthal, would allow state and local authorities to prosecute sites that host content related to sex trafficking.
Their bill, which has bipartisan support from dozens of members in the Senate, would also enable people to sue websites.
Video

Companies like Google and Facebook vehemently opposed the law when it was introduced, warning that it would expose web companies to numerous lawsuits because the actions of users are hard to police.
The bill had provisions that would shield companies like Google and Facebook that have policies to combat sex trafficking, but the companies pushed back nonetheless.
Starting about two weeks ago, as politicians stepped up their attacks against their businesses, Facebook and Google realized that the political landscape had changed, according to two people with knowledge of the decisions who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the internal corporate decisions were private.
So instead, the companies began trying to negotiate changes to the bill with Mr. Portman and other senators instead of trying to stop it entirely.
As of Tuesday, Facebook and Google were still trying to negotiate changes with Senate staff members.
One effort, by Google, would block state attorneys general from prosecuting web platforms for hosting any third-party sites that aided sex trafficking.
Google said the Justice Department should be the sole agency in charge of enforcing sex trafficking laws.
Mr. Portman has viewed enforcement by state attorneys general as the centerpiece of the legislation.
He will not agree to weakening the enforcement role of local and state prosecutors, according to his spokesman, Kevin Smith.
Well continue to engage members of Congress, anti-trafficking organizations and the industry to try and get to a resolution that addresses the problem without creating unintended side effects, Susan Molinari, Googles vice president of public policy, said in a statement.
Facebook appeared more eager to reach a deal with lawmakers, according to two Senate staff members and a tech industry official, who all said the company had expressed a willingness to allow state law enforcement.
They spoke on the condition of anonymity because Facebooks discussions with the lawmakers were private.

We strongly believe that there is a legislative solution that can address this terrible problem while ensuring that the internet remains open and free and that responsible companies can continue to work to stop sex trafficking before it happens, Erin Egan, a vice president of public policy at Facebook, said in a statement.

Senators have not held back their continued frustration with the tech industry, even as the position of the companies has changed somewhat.
On Tuesday, the Senate commerce committee held an emotional hearing on bill, called the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act, that included the mother of a teenage victim of trafficking.
The Senate invited Facebook and Google to testify but they declined, according to a member of the committee staff, instead sending their trade group, the Internet Association, to represent them.
Silicon Valley holds itself out as being more than just an industry but a movement to make the world a better place, Mr. Portman said in the hearing.
But selling human beings online is the dark side of the internet.
Other issues related to tech companies have gained less traction.
The earliest criticism of big tech companies came from left-leaning politicians and economists, whose ideas were largely dismissed by Washington lawyers and regulators as fringe ideas.
But there are signs that the companies are starting to take them more seriously now as well.
The New America Foundation, a left-leaning research group in Washington that is financed by Google and Eric Schmidt, the chairman of its parent company, recently fired a division of antitrust scholars who had been critical of the company.
Google has denied playing a role in the split.
In California, big tech companies joined internet service providers like AT&T and Comcast  their adversaries on many policy issues  to fight a state broadband privacy law, fearing that it could embolden other states and federal regulators to write broader internet privacy rules.
Even Amazons recent move to buy Whole Foods Market for $13.4 billion generated political attention.
Amazon and Whole Foods have a small portion of the overall grocery market, an important measure in antitrust decisions, and the deal quickly passed an antitrust review by the Federal Trade Commission.
But some lawmakers raised questions about Amazons deep pockets and its ability to undercut the prices of smaller competitors.
Senator Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat from Minnesota, pressed F.T.C.
officials to justify their decision, arguing that the agency should have looked at longer-term competition factors.
She has also introduced a bill that would force companies to prove that their deals would not be anticompetitive in the future.

We need to start adjusting to a world where we are right now, said Ms. Klobuchar.
Antitrust laws havent been updated since the 1950s.
In the 1950s, they didnt envision a major search engine dominating the internet.
They didnt even have the internet.
But there are gaps in the way these sensors operate, and combining their disparate streams of data is difficult.
Aevas prototype  a breed of lidar that measures distances more accurately and also captures speed  aims to fill several of these sizable holes.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story

I dont even think of this as a new kind of lidar, said Tarin Ziyaee, co-founder and chief technology officer at the self-driving taxi start-up Voyage, who has seen the Aeva prototype.
Its a whole different animal.
Founded in January and funded by the Silicon Valley venture capital firm Lux Capital, among others, Aeva joins a widespread effort to build more effective sensors for autonomous vehicles, a trend that extends from start-ups like Luminar, Echodyne and Metawave to established hardware makers like the German multinational Robert Bosch.
The companys name, Aeva, is a play on Eve, the name of the robot in the Pixar movie WALL-E.

The market for autonomous vehicles will grow to $42 billion by 2025, according to research by the Boston Consulting Group.
But for that to happen, the vehicles will need new and more powerful sensors.
Todays autonomous cars are ill prepared for high-speed driving, bad weather and other common situations.
The recent improvements in self-driving cars coincided with the improvements offered by new lidar sensors from a Silicon Valley company called Velodyne.
These sensors gave cars a way of measuring distances to nearby vehicles, pedestrians and other objects.
They also provided Google and other companies with a way of mapping urban roadways in three dimensions, so that cars will know exactly where they are at any given moment  something GPS cannot always provide.
But these lidar sensors have additional shortcomings.
They can gather information only about objects that are relatively close to them, which limits how fast the cars can travel.
Their measurements arent always detailed enough to distinguish one object from another.
And when multiple driverless cars are close together, their signals can become garbled.
Other devices can pick up some of slack.
Cameras are a better way of identifying pedestrians and street signs, for example, and radar works over longer distances.
Thats why todays self-driving cars track their surroundings through so many different sensors.
But despite this wide array of hardware  which can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars per vehicle  even the best autonomous vehicles still have trouble in so many situations that humans can navigate with ease.
With their new sensor, Messrs. Salehian and Rezk are working to change that.
Mr. Rezk is an engineer who designed optical hardware for Nikon, and presumably, he was among those who handled optical sensors for Apples driverless car project, though he and Mr. Salehian declined to say which special project they worked on at the company.
They left Apple late last year.

Where current lidar sensors send out individual pulses, Aevas device sends out a continuous wave of light.
By reading the way this far more complex signal bounces off surrounding objects, Mr. Rezk said, the device can capture a far more detailed image while also tracking velocity.
You can think of it as a cross between lidar, which is so good at measuring depth, and radar, which is so good at measuring speed.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Mr. Rezk also said the devices continuous wave would provide greater range and resolution than existing lidar devices, deal better with weather and highly reflective objects like bridge railings, and avoid interference with other optical sensors.
Cars will continue to use multiple kinds of sensors, in part because redundancy helps ensure that these cars are safe.
But Aeva aims to give these cars a better view of the world from a smaller and less expensive set of sensors.
Researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, have built similar hardware, and companies like Velodyne and the start-ups Oryx Vision and Quanergy say they are exploring similar ideas.
Like these efforts, the Aeva prototype is still under development, and the company plans to sell devices next year.
But it shows how autonomous car sensors need to evolve  and that they are indeed evolving.
Ultimately, new sensors will allow cars to make better decisions.
With autonomous cars, 90 percent of the time, you are trying to infer what is happening, Mr. Ziyaee said.
But what if you can just measure it?
Ms. Sandberg said the company never intended or anticipated this functionality being used this way  and that is on us.
Facebook has grown into one of the worlds most valuable companies by offering advertisers the ability to quickly and easily target its users based on a vast array of information, from the type of home they live in to their favorite television shows.
But the company is facing a new wave of scrutiny over how those tools can be misused, particularly after it disclosed this month that fake accounts based in Russia had purchased more than $100,000 worth of ads on divisive issues in the run-up to the presidential election.
The site has also been criticized for not anticipating that its technology could be put to nefarious use.
The appearance of these offensive terms was embarrassing for Facebook and reflects the tendency of Silicon Valley companies to overly trust algorithms and automated systems to manage advertising, said Ari Paparo, chief executive of Beeswax, an advertising technology start-up in New York.
The media business is all about people and influence, so theres a necessary role for human moderation and control.

This is not the first time that Facebook has faced issues stemming from a lack of human oversight.
Earlier this year, after a series of violent acts appeared on Facebook Live broadcasts, the company said it would add 3,000 people to the 4,500-member team of employees that reviews and removes content that violates its community guidelines.
But this was the first time that Ms. Sandberg, who is responsible for Facebooks entire advertising organization, has directly addressed the companys high-profile ad issues in public.
Ms. Sandberg, a veteran of the digital advertising industry, grew to acclaim in Silicon Valley by developing Googles sales organization in the search giants early days.
She joined Facebook in 2008, and was asked to do the same for the social network.
Facebook has faced thorny questions about race and its ad-targeting tools before.
Last fall, ProPublica reported that advertisers could use those tools to exclude certain races  or what the social network called ethnic affinities  from housing and employment ads, a potential violation of the Fair Housing Act of 1968 and the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
Facebook, which assigns the updated term multicultural affinity to certain users based on their interests and activities on the site, no longer allows that classification to be used in ads for housing, employment or credit.

A whole bunch of problems have come up for Facebook over the past year that are going to have consequences, said Brian Wieser, an analyst at Pivotal Research Group who closely follows Facebook.
Its something between sloppiness, an absence of consideration on a range of issues, and the simple challenges of managing a massive company growing at an unparalleled pace.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Facebooks annual revenue, nearly all of which comes from online ads, has more than tripled in the past four years to $27.6 billion in 2016, when it posted a net profit of $10.2 billion.
Separately, the company has also been working to repair its relationship with major advertisers after it disclosed about a year ago that some of its measurement tools were not delivering accurate results.
Facebook, which restricted how advertisers could target users after the publication of last weeks report by ProPublica, reinstated 5,000 of its most commonly used targeting terms, like nurse and teacher, after manually reviewing the options, Ms. Sandberg said in her post.
Ms. Sandberg also said that the company was working on a program to encourage Facebook users to report abuses of its ad system.
The move to add more human reviews is a good one and hopefully they can get ahead of the next issue that might arise in their powerful system, Mr. Paparo said.
This solves one of the main problems that restaurants used to have in the days when old media was the only game in town: How do you keep people talking about your place after the initial buzz dies down?

Besides the marketing, there are creative implications.
For one thing, chefs are much more focused now on sending out food that photographs well.
So I end up eating a lot of flowers and leaves that dont really taste like much but make the plate more colorful, because most cooked food is brown.
Ditto all the boards and slates and rocks that are being asked to stand in for plates.
It has also sped up the rate at which ideas about food travel from one place to another.
Chefs dont just use photography for marketing.
They are also documenting their work for their peers; you see this in the way Ren Redzepi in Copenhagen uses Instagram.
Its one reason his style has spread around the world in the span of just a few years.
And how has it changed the way you do your job?
What are the pros and cons?
The best thing about having everybody take pictures of food is that I can do it without giving myself away.
I used to be really self-conscious when I took out my phone; Id run to the restroom and take surreptitious notes in the stall.
Now I just snap away all night long, and I look like everybody else.
And photography is the first stage of my note-taking now.
After I get home I reconstruct my impressions of the meal, starting with my pictures of my food and the menu.
When I started this job, a former critic advised me to steal menus when I could get away with it, and thats completely unnecessary now.
Whats your opinion on Yelp, where everyone is a wannabe food critic?
I probably look at Yelp more than some other critics because Im convinced theres valuable information in there.
The hard part is extracting it from all the useless stuff, which is what most people in food media see when they look at Yelp.
The basic problem is that Yelp was built to reward frequent posting rather than knowledge or insight or expertise.
And yet there are people on Yelp who know a lot about food and eat around and have a pretty solid basis for comparison.
I find that Yelp is most useful with Korean, Chinese and Japanese food, because, for a number of reasons, there tend to be a lot of Yelpers who know those cuisines pretty well.
How do you feel about delivery apps like Instacart, Caviar or UberEats?
Do you use them much?
I dont.
I almost never eat at home, and when I do, I want to cook.
I did use Caviar in the context of a restaurant review a few weeks ago and was pretty happy with how well it worked.

Sites like Yelp give people plenty of information about restaurants.
Yet many restaurants still have their own websites.
Is this necessary?
Advertisement Continue reading the main story

The most valuable thing a restaurant can do on its website is post the current menu and drinks lists, with prices.
All the other data you might want, and theres not really very much, can be served up much more efficiently by Google, although I still think website designers who dont put the restaurants address and phone number and hours right on the home page should be sued for malpractice.
As our food critic, you have to stay unrecognized when you try new restaurants.
How do you do that in an era that demands us to sacrifice privacy on the internet?
This isnt a major issue.
People are always surprised when I say that, but its one of the things that has been least affected by technology.
Before we had digital photographs, restaurants would get their hands on some old head shot of the critic from a book jacket or something  Ruth Reichl, William Grimes and Frank Bruni had all written books before they were restaurant critics  and then photocopy it and share it with all their friends in the business.
I remember, in the 1990s, a friend who worked as a waiter showing me a picture of Ruth, who was the critic at the time.
It was probably a 15th-generation photocopy, but you could still recognize her.
Now the fidelity and resolution are higher, but the picture of me that most restaurants seem to have on their wall is about 10 years old.
There are a few more recent shots, taken across a dining room while I was eating, that are in circulation, but theyre pretty terrible.
My friends know theyre not supposed to put pictures of me on Facebook.
I dont take selfies, but I probably wouldnt be a selfie guy even if I had another job.
Most of the time when Im recognized its because somebody is working in that restaurant who waited on me in another place Ive reviewed.
I dont get caught by technology; I get caught by human memory.
Its sort of reassuring, I guess.
The main challenge is to reform the international tax framework, which was first designed at the start of the 20th century and is no longer fit for purpose, the report said.
It will be published by the commission on Thursday.
The existing system has worked well for traditional brick and mortar companies but as business activities have become more globalized and digitalized the old rules work less well, it continued.
It found that companies that did their business online were paying an effective tax rate of 8.5 percent, or less than half that paid by more traditional businesses.
The European Union stepped up its efforts to curb tax avoidance, by companies as well as wealthy individuals, after the financial crisis, which forced many of its member states to adopt belt-tightening measures, slashing public services and raising taxes.

But because big corporations were able to shift their profits to low-tax countries, critics of the austerity programs argued that the brunt of the cuts impacted small businesses and individual citizens.
In the years since, calls have increased for large companies to be more transparent and pay more tax.
American tech companies, in particular, have found themselves the targets of the commissions ire.
Commission officials are investigating Google and Qualcomm for allegedly abusing their dominant market position.
Officials in Brussels are looking into Amazons tax practices in Europe.
And the commission has demanded that Ireland recover about $14.5 billion in back taxes from Apple.
The commission said in its latest proposals that it wants to agree to a long-term solution with other countries around the world.
But that could take a long time to negotiate, and may not close enough loopholes, so it put forward several shorter-term plans that could wind up meaning companies like Amazon, Facebook and Netflix pay larger tax bills in Europe much sooner.
In the absence of adequate global progress, E.U.
solutions should be advanced, the commission said, adding that it could make more formal proposals on taxation in the coming months.

The potential reforms it outlined include taxing companies based on their revenue rather than their profits, allowing national authorities to tax payments made by consumers to digital businesses, and allowing individual countries to tax revenue generated from advertising by internet companies.
France has thrown its weight behind the first of those reforms, in particular.
But questions have been raised over whether taxing revenue is a viable plan.
Businesses that turn a hefty profit could effectively pay the same as a company of a similar size that has narrower margins, or even loses money.
The fundamental question is where is the business really being conducted, said J. Scott Marcus, an analyst at Bruegel, a research organization in Brussels.
The devil is in the details with a digital service across borders  the service can be made anywhere.
The question is who gets the tax, he continued.
Its a genuine challenge.
Heres a taste of what Caroline and I experienced playing the Super NES Classic Edition.
Installing the System

The console is easy to set up: Just plug it into a TV via the included HDMI cable.
After that, I had a blast exploring the dungeons of Hyrule in The Legend of Zelda and tossing TNT barrels in Donkey Kong Country.
In fact, I played so long, a creeping ache lead to worries about the onset of the dreaded Nintendo thumb.
But as fun as the retro games are, Nintendo did little to update the gameplay for modern audiences.
The Super NES Classic has no internet connection, so there is no way to compete online with friends.
(The console does come with a pair of controllers, allowing for two-player mode at home.)
And in a time of wireless technology that allows controllers to be used in any spot in a room, the Super NES Classic controllers are wired and plug into the console, which limits a players mobility and leaves a mess of cables draped over the floor.
The cables are longer than those of the NES Classic, but they are still only about five feet long.
I had to place the console on a chair in the middle of the room to play from the comfort of my couch.
Another limitation: The Super NES Classic has no slot for game cartridges, so if you hung on to your old Super NES games in the hopes of using them again, you are out of luck.
They will not work on this system.

Nintendo does offer games from past consoles for download for the Wii U through its Virtual Console service and, starting Wednesday, arcade games for the Switch through its Arcade Archives service.
Standout Features

But the Super NES Classic does have a few new and nifty features.
One is called Rewind, which lets players back up a minute or so in a game to restart difficult challenges.
And each game has four suspend points, allowing players to save a game midlevel  unlike in the original system, which forced you to rush to finish a level because your mother was calling you to dinner.
A feature called Frame also allows players to pick a border around games to fit todays wider-screen TVs.
The console also offers three display choices: the original 4:3 aspect ratio of the games, a CRT filter that replicates the same blurry look of cathode-ray tube TVs, and a Pixel Perfect mode that makes the games look crisp and clean.

Carolines Experience

Its hard to imagine that todays youth would want to play 16-bit games on an outmoded system when they are accustomed to ergonomic controllers, powerful processors, surround-sound audio and high-definition screens.
And the simple, side-scrolling gameplay of the past is no match for the interactive worlds created by augmented and virtual reality games.
So the real draw of the Super NES Classic is nostalgia.
Thats a theory I tested with Caroline.
Over the hour we played with the console together, she was drawn to the characters she recognized (Mario, yes; Samus Aran of Super Metroid, not so much).
She wanted to play Super Mario World, which she loved once she learned how to make Mario ride Yoshi.
But for a child used to touch controls on mobile devices, other games were harder.
Maneuvering Luigi around the track in Super Mario Kart proved to be too difficult, and she put the controller down after the first race and switched back to Minecraft on her Kindle.
I couldnt see what I was doing, she said of the fast and furious racing game.
Minecraft is simpler.
Bottom Line

The target for the Super NES Classic Edition is adults who grew up with the original console, which is still a big audience.
Learning a lesson after many outraged fans who sought the NES Classic last year were left empty-handed, Nintendo said it would increase inventory of the Super NES Classic this year.
It also said that the NES Classic would return to retail shelves next year.
The games of the Super NES Classic still stand the test of time as some of Nintendos finest.
But they feel trapped in the amber of an outdated console.
There may also be some early kinks for Apple to work out with the new cellular Watch.
Some reviewers discovered that the device occasionally lost its cellular connection, for example.
Apple said on Wednesday that the issue was related to the watch inadvertently connecting to open Wi-Fi networks that lacked internet connectivity, and that it was investigating a software fix.
In the end, some people who want a wearable device for things like fitness tracking and a quick glance at mobile notifications will probably be happy with the Series 3 without cellular, which costs $329.
An Overview

Like its predecessors, the Apple Watch Series 3 is a computer worn around the wrist, with a miniature touch screen.
Photo

The device requires an iPhone to set up and work properly.
Notifications like text messages or social media alerts that come to your iPhone appear on the watch first if you are not actively using the phone.
The watch runs apps, including some built-in software for fitness tracking as well as third-party widgets you can download from the App Store.
The main difference with the cellular Apple Watch is that some important features, like placing calls, texting and streaming music, will work when you are not near your phone; the watch shares the same phone number and cellular plan with your iPhone.
To help determine whether the cellular watch is right for you, I abandoned my iPhone to test the watch in a number of common situations.
Heres how that went.
Date Night

Over the weekend, my partner and I made plans to go to dinner at a sushi restaurant.
I used the Apple Watch to summon a Lyft car to pick us up at home.

At the sushi bar, I liked that I didnt have a smartphone constantly buzzing in my pocket, though I got a text that I quickly responded to on the watch using an emoji.
My partner and I enjoyed 90 minutes of intimate conversation over omakase with minimal distraction, though I was a bit envious that she could Instagram our gorgeous nigiri.
(Alas, the watch does not have a miniature spy camera.)
Verdict: I could have had roughly the same experience with just an iPhone put on Do Not Disturb mode  and a bit of self-discipline.
Dog Walks

For several days, I wore just the watch while walking my dogs.
Not having a phone freed up valuable space in my pockets for other items, like my keys, my wallet, dog treats and bags.
I liked that the Apple Watch tracked my steps and walking distance to make dog walking feel more like exercise than a chore.
I placed a call to my partner with the watch to tell her where to meet me at a park; she said the call sounded crystal clear.
It was also nice that with just the watch, I could still be reachable via phone or text by my colleagues during morning walks  but emails took several minutes to show up after they were sent.
It turns out that while texts and calls are done directly on the cellular watch, emails still rely on the iPhones pushing emails to the cloud, which then transmits the message to your watch.
Verdict: The watch is good for staying reachable via phone or texts.
But in those brief moments when you need to step away from a computer during work hours, a smartphone is still necessary if you rely heavily on email, as I do.

Gym Workouts

I wore the watch and took a pair of AirPods, Apples wireless earbuds, to a rock-climbing gym.
Again, I left my iPhone behind.
At the gym, I opened the Workout app to track my heart rate and calories burned throughout the workout.
During breaks, I used Siri to write a few quick texts to some friends to make plans for the week.
I put on the AirPods in the hope of streaming songs on the watch from Apple Music, only to realize that this capability has not yet been released.
Apple said music streaming for the cellular watch will come out next month.
Verdict: It was nice being able to stay in touch with people at the gym without a phone bulging in my pocket, but Id be happy unplugging for a while and tracking my workout with a noncellular Apple Watch.
As for whether streaming music makes a cellular watch worth owning, I unfortunately cant tell you yet.

Grocery Shopping

Heres where leaving my phone behind and relying only on the watch did not make sense: during grocery shopping.
The watch doesnt have a web browser, let alone a big enough screen, for looking up recipes.
But when it came time to check out, I hit the side button to activate Apple Pay and quickly paid for the groceries.
Verdict: A smartphone is a better shopping companion than a watch.
The Bottom Line

The value of the cellular capabilities on the Apple Watch is questionable considering the price you pay each month.
AT&T and Verizon Wireless, for example, charge a network access fee of $10 a month to share your phone plans texts, minutes and data with an Apple Watch.
Thats about the same as a Spotify subscription, but with the exception of avid joggers and gym rats, people may not use the cellular features frequently enough.
Hopefully, over time, Apple will negotiate with carriers to bring the monthly rate down.
Although I think most people can skip buying the cellular model, the Apple Watch Series 3 is the first smart watch I can confidently recommend that people buy.
While I dont personally find it attractive enough to replace my wristwatch, the new Apple Watch is a well-designed, durable and easy-to-use fitness tracker for people who want analytics on their workouts and general health (R.I.P., Fitbit).
Important features like the stopwatch, calendar and Siri work quickly and reliably.
And unlike its predecessors, the watch has impressive battery life  on average, I had more than 40 percent battery remaining after a full day of use.
So the final verdict?
The Apple Watch Series 3 is the first sign that wearable computers are maturing and may eventually become a staple in consumer electronics.
Unsurprisingly, both the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus are very good phones.
Most of Apples improvements over the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus are minor, but if you have an older model, either of the 8s will feel like a solid upgrade.
And if you are considering upgrading from an Android phone, theres one area where the new iPhones still rank head and shoulders above their competition  the processor, the engine that runs the entire device, where Apple is so far ahead that it almost feels unfair.
Photo

But lets start with the basics.
The iPhones overall design is very slightly improved in the 8.
The new models have a glass back, which you would think would make them more delicate but which actually adds a slight grippiness, making them less prone to catastrophe.
(Id still use a case for the 8 Plus, which I find ungainly to hold; the 8, though, shines in its caseless glory.)
The glass back allows for the iPhone 8s handiest new feature, wireless charging.
This works just as it does on the many other phones that have long sported this trick: Set the phone down on a charging pad and it just starts charging, even through most cases.
Apple said it would release its own charging mat next year; for now, you can use one of the many third-party mats that run the Qi wireless standard.
(Over all, battery life on the 8 was comparable to that of the 7  it lasted all day with light use, about half a day with heavy use, and always not long enough.)
The display on the 8 and 8 Plus is better than on the 7, but only very slightly.
In particular, the screen uses a technology Apple calls True Tone, which automatically adjusts the displays white balance to match the lighting in your surroundings.
This adds a subtle vibrancy to everything you see  though honestly the only time I was able to appreciate it was when I compared it side by side with the iPhone 7.
In other ways, the display is where the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus fall furthest short of their rivals.
The 8s use a technology called LCD, while Apples rivals in the high-end phone market, including Samsung, use a newer screen technology called OLED.
I wont get into the differences here except to say OLEDs are noticeably superior  they produce more vibrant colors and deeper contrast ratios.
Even Apple seems to agree, given that OLED is the basis for the display in the iPhone X.
The cameras in the 8s are very good, which is always true of cameras in the iPhone.
My kid had a birthday party this weekend, and just before leaving for the venue, I decided to take a risk  I left my fancy interchangeable-lens mirrorless camera at home, and instead took just the 8 Plus.
It would be too much to say that the phone produced images comparable to those I could get on my dedicated camera.
In some indoor, low-light shots, Apples noise-reduction algorithm left an annoying watercolorlike ripple on my shots (a problem that has plagued previous iPhones, too).

But that was the exception.
Most images were astounding, and given the iPhone 8s advantages in size, convenience and usability, I predict that my camera will be spending a lot more time in the drawer.
In particular, I fell hard for the 8 Pluss Portrait Lighting feature, which uses data from a depth sensor to mimic the blurred-background bokeh effect you get when taking portraits with expensive cameras.
That feature made its debut last year on the iPhone 7 Plus, but in the 8 Plus, its been further refined to let you adjust the lighting of each shot, making for breathtaking portraits that youll be surprised came from a mere phone.

 But the best thing about the 8 and 8 Plus is whats most hidden: Its the processor that powers everything else.
The first thing I usually do when I get a new iPhone is run a benchmark app to get a sense of the kind of power Im dealing with.
(Yeah, Im real fun.)
For the last few years, Apples phones have been producing benchmark scores so high you wonder if theyre powered by some kind of black magic.
For instance, on Geekbench 4, one of the more popular benchmark apps, the iPhone 8 gets a single-core processor score of around 4,200.
That makes it about 25 percent faster than the iPhone 7 and about 80 percent faster than the iPhone 6S.
The fastest Android phones, though, are painfully behind.
With a Geekbench score of around 1,900, Samsungs flagship Galaxy S8 is not just half the speed of the iPhone 8, but its actually slower than last years iPhone 7, and even slower than the iPhone 6S, released in 2015.
In fact, Apples phones are now so powerful that the closest rivals arent phones but computers  for instance, the processor in the iPhone gets benchmarking scores comparable to the Intel chips found in some of Apples latest MacBook Pro laptops.
I spoke to several processor analysts about why Apple is so far ahead on processing power.
They explained that Apple can produce these gains because it designs its own processors, while its competitors rely on chips created by third parties.
And performance matters.
Everything you do on a phone is improved by better chips: The interface is more responsive, advanced graphical features like augmented reality (in which digital scenes are interposed on the real world) work more fluidly, and they allow for groundbreaking new features, like the face-detection system Apple built into the iPhone X.
And while experts said Apples lead might slip over time, for now, its advantage remains enormous enough to make the iPhone a must for people who think of their phones as their most important computing device  in other words, you and me and everyone we know.

Q. I thought Instagram now lets you post photos that arent in the standard square format, but its still cropping my pictures.
Also, is it changing the resolution of my original image when I upload it?
A. Instagram supports photos in the rectangular landscape and portrait orientations  as long as you switch it from the default square shape before you upload the file.
To do that, tap the round gray arrow icon in the bottom corner of the image preview.

Instagrams help guide says the service supports photos and videos only with aspect ratios between 1.91:1 (a horizontal wide-screen/landscape shape) and 4:5 (a vertical portrait shape); the traditional square shape has an aspect ratio of 1:1.
If the photo you upload is not in one of Instagrams supported aspect ratios, it will be cropped automatically.
As for the image quality, Instagram does not change the picture resolution if the photo has a width from 320 to 1,080 pixels, as long as the file is in one of the supported aspect ratios.
Small, low-resolution photos are enlarged to a width of 320 pixels when you upload them to the service, which may distort them.
Most decent smartphones these days take fairly high-resolution resolution photos  12-megapixel (or better) cameras are common now in the flagship models from Apple, Google, LG, Samsung and other companies.
The photos these mobile cameras can produce are typically much larger than 1,080 pixels wide, but if you upload a picture that is bigger than Instagrams requirements, the service resizes the image to meet the maximum 1,080-pixel width.
I bought a multicooker almost a year ago to report on for this newspaper.
I figured that after publishing my article, Id stick the machine in the basement with all the other once-in-a-while appliances (like that electric deep fryer).
Then Id dig it out for braising the occasional large hunk of meat to tender perfection, which, as I immediately discovered, it does better than any other piece of equipment  Dutch ovens and slow cookers included.
Over time, though, the multicooker became so embedded in the rhythm of my everyday cooking that I never unplugged it.
I ended up writing my new cookbook for it, Dinner in an Instant (Clarkson Potter), as well as an in-depth guide at NYT Cooking.
It was the slow cooker that went into storage, where it will remain until my next stoop sale.
What I especially love about the multicooker is its inherent flexibility, pleasing cooks of all temperaments.
Photo

If youre an organized, plan-ahead type of person, you can use your multicooker exactly like a slow cooker.
Just use the slow-cook setting with any of your old favorite slow-cooker recipes without even having to adjust them.
Culinary procrastinators, on the other hand, can take full advantage of the pressure setting, which cooks food in minutes instead of hours.
Im in the latter camp, and so this is my routine: On the way home from work, I stop at the store for some beans or grains or a package of chicken thighs.
I throw them into the pot with a mix of interesting seasonings.
Then I make a salad while the pot does its thing.
Photo

Thats it.
A satisfying dish that would normally take an hour or more is on the table in 20 to 30 minutes.

Now earthy soups, supple stews and luscious braises are within reach for winter weeknights, instead of being relegated to weekends when I have hours to let them simmer.
In the summer I can quickly cook beans and grains for salads without heating up the kitchen, or steam artichokes without having to stare at a pot on the stove.
I dont even have to be home.
No matter the season, my basic strategy for using my multicooker on weeknights remains constant: I estimate how many minutes I have before I want dinner to be on the table, and work backward from there.
Often, getting my meal done in the shortest amount of time is simply a matter of how you cut up the ingredients  the smaller the pieces, the faster they will cook.
So while a whole brisket or boneless pork shoulder might take 90 minutes to braise under pressure, beef stew meat cut into 1-inch pieces, or pork ribs cut into two or three rib sections, will be tender in 20 to 25 minutes.
Save the large, impressive, company-worthy pieces of meat for when you have more time.
You can apply the same method for dense root vegetables like beets and potatoes.
While whole roots usually need about 20 to 30 minutes to cook, slices or cubes take 5 to 10 minutes.
Because I rarely plan ahead, one of my favorite multicooker tricks is to cook dried beans on a weeknight without soaking them first.
Of course, you cant cut them up to make them cook more quickly, but you can select smaller beans.
When time is tight, buy lentils, split peas or adzuki beans, which cook from their dried, unsoaked state in under 20 minutes.
Save the chickpeas, kidney beans and cannellinis for when youve got close to an hour.
Q. Microsoft Word 2016 comes with plenty of templates, but none of them are quite what I want.
Is there a way to modify one of the stock business letters into a multipage document with my own letterhead?
A. Microsoft Word 2016 for Windows and Mac comes with a variety of page templates you can use to create different types of documents like letters, reports, rsums, brochures, labels and fliers.
If you have not found a template that suits your needs, you can modify one and save it.
You can also look in the online template library on Microsofts site at templates.office.com, or you can create your own template from scratch.
Photo

To design your own template, create a new Word document just as you normally would and set it up as letterhead with your name, address, logo graphics, headers and footers, and anything else you want.
You can insert a page break and put in placeholder text to create a multipage file.
When the document looks the way you want it, go to the File menu and select Save As.
In the Save As box in the Windows version of Word, choose the option to store the file on your computer and give it a recognizable name, as you normally would with a new document.
In the Save as Type menu, click the drop-down menu and choose Word Template instead of the regular document format.
Click the Save button to store the new template in Words folder for custom Office templates.
(In Word 2016 for Mac, go to the File menu and choose Save as Template.)
Later, when you want to use your new letterhead template, open Word.
In the Windows version, go into the File menu to New, choose Personal and select your template.
In the Mac edition, go to the File menu, choose New from Template and select your creation from the thumbnails.
A new document opens based on your template design, and this time you can save it as a standard Word document and start writing.
When it comes to streaming and downloading movies, do you really notice that much of a difference between standard definition and the high-definition version?
A. High-definition (HD) files pack considerably more pixels into the video than those classified as standard definition (SD), and in side-by-side comparisons, the sharpness of the picture and depth of the colors in an HD video can stand out.
You may want to sample both formats on a similar type of movie and see which version you prefer.
Photo

Online video services typically label movies by the number of pixels in their vertical dimension; more pixels generally mean a sharper picture.
HD movies are usually classified as 1,080p or 720p (referring to the resolutions of 1,280 by 720 pixels or 1,920 by 1,080 pixels).
Movies in standard definition have lower resolutions and can vary based on the provider, but a sample SD movie downloaded from iTunes has a resolution of 853 by 352 pixels.
If you are watching the movie on a small tablet, phone or other screen, SD video quality is usually just fine.
Standard-definition videos are less expensive to buy, often by about $5, and $1 or $2 less to rent in some online stores.
Certain devices cannot fully display HD video anyway because the screens lack the needed resolution or the hardware is not compatible.
(Some files may automatically download in standard definition anyway depending on the device you are using.)
Because they contain more data, downloaded HD videos need more bandwidth to stream and, when downloaded, take up more space on your device.
For example, the 720p HD version of The Martian in Apples iTunes Store is a 5.36-gigabyte file, while the SD edition weighs in at 2.54 gigabytes.
If you are downloading a movie to a mobile device to watch offline, the SD edition is a space saver.
If you plan to watch the movie on a high-definition television or high-resolution computer monitor, though, SD video can look flatter and less vibrant than the HD version.
Many video services are now offering movies and television shows in yet another format: ultra high-definition, also known as 4K for its 3,840 by 2,160 pixels of resolution.
Amazon, Apple, Google, Microsoft, Netflix, Roku, Vudu and YouTube are among the services with 4K content or devices; video in the 4K H.D.R.
(high dynamic range) format is also available from some services.
To properly appreciate the clarity and color depth of the newer formats, you need a TV or monitor that can actually display 4K or 4K H.D.R.
video  and a lot more bandwidth to stream or store the file.
Is it true that Google Drive is being discontinued?
A. Google announced this month that it will end support for the Google Drive desktop apps for Windows and Mac computers on Dec. 11 and that the software will be shut down for good on March 12.
But while those handy desktop programs for managing your files in the cloud are destined for retirement, Googles online backup service is not going anywhere soon.
You just get to it through different desktop programs.
(You can also continue to just upload and download stored files through your Google Account in a web browser.)
For desktop users who backed up files to cloud servers with the Google Drive app, the company has two newer programs to do the job instead.
The Backup and Sync app for Windows and Mac, introduced in July, is Googles software for users of its free services.
The program can be set to synchronize copies of locally stored photos and other files on the computer to Googles cloud servers.
(Note that you get a free 15 gigabytes of storage from Google, but if you max it out, you need to buy more space if you want to keep storing all your files on the companys servers.)
Photo

Business customers using the paid G Suite version of Googles Gmail, calendar and business programs have a choice.
They can use Backup and Sync, too, or switch to the new Drive File Stream app for Windows or Mac.
Drive File Stream has been available since March for early adopters and officially arrives on Tuesday.
Google recommends that its business customers use the Drive File Stream for a few reasons, including faster data-sync times.
Additionally, the app stores the files online for direct use and puts less corporate data on the users hard drives; specific files and folders can be marked for local storage and use offline when an internet connection is not available.
Users running both Backup and Sync and Drive File Stream on the same computer will get a nudge from Google to switch to the latter app to save disk space.
Those still using the Google Drive app will begin to see alerts next month announcing that the software is headed to the digital dustbin.
This solves one of the main problems that restaurants used to have in the days when old media was the only game in town: How do you keep people talking about your place after the initial buzz dies down?
Photo

Besides the marketing, there are creative implications.
For one thing, chefs are much more focused now on sending out food that photographs well.
So I end up eating a lot of flowers and leaves that dont really taste like much but make the plate more colorful, because most cooked food is brown.
Ditto all the boards and slates and rocks that are being asked to stand in for plates.
It has also sped up the rate at which ideas about food travel from one place to another.
Chefs dont just use photography for marketing.
They are also documenting their work for their peers; you see this in the way Ren Redzepi in Copenhagen uses Instagram.
Its one reason his style has spread around the world in the span of just a few years.
And how has it changed the way you do your job?
What are the pros and cons?
The best thing about having everybody take pictures of food is that I can do it without giving myself away.
I used to be really self-conscious when I took out my phone; Id run to the restroom and take surreptitious notes in the stall.
Now I just snap away all night long, and I look like everybody else.
And photography is the first stage of my note-taking now.
After I get home I reconstruct my impressions of the meal, starting with my pictures of my food and the menu.
When I started this job, a former critic advised me to steal menus when I could get away with it, and thats completely unnecessary now.
Whats your opinion on Yelp, where everyone is a wannabe food critic?
I probably look at Yelp more than some other critics because Im convinced theres valuable information in there.
The hard part is extracting it from all the useless stuff, which is what most people in food media see when they look at Yelp.
The basic problem is that Yelp was built to reward frequent posting rather than knowledge or insight or expertise.
And yet there are people on Yelp who know a lot about food and eat around and have a pretty solid basis for comparison.
I find that Yelp is most useful with Korean, Chinese and Japanese food, because, for a number of reasons, there tend to be a lot of Yelpers who know those cuisines pretty well.
How do you feel about delivery apps like Instacart, Caviar or UberEats?
Do you use them much?
I dont.
I almost never eat at home, and when I do, I want to cook.
I did use Caviar in the context of a restaurant review a few weeks ago and was pretty happy with how well it worked.

Sites like Yelp give people plenty of information about restaurants.
Yet many restaurants still have their own websites.
Is this necessary?
Advertisement Continue reading the main story

The most valuable thing a restaurant can do on its website is post the current menu and drinks lists, with prices.
All the other data you might want, and theres not really very much, can be served up much more efficiently by Google, although I still think website designers who dont put the restaurants address and phone number and hours right on the home page should be sued for malpractice.
As our food critic, you have to stay unrecognized when you try new restaurants.
How do you do that in an era that demands us to sacrifice privacy on the internet?
This isnt a major issue.
People are always surprised when I say that, but its one of the things that has been least affected by technology.
Before we had digital photographs, restaurants would get their hands on some old head shot of the critic from a book jacket or something  Ruth Reichl, William Grimes and Frank Bruni had all written books before they were restaurant critics  and then photocopy it and share it with all their friends in the business.
I remember, in the 1990s, a friend who worked as a waiter showing me a picture of Ruth, who was the critic at the time.
It was probably a 15th-generation photocopy, but you could still recognize her.
Now the fidelity and resolution are higher, but the picture of me that most restaurants seem to have on their wall is about 10 years old.
There are a few more recent shots, taken across a dining room while I was eating, that are in circulation, but theyre pretty terrible.
My friends know theyre not supposed to put pictures of me on Facebook.
I dont take selfies, but I probably wouldnt be a selfie guy even if I had another job.
Most of the time when Im recognized its because somebody is working in that restaurant who waited on me in another place Ive reviewed.
I dont get caught by technology; I get caught by human memory.
Its sort of reassuring, I guess.
