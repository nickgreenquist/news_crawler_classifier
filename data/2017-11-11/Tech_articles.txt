What it’s like cooking with meal kit startup Chef’d:::::Meal kits have been in the mainstream as of late thanks to Blue Apron going public and HelloFreshs IPO pricing.Ive tried both Blue Apron and HelloFresh before, but I dont like being locked into some subscription, so I decided to go with Chefd this time around.Chefd, which raised $35.2 million in August from strategic investors like pork producer Smithfield Foods and online grocer Fresh Direct, is different in that you dont need to subscribe to anything, ever.There is, however, an option to set up a recurring meal kit plan.Chefd also partners with The New York Times as the exclusive meal kit for the publications cooking section, Coca-Cola, WeightWatchers and other brands.For my first go with Chefd, I ordered three meals kits with two servings each: pork and udon noodles, gnocchi and salmon.The total cost came out to $88, including shipping.First up was the roasted glazed salmon, which Chefd told me to expect to spend 30 minutes prepping and cooking.That estimate ended up being true, taking me about 29 minutes from the second I started pre-heating the broiler to the moment I put the salmon on my plate.The directions were easy to follow and required very little preparation.The hardest part for me was zesting the lemon.I had to Google what that even meant, but I was good to go once I figured it out.In the process, I learned how to zest a lemon, and cooked kale and okra for the first time in my life.The pork and udon dish was super easy, but the gnocchi preparation is what gave me a hard time.Unbeknownst to me, Chefd warned me that the gnocchi dish would be hard clocking the prep time at 45 minutes but I somehow missed that label before I placed my order.The most time-extensive part was the actual gnocchi preparation, which entailed mixing up flour, eggs and ricotta, rolling it out and then cutting them up into smaller, gnocchi-sized pieces.Had I known I wouldve been making gnocchi from scratch, Im not sure I wouldve picked this dish.But, surprisingly, I had a lot of fun.And it only took me about 10 minutes longer than Chefd said it would.In the last year, Ive been to the grocery store no more than four times and Ive cooked for myself about the same amount.What Im about to say is probably not news for anyone who is comfortable in the kitchen and makes meals for themselves on the regular, but cooking is a lot of fun.And its quite a rewarding experience.Thats what the promise of these meal kits is about.Its about teaching people how to cook.Its about democratizing access to healthy ingredients by getting rid of the requirement to be close to a grocery store.Its about minimizing the amount of thinking involved in the decision-making process around what to make.But its also not necessarily for those without a healthy, steady income.Some meal kit companies, however, are thinking about this.Plated, for example, is seeking authorization to accept SNAP benefits (food stamps) for meal kits.Already, the U.S. Department of Agriculture has a pilot program in place to allow those with food stamps to purchase groceries online through Amazon Fresh and Fresh Direct.As of now, no meal kits are authorized to do so.The meal kit aftermath Meal kit startups have received a good amount of flack for the amount of waste they leave behind.Its important that meal kit companies ensure the food arrives at a safe temperature.But its at a cost to the environment.Chefd, Blue Apron, HelloFresh and the gang of meal kit companies all package their meal kits similarly in a large cardboard box thats insulated with a foam liner.The ingredients are individually packaged in plastic and stay cold thanks to several ice packs.The box is easy enough to recycle.But the foam liner needs to be taken to a polyurethane recycling depot!I didnt even know those existed.Chefd says the foam liner is reusable, but in what normal context one would reuse it, Im not sure.TL;DR about foam liner recycling is that the foam liner is currently sitting in my closet because I havent made it to the polyurethane recycling depot yet.My overall experience with Chefd was solid, but it did have a bit of a rocky start.I placed my order on a Monday for a Wednesday delivery, but the box didnt arrive until Saturday due to some weirdness on the companys end processing my credit card, and then some system issue.Because of the delay, Chefd gave me a $30 code to use on a future order.My rationale for placing another order via Chefd instead of from some other meal kit company comes down to not being locked into a subscription.It also didnt hurt that they gave me a discount code to use on my next order.It took me a full week to get around to cooking all three meals and eating the leftovers.Blue Apron and HelloFresh like to remind people that they can pause their subscriptions whenever, but Id rather just not be locked in from the get-go.
Physical storage startup Makespace has a new CEO to represent it:::::Makespace, one of the many startups that launched to give consumers a new option for storing their stuff, has a new chief executive, TechCrunch has confirmed.The companys thirty year-old co-founder and chief executive Sam Rosen is stepping down to make room at the top for Rahul Gandhi, Rosens fellow founder and Makespaces chief operating officer.News of the change at the top was first reported in Wired.The 37 year-old Gandhi said the executive change had full approval of the board and discussions had been underway for the last several months.Always more operationally minded than Rosen, Gandhi said that along the way we always had conversations that as the business would hit scale he would hand over the keys.New York-based Makespace has raised $57.6 million in financing from leading venture capital firms including Upfront Ventures and 8VC.Some of the New Yorks biggest names in sports and entertainment like Carmelo Anthony and Nasir Nas Jones have invested in the company, along with Winkelvoss Capital the investment vehicle for the Winkelvoss twins.Since its launch the company has signed up thousands of customers, according to Gandhi and is on pace to double its revenue this year.Gandhi and Rosen met through University of Virginia alumni networks and became friends.A former investor with the firm Primary Ventures, Gandhi left his role at the firm to help Cohen build out Makespace.Makespace isnt the only company to try and haul off with some of the physical storage industry.Los Angeles-based Clutter has raised nearly $100 million to go after the same opportunity and the company recently expanded its services from simply storing items to moving them as well.
These are the US startups that Russian investors are backing:::::A taxi-hailing app.A transplant device developer.An online mortgage provider.Those businesses may have little in common, but one shared thread is that U.S. startups in these sectors have all secured large funding rounds led by Russia-based investors.Theyre not alone.Over the past seven years, Russia-based strategic and venture investors have participated in more than 300 funding rounds for U.S.-based startups, according to Crunchbase data.Investments span all stages, major sectors and round sizes, and include both equity and debt financings.(See deal list here.)The cross-border deal-making isnt limited to Russian investors backing U.S. startups.Venture firms based in the U.S. have invested in more than 150 funding rounds for Russian startups over the past decade, with a particular focus on e-commerce and consumer internet deals.Well look at those trends in the second installment of this two-part series.In this first installment, well focus on Russia-backed rounds for U.S. startups.Below, we look at the year-over-year trends, highlight some of the biggest deals and most active investors and look at what the data set does not include.Russia-U.S. investment over the years A Crunchbase News analysis of deals involving Russian investors backing U.S. startups found that deal counts began picking up in 2011.Activity peaked in 2012, and it held relatively steady over the next three years.In the chart below, we look at the number of rounds per year for U.S. startups that included a Russia-based investor and the totals raised in those rounds.The investment totals reflect capital from all backers, not just Russia-based ones.Overall, Russian investment activity looks to be lessening in 2016 and 2017, with fewer rounds recorded.In the chart below, we look at U.S. startup rounds involving a Russia-based lead investor.The number of deals with a Russian lead investor peaked in 2012, dipped over the next three years and has been trending up in the past two years.These are the active investors A number of Russia-based investors have backed multiple U.S. startups, and a few are particularly active.Among cross-stage investors, Moscow-based Bright Capital looks to be the most active.The firm has participated in 30 seed through growth-stage financing rounds for U.S. companies, with a focus on cleantech, biotech and IT.At the seed stage, Impulse VC has been quite active, participating in about a dozen rounds since 2013.And Skolkovo Foundation, which is supported by the Russian government, has extended grants or seed investments to at least 8 U.S. startups in the past six years.Banks also have done a number of deals.VTB Capital Investment Management, a subsidiary of Russian government-controlled VTB Bank, has participated in funding rounds for at least four U.S.-based startups.Its most recent funding round was in 2016, for storage technology developer Avalanche Technology.Sberbank, Russias biggest bank, has been active, as well.The bank was involved in two of the largest cross-border deals in the past year: a $100 million debt round for taxi app Gett and a $57 million Series C for online mortgage provider LendingHome.Meanwhile, on the strategic side, one of the busiest U.S. startup backers is Russian pharmaceutical firm Pharmstandard, which has led or joined funding rounds for at least six (listed here) U.S. life science companies.The Moscow-based company was a lead investor in funding rounds for TransMedics, a transplant device developer; Argos Therapeutics, a now-public cancer immunotherapy developer; and Avelas Biosciences, which is working on technology used in cancer surgery.To give an idea of the breadth of investments, we look at the largest U.S. funding rounds in recent years that involved a Russia-based lead investor: Whos not included (and why it matters) It should be noted that the Crunchbase data sets may not reflect the full extent of Russian involvement in the U.S. startup ecosystem.For one, the data is limited to funds and investors based in Russia.That means it leaves out Russian billionaire Yuri Milners DST Global, which is headquartered in Hong Kong.Milner is the most high-profile Russian national actively investing in U.S. tech companies.Although his personal investments are included in the Crunchbase data set, DSTs are not.Thats significant as, since 2009, DST has participated in at least 23 funding rounds for U.S. companies, mostly not as a lead investor.Deals include many of the most prominent internet companies, including Facebook in 2009, Airbnb in 2011, Twitter in 2011 and Slack in 2015.(See the full list here.)Russian nationals, firms and government-run entities also can participate in startup funding as limited partners, which are generally passive stakeholders in venture funds.DST, for instance, counts banking conglomerate VTB Bank, which is majority-owned by the Russian government, among its limited partner investors.The data set does not include investments by non-Russian firms with Russia-based limited partners.Looking ahead Where is Russia-U.S. startup investment likely to go from here?Its noteworthy that the number of U.S. startup financings involving Russian investors is down in 2017 from prior peaks, along with investment totals.Perhaps theres greater caution in the startup community around the sourcing of capital.There were some hints of this in a New York Times report examining how the election hacking story is impacting Silicon Valley and its large Russian immigrant population.The paper reported that some Russian venture capitalists have said startups are more wary about taking their funding.
Imagining Instagram: Stories-first:::::Time spent by people watching Instagram Stories which is temporary sharing with private replies that launched in August 2016 could someday significantly surpass time spent in the Instagram Feed, which is the permanent stream of photos and videos with comments that launched in October 2010.Although numbers comparing sharing and time spent between Stories and Feed are not available, theres more to be done.This feels credible to me for reasons such as Stories is largely video, according to the Instagram CEO, and video sharing and watching videos on Instagram are going up over time as a percentage of both time spent and total posts.As of June, video watch-time on Instagram is up 80 percent year-over-year and the number of videos shared is up 4x.From June 2016 to April 2017, Instagram grew monthly active users by 40 percent.Before Stories launched, there was a question about a per user Feed photo sharing decrease.A year after Stories launched, people younger than 25 spent 32 minutes per day on Instagram on average, and people 25 years and older spent more than 24 minutes per day.That compares to 21 minutes per day on average for all Instagram users in October 2014.Instagram Stories currently has more than 300 million daily active users, and that compares to Instagrams total 500 million daily active users in September.I often visit Instagram only to watch Stories without scrolling through the Feed.I believe Stories-first is happening with how Instagram is used, but Instagram is not yet designed to be Stories-first.At a minimum, the Feed must be improved to the standard of Stories, and Stories must be featured equal to its significant current and expected usage.How would you imagine Instagram would work if Stories were made first, and Feed didnt exist?And what if only now Feed were designed and introduced?Viewing Stories full-screen makes sense, which may help explain why its largely video.However, the scrolling technique used in Feed today obscures that video because the top or bottom is cut off during scrolls, and scrolling can require more than one gesture such as swipe up and then press to stop just to get the next post on the screen.This can cause the user to miss the beginning of the video and also split their focus, while taking more time than necessary.So I felt a need to create a new design.How could Instagram change from Feed-first to Stories-first?Today, Feed scrolling is the primary focus of Instagrams design.When opening the app, the Feed uses 68.29 percent of screen space on iPhone 7 Plus.Meanwhile, Stories is displayed as one horizontal row below the top of the app, assigned 22.55 percent of screen space.Lets first consider the differences between Instagram Stories and Instagram Feed, and how they could become more similar or different: Stories core: A: Delete in 24 hours B: Replies are private messages C: Shows who viewed your Story Feed core: D: Permanently shared unless deleted E: Hearts and comments are visible to anyone who can view the post Stories current design: A: Small circle profile photo or thumbnail B: One-tap to next post, or swipe left to next Story C: Photo shown for 3 seconds, and video shown once D: Swipe up to privately reply, or swipe down to close Feed current design: E: Full-width of video/photo is shown, and conforms to dimensions 1:1 for square, 1.91:1 for landscape or 4:5 for portrait F: Name/profile photo appear outside of the video/photo with caption/comments/buttons G: Scroll up to view more Feed posts Imagine combining features across Stories and Feed.What if Stories included comments?Or if Feed was one tap to advance?Applying learnings from how Stories appears to have made video the focus, a new approach to Feed may increase how many videos are shared, increase the ratio of videos-to-photos shared and increase how long people want to watch videos on Instagram.Please let me know your comments/feedback about my design by messaging here.In addition to the video and gif above, I also show below how each feature works in my design.My design for Stories-first with Feed Generally, I think this approach could help bring together the user experiences of Feed and Stories, while preserving the distinctions that make each useful.Feed and Stories always one swipe away Easily switch between Stories and Feed and vice versa at any time.Imagine if you could open the app, tap on Feed and watch for a while what your friends have been sharing and commenting.Then with just one swipe down, you can return to the main screen, which shows up to thee rows of five Stories each.Then you can tap on friends Stories you want to watch for a while and send back private replies for some.Then switch back to Feed to check out more updates, and so on.Below, you start each side at the fifth Feed Story, then open the NYC Story, then go to the sixth Feed Story.A bar appears in the middle when finished, and indicates that Stories-first is faster: You can switch to view three big thumbnails of Stories per row, then view more Stories or go back to the Feed.Today, Instagram shows these larger previews of recent Stories sometimes when you scroll in the Feed, but not at the top of the app.Full-screen Feed posts with one tap to next post This is a much faster and easier way to look at content, and it can be done simply with one hand holding the phone.Tap through multiple videos/photos included in an album post.Feed still shows only one post, and focus remains on ranking Feed based on content shared.In contrast, Stories shows all of someones posts for that day.There is no sharing of who viewed each Feed post, so a distinction between Feed and Stories is preserved.Cropping/editing tools of Feed posts would now be included as editing options after making a video/photo in Camera and after selecting from Camera Roll.Note that any dimension video/photo can be posted to the Feed, including using full width/height of available space.Press on the Feed post to show only the videos/photos, then release to show text and buttons over the videos/photos again.You also can opt to show no animation from right to left when a new Feed post is shown, so the focus can remain on the content, without needing to look at the animation.Press then swipe up to heart The gesture replaces double-tap to heart so one tap is to advance.Note that if you swipe up and the heart appears, then you can still swipe down and the heart will not have been sent.A heart is only sent upon release of press after swipe up.Watch Feed in 22 full screen and tap a Feed post to expand to full size Showing a 22 of Feed posts lets you view four posts per screen, so you can scan a bunch of posts to decide what to view.Tap on the right side to go to the next 22, or tap on the left edge to return.Just tap on a Feed post in a 22 to open to full screen of that post, so theres a clearer view of the post.Tap Profile, then tap to open Grid, then one-tap to next post This is a fast way to check out profile posts with just one tap, so the design of viewing Profile and viewing Feed are compatible.Turn on Stories comments and require approval for comments before sharing You can choose which posts you may want to share to view responses.Comments in Stories provide a space to share responses among viewers.While knowing the default is the comments are deleted with the Story, this may inspire people to share more comments.A purpose of the option to review all comments before posting is for the person posting to feel more control over the comments added to their content.Turn on or off comments by using the camera, then tapping Next for the selector.Tap on the comment icon to reply with a comment on a Story, or swipe up to privately reply.So even with comments on, there remains a default focus on private replies.Choose each Story video/photo to expire after 6 hours, 24 hours, 1 week, 1 month or 6 months You can change the expiration time for each Story you share in order to control the amount of time the Stories appear.The default time remains 24 hours.Remove read Stories when tap Feed, and Feed moves up to the first row if no more unread Stories So the design is flexible even if there are only a few Stories to view.At most there are four versions of the layout that could appear: 1 Stories row, 2 Stories rows, 3 Stories rows, and 3 Stories rows with a preview of the fourth Stories row.Closing after watching 16 Stories: Closing after watching the last unread Story: Turn off auto-play Stories Only watch the Stories you tap.Turning off auto-play can last until you turn it back on.Or, another approach is that turning off auto-play can last for the current session or 24 hours, then will return to auto-play for the next Story.Make a playlist of Stories to watch now Easily pick which Stories you want to watch.Swipe right to open camera over Home, or tap bottom-row camera to open and swipe down to close camera This provides a consistent way to swipe down to close the camera.Make multiple videos/photos without stopping This helps bring default function of the phones camera app into the app for making a bunch of videos/photos when needed in the moment.Use the Multi camera option, then tap thumbnail or swipe up to decide which videos/photos to select.Media would be stored in the camera roll or cloud.Main design conclusion Plainly, there are many important possibilities to explore.Meanwhile, I believe my approach outlined here could significantly benefit people today.And the purpose is to design and share ideas with people who can inspire change.There could be continued development, such as with trying the design with people in the app.Looking forward, augmented reality could increasingly expand the canvas for information and interaction to everyone, everywhere but over the coming years, what wont change about sharing?Sharing the lived experience is a core desire.In some broad definition, it is what makes us alive.And people will want increasing ways to share across dimensions of time, people, place, format, feelings, identity and more.Really, the story of sharing itself including what, how and why is still being told.As ever.For higher resolution videos of the ideas above, please visit my Facebook Page.Disclosure: DJ Sherrets is a shareholder of Facebook stock.
Robin goes all in on robotic lawn care and focuses on franchising:::::Robin, which pitched a combined Uber for lawn care and robotic-lawnmower-as-a-service at Disrupt SFs Startup Battlefield last year, is making some big changes.It quietly sold the first part to Porch earlier this year, and is now focused on expanding the robot service nationwide via a franchising plan.(And theyre going to be on Shark Tank.)The service essentially subcontracted to local lawn care providers, allowing people to set up recurring mows and edging and so on without contracting with the companies themselves.On the robot side of the business, Robin essentially leased and supported custom lawnmower bots so customers could have that futuristic privilege without dropping two grand up front.When we announced at Disrupt, things were just booming, co-founder and CEO Justin Crandall said.Demand was as good as thought it would be.But it became clear to them that the robotic side of the business was the future, and likely the easier one to grow.So they sold the lawn service on demand part of the company in June to one of the big marketplace type companies, and although he declined to name it, I confirmed that it was Porch.(The company confirmed the purchase but did not provide any further details on the transaction.)Meanwhile, when it came to robots, they determined that the best way to expand wouldnt be to just offer the service in more and more places, but to set up a franchise system.So they rebranded the company to Robin Autopilot and are now looking for local partners.Basically, instead of leasing the robots to individual homeowners, theyll be leasing the robots to local Robin franchises, which will do the local legwork that Robin normally does.Crandall says that if anyone was interested in getting into the business of robo-mowing, it could cost over a hundred grand to set up the infrastructure, buy the robots up front, hire staff, and so on.Robin will cover a bunch of that.We built all the tools they need to manage robot inventory, build and manage customers, route crews and all that.In many ways it become a turnkey robotic lawn care business for the franchisee, Crandall said.They intend to start in southern states, where they already know the landscape, so to speak, and lawns are nice and big.California is a goal, but a few barriers make it a long-term one.Plans for 2018 are relatively modest: If we get to 20 [franchisees] this year, that would feel like a real good number for us, before we really expand next year.Theyre hoping to target veterans; co-founder Bart Lomont is former Air Force and mentioned that vets like himself tend to be ideal candidates for starting local businesses like this.And while the franchisees will (ideally) create a nice cash flow for the main company, they dont intend to give up the local mowing business just yet.Were gonna keep some territory, Crandall said.We definitely want to be able to say, look, were doing our own here.The company is looking for a bit of crowdfunding via Fundable rather than hitting up VCs.Theyre hoping to raise $500K to finance the switchover and expansion costs purchasing the new robots for franchisees and so on.Lastly, the company will also appear on Shark Tank this Sunday; the founders said that the judges (including Mark Cuban and Richard Branson in this episode) were highly entertained when the robot mower came out onto the fake grass theyd set up, through the little one-way door that lets it through but not any pets ranging around the yard.Theyre not the first Battlefield company to go on the show, and I seriously doubt theyll be the last.Featured Image: Robin Autopilot
China’s second largest e-commerce firm just showed Alibaba has serious competition:::::Alibaba invented Chinas biggest shopping day 11/11 aka Singles Day and it dominates the headlines with record sales year-on-year, but another company just stepped out to remind us that others are busy trying to close the gap.JD.com, the perennial challenger to Alibabas e-commerce empire in China, just revealed its 11/11 figures for the first time.While not as high as Alibabas 163.8 billion RMB ($25.3 billion) the company did process an impressive 127.1 billion RMB in GMV, which works out to around $19.14 billion.Theres no direct comparison but the figure is a touch above Alibabas 2016 11/11 sales GMV of RMB 120.7 billion.The figure is also higher than the $17.6 billion that JD.com grossed for its own 6/18 sales event which commemorates the date of its founding although that bonanza lasts for 18 days rather than just one like Singles Day.JD.com was previously fairly guarded over Singles Day data instead choosing to talk up percentage growth but with this announcement today it has reminded people that it is indeed a close challenger to Alibaba.On consumer e-commerce marketshare, iResearch puts JD.coms reach at around 25 percent, while Alibaba is said to have just over 55 percent but theres more to it than that.The main difference between the two is that Alibaba operates a marketplace approach with its e-commerce businesses, whereas JD.com opted for an Amazon-like vertical approach to sales.There is also a disparity in size.Alibaba sits on the New York Stock Exchange with a market cap of $477 billion.JD.com, meanwhile, is listed on the NASDAQ and valued at around $57 billion.Still impressive, for sure, but a small fraction of Alibaba.Nonetheless, long-time Alibaba CEO Jack Ma noticed the potential of the rival early on.The Information reported this week that back in 2011 Ma wanted JD.com founder Richard Liu to open a store on Alibabas platform to avoid the potential of direct competition.Liu rejected the offer has gone about making his company, which was then less established, Alibabas chief rival through a different approach to e-commerce, and by embracing technology such as drones and robots faster.Featured Image: VCG/VCG via Getty Images/Getty Images (IMAGE HAS BEEN MODIFIED)
Alibaba smashes its Single’s Day record once again as sales cross $25 billion:::::Alibaba has set another Singles Day record after the e-commerce giant sold over $25 billion of product on the Chinese biggest online shopping date.The full number comes in at 163.8 billion RMB, thats roughly $25.3 billion, in GMV thats gross merchandise volume which is used to measure a dollar value for all sales on a platform.In Alibabas case, that predominantly means its Taobao marketplace and Tmall brand store although it does offer sales via its international services and it ships worldwide.All told, Alibaba handled 1.48 Billion transactions during the 24-hour period.That represents an impressive 39 percent increase on last years sales total of RMB 120.7 billion ($17.79 billion), and it comes nicely on the heels of another blockbuster quarter in which Alibabas revenue surged by 61 percent thanks to its core business in China.For comparison, Alibabas Singles Day haul puts Americas largest shopping days in the corner.Retailers pulled in a record $3 billion on Black Friday and then $3.45 billion on Cyber Monday, both of which were records.Related: Rival JD.com revealed its 11/11 GMV for the first time after processing 127.1 billion RMB ($19.14 billion) #Double11 2017: As of 24:00, total GMV has exceeded RMB168.2 billion more than USD25.3 billion.Mobile GMV: 90%.pic.twitter.com/Kfm3dhNNdw Alibaba Group (@AlibabaGroup) November 11, 2017 The years numbers also signal a return to growth for Singles Day (11/11) sales, an important area that investors will look at and Alibaba needs to show progress on.While the jump isnt as much as the 60 percent Alibaba saw yearly from from 2013 to 2015, it is up on last years 32 percent which is impressive given the scale that the event has reached today and the growth that Alibabas business has seen since then.The holiday began as a promotion for TMall started by current CEO Daniel Zhang, who was then in charge of the business unit, as a way to make single people feel less lonely, but it has since blossomed into the worlds largest single shopping date by some margin.GMV is off the charts, but it is important to note that this is not revenue for Alibaba.The company makes money from e-commerce in two main ways.It charges a commission and store fee to brands that are accepted to Tmall; Taobao doesnt charge fees to merchants, it instead makes money by charging them for ads that boost their product/store visibility.Its important to note sales in RMB and USD due to varying exchange rates This years 11/11 got off to a fast start with around $7 billion of goods sold in the first 30 minutes of the day alone.Alibaba went on to surpass last years $18 billion total after just twelve hours of sales.Another important metric is mobile.Not only does a higher number mean that Alibaba is reaching new/newish internet users, but mobile users tend to be more engaged which is obviously an important goal.This year, Alibaba said 90 percent of sales were made on mobile which is up on 82 percent for 2016 and 69 percent in 2015.Among the many stats released by Alibaba, the following stand out: Order total numbers hit 812 million, up 23 percent Alibaba Cloud, which handled the infrastructure, managed 325,000 orders at peak Alipay processed 1.5 billion payment transactions, up 41 percent Over 140,000 brands including 60,000 international took part on Tmall where they offered 15 million product listings 167 merchants generated over 100 million RMB ($15.1 million) in sales each 17 merchants surpassed 500 million RMB ($75.4 million) each Six merchants surpassed 1 billion RMB ($150.9 million) each Featured Image: Xinhua/Wang Dingchang via Getty Images
Alibaba needed just 12 hours to equal last year’s Single’s Day sales:::::Update: Alibaba ended Singles Day with $25 billion in GMV Well, its 11/11 on the other side of the globe which means Alibaba is already raking in loads of cash from Singles Day, otherwise known as the biggest day for global online shopping of the year.The company has a running sales counter on its Alizila news website, which details the gross merchandise volume that it has fulfilled orders for so far.Its currently just after noon in China and the company has already surpassed last years sales for Singles Day with nearly $18 billion USD in merchandise sold already, about $7 billion of which was sold in the first 30 minutes of the day.The company reached $17.8 billion in sales by days end in 2016 so theres plenty more orders to be made with just under 12 hours to go.Singles Day, a Chinese holiday thats sort of the single persons response to Valentines Day, is, at its core, a day to treat yourself.Alibaba didnt invent the holiday, but since 2009 they have come to draw the bulk of global attention for the mind-blowing sales they manage to pull off.Its similar in theory to events like Amazons Prime Day, though the scope is much more expansive for Alibabas popular Tmall and Taobao online storefronts which offer a number of deals to entice shoppers.Smashing through last years Singles Day sales will obviously be a great signal for the company which has been having a pretty great year already.Alibaba has more than doubled its stock price since this time last year, now sitting on a market cap north of $475 billion.

Nintendo may make as many as 30 million Switches next year:::::Rumors in early October had Nintendo more than doubling production for the highly successful Switch in order to meet what will almost certainly be crushing demand during the holidays.The company may be planning even higher volumes for next year perhaps as many as 30 million consoles.Citing sources with direct knowledge of the plans, the Wall Street Journal reports that Nintendo has started sharing the idea of expanded manufacturing with partners.25 to 30 million is the cited goal volume, but they could aim even higher depending on how the holidays go.The goal mentioned in Octobers report was 10 million units out the door by March 2018, but by the end of the month Nintendo had upped its sales predictions to 14 million in the same period, perhaps even as high as 17 million.That would put its first-year sales well ahead of the lifetime sales of the unfortunate Wii U.With games like the new Zelda and Mario, thats no surprise the company is setting new standards for quality while also attracting tons of indie developers and even decent AAA ports.
Twilio competitor Bandwidth up 6% following IPO:::::Bandwidth, a company that helps businesses with voice and text communication, debuted on the Nasdaq on Friday, going up about 6 percent on its first day of trading.After pricing its IPO at the bottom of the expected range at $20 per share, the company closed Friday at $21.19, or up about 6 percent.The Raleigh, North Carolina-based company raised $80 million in its offering.Bandwidth, which previously bootstrapped, will be using the capital for hiring and R&D.Bandwidth has been cash flow positive and profitable for a long time, co-founder and CEO David Morken told TechCrunch.He started the company in 1999 and then later started Republic Wireless, a wireless provider division that was recently spun off as a separate company.Bandwidth competes with Twilio and Nexmo, which it claims offer a narrower set of software APIs, less robust customer support and fewer other features while relying on third-party networks and physical infrastructure.It also competes with AT&T, Level 3 and Verizon, which it characterizes as network service providers that offer limited developer functionality on top of their own networks and physical infrastructure.Bandwidth says it has been able to convince 865 large enterprises, including GoDaddy and ZipRecruiter, that its API integrations are better quality, in part because it has its own voice network.Bandwidth brought in $152.1 million in revenue last year.This compares to $137.8 million in 2015.For 2016, the company had $22.4 million in profit; 2015 had a loss of $6.7 million.TechCrunch is owned by Verizon, which does business in the same space as Bandwidth.Featured Image: Bandwidth
Netflix cuts ties with Louis CK:::::Netflix has announced that it will not be making a second stand-up special with comedian Louis CK.For years, rumors have swirled that Louis CK engaged in inappropriate sexual behavior with the women around him.Gawker led coverage of these rumors in 2015 (and even as early as 2012).But this week, the New York Times reported that five women, many of whom went on the record, have accused Louis CK of sexual misconduct.In response, Netflix has cut ties with CK, who admits that these stories are true.Based on Louis CK's behavior, we are not making his second stand up special.Netflix US (@netflix) November 10, 2017 That said, other Louis CK content is still available on the Netflix service.Beyond Netflix, Louis CKs upcoming film, I Love You, Daddy, which was set to be released on November 17, will no longer hit theaters, according to the NYT.The Times also reports that HBO has pulled Louis CK from its on-demand library and dropped him from the lineup of its comedy benefit broadcast Night of Too Many Stars.FX, the network behind the the series Louie in which Louis CK stars, said that the matter is currently under review, according to the NYT.As more allegations of sexual harassment and misconduct come to light across Hollywood and beyond, big players in the media world are now having to take sides.Netflix, for one, has drawn a line in the sand, cutting ties entirely with Kevin Spacey after allegations that he made a sexual advance toward actor Anthony Rapp when Rapp was just 14.Weve reached out to Netflix asking if they have any plans to remove other Louis CK content from the platform.
Amazon’s Echo Spot might not arrive by Christmas [Updated]:::::A number of customers who pre-ordered Amazons new Echo Spot smart alarm clock are now being told the products ship date has been pushed back.Emails sent to customers inform them that unfortunately, the release date for the item listed below has changed, and then provides a new delivery estimate based on that revised date.[SEE UPDATE BELOW] However, the official website for the Echo Spot still says the device will be released on December 19, 2017, as was originally promised.The revised ship times seem to vary by customer, from what weve heard.Some have told us theyre now being promised a December 22, 2017 estimated arrival.But others told us their new arrival date is December 25. e.g.This Twitter user posted a screenshot of their Amazon email, asking if the product had been delayed: Has the Amazon Echo Spot release date changed, as email reads (despite site still showing Dec 19)?No email for my Sep 27 order, just for this Oct 16 one.pic.twitter.com/5cITKTXCLA Yenta Magenta (@YentaMagenta) November 10, 2017 In the email examples weve seen as well, Amazon is telling customers that the release date for the Echo Spot has changed, using the same language as seen above.In addition, Amazons customer support Twitter account is also now advising customers who ask if the Echo Spot will arrive by Christmas Eve (December 24, 2017) that the most accurate delivery estimate will be displayed to you at checkout instead of simply responding, yes.The most accurate delivery estimate will be displayed to you at checkout.Learn more here: https://t.co/UDVzXbf2PJ -Brittany S. Amazon Help (@AmazonHelp) November 9, 2017 When the customer lamented that theyre being shown a ship date of December 25, the Twitter rep suggested they pre-order on Amazon and at a local retailer, as a precaution.That does not sound promising.I'd suggest pre-ordering on Amazon and your local retailer if they carry it.That way, you've covered.Totally your choice.^SY Amazon Help (@AmazonHelp) November 9, 2017 Its unclear how many Echo Spot pre-orders there were to begin with, as thats data Amazon doesnt share.Nor is it clear if the arrival dates have been pushed back for all, or just some portion of the pre-order customer base.The Echo Spot is one of Amazons more interesting new Echo devices, given its combination of a screen for video calling and its smaller form factor, as compared with the larger Echo Show.Its affordable price point of $130 also made it promising as a holiday gift.Oddly, when we tried to place an pre-order for the Echo Spot ourselves today, the order would not go through at all.Whether added to the cart or ordered via 1-Click, we were shown an error page instead of an order confirmation.Amazon has not responded to requests for comment about the matter.- UPDATE, 11/10/17, 6:46 PM ET: Amazon has responded.The company claims the emails are in error but declined to provide more details as to how or why they were sent.The statement is below: The emails sent to customers claiming Echo Spot would be delivered on December 25 or later are inaccurate.We can confirm all customers who have ordered an Echo Spot to date will receive their order no later than December 22, before Christmas.We apologize for the inconvenience.
Bike-share platform Spin poaches Seattle transit regulator and launches in a dozen new cities:::::Spin, one of several dockless bike-sharing companies now vying for dominance in a number of U.S. cities, has a new weapon to wield against its competitors: Kyle Rowe, the architect of Seattles permissive and apparently successful bike-share permit system, who is joining the company to work on government partnerships.In addition, Spin is gearing up to launch in a dozen or so new cities all around the country.I met Rowe in Seattle this summer, funnily enough at a launch party for Spins well-funded Chinese rival Ofo.He and the team at the Seattle Department of Transportation had put together an attractively simple process for launching dockless bike sharing in the city.It made things easy on operators while still holding them to fairly rigorous standards and requiring them to share certain valuable data so it could be used by transit officials and other companies.This has allowed, for instance, apps like Transit and Migo to add multiple bike-share companies to their maps of local transportation options (although payments are still only available in the individual services apps): Between Spin, Ofo and LimeBike, the new system was already more popular in its first few weeks than Seattles dog of a docked bike system (now defunct) was in a year.Spin apparently liked it so much, they hired Rowe to spread the gospel elsewhere.Elsewhere, it turns out, was already interested: Rowe told me that in his time at SDOT, the phone was ringing off the hook with other municipalities curious about implementing a similar system.You may be, as I was, concerned about the possible conflicts of interest that arise when a company essentially hires its own regulator right out of the job.But this sort of thing is fairly common in industries like transit, where public-private partnerships are the rule.I worked closely with the ethics commission, Rowe told me.They decided that he should not communicate professionally with SDOT for a year, and cant communicate with them about bike sharing stuff for two years.Someone else will just have to handle the Seattle connection, essentially.He admits that there was a certain level of trust between public servants that hell have to reestablish now that hes gone private, but he also pointed out that its a very collaborative environment.Each city is going to choose their own way of executing this, but we all come together at conferences, do whitepapers, find best practices, he said.You see this for example with how bike lanes are designed at first it was kind of all over the place, but over time weve all kind of agreed on a template that makes the most sense.Thats how its going to work for this industry as well.Spin also announced that it is bringing its service to a double handful of new cities and regions.The timing on these is kind of hazy, since the logistics of dropping off thousands of bikes and getting everything online are complicated, but you can count on the following cities being up and spinning by the end of the year: Los Angeles and LA County cities Bay Area cities (including East Bay) Durham, NC Scottsdale, AZ Houston, TX Silver Spring, MD Doral and Miami Lakes, FL Smaller cities, Rowe noted, often dont have the staff or infrastructure to let a company like Spin just plop down its bikes.Thats going to be part of his role at the company, to start those conversations and make sure any municipality has the tools to make bike sharing an option.So dont lose hope if youre in a city with fewer than 100,000 people youll be able to join the party sooner or later.It looks as if dockless bike sharing is here to stay, and I for one like the idea, although I wish I didnt have to keep 3 or 4 different apps on my phone just so I can grab whichever bike is closest.
New startups like Mytime want to pay for your attention and time in cryptocurrency:::::The debate about the effects social networks like Facebook and Twitter have on us as human beings goes one.Indeed, just this week Facebook co-founder Sean Parker said The thought process that went into building these applications, Facebook being the first of them, was all about: How do we consume as much of your time and conscious attention as possible?God only knows what its doing to our childrens brains.Thanks for that Sean.That attention-grabbing is all about getting as much data from the user about their preferences, but ultimately is also showing them adverts while they trawl the feed.But what if we literally got paid for our attention in crypto currency?Well, thats exactly what a few blockchain startups are trying to figure out.Brave Browser, created by Brendan Eich, a former Mozilla CEO, recently announced the Basic Attention Token (BAT) backed by users attention on the content.And online blogging platform Steemit has rolled out a new protocol for media organizations to use cryptocurrency to generate revenue.Now theres a new kid on the block: Mytime.In terms of functionality, the mytime protocol is similar to existing cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum, Plasma and EOS.But this is an open blockchain-based platform that converts time spent by a person on a particular service or app, into cryptocurrency.The idea is that companies can reward their loyal audiences while saving on transaction and marketing costs, and users get to spend the crypto how they want.Imagine if content networks like news sites paid you to see their content instead of forcing you to see ads?Perhaps we would have a different kind of media.Users will be rewarded with mytimes new cryptocurrency tokens (known as MYTC) which companies will be able to mine themselves, based on the duration of the service.Users can use the tokens to pay for other services from other companies using time the mytime platform or convert them to fiat currency via exhanges.Eduard Gurinovich, CEO, MyTC says: Mytime is a revolutionary concept, and we believe it will give traditional advertising models a run for their money when it comes to attracting users to services.We expect the increasing number of users and the intensity of transactions to contribute to a flourishing mytime economy, boosting the value of MYTC.Some examples might be a video game player getting MYTC for every minute spent in a game, the reading of a newspaper website, or a taxi passenger getting tokens for using a taxi which also uses MYTC.The startup has created its new protocol to do two main things.Firstly, it validates user time spent.Secondly, it protects the platform from abuse.The whole system operates on two parallel blockchains: one is used to confirm the elapsed service time (which cannot exceed 24 hours a day, and automatically prevents users from logging the same time period for more than one service).The second one records the participating companys MYTC reward dispensation.Token transfer occurs on the MYTC online wallet.Gurinovich previously founded CarPrice, which attracted $80 million from investors in Eastern Europe and opened more than 50 offices in Russia, Japan, India and Brazil.His co-founders include Georgy Chumbridze, founder of Innova, which made browser-based online games; and Armen Gulinyan, previously CEO of Ruform (Rutube, Pladform), a video distribution system which has 20 percent of the video advertising market in Russia.They are joined by Alexander Garkusha (co-founder of ModernToken who also participated in creating a whitepaper for the Ethereum ICO) who is a technical adviser of the mytime platform.
Uber ‘Express POOL’ offers the cheapest fare if you’ll walk a little:::::Ubers found a way to shave another 25 percent or so off the price of a ride.Uber Express POOL asks you to walk up to a few blocks to your pickup and destination before and after the ride in exchange for the cheapest fare out of all of Ubers options.The feature dynamically generates smart spots that are easy to drive to and close to the origin or destination of several people seeking an Express POOL.You hail, it tells you where to walk, you go there, join other passengers, take your ride, get dropped somewhere easily accessible near your destination and you get in-app walking directions to your final address.By picking up and dropping off multiple groups of people at once, Uber avoids diverting from a citys main streets, and passes on some of the savings.I first spotted the new Uber Express POOL option in San Francisco this week, and then noticed an email from Uber that it was Introducing our most affordable ride.The email explained that Express POOL is a new kind of shared ride that begins and ends at convenient Express spots.Update your app today to start riding for as low as $2.After asking about the feature, an Uber spokesperson told me: Were always thinking about ways to put more people in fewer cars, while continuing to deliver affordable ride options to consumers.As part of that effort, were testing some changes to Express POOL where riders walk to nearby spots that are convenient for everyone.They confirmed this is currently a very small pilot program testing in certain neighborhoods of Boston and San Francisco.But if the pilots prove popular, Uber Express POOL could expand to more markets.Back in July 2015, I wrote that Uber should tell people where to get picked up nearby, and offer small discounts if theyre willing to walk.Soon after the company began testing Suggested Pickup Points to make small route optimizations, but without a discount.Later that year Uber tested Smart Routes that reduced your fare for setting your pickup along a main artery.That was around the time that Lyft killed off its Express POOL-style Hotspots feature.Uber quietly started testing a different feature with the same Express POOL name in May 2017, but it received no press attention.At the time, youd schedule your ride up to hours ahead of time, and then get a cheaper fare after a short walk.The recently revamped version Uber just implemented is on-demand like the rest of Uber.Theres still the separate option to schedule an UberX, Black or SUV ahead of time for full price.The updated feature brings the price of an Uber below the $2.75 that San Francisco charges for a bus ticket.It could be especially helpful to those willing to exchange a little time and effort to save some cash, furthering Uber POOLs trade-off of time for money.And it could be a free discount for people who live on one-way streets or alleyways who might already call their Uber to pick them up around the corner on the main road.Uber is on a quest for the perfect ride, and that means polishing every part of the trip.Cutting down the ETA with features like this is particularly advantageous since Uber and the driver dont usually get paid during the pre-pickup drive.Reducing the price by putting a little work on the passenger could open up Uber to new budget-conscious demographics, and allow it to be a stand-in for public transportation.And as rideshare usage has been shown to decrease public transit usage, bus and subway fares could keep going up while Ubers fees go down.
Instagram could let you follow hashtags soon:::::Instagram is testing a new feature with a small fraction of its user base.As spotted by Pippa Akram and The Next Web, some users can now search for a hashtag and follow this tag in particular.Ok this is new.What does this do @SimonSocialMM @BizPaul @NatalieTFG any ideas?I've followed 2 but can't find what that means!!pic.twitter.com/LlCBk4Wmfv Pippa Akram (@Social_Pip) November 9, 2017 Instagram used to feel like a carefully curated community.Now, thanks to the algorithmic feed, all the funny posts, weird accounts and niche content seems to be relocated to the very bottom of your feed.Instead, it feels like Instagram is promoting posts that is going to generate a lot of engagement baby photos, outrageous things and Taylor Swifts teasers for her new albums.In other words, Instagram now feels like a tiny Facebook.Maybe this isnt the solution, but if youre a fan of @ihavethisthingwithfloors but dont see those photos anymore, you might soon be able to follow the #ihavethisthingwithfloors hashtag.As the screenshot shows, Instagram isnt going to drastically change your feed.The service is going to select popular and recent posts.And youll once again be able to follow things based on your interests and not your social graph.
Mysterious ‘green line of death’ appears on some iPhone X displays:::::It wouldnt be the launch of a first-generation Apple product without a few hiccups who can forget Antennagate and Bendgate?and the iPhone X is no different.A handful of users report that a mysterious and inextinguishable green line has appeared on their devices display.The above images, from Twitter users mix0mat0sis, Nate Heagy and Christian Roman, represent a few of the examples of the green line of death as the latter called it.No one seems to know what causes it or how prevalent it actually is.Ive asked Apple for comment.We can at least speculate on one part of that.iPhone Xs have a new diamond sub-pixel pattern in their displays, and as such all green sub-pixels appear in lines, while red and blue alternate.You can see that in this image taken as part of DisplayMates tests: It seems likely that an electrical fault in a few phones is causing voltage to flow to all the green sub-pixels in a line.That it stretches all the way from top to bottom suggests its something at the edge of the display thats sending an incorrect voltage down a few lines of pixels (if it were just one line of sub-pixels, it would appear much thinner).The line tends to be close to the right or left side of the phone, but thats harder to diagnose.This kind of issue always pops up in ambitious devices that use several new kinds of tech at scale.It happened to Samsung last year, except the line was pink.Even if only 0.001 percent of the displays they put together were faulty, a frequency thats nearly impossible to test for, a few users will still end up with a bum phone.One such user already reports that their phone was replaced at the Apple store, so it seems unlikely that this is a software issue.Is your phone showing this line?Take a picture and let us know.Then take it in to be replaced.
Online real estate startup ToLet acquires Jumia House Nigeria to create PropertyPro.Ng:::::African tech can produce surprises.One this week is a $1.2 million Series A startup buying part of a $1 billion company.Thats what Lagos based property startup ToLet.com.ng has done, purchasing Jumia House Nigeria for an undisclosed amount.Jumia House is a subsidiary of the continents lone tech unicorn Pan-African e-commerce giant Jumia.com.ToLet and Jumia House Nigeria will merge platforms under the new name of PropertyPro.ng.The acquisition was a result of ToLets strength in market and help from their lead investor, Malaysia based Frontier Digital Ventures, according to CEO and Co-Founder Fikayo Ogundipe.This came about from FDVwhich has a strong real-estate classified portfolio across Africalooking at which markets they were strong and where Rocket [Jumias lead investor] was weaker, he told TechCrunch.In Nigeria Jumia House was number three or number four in online listings.It didnt make sense for Rocket to burn more capital in that position, so [FDV] approached them on the acquisition.So how did ToLet finance the purchase?Without additional financing from lead investor FDV, according to Co-Founder Sulaiman Balogun.The $1.2 million in funding we announced last year is the only round weve disclosed.Weve raised enough capital to run through this deal and really fund the business and grow, he said.With the acquisition, ToLet is acquiring the entire Jumia House platform staff, assets, and their listings and agent network.The new PropertyPro entity will combine ToLets 60,000 listings to Jumia Houses 22,000 to create the largest online real estate listings platform in Nigeria with 65 percent of the market, according to Balogun.ToLet would not divulge annual revenue stats, but execs explained it makes money from agent subscription fees.ToLets legacy platform had 10,000 agents, of which 20 percent were charged.We have a long-term plan to charge a higher percentage on our the premium plan, said ToLet CEO Ogundipenoting agents receive more options under that plan.ToLets new PropertyPro platform will not charge fees or commissions on listing sales, something some of its competitors do, according to Balogun.We did that on our previous model, but stopped.That increased the number of agents on our platform and generated more revenue overall, he said.ToLets current online listings are about 70 percent rentals and 30 percent sales.Co-CEOs Balogun and Ogundipe said to expect updates on the integrated PorpertyPro platform.They have engineers developing new ease of search features for the site and plan to launch an android app in coming weeks.A prime aim of the acquisition and new PropertyPro platform is to expand ToLets agent and listings reach across Nigeria and increase the number of sales listings, Balogun told TechCrunch.As a market, Nigeria boasts the dual distinction of being Africas most populous nation and largest economy, valued at roughly half a trillion dollars.A small real-estate sector (circa 8 percent of the overall economy) and a high urbanization rate have created a housing deficit in the country.Furthermore, a nascent credit rating market in the Nigeria has fueled practices whereby landlords can require advance deposit of up to two years rent from tenants.ToLet hopes its recent acquisition and upgraded PropertyPro platform can ease that.We believe creating more visibility of real estate listings and ease of connecting buyers and sellers online can solve some of these liquidity problems and bridge this gap between supply and demand, said Co-Founder Sulaiman Balogun.
Apple’s iOS App Store adds weekend deals to boost app downloads:::::With the introduction of iOS 11, Apple redesigned the App Store with a heavier focus on editorial content, including articles, interviews, how-tos, lists and other round-ups with app recommendations.Now, its adding another feature, as well, called This Weekend Only.The new section lists deals that can be found inside apps, as opposed to discounts on downloads of apps themselves.As Apples editors explain in the features introduction: Today, were kicking off a new way to save using your favorite apps.Youll get great deals, available only through these apps, on everything from apparel to food delivery, hotel reservations to movie tickets.To see the discounts, head to the Apps tab each Thursday.There youll find an app labeled This Weekend Only with an exclusively promotion thats valid through Sunday.The note also adds that Apple is offering five deals instead of just one to kick of the promotion.This weekends list includes a 40 percent discount on HotelTonight bookings, a free case from Warby Parker, $20 off Under Armour orders, free Chips & Queso from Chipotle, and 15 percent on orders at Shoptiques.9to5Mac and other sites first discovered the new App Store section when it debuted on Thursday.The launch has likely been timed to capitalize on the busy holiday shopping season ahead, where its being forecast that mobile holiday shopping visits in the U.S. will surpass desktop for the first time.It makes sense that Apple would want to capture some of consumers interest in mobile commerce by pointing people to apps where they could save on purchases, as well as on other holiday expenses, like travel.But more broadly, a recent analysis of the revamped App Store found that its new App of the Day and Game of the Day features though notable in terms of driving downloads did better on weekdays than on weekends.For example, the weekday download boost from being featured was 2,172 percent compared to weekends 580 percent boost.That leaves room for a different type of app promotion to target weekend iPhone users.This Weekend Only gets started before the weekend begins, however.Apples note indicates that the deals will pop-up starting on Thursdays and run through Sundays.
Tech Q&A: Dark web, cheap Apple Watches, Facebook swap meets and more:::::Credit cards on the dark web Q: How do hackers buy credit card numbers on the dark web?A: Many people believe hackers use stolen data themselves, that they find a bunch of Social Security numbers and then create fake passports and open bank accounts for their purposes.But hackers do not need these things; they just want to sell the data to someone else.This includes credit card numbers, which are bought and sold on the dark web like any other commodity.Want to be shocked?Click here to see what you can buy for just a few bucks on the dark web.Black Friday deals Q: Do you have any thoughts on what deals we can expect on TVs on Black Friday?A: Gadget sales are always full of surprises, and hot-ticket items from January may have lost their luster by the time November rolls around.Other items take months or even years to attract a following, which can dramatically affect their Black Friday price tags.Around the holidays, a lot of gift-givers veer toward entertainment, and every year I pay close attention to the door-buster sales on wide-screen TVs.Click here for Black Fridays TV price predictions.Google Maps hacks Q: I use Google Maps.Can you share how you use it?Id like to learn a few tricks.A: Most people use Google Maps for quick directions.Thats great, but like everything Google creates, Maps is capable of so much more.You can search by category, save venues and even use the maps offline.As someone who often finds herself in busy airports, I love the share location feature, because its stressful to explain where you are when someone is trying to pick you up.Perhaps the least-known option allows you to chart the path youve already taken, which can be handy or creepy, depending on how you look at it.Click here for 12 useful tricks for using Google Maps.Facebook swap meets Q: I heard you mention Facebook swap meets on your national radio show.What are these?A: When it comes to free exchanges online, almost everything gets compared to Craigslist.After all, Craigslist was the first major website to list classified ads for free, and millions of people still use its stripped-down interface to find babysitters, motorcycles and acting gigs.But, as everyone knows, Craigslist is a crapshoot, and con artists are everywhere.So whats a safer alternative?Check out Swip Swaps.Unlike Craigslist, Swip Swaps has a certain level of accountability.Click here for cheaper, safer deals on Facebook.Dirt-cheap Apple watches Q: My sister told me that I could buy an Apple Watch for $25 from my insurance company.Is she making stuff up again?A: I have to laugh because I can only imagine the yarns your sister has spun in the past.But rest assured that this one is true, as long as you are enrolled in one particular insurance company.To paraphrase Hippocrates, the best thing you can do for yourself is get a little exercise, and the Apple Watch is a great motivator.The device can record your movement, your heart rate and sleep data, and you can easily learn how many calories youve burned in a day.If youre already signed up with John Hancock, you may be able to nab an inexpensive new toy.Click here to learn about this $25 Apple Watch opportunity.What questions do you have?Call my national radio show and click here to find it on your local radio station.You can listen to the Kim Komando Show on your phone, tablet or computer.From buying advice to digital life issues, click here for my free podcasts.Copyright 2017, WestStar Multimedia Entertainment.All rights reserved.Learn about all the latest technology on the Kim Komando Show, the nation's largest weekend radio talk show.Kim takes calls and dispenses advice on today's digital lifestyle, from smartphones and tablets to online privacy and data hacks.For her daily tips, free newsletters and more, visit her website at Komando.com.
Remarkable self-healing tech could tackle invisible war wounds:::::Wounded warriors may soon have extremely miniature devices injected into them that can trigger the body to self-heal from invisible war wounds.In the future, ElectRx tech could potentially detect the onset of disease.Once detected, the tech would immediately react and stimulate the peripheral nerves to restore health by course correcting the performance of the brain, spinal cord and internal organs.This program could deliver an entirely new system to defeat post-traumatic stress, chronic pain, inflammatory disease, and other illnesses that may not respond to current and conventional treatments.It could revolutionize the way illness and disease are diagnosed and treated.Currently neuromodulation is a last resort.ElectRx could make it the first thing and the only thing needed to restore health.Invisible wounds Approximately 20 veterans commit suicide every day, according to the Department of Veterans Affairs.This is a much higher rate than civilians.NORTH KOREA: WILL MINI NUKES BECOME AN OPTION FOR TRUMP?Invisible wounds from war such as post-traumatic stress, depression and chronic pain are believed to be contributing factors to this tragic loss of life.The bastion that gave rise to life-changing innovations like the internet and GPS, DARPA, is seeking solutions.DARPAs brainboxes are turning their genius to solving the challenges of invisible war wounds.And theyve enlisted other medical pioneering superstars from all over the country, drawn from academia and the private sector, to join them in finding solutions to PTSD, depression and chronic pain.The program is called Electrical Prescriptions, or ElectRx.And they are determined to create groundbreaking miniature devices that will initiate self-healing of body and mind.This futuristic tech will use the bodys nervous system to restore and maintain health.If successful, it could mean entirely new treatments for illnesses that replace the traditional go-to drugs.And even solutions for illnesses that have no current viable treatment.It is believed that much of the mental health and chronic inflammatory diseases involve abnormal activity in the peripheral nervous system.The peripheral nervous system plays a central role in organ function.WILL THE US UNLEASH REVOLUTIONARY 'LIGHTNINGSTRIKE' DRONE ON FUTURE ENEMIES?If the nerve signals of the peripheral nervous system could be somehow monitored - and targeted then there could be great potential to restore health without drugs or surgery.PODCAST: MEET PRINCE HARRYS HEROINE + US MARINE AMPUTEE Commandeering the human body superhighway The peripheral nervous system is the bodys information superhighway.Motor and sensory signals constantly zoom through this superhighway communicating information regarding our health status.These signals play a role in triggering changes in the brain and other organs to maintain health.A key part of this initiative is unlocking the mysteries of the bodys data superhighway the nervous system.Experts are going to figure out specific neural circuits and their role in health and disease.The teams will map neural circuits and develop revolutionary bio-electrical interfaces.The initiative will need to master how the nervous system regulates many aspects of our health.It will also need to develop the tech to measure and stimulate nerve signals.ElectRx will be able to change lives by controlling the human bodys superhighway.DARPA will own the road and use it to restore health to our wounded warriors.POWERFUL TINY TANKS WITH VR AND FUTURISTIC COCKPITS COULD REVOLUTIONIZE THE BATTLEFIELD Heres an example neurochemicals regulate learning and memory in the brain.Peripheral nerve stimulation could be used to regulate neurochemical production.This could mean entirely new treatment options for post-traumatic stress and other mental health challenges.How would it work?The devices, called neuromodulation tech, will be so small they could be injected with a needle.They can both monitor and respond from inside the body.Once inside the body, the ElectRx device would harness its advanced sensing and stimulating technologies to target specific peripheral neural circuits that control organ functions.They would monitor the persons health status and then intervene when necessary.If intervention is required to restore health, then the device would deliver therapeutic patterns of stimulation tailored specifically for the patient.SLIME OF 300-MILLION-YEAR-OLD CREATURE MAY BE USED FOR BODY ARMOR A simple example of this sort of tech and approach is the pacemaker, which uses brief pulses of electricity to stimulate the heart to beat at a healthy rate.ElectRx devices will do something similar, but for other organs, whether the stomach or the brain.This could even provide entirely new ways of treating inflammatory diseases like rheumatoid arthritis.It may also even help to safely and reliably instruct the peripheral nervous system to fight disease.DARPA has selected seven teams of researchers.Heres a nutshell on 3 of these exciting projects underway.PODCAST: FIND OUT HOW THIS INSPIRING SPECIAL FORCES AMPUTEE ACHIEVED THE IMPOSSIBLE Defeating biomolecules to conquer depression For depression, some research suggests that depression might be caused in part by excess levels of inflammatory biomolecules.Fighting inflammation with ElectRx may also provide new treatments.Eliminating chronic pain with light inside the body Circuit Therapeutics is working with optogenetic methods to treat neuropathic pain.In simple terms, they are using a combination of gene therapy and a light device.By harnessing the power of light and targeting specific regions with it inside the body, they are hoping to put an end to chronic pain.Theyre transducing the specific circuit and making exciting progress.Ending PTSD using the neck PTSD is when individuals are reminded of a traumatic event and feel anxiety and panic.Approximately 8 percent of the U.S. population will have PTSD at some point in their lifetimes, according to the National Center for PTSD.A University of Texas team, led by veteran Robert Rennaker and Michael Kilgard, is using vagal nerve stimulation to induce neural plasticity for the treatment of post-traumatic stress.VNS has already had success with depression.To reduce the fear response, they are using targeted VNS during exposure therapy.The vagus nerve is in the neck.They send a mild electric pulse through it and it relays data about the status of the body to the brain.
Futuristic bionic arms now available for the nation's bravest:::::American military members make many sacrifices serving the United States.In fact, more than 1,600 have suffered the loss of a limb in Iraq and Afghanistan.Until now, options for those who have endured an arm amputation have been limited.The quality of prosthetics has been entirely unworthy of the men and women who selflessly serve the country.DARPA has been doggedly determined to find a way to restore limbs.For more than 10 years, this military bastion of innovation has paved the way and funded the best advances to deliver limbs that would far better restore capabilities.The aim doesnt stop there.In the Revolutionizing Prosthetics DARPA program, their vision is to also restore intuitive use of the new limbs with near natural control even through thought control.The hope is that these limbs will be so good that a service members options will be limitless and that they may even return to duty if they so wish.LUKE One of the exciting advances for those who have lost an arm is the LUKE (Life Under Kinetic Evolution) available through Mobius Bionics.NORTH KOREA: WILL MINI NUKES BECOME AN OPTION FOR TRUMP?With far better capabilities, LUKE allow users to do many things again for the first time since they lost the arm.It can translate muscle signals into complex arm motions.Developed by DEKA Research & Development Corp., and funded by DARPA, it is the very first arm cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.About 100 wounded veterans played a vital role in this breakthrough.During development, they assisted by testing the LUKE and providing feedback.More than 10,000 hours went into honing it into the arm.And it is now commercially available for everyone and available by prescription.WILL THE US UNLEASH REVOLUTIONARY 'LIGHTNINGSTRIKE' DRONE ON FUTURE ENEMIES?LUKE is compatible with a range of amputation levels including shoulder, above the elbow and below the elbow.And an amazing breakthrough for wounded warriors as well as those with amputations from other causes such as diabetes, trauma and cancer.PODCAST: HEAR HOW THIS NAVY SEAL WENT FROM WAR ZONES TO MOVIE STAR The Need Since 9/11, it is believed more than 1,600 American warfighters have lost hands, arms, feet or legs.In war zones, enemies of the U.S. have deployed vicious means of attack, like hidden IEDs, that have caused horrific wounds requiring amputations.The impact of limb loss can be devastating.In addition to physical challenges, it can have profound psychological, social and economic, social and psychological consequences.How is LUKE different?The LUKE arm will give wounded warriors the chance to do more complex movements with precision.POWERFUL TINY TANKS WITH VR AND FUTURISTIC COCKPITS COULD REVOLUTIONIZE THE BATTLEFIELD This enhanced precision, greater strength and better range will make daily activities much easier.LUKE provides a shoulder with better range, a hand that can manage both fragile and heavy items, a wrist with more dexterity and an elbow with far more strength.With this prosthetic advance, users will have the strength to take a heavy grocery bag out of the trunk, carry it into the house from the car and heave it onto a high countertop.Users can take advantage of the enhanced precision for tasks that require dexterity and a gentle touch such as taking something delicate like an egg out of the fridge and delivering it to the stove to make an omelet and without the egg breaking on the way.The LUKE arm can also do things like pour a glass of orange juice in the morning and hold a glass without spilling.SLIME OF 300-MILLION-YEAR-OLD CREATURE MAY BE USED FOR BODY ARMOR The better range means users can now reach behind their backs or for something on the top shelf over their heads.PODCAST: FIND OUT THE TRUTH ABOUT MILITARY DRONES WITH THIS ARMY INTEL OPERATIVE How does it work?The central control tech harnesses signals.Electromyogram (EMG) electrodes detect electrical signals from the users muscles.Pattern recognition tech then interprets these nerve signals and translates them into the intended arm movement.This approach is definitely not new.The breakthrough has been just how much this tech can translate from the nerve signals and communicate to the LUKE, giving the user much better control, strength and movement.The design incorporates multiple motors, which are key delivering the technologys capabilities.LUKE can deliver 10 powered degrees of freedom.To control the limb, LUKE users have a number of different input devices and approaches they can choose to use.Surface EMG electrodes and pressure switches is one option.WILL COMBAT VEHICLES USE URINE FOR FUEL?Another option is the foot control device, which is generally worn on top of shoes.This was the choice of the first two veterans to receive the LUKE through prescription.The IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) foot controls enable the users to intuitively control the LUKE movements.There are a number of grasp patterns available and the user can turn them on and off depending on what is needed for the activities ahead.It was also designed with other practical daily challenges in mind like weather and terrain.The LUKE can be worn outside and will be fine in conditions like light rain.Whats next?Now bomb robots are benefiting from the extraordinary advances made by the LUKE project too.These robots are using the LUKE hand capabilities to do their job better.With bomb robots more capable of stopping dangerous explosive threats, this means that humans do not have to be put in harms way to complete the task.Not only can this save lives, it will also help prevent suffering and amputations in the future.Thanks to DARPA and Mobius Bionics this breakthrough is now commercially available.Mobius is now finally able to accept requests from veterans.For more information, you can contact Mobius Bionics at

Eavesdropper bug exposes millions of texts, calls:::::A recently discovered vulnerability affecting almost 700 iOS and Android apps has exposed millions of text messages, calls, and voice recordings, researchers at enterprise mobile threat protection firm Appthority warned Thursday.The vulnerability, which Appthority researchers have dubbed Eavesdropper, was introduced when developers "carelessly" hard coded their credentials in mobile apps using the Twilio Rest API or SDK for communications services.Those developers failed to follow Twilio's guidelines for secure use of credentials and tokens."By hard coding their credentials, the developers have effectively given global access to all metadata stored in their Twilio accounts, including text/SMS messages, call metadata, and voice recordings," Appthority's Michael Bentley wrote in a blog post."The scope of the exposure is massive including hundreds of millions of call records, minutes of calls and audio recordings, and text messages."About 33 percent of apps with the Eavesdropper bug are business-related.They include "an app for secure communication for a federal law enforcement agency, an app that enables enterprise sales teams to record audio and annotate discussions in real-time, and branded and white label navigation apps for customers such as AT&T and US Cellular," Appthority wrote in a news release.The vulnerability, which Appthority has described as "easy" to exploit, would allow an attacker to "access confidential knowledge about a company's business dealings and make moves to capitalize on them for extorting actions or personal gain," Bentley added.Collectively, the affected apps have been downloaded around 180 million times.Moreover, more than 170 of the affected apps are currently available in official app stores today.Appthority discovered the flaw in April 2017 and notified Twilio about it the following month.Twilio has since reached out to developers of the affected apps and is working with them to secure their accounts.Meanwhile, Appthority says this problem is not limited to apps created with Twilio."Hard coding of credentials is a pervasive and common developer error that increases the security risks of mobile apps," the firm said."Developers who hard code credentials in one service have high propensity to make the same error with other services."This article originally appeared on PCMag.com.
White supremacist controversy prompts Twitter to fix 'broken' account verification policy:::::Twitter has vowed to fix its broken verification policy amid controversy over the verification of an account belonging to an organizer of the white supremacist rally in Charlottesville.Verified accounts, which are denoted by a blue checkmark, let Twitter users know that an account deemed to be of public interest is authentic.TWITTER USERS IDENTIFY WHITE SUPREMACISTS AT CHARLOTTESVILLE PROTESTS However, the recent verification of a Twitter account belonging to Jason Kessler, one of the organizers of this summers Charlottesville rally, has sparked outrage.Looks like I FINALLY got verified by Twitter.I must be the only working class white advocate with that distinction, Kessler tweeted Tuesday.Twitter was slammed for verifying Kesslers account.Comedian Michael Ian Black, who has 2.16 million Twitter followers, described the situation as disgusting, and threatened to leave Twitter.Verifying white supremacists reinforces the increasing belief that your site is a platform for hate speech.I don't want to give up Twitter, but I may have to.Who do you value more, users like me or him?he tweeted Tuesday.Jason Kessler is so toxic that he broke Twitter's verification process, tweeted anti-fascist activist Emily Gorcenski.Kesslers account was still verified on Friday morning.Twitter acknowledged that more work is needed on its verification policy, and announced a pause in general verifications Thursday.OBAMA'S TWEET IN RESPONSE TO CHARLOTTESVILLE VIOLENCE IN THE MOST LIKED EVER Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey said that, while Twitters verification policy had been followed correctly, there are issues with the policy itself.We shouldve communicated faster on this (yesterday): our agents have been following our verification policy correctly, but we realized some time ago the system is broken and needs to be reconsidered.And we failed by not doing anything about it.Working now to fix faster, he tweeted Thursday.Verification was meant to authenticate identity & voice but it is interpreted as an endorsement or an indicator of importance, tweeted Twitter Support.We recognize that we have created this confusion and need to resolve it.We have paused all general verifications while we work and will report back soon.The row places Twitters criteria for deeming an account of public interest firmly in the spotlight.The account of white supremacist Richard Spencer is verified on Twitter, although, as critics have noted, the account of Wikileaks founder Julian Assange is unverified.We approve account types maintained by users in music, acting, fashion, government, politics, religion, journalism, media, sports, business, and other key interest areas, explains Twitter on its site.Well ask you to tell us why we should verify an account.If the account represents a person, we want to understand their impact in their field, it added.Users looking to get their Twitter accounts verified need to provide Twitter with information such as a verified phone number, a confirmed email address, a bio, profile photo and login verification.Follow James Rogers on Twitter @jamesjrogers
iPhone X screen ‘freezing’ in cold weather, but fix is coming:::::Apple has acknowledged a problem with its iPhone X that it plans to fix in a future software update.Users have taken a Reddit thread to complain that the iPhone X's screen becomes unresponsive when they step outside into the cold.When they come back inside where it's warmer, the iPhone X goes back to operating normally.Not all iPhone X owners have experienced the problem, but according to the Redditors, a sizable portion are able to replicate the issue when they go outside in the cold.In a statement to Loop Insight, which earlier reported on the Reddit thread, Apple said that it's "aware of instances where the iPhone X screen will become temporarily unresponsive to touch after a rapid change to a cold environment."While the company didn't say how many iPhone X users were affected by the flaw, it did say that the screen will return to normal operation after "several seconds."We took our iPhone X review unit outside this morning, going from a toasty 68 degrees to 41 degrees, and the screen remained responsive as we surfed the web and clicked on emails.Regardless, Apple is planning to fix the problem in an upcoming software update.According to Loop Insight, which dug through the Reddit forums, it's not immediately clear why the iPhone X will be fine in some cases and react abnormally in others.Users have postulated that it could be certain models affected, but again, Apple hasn't said what it might be.In a support page entry, Apple said that it recommends using the iPhone X in the 32-degree to 95-degree temperature range.The company added that using the device in temperatures outside that range "might cause the device to change its behavior to regulate its temperature."Interestingly, the support page suggests the iPhone X's problem goes beyond just turning the screen off and might actually turn off the entire handset.Apple also said that low temperatures could cause a "temporarily" shorter battery life."Battery life will return to normal when you bring the device back to higher ambient temperatures," Apple said on the support page.Apple has yet to announce when it'll release the software update to fix the cold weather problem.
Cunning malware spreads, going after your bank account:::::Malware keeps getting smarter at ways to get your money.And a new version of Zeus Panda malware has some scary smarts.According to a blog post by Cisco-owned Talos, the Zeus Panda malware essentially poisons Google search results to push fake bank-related results to the top of a key word search.Then, the unwary user, looking for quick answers to a search related to their bank, is fooled into clicking on malicious links.The malware utilizes search engine optimization (SEO) to make their malicious links more prevalent in the search results[which] will enable the attacker to quickly obtain credentials, banking and credit card information, Talos said.5 PHISHING SCAMS YOU NEED TO BE AWARE OF "[It's] a clever way...to serve malicious files," a spokesperson for the internet security firm Avast told Fox News."Although its not completely new, its rarely seen as a mechanism of spreading malware such as banking Trojans."Computer security website Bleeping Computer covered the malware in a recent post."This group has taken a novel approach, never before seen in the distribution of banking Trojans, Bleeping Computer wrote.The ultimate goal is to trick you into going to the hacked site, then redirecting you until you reach a site offering a Microsoft Word document for download, according to Talos.Ironically we have observed the same redirection system and associated infrastructure used to direct victims to tech support and fake [anti-virus] scams," Talos added.So far, the malware seems to be targeting customers in Sweden, India, Australia and Saudi Arabia.But thats never stopped successful malware from spreading to other countries.YOUR SPAM IS GETTING DANGEROUS How to protect yourself Malware often needs you to proactively click on links and buttons.In this case when the Microsoft Word document is opened, it prompts pop-ups such as Enable Editing, Enable Content and "Macros have been disabled."If you do enable the macro, an executable download will infect your system.The biggest red flag youll get is from Microsoft itself.By default, macros are disabled.And Microsoft wants you to keep it that way to protect you from documents coming from untrusted sources.Avast told Fox News that it is currently "blocking most of these sites, [which] prevents users from being infected."Defending against this attack requires not only vigilance by companies to make sure the sites and servers are compromised, but that consumers pay attention to what they are clicking on and not enabling macros or open unknown attachments, according to a post at SC Media, a cybersecurity website.
Apple's big plan to help the jobless:::::Melbourne University RMIT has teamed up with Apple to offer an Australian-first course giving students the chance to build apps and learn to code in the tech giants Swift programming language.As technology seeps into all aspects of our lives, its increasingly clear that young workers who have an understanding of how to design and build software applications will have a huge advantage in the modern workplace.And partnerships with tech giants like Apple could help shape the future curriculums of educational institutions.On a recent trip to France, Apple CEO Tim Cook said learning to code is more important than learning to speak English.In fact, the big languages of coding and computer programming will soon be the most commonly understood in the world.Apples vice president of environment, policy and social initiatives, Lisa Jackson, was in Melbourne today to announce the new partnership.From the beginning we wanted to make the practice of coding just like we do our products: simple, intuitive, engaging and empowering, she told news.com.au.Apples Swift coding language became available about three years ago.The company says it designed Swift to be an approachable and intuitive coding language for beginners while also allowing professionals to build sophisticated programs.Earlier this year the tech giant released a platform called Everyone Can Code which includes free learning experiences and online guides for students and teachers to help bring coding into the classroom.THE MULTI BILLION DOLLAR APP ECONOMY Since its inception in 2008, Apple has paid out more than $US70 billion to developers from its App Store, and RMIT vice chancellor Martin Bean wants to give more Aussie students a slice of that pie.Using its own version of Apples App Development with Swift curriculum, RMIT Online will begin offering a coding course on November 20 (you can enrol from today and the first batch of students will receive a 60 per cent discount) while a new vocational education short course will be taught on campus from February 2018.The app development course will also be integrated into RMITs tertiary curriculum for students enrolled in IT or computer science.These are the sort of skills Australians need for the jobs of the future and were delighted to work with Apple as the first university in Australia to deliver tailored, industry-focused courses using Swift curriculum, Mr Bean said.Students who undertake the course will be required to build an app that will then appear in Apples App Store.Because the course is outcome driven ... its like the best assessment in the world, Mr Bean told news.com.au.Because youre not having to pass a test, youre building an app that has to work and people have to like it.He sees it as a contemporary way for the university to teach coding and attract students to learn a much needed skill set.The so-called app economy is responsible for an estimated 113,000 jobs in Australia at the moment a number expected to grow immensely in the next decade.Its projected that by 2020, Australian industry will need more than 80,000 specialist tech workers.Melbourne developer Jason Fabbri who co-founded the app Roamni, a platform which crowd sources audio tours for cities around the world, said building the app with Swift ensured it was future proof for Apples App Store.The company has worked on the app for the past two years and hopes to launch by the end of the year.The move is a smart play by Apple the more people they can lure to learn their coding language, the stronger its App Store will be.Of course we want a vibrant App Store, Ms Jackson said.Apple is nothing without the App Store and the App Store is nothing without developers.Sometimes dubbed the most powerful women at Apple she reports directly to Tim Cook on an array of matters, which might sound daunting until you learn she used to do the same for then US president Barack Obama when she was head of the US Environmental Protection Agency from 2009 to 2013.We believe coding is an essential skill that people of all ages and backgrounds should have the opportunity to learn, so that they have the ability to create something that can change the world, she said.RMIT also worked with leaders of Australias burgeoning tech industry to help shape its new iOS App Development with Swift online program.The course was co-created and endorsed by major industry partners, including Tigerspike, jtribe and Bilue, who represented key drivers of growth in the app economy, the university said.AUSTRALIA PLAYING CATCH UP A report commissioned by NBN Co. last year claimed that one in two jobs in Australia will require programming and IT skills within 15 years.Many in the Australian tech industry argue there is a severe shortage of Australians skilled up for jobs in the sector and more needs to be done in training and early education something the Turnbull government sought to partly address in its 2015 Innovation Statement.For about the past three years, coding in every Australian school has been an official policy of the Australian Labor Party.The Queensland state government has introduced coding into its mandatory curriculum this year but because there is no standardised coding classes at a national level, parents who can afford to are sending their kids to holiday programs put on by companies like Code Camp.But Australia risks falling further behind the rest of the world in this vital area, experts warn.Belgium, the Netherlands, Finland, Estonia and England have all mandated coding and programming classes in school with kids as young as five learning to code and create their own computer games.Meanwhile US-led initiatives such as Code.org and the Hour of Code, backed by organisations like Microsoft and Google champion the need for young students around the world to have the opportunity to learn coding.The industry has been crying out for more digitally-skilled workers for years and RMIT is proud to work with Apple to meet the demand in this booming area and create life-changing educational opportunities for people from all walks of life, said Helen Souness, CEO of RMIT Online.As part of its commitment to boosting digital literacy in Australia, RMIT will also offer 100 scholarships for school teachers to upskill and help demystify coding by completing the RMIT Online program.The university will also offer a free summer coding school for Victorian-based students at RMITs City campus to give secondary students the chance to learn the basics of coding in Swift.We are proud to work with RMIT and many other schools around the world that share in our vision to help students learn the skills they need to create something that could change the world, Apple boss Tim Cook said in a statement.The reporter traveled to Melbourne as a guest of Apple.This story originally appeared in

North Korea's internet is as weird as you think it is:::::PYONGYANG, North Korea (AP) Ever so cautiously, North Korea is going online.Doctors can consult via live, online video conferencing, and lectures at prestigious Kim Il Sung University are streamed to faraway factories and agricultural communes.People use online dictionaries and text each other on their smart phones.In the wallets of the privileged are "Jonsong" or "Narae" cards for e-shopping and online banking.Cash registers at major department stores are plugged into the web.It's just not the World Wide Web.This is all done on a tightly sealed intranet of the sort a medium-sized company might use for its employees.The free flow of information is anathema to authoritarian regimes, and with the possible exception of the African dictatorship of Eritrea, North Korea is still the least Internet-friendly country on Earth.Access to the global Internet for most is unimaginable.Hardly anyone has a personal computer or an email address that isn't shared, and the price for trying to get around the government's rules can be severe.But for Kim Jong Un, the country's first leader to come of age with the Internet, the idea of a more wired North Korea is also attractive.It comes with the potential for great benefits to the nation from information technology and for new forms of social and political control that promise to be more effective than anything his father and grandfather could have dreamed of.It also allows for the possibility of cyber-attacks on the West.Pyongyang's solution is a two-tiered system where the trusted elite can surf the Internet with relative freedom while the masses are kept inside the national intranet, painstakingly sealed off from the outside world, meticulously surveilled and built in no small part on pilfered software.The regime created, in other words, an online version of North Korea itself.SURFING THE INTRANET Rising from Ssuk Island in the Taedong River, which divides Pyongyang east and west, is a building shaped like a colossal atom.The "knowledge sector" is a key priority for Kim Jong Un, and the sprawling, glassy Sci-Tech Complex, a center for the dissemination of science-related information throughout the country, is one of his signature development projects.It houses North Korea's biggest e-library, with more than 3,000 terminals where factory workers participate in tele-learning, kids in their bright red scarves watch cartoons and university students do research.Pak Sung Jin, a 30-year-old postgraduate in chemistry, came to work on an essay.It's a weekday and the e-library is crowded.Unlike most North Koreans, Pak has some experience with the Internet, though on a supervised, need-only basis.If Pak needs anything from the Internet, accredited university officials will find it for him.As a scholar and a scientist, Pak says, it's his patriotic duty to be on top of the most up-to-date research.He echoes the official condemnation that the Internet has been poisoned by the American imperialists and their stooges."There ought to be a basic acceptance the Internet should be used peacefully," he says.Today, he is relying on the Internet's North Korean alter ego, the national intranet.Below a red label that states his black "Ullim" desktop computer was donated by Dear Respected Leader Kim Jong Un, what's on Pak's screen is for North Korean eyes only.The IP address, 10.76.1.11, indicates he's on the walled-off network North Koreans call "Kwangmyong," which means brightness or light.Using the "Naenara" browser the name means "my country" but it's a modified version of FireFox Pak visits a restaurant page, his university website, and cooking and online shopping sites.There are very few actual sites on Kwangmyong.An official at the Sci-Tech Center said they number 168.They are spread across separate networks for government agencies, schools and libraries, and companies.It's all domestically run, though government-approved content culled from the Internet can be posted by administrators, primarily for researchers like Pak.North Korea's national intranet concept is unique and extreme even when compared with other information-wary countries.China and Cuba, for example, are well known for the extent of control the government exerts over what citizens can see.But that is done primarily through censorship and blocking, not complete separation.Like most North Korean computers, the desktops at the Sci-Tech Complex run on the "Red Star" operating system, which was developed by the Korea Computer Center from Linux open-source coding.Red Star 3.0 has the usual widgets: the Naenara browser, email, a calendar and time zone settings, even "kPhoto" (with an icon that looks a lot like iPhoto).Older versions featured a Windows XP user interface but it now it has a Mac design, right down to the "spinning beach ball" wait icon.Versions of Red Star that have made it out of North Korea and into the hands of foreign coding experts also reveal some rather sinister, and for most users invisible, features.Any attempt to change its core functions or disable virus checkers results in an automatic reboot cycle.Files downloaded from USBs are watermarked so that authorities can identify and trace criminal or subversive activity, a security measure that takes aim at the spread of unauthorized content from South Korea, China and elsewhere.Red Star also uses a trace viewer that takes regular screenshots of what is being displayed.The screenshots can't be deleted or accessed by the typical user but are available for checking if a trained government official decides to take a look.Outside North Korea, Android phones have a similar trace-viewer feature, noted Will Scott, who taught computer science at the Pyongyang University of Science and Technology in 2013 and is now a doctoral student at the University of Washington.But the Red Star version reflects the regime's very specific surveillance and violation-busting priorities.It doesn't collect much more than the Android would; however, it is designed to make getting at that information easier for a local authority who isn't an expert programmer.Scott said the North has been "very effective" in using such technology to serve its goals.Nat Kretchun, deputy director of the Open Technology Fund, said the kinds of censorship and surveillance software in Red Star and the mobile operating systems of phones and tablets reveal a new information control strategy.Under Kim Jong Un's predecessors, the flow of information was primarily controlled through a resource-intensive human network the State Security Ministry's "thought police," for example, or Pyongyang's iconic traffic controllers that kept tabs on what people were up to.But the advent of the Internet and advances in communication technology poked holes in that strategy, particularly among the better educated, younger and more affluent, the very segment of society that could be most likely to pose a political threat.So, while maintaining its old school tactics on the ground and enforcing the blackout of the global Internet, North Korean officials have learned to adapt by using the online devices themselves as yet another tool for surveillance."In North Korea cell phones and intranet-enabled devices are on balance pro-surveillance and control," said Kretchun, who has been studying North Korea's relationship to the Internet for years.THE AZALEA SMART PHONE AND THE RYONGHUNG IPAD The most common online experience for North Koreans isn't on a laptop or desktop.It's on a smart phone.A decade ago, only a small cadre of select regime and military officials had access to smart phones.Now, according to the main provider's most recent financial reports, there are an estimated 2.5-3 million mobile phones in North Korea, a country of 25 million.The rapid spread of mobile phones is one of the biggest success stories of the Kim Jong Un era.After a couple of false starts, the North's foray into mobile telecoms began in earnest in 2008 under Kim Jong Il.But it has truly blossomed over the past five years with the introduction of 3G services, thanks in large part to two foreign investors Loxley Pacific of Thailand and Egypt's Orascom Telecom Media and Technology.Like the walled-off intranet, North Korea's phones deny access to the outside world.Local phones allow North Koreans to call and text each other, play games, surf the domestic intranet and access some other services.Users have hundreds of ring tones to choose from, and can get weather updates, look words up in dictionaries and snap selfies.But they cannot receive or place calls to numbers outside that network the rest of the world, in other words.It's easy enough for North Koreans to buy phones, though the phones must be registered and approved.A good "Pyongyang" or "Arirang" model smart phone costs from $200 to $400.More basic phones go for much less, especially if the phone is second-hand.On the second floor of the Pottonggang IT center, a clerk stands behind a glass display cabinet filled with tablets and USB flash drives.Signs on the wall behind her advertise anti-virus software and apps to put on mobile phones, which they can do by Bluetooth at the store.One of the most popular apps is a role playing game based on "Boy General," a locally created hit anime series.It costs $1.80.Foreigners in North Korea are relegated to a different network and cannot make calls to, or receive calls from, local numbers.They can buy local phones if they want, but the devices will be stripped of the apps and features that they normally carry and securely coded so that the apps can't be added on later.Wi-fi use is banned for North Koreans, and tightly restricted and monitored to block surreptitious piggybacking on foreigners' signals.North Korea undoubtedly imports and rebrands some of its IT products.But over the past few months, two companies have generated quite a stir among Apple fans with products billed to be wholly domestic: the "Jindallae (Azalea) III" mobile phone and the "Ryonghung iPad."The gadgets' insouciant similarity to Apple products, and the flat-out appropriation of the "iPad" name, isn't especially surprising.Kim Jong Un likes Apple products he has been photographed with a MacBook Pro on his private jet, and even had a 21-inch iMac on the desk beside him when state media showed him reviewing a nuclear "U.S. mainland strike plan" four years ago.It seems North Korean coders have also lifted some ideas from Apple.Outside experts believe a program similar to what Apple uses in its OS X and iOS is believed to be the basis of the booby-trap that thwarts attempts to disable security functions in Red Star.It's now a staple on North Korean phones.And by 2014, all mobile phone operating systems had been updated to include the watermarking system to reject apps or media that don't carry a government signature of approval.It's the same mechanism used by Apple to block unauthorized applications from the App Store, but in North Korea's case serves instead to control access to information."The stakes are infinitely higher in North Korea, where communications are monitored and being caught talking about the wrong thing could land you in a political prison camp," Kretchun noted.WIRED ELITES AND CYBERSOLDIERS While blocking off the masses, North Korea allows more Internet access to a small segment of society, including the country's elite and its cybersoldiers.To create a snapshot of the online behavior of the elite, U.S.-based cyber threat intelligence company Recorded Future and Team Cymru, a non-profit Internet security group, analyzed activity in IP ranges believed to be used by North Korea from April to July this year.They found that the limited number of North Koreans with access to the Internet are much more active and engaged in the world and with contemporary services and technologies than many outsiders had previously thought, according to Priscilla Moriuchi, Recorded Future's director of strategic threat development and a former NSA agent."North Korean leaders are not disconnected from the world and the consequences of their actions," she said.How deep the access goes isn't known.Recorded Future and Team Cymru officials contacted by The AP refused to comment on details of their dataset, including how many "elite" users were observed and how foreign tourists or residents in the North were excluded.Even so, it stands to reason at least some members of the North Korean leadership have the access they need to keep up on world events and that specialist agents are allowed to monitor and cull intelligence from the internet.There is also strong evidence that North Korea allows people involved in hacking or cyber operations the access necessary for a deep engagement in cyberattacks and cybercrime.According to the FBI, the North's bigger hacks include the recent WannaCry ransomware attack, which infected hundreds of thousands of computers in May and crippled parts of Britain's National Health Service.It has been linked to attacks on the Bangladeshi central bank last year and on banks in South Korea going back to 2013.There was also the 2014 hack of Sony Pictures over the release of the "Interview," a black comedy that graphically portrayed Kim Jong Un being killed.U.S. authorities recently dubbed North Korea's cyber presence "Hidden Cobra."Weaponizing cyberspace is a logical option for the North because it can be done at relatively low cost and at the same time denied, according to a Congressional report submitted in August.Pyongyang has denied hacking allegations, but the ability to carry out sophisticated cyber operations is a powerful military weapon in the hands of a state.Just as assuredly as North Korea is developing its nuclear and missile capabilities, most experts assume, it's honing its cyber warfare tool box.Beau Woods, the deputy director of the Cyber Statecraft Initiative at the Atlantic Council, cautioned of a "preponderance of question marks" regarding North Korea's cyber skills.But he warned of how potentially devastating a more cyber-active North Korea could be.Those concerns are turned on their head back at the Sci-Tech Center in Pyongyang.Pak, the chemist, supports the official line in North Korea that the increasing danger of cyberattacks and slanderous Internet propaganda comes from the U.S. against Pyongyang.The government says that justifies "protective" walls to shield the masses from aggressive propaganda, and virtually requires extensive cybersecurity measures in the name of national defense."Don't you see how severe the anti-Republic slander of our enemies on the Internet is?"Pak said, although the restrictive policies make it difficult for him to carry out his research."There are a lot of cases where the Internet is being used to raise hostility against us."
Secret agent fish? Robot infiltrates aquatic schools, influences their behavior:::::Robots may be getting more realistic but most of us can still discern a human from a humanoid.Fish, on the other hand, seem easier to fool.Researchers at cole Polytechnique Fdrale de Lausanne (EPFL) in Switzerland have developed an aquatic robot that can infiltrate schools of zebrafish, going so far as to influence their activities.By designing robots to integrate with animal communities, the roboticists hope to unravel these animals behavioral and social structures by learning more about how they communicate.We wanted to study how a robotic agent can be inserted in a fish shoal, and, when inserted, how this robotic agent could learn how the fish interact, communicate, and take decisions, Frank Bonnet, an EPFL postdoctoral researcher who worked on the project, told Digital Trends.The robot has two parts a magnetic fish and a motor, which is positioned underneath the aquarium and helps propel the robot through the water.To infiltrate the school, the EPFL team identified characteristics that real fish use to distinguish themselves and designed the robot accordingly.These included physical traits (such as shape, color, and markings) and behavioral traits (including acceleration speeds, size of schools, and how the fish move their tails in transit).Taking the project one step further, the researchers designed the robot to learn and adapt from the behavior of the real fish.In somes studies, we compared groups composed of only fish with groups composed of fish and robots, Bonnet said.We could show that the two are behaving similarly, which shows that the robots are able to act like fish, and integrate groups of fish.We also used other setups, such as a ring-shaped setup, to show that the robotic agents can influence on the swimming direction preference of the fish.EPFL researchers have previously done similar work on cockroach communities, which are willing to accept practically anything that emits specific cockroach pheromones.Fish posed a much more difficult task, but Bonnet already sees how the work will shed light on the nuances of their societies.We could already learn which features are relevant for the fish for social integration, he said.We can also learn the hierarchy in fish societies, if for instance there are some leaders, and what are the important aspects to become a leader in fish groups, and how the fish are collectively taking decisions.A paper detailing the research was recently published in the journal Bioinspiration & Biomimetics.
How to deactivate your Facebook account, and what happens next:::::I just deactivated my Facebook account.It wasn't a snap decision, but a culmination of a lot of things that peaked with some of the revelations about how the Russians used the platform to spread targeted ads and widen political divisions in the U.S. during the last presidential election.I also found that the product is no longer the one I used to love the one I found useful in college to learn more about friends I was meeting and whether we shared classes.Instead, it seems more like a wasteland of political opinion, memes and cartoons I don't find interesting and snippets of video I have no interest in watching.It's become an outlet for opinion and random entertainment instead of a place to connect with other people.There are some things I'll miss.I've found Facebook useful for managing my social life, particularly with the invites to events that other Facebook friends are attending.I'm willing to give that up for now, though, and maybe it'll help me learn to reach out to people more directly, like over the phone, instead of with a quick "like" on a post or an automatic "happy birthday" comment.If you're like me and want to do the same, here's how:
Etienne Schneider: The space industry is now 2% of Luxembourg’s GDP:::::One of Europe's smallest countries now holds claim to being a giant in the space industry.Luxembourg, with a population less than the state of Vermont, now generates nearly 2 percent of its annual gross domestic product from the space industry, according to Deputy Prime Minister Etienne Schneider.The country's economy checked in just shy of $61 billion in 2016, according to the CIA World Factbook."We have grown from nothing to the most dynamic in Europe," Schneider told an audience Saturday, in a speech at the New Worlds conference in Austin, Texas.He added that the country's space program was first launched just over 30 years ago.Schneider, who also serves as Luxembourg's economic minister, told the conference that he is often questioned about why Luxembourg is so "keen on exploiting space resources."He replied by saying the same "liberal, extremely business friendly climate" that pushed the country's financial sector boom is now being reapplied to attracting space companies."I have more than 70 space companies in the pipeline," Schneider told CNBC after the speech.Luxembourg's "space resources initiative" is the country's plan to make the most out of a quickly growing global industry, the minister said."It's a series of measures to position Luxembourg as the European heart of exploration and use of space resources."He highlighted U.S. companies Deep Space Industries and Planetary Resources, as well as Japanese ispace as three key, rising players in Luxembourg.With a per capita GDP of $103,000, Schneider says the space industry has "strong public support."Space mining is Luxembourg's present focus, but it is not the country's first.In 1985, Luxembourg launched a public-private partnership with satellite builder SES.While Schneider said he believes the satellite business has not plateaued, he does not anticipate the space industry growing beyond the 2 percent GDP mark any time soon."It could be 5 percent, but that may be 10 or 15 years," Schneider said."Right now we have dozens of companies that are here but have yet to make money.We have startup incubators and investment funds are being established."The key then, to Schneider, is his nation's legal framework of ownership.The United States and Luxembourg are the only two countries in the world to have passed laws giving corporations ownership of materials mined in space, but only after they've been extracted."Allowing companies to have ownership of future materials gives venture capital firms incentive to come here and buy into these opportunities," Schneider added.
Showing people what it feels like to be sick could scare them into healthy behavior today:::::This device lets you feel the effects of Parkinson's disease 7:03 PM ET Thu, 9 Nov 2017 | 01:27 Next up, the company is working on a similar device to simulate COPD.Klick's intended goal is to build empathy between patients and their caregivers.But it's possible that technology like this will be used to dissuade people from unhealthy behaviors.And it might be just drastic enough to work.Changing behavior is a lot more challenging than giving people a Fitbit or an Apple Watch.Studies have found that technology that nudges users to take their medications on time or exercise more regularly isn't usually sustainable in the long-term.Think about how many of these devices end up gathering dust in the back of a closet.This new approach might work, but needs to be studied."I do think that you can dissuade users via a virtual feeling," said John Brownstein, a Harvard professor and the chief innovation officer at Boston Children's Hospital.Klick's devices might play a role, but Brownstein also sees potential for virtual and augmented reality.For instance, these technologies could be used to "age" people to show how they might look after several decades of smoking (makeup artists have tried that on young smokers, but it's unclear whether the results had an impact).It might not work for everyone.The optimism bias, a well-documented cognitive effect that causes a person to believe that they are at a lesser risk of experiencing a negative event compared to other, might blunt its effectiveness.Moreover, studies have found that using fear as part of a punishment procedure is unlikely to succeed in promoting healthy behaviors.Still, Brownstein believes it's worth a shot."Direct experience of future symptoms could potentially change the course of someone's unhealthy habits," he said.
'Singles Day' China shopping festival smashes record with $25 billion haul:::::Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce giant, said on Saturday its Singles' Day sales extravaganza hit $25.4 billion, smashing its own record from last year and cementing it as the world's biggest shopping event.Once a celebration for China's lonely hearts, Singles' Day has become an annual 24-hour buying frenzy that exceeds the combined sales for Black Friday and Cyber Monday in the United States, and acts as a barometer for China's consumers.As tills shut midnight on Saturday, Alibaba's live sales ticker registered 168.3 billion yuan, up 39 percent from 120.7 billion yuan last year.The dollar figure was up more steeply due to the strength of the yuan against the greenback this year.The event began soon after a star-studded event in Shanghai late on Friday.As midnight hit, a deluge of pre-orders helped drive a billion dollars of sales on Alibaba's platforms in the first two minutes and $10 billion in just over an hour."In terms of scale it just dwarfs any other event out there," said Ben Cavender, Shanghai-based principal at China Market Research Group.At just past the halfway mark, the headline gross merchandise volume swept past last year's dollar total just shy of $18 billion.Shortly afterward, sales surpassed the 2016 total in the local currency.The event gets shoppers around China scouting for bargains and loading up their online shopping carts, while delivery men - and robots - brace for an estimated 1.5 billion parcels expected over the next six days."This is a big event for China, for the Chinese economy," Joseph Tsai, Alibaba's co-founder and vice chairman, said."On Singles Day, shopping is a sport, it's entertainment."Tsai said rising disposable incomes of China's "over 300 million middle-class consumers" was helping drive the company's online sales and would continue."This powerful group is propelling the consumption of China," he said.The final total more than the GDP of Iceland or Cameroon leaves other shopping days in the shade.Cyber Monday in the United States saw $3.45 billion in online sales last year.Investors closely watch the headline number, though some analysts say the way it is calculated is too opaque.The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission launched a probe into Alibaba's accounting practices in 2016, including into its Singles Day data.That investigation is as yet unresolved.
Salesforce COO Keith Block explains how to win even if you're not one of the 'Big Five':::::Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff once called Keith Block "the best sales executive the enterprise software industry has ever seen."The remark came in early 2014, six months after Benioff hired Block away from Oracle where Benioff himself got started and made him COO.At the time, Benioff said he'd been trying to hire Block for 10 years.Benioff is not prone to understatement, but his respect for Block has been borne out.Since Block started, Salesforce's revenue has approximately tripled, from $4.1 billion in the fiscal year ended in January 2014 to an expected $12.5 billion for the year ending in January 2019.Its share price has jumped more than 160 percent during his tenure, giving Salesforce a market value of over $75 billion.That makes Salesforce the rare counterexample to the dominance of the "Big Five" Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, and Facebook which have added a total of over $1 trillion in value this year.In particular, Salesforce has managed to stay one step ahead of Microsoft, a competitor in the space where Salesforce made its name: Customer relationship management software.While CRM is what sales organizations use to keep track of customer interactions, Salesforce has expanded into adjacent markets like marketing, and has deftly signed partnership agreements with enterprise giants that include IBM, Amazon and even Alphabet's Google.As Block explained to CNBC during the company's massive Dreamforce conference last week, the way to compete with giants is not to worry about the competition."We are laser-focused on the customer.We're not worried about ERP, we're not worried about consumer electronics, we're not worried about servers, storage," he said."Some of those five that you're referring to, that's their world that's not our world.And I think that world largely represents the past, and our world is about the future It's about customer engagement and growth," Block added.Salesforce does have a partner agreement with Microsoft to make it easier for customers to integrate its products with Microsoft's Office 365, among other things.The two companies cozied up to each other after Satya Nadella took over as CEO in 2014, and Nadella was a major presence on stage at Dreamforce in 2015.But the relationship has again soured.The two companies were in sharp competition to acquire LinkedIn last year, and the gloves came off after Microsoft won.Benioff has gone back to taking potshots in public.Block stays out of that fight, letting his voluble boss do the honors.He prefers to focus on the business."If you go back to the origins of that relationship with Microsoft, that was in response to what's best for our customers," he said.Here's a transcript of our conversation, edited for length and clarity.CNBC: Can you give me an overview on how things have changed in the four and a half years since you've been there?What's improved?Keith Block: If you go back to the roots of the company, [when] I started with the company -- it was about 4 billion in revenue at that particular point in time.We just gave our forward guid[ance] of 12 and a half billion, which means that the company will triple in five years, in terms of revenue, going from 4 to 12 and a half billion.So we're all very, very excited about that.But the roots of the company were single cloud sales force automation.Largely selling into the SMB [small and mid-sized business] space.And since then, the company's gone through a transformation where we've moved very, very aggressively, both globally, in terms of our international expansion, as well as moving into the enterprise.And if you look at our business mix, you can see that the enterprise business has been on fire.CNBC: Did you have to build up vertical expertise in the sales team?Block: Yes, so all the go-to-market organizations today are very deliberately moving towards more vertical market selling and services expertise.We released vertical products for the first time last year.Financial Services Cloud, which was focused on the wealth management business, and Health Cloud, which is the relationship between the patient and the provider.A couple weeks ago we announced the retail bank solution.So we have deep industry expertise, deep industry knowledge.Our customer-facing teams are focused by industry.We've released products specific to those two industries.CNBC: As you guys were trying to move up market and go into the enterprise, what were the biggest challenges you faced?Block: In certain cases, there's a market awareness challenge, historically, because some companies thought we were just in sales force automation and clearly we're not; we are a customer success platform.And there's a cultural change, even inside the company, to think differently about the life cycle, the relationship, the strategic nature of going after those customers.The international expansion is very important because if you are going into the enterprise, these are global companies.So you need to be able to service them all over the world.CNBC: As an outsider, it's sometimes a little hard to get a read on Saleforce because you typically don't have a huge product release every few years.How do you guys think about that kind of rolling product development and how do you work with company IT departments to get them comfortable with that?Block: The days of, "We are gonna work years, and then there's going to be a big release," is -- it's over.That is the thinking of the past.You know, big upgrades, big bang, wait years for innovation.It's done.I lived in that world for a very long time.Part of the challenge with that it, if you wait three years for anything, the technology changes -- certainly nowadays, because we've seen this accelerated technology -- but your business changed.So the whole market can change underneath you, while you're trying to figure out what to do for three years.So I think increasingly, customers are embracing the notion of agile, very quick.You know, you hear the expression of "scrum teams," that's very, very new to engineering.CNBC: Do you need more of a high-touch, constant-touch sales and communication process because of that?Again, from the outside, I'm unsure whether to treat Salesforce as more of a software company or more of a services company or consulting company.You're kind of neither; you're kind of both.How do you look at that?Block: We're a transformational company.We're a solutions company.And, you know, specific to the enterprise, we have offerings that we provide called ITCs -- "innovation technology centers" -- where we'll put a cadre of people who are on site and they're driving adoption.And even if you don't use an ITC, that's part of our regular success services.So when you buy something from us, no matter what, you automatically are connected with a journey and somebody who's going to support you and shepherd you through this transformation.CNBC: Do you find other companies in the enterprise space mimicking that approach more so than they were four years ago?Block: I think that if you're a legacy technology company that has been doing business for a very, very long time, it's no different than any other company in any other industry that is facing market dynamics around, "you must transform," because your market is being disrupted.And I think those legacy technology companies it's like turning an aircraft carrier in pre-stormy seas.It's hard.CNBC: The big talk in tech these days is how five companies really dominate The New York Times, for example, talks about the "Frightful Five."And in the enterprise space, the most talked about frightful five is Microsoft.The perception is, if you're not one of those five, you have no chance.Salesforce has conclusively disproved that.How much do you concern yourself with the really huge players at the top?And as you move up into the enterprise, who do you run into and what kind of tactics are you running into where they try to block your progress?Block: It's very interesting the way that's been positioned.Here's what I would tell you: Number one, all we care about is our customer success; everything that we do is about the customer.We are laser-focused on the customer.We're not worried about ERP, we're not worried about consumer electronics, we're not worried about servers, storage.Some of those five that you're referring to, that's their world -- that's not our world.And I think that world largely represents the past, and our world is about the future -- It's about customer engagement and growth.That's our vision, that's our mission.It's aligned with the CEOs in the world.If you look at the market statistics, we're the number one in CRM.We're the number one in sales, we're the number one in service, we're the number one in marketing.The beat goes on.So we're playing our game, we're laser-focused, 20,000 employees -- that's all we do.
New PTSD treatment options for military veterans focus on technology:::::The National Center for PTSD estimates that between 11 percent and 20 percent of veterans who served in Iraq and Afghanistan have PTSD.Among Vietnam War veterans, they estimate that 30 percent have had PTSD in their lifetime.When veterans return from deployment, they are required to complete a Post-Deployment Health Assessment, or PDHA, which contains 25 questions, including a checklist of symptoms.Veterans must self-disclose their symptoms to the document, and the information goes on their record.Lucas said veterans and service members filling out the survey might feel pressure not to disclose all of their symptoms.The checklist is impersonal and, because the information from the PDHA is recorded, it might affect future deployment opportunities for still-serving members and job opportunities for veterans."The culture of the military is to say, 'No, I'm fine,'" Lucas said.Ellie offers anonymity to patients the interview is not recorded.Instead, she reads expressions by tracking 66 points on a patient's face, and she also registers speech patterns.Analyzing this data in real time, she responds to patients with active affirmations, like nodding or even saying "mhmm" when patients appear to need it.More from Modern Medicine: America's veterans: Overlooked in the endless Obamacare battle A primer on how to handle stress after a traumatic event A popular party drug is looking like an effective treatment for depression The new study, published in Frontiers, shows that by building rapport with patients and keeping the interview anonymous, Ellie outperformed the PDHA in getting veterans to disclose symptoms.Ellie even topped an anonymous PDHA to show that a conversation, even with a virtual therapist, is effective in assessing PTSD."It's a humanlike interaction," Lucas said."It makes people feel more comfortable sharing personal things, like symptoms of PTSD."In the future, Lucas hopes that Ellie will be able to report the likelihood of a veteran having PTSD immediately following the interview.That will allow the veterans to make a more informed decision about seeking treatment through therapy.
Tesla bear says Elon Musk makes Donald Trump look like an angel:::::Breaking into autonomous taxis could drive Tesla shares higher, says one analyst.But a short investor isn't buying that idea.ARKInvest analyst Tasha Keeney said Friday on CNBC's "Closing Bell" that billionaire investor Ron Baron may not be wrong to believe he can still make 20 times his money on his investments."If you look at the opportunity in autonomous cars, which we think is the largest market opportunity Tesla has in front of it, that is quite possible," Keeney said on Friday.The potential market for autonomous taxi services is actually much larger than the market for manufacturing cars alone, Keeney said.She also thinks Tesla is much further ahead than any traditional automaker in this space.Keeney does not own any shares of Tesla, but ARKInvest owns shares.She maintains that while Tesla makes a few thousand dollars off each Model 3, it could make more than $10,000 a year in cash off each car if they were used in an autonomous taxi service.At least one Tesla analyst remains skeptical.Gabe Hoffman of investment firm Candens Capital says such claims about Tesla's upside potential are "absolutely ridiculous."Tesla is Hoffman's largest short position."Tesla already has a $50 billion diluted market cap.To say that it is going to $1 trillion is unbelievable."Hoffman said recently issued Tesla bonds are "trading in junk territory and will get downgraded to junk."He also said that the Model 3 will be a "complete disaster" both in quality and safety, and that autonomous cars are at least 10 years away, based on what he reads from autonomous technology engineers.Hoffman said Musk is "full of it" on Tesla's timeline for autonomous cars."Elon Musk makes Donald Trump look like an angel," Hoffman said.Tesla did not immediately respond to calls for comment.
Netflix dropped 5 percent this week, after rallying all year:::::Will Disney's streaming service be able to compete with Netflix?3:53 PM ET Fri, 10 Nov 2017 | 03:45 The fastest growing FANG stock slowed this week.Netflix up 64 percent in the last 12 months, outpacing Facebook, Amazon and Google parent Alphabet shed more than 5 percent this week, as big media players started eyeing the streaming space.At Friday close, the stock had fallen to $192.02."I think Netflix is in trouble when the big guys start coming after them," Needham analyst Laura Martin said."Netflix should be scared to death."The stock wavered Monday on reports of a possible Disney-21st Century Fox deal that could challenge the streaming service's iron grip on the market, falling just more than a percent.Disney CEO Bob Iger took a shot at the streaming service this week, telling investors that over-the-top, direct-to-consumer distribution had become vital to its business and that its own streaming service would be priced "substantially below" Netflix.All of this comes while Netflix ups its content budget by $1 billion to fund more original programming, even as two stars of Netflix original shows are accused of sexual misconduct.Netflix announced in October it would suspend filming of its breakout series "House of Cards" following reports that lead Kevin Spacey made a sexual advance at a 14-year-old in the '80s.Friday, the company tweeted it would not follow through on production of a stand-up special with comedian Louis C.K.following harassment reports by five women.To be sure, this week's stock movement was far from earth-shattering.It's still hovering just below all-time highs.
Air Force general says China is advancing in space five times as quickly as the US:::::A half century of regulating satellites made government regulations bulky and nearly impossible for entrepreneurs.Kwast analogizes the current regulatory environment to needing to submit an itinerary for every item you plan to bring on a flight from D.C. to Los Angeles one year before the flight."You have to detail everything in your suitcase each item's material, manufacturer, weight and more the government takes a year to go through it and then tells you what you can and can't take," Kwast said."And, if you have to update your request, then you have to start all over."He continued, "When you finally get approval you have to spend your entire life savings for the airplane, which, when you land, you have to burn to the ground."Officials want to evolve regulatory methods but must placate taxpayers that discarded rockets will not begin falling on suburban rooftops."You need technological innovations to reassure Congress that this is safe and effective, as the FAA cannot do this unilaterally," Kwast said."Low-cost access to space is the first domino to making this possible."SpaceX has also criticized the regulatory process, with President Gwynne Shotwell noting the process takes six months "and then you re-apply at 90 days, 30 days, and then 15 days to file a flight plan.""If we want to achieve rapid progress in space, the U.S. government must remove bureaucratic practices that run counter to innovation and speed," Shotwell said.
Early Uber investor: Why IPO when SoftBank will 'save' your company?:::::With some tech companies struggling post-IPO, Silicon Valley could start looking elsewhere for cash namely, to Japanese billionaire Masayoshi Son, technology investor Jason Calacanis told CNBC's "Squawk Alley" on Friday."There's this other optionality, the Masa-IPO," Calacanis said."In Silicon Valley now, everybody's talking about, 'Why IPO when you can just Masa-PO?'Masa's going to save all these companies and put the money in and we're good.So I feel great about it."Son, the SoftBank CEO, has pledged to invest $100 billion in artificial intelligence, including robots and autonomous vehicles, using an unrivaled sum of money known as the Vision Fund.SoftBank has invested in companiessuch as Nvidia and SoFi, both of which the Vision Fund which is also backed by non-SoftBank investors may also invest in.Calacanis was an investor in Uber a company that's considering taking money from SoftBank after a flurry of controversies earlier this year.Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said this week that while he and his board want Uber to go public, SoftBank is a long-term investor with little interest in an IPO."Our bringing in SoftBank as a strategic investor at the right price would be a good thing," Khosrowshahi said in an interview by New York Times columnist and CNBC anchor Andrew Ross Sorkin at The New York Times DealBook Conference.Not everyone is as bullish as Calacanis and Khosrowshahi.Oaktree Capital's Howard Marks said the "willingness of investors to invest in a shockingly large fund for levered tech investing with a questionable structure is a further indication of an exuberant, unquestioning market."Bill Gurley another venture capitalist who invested in Uber has long cautioned that a sparse IPO market and high private valuations could lead to recklessness from start-up founders and investors."Founders have come to believe that more money is better, and the fluidity of the recent funding environment has led many to believe that heroic fundraising is a competitive advantage.Ironically, the exact opposite is true.The very best entrepreneurs are relatively advantaged in times of scarce capital," Gurley wrote in 2016, before SoftBank's Vision Fund entered the scene."Loose capital allows the less qualified to participate in each market."Son has brushed off the idea that the Vision Fund is affecting start-up valuations or creating any sort of peak."My track record the last 18 years is 44 percent, compound every year," Son told Sorkin in a separate conference in October."People call me high risk, high return.High return, definitely yes.But I don't know if it's high risk.If you think deep enough, if you work hard enough, if you smartly select ...I think it's not only high return but could be good."CNBC's Sally Shin and Leslie Picker contributed to this report.
Apple will issue a fix for iPhone X devices that seize up in the cold:::::Apple will issue a software update to fix iPhone X screens that act up in cold weather, the company told CNBC.Some social media users complained that the iPhone X screen would become unresponsive or inaccurate in the cold, unless users locked and unlocked the phone.The issue became more widely known when it was reported on popular Apple blog The Loop."After several seconds the screen will become fully responsive again.This will be addressed in an upcoming software update," an Apple spokeswoman said.The pricey new iPhone X is the first iPhone to feature an OLED display, which allows darker blacks, brighter colors and is more flexible and durable.This newer type of screen is tricky to produce, even for industry-leader Samsung: The Galaxy S6 handset faced supply constraints in 2015 because of this type of screen.The iPhone X issue surfaced just as many Americans are preparing for record low temperatures over the weekend.A blast of Arctic air is expected to chill areas of the northeastern United States for the next two days.
Elon Musk just got 1 million likes for an Instagram photo taken at a Turkish memorial:::::Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk took a photo in Turkey that has earned more likes than anything else he has posted to Instagram.Musk posted a shot of himself at the memorial of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the first president of modern Turkey and a champion of secularism and modernization.The post has nearly 1 million likes.
Mark Zuckerberg: opioid epidiemic is more than health crisis:::::Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the extent of the U.S. opioid crisis was the thing that surprised him the most during his travels throughout America this year."The biggest surprise by far is the extent of opioid issues, it's really saddening to see," Zuckerberg said during a live Facebook broadcast from the University of Kansas.Zuckerberg grew emotional and had to pause to compose himself as he recounted talking to opioid addicts and the effects the epidemic has taken on them, their families and the country."One thing we don't fully internalize, how this epidemic has affected people's attitudes more broadly...it's one of the worst public health issues," he said.Zuckerberg, the world's fifth-richest person, suggested the epidemic may have even impacted last year's election.The issue is "so pervasive, it's affected attitudes on political issues more than people realize...counties that swung from Democrat to Republican were those with some of the highest opioid addiction rates," Zuckerberg said.The opioid epidemic "is getting attention, but nowhere near what it needs.It's a public health crisis," he said.Facebook has been widely criticized and last week faced tough questioning in Congress for allowing Russians to use its ad targeting to influence last year's election.Despite this and other problems, Zuckerberg said he remains an optimist, pointing to the France, which had a drug epidemic problem a decade ago."It won't happen overnight, but there is a road map for how to improve.""People who are addicted to opioids don't want to be," he said.Zuckerberg also addressed the pervasive negative effects that economic globalization has had on some parts of the country he visited."When you lose a job, it doesn't just affect your family in the short term.It affects your view of what you want to do in the long term," he said.Zuckerberg recounted a discussion he had with workers who had lost their jobs at a paper mill in Millinocket, Maine, after the work there moved across the border into Canada."People there were very entrepreneurial...but many of these folks were afraid the next job they would get would also be replaced," he said, decreasing the chances they would seek job re-training.
Alibaba sales surge $5 billion in first 15 minutes on Singles Day:::::Alibaba hit $5 billion in transactions in less than 15 minutes on Singles Day, blowing the opening minutes of past years for the one-day shopping event out of the water.To put that figure perspective, Alibaba made more transactions in first 15 minutes of Singles Day this year than it did during the entire first hour of the cybershopping event back in 2015.And last year, it took the Chinese e-commerce giant a full hour to reach $5 billion in transactions.Within the first 30 seconds, 97 percent of sales were generated through mobile devices.The peak number of transactions per second so far this year reached 325,000.Payment transactions reached 250,000, about two times greater than in 2016, according to Alibaba's data.Singles Day is a holiday in China, in which unmarried men and women celebrate their single lifestyle.The holiday derives its name from the date it takes place on, 11/11.In 2009, Alibaba decided to turn Singles Days into a cybershopping event along the lines of Black Friday in the United States.Last year, Alibaba saw $17.8 billion in sales during the day-long event, far surpassing the $12.8 billion Americans spent in the four days after Thanksgiving."It's not that we need Singles Day," Alibaba Group President Michael Evans said in an interview with CNBC on Friday."It's the opportunity for merchants and consumers to have fun and engage in something that's really exciting.It's the opportunity for consumers to explore and find new brands and new products."
Bernstein analyst finds Tesla Model 3’s fit and finish ‘relatively poor’ after test drive:::::A real-life Model 3 demonstration did not alter one Wall Street analyst's skeptical view of Tesla."We had the opportunity to see and test drive the Model 3 at Tesla's showroom in Red Hook Brooklyn, NY Fit and finish on the two demo cars we saw perhaps not surprisingly was relatively poor," Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi wrote in a note to clients Friday."While we doubt that it would impact (or even be noticed by) most prospective buyers, we do worry that poor overall initial quality could undermine Tesla's brand and potentially overwhelm its service network."Sacconaghi reiterated his market perform rating and $265 price target on Tesla shares, representing 12.5 percent downside to Thursday's close.
Overstock may soar if sells e-commerce, focuses on bitcoin blockchain:::::Shares of Overstock.com could soar more than 60 percent, according to the primary Wall Street analyst covering the e-commerce company.D.A.Davidson analyst Tom Forte is the only analyst listed on FactSet covering the stock, which has topped $1 billion in market value only in the last few weeks.Forte said in a Thursday note that after Overstock indicated in an earnings call it could sell its home e-commerce business, he is raising his target price on the stock to $85 from $57 a share."We now see the possibility of unlocking value in its two most significant assets its home e-commerce effort and Medici Ventures (portfolio of nine companies that, to varying degrees, leverage the blockchain)," Forte said.He has a buy rating on the stock and said the market still doesn't fully appreciate the value of Medici Ventures, the blockchain-focused division Overstock launched in 2014.Blockchain is the technology of bitcoin and other digital currencies that have caught Wall Street's attention this year.Independent investor and longtime short seller Marc Cohodes cited Overstock's work in blockchain when he predicted in October that shares can reach $100.Overstock is an online retailer of home goods and clothes that has quietly invested in and developed businesses focused on digital currencies and their blockchain technology.Shares leaped 31 percent Thursday to $52.40, leaving about 62 percent potential gains in order to reach Forte's target.Shares rose more than 5 percent Friday, on pace for gains of more than 20 percent for the week.Late Wednesday, the company reported diluted net loss per share of 3 cents in the third quarter, better than its 12-cent loss per share in the third quarter last year.The Medici division posted a pretax loss of $3.7 million, greater than the $3 million reported in the same period last year, according to a presentation.The stock has surged in the last several weeks after CEO Patrick Byrne announced the company's majority-owned subsidiary tZero is launching a digital coin-trading platform.The company has a license for a U.S. alternative trading system.The news drew attention to Overstock's work in blockchain development since 2014 amid increased interest in this year's surge in bitcoin to record highs.In the last few weeks, two small stocks that added "blockchain" to their names saw their shares leap dramatically as traders bet on the companies as a way to play the momentum behind bitcoin and the potential of its blockchain technology.Reflecting the high interest in bitcoin and blockchain, Byrne said about 850 people dialed into Overstock's third-quarter earnings call, according to a StreetAccount transcript.Byrne also said the call could be his last with the company as it currently exists.The e-commerce company said in its third-quarter earnings release that Quantum Partners, a private investment fund managed by Soros Fund Management, bought a $4 million warrant to purchase nearly 10 percent of Overstock's common shares at $40.45 each until early January.
‘The space industry is changing’ and NASA must evolve, lead administrator says:::::A new era is dawning in space, and NASA, despite decades of tight budgets, wants to remain the industry's leader."The space industry is changing," Bill Gerstenmaier, the NASA associate administrator for Human Exploration and Operations, said Friday at the New Worlds conference in Austin, Texas.He does not expect "to get another huge budget like the Apollo missions," and says NASA will focus on "orchestrating human spaceflight," instead of conceptualizing, funding, building and operating all on its own.Having served in his role since 2005, Gerstenmaier told CNBC that he sees NASA now operating more akin to a venture capital firm, picking investments and helping build them up.He cited Morgan Stanley's recent report on the industry as a look into the direction space is heading."In the past, NASA would pick one company, give them a contract and throw money into it to ensure success," Gerstenmaier said.He wants NASA to drop the hope he believes many in the organization have: That if NASA just dreamed up the right program, then taxpayers would fund it."The days of getting funding that's three or four percent of GDP are long behind us," Gerstenmaier said.The core of Gerstenmaier's vision is the principle of "fiscal realism," something he told CNBC is a different approach than those in NASA's past."We want to back programs that are implementable in the near-term within the power of current budgets," Gerstenmaier said.Projects that "only do one thing" are the antithesis of Gerstenmaier's ideology.He gave the example of concepts for developing different spacecraft that fulfill multiple functions."While a lunar lander may need to be different than one that lands on Mars, you can develop an ascent vehicle that does both," Gerstenmaier said.In testimony before the House Science Committee on Thursday, Gerstenmaier updated representatives on NASA's progress with its two exploration vehicles, the Space Launch System and Orion manned craft.Gerstenmaier added in his comments Friday that these are each a part of "a basic framework" for expanding human presence in space beyond low Earth orbit.That framework is "not NASA's plan" for future programs, but rather the direction NASA wants to lead the industry.The end goal is the "need to increase the amount of people in space," Gerstenmaier said."The future is expanding human presence in partnership with nations, companies and innovators," Gerstenmaier added.
Traders bet on Cisco and against Best Buy ahead of earnings next week:::::Next week key technology and retail names are set to release earnings, and traders are making big bets ahead of those reports.In keeping with the recent market trends, they are betting that Cisco moves higher after earnings, while retailer Best Buy will trade down.This week bullish investors bought more than 11,000 Cisco calls with a November 34.50 strike price.The San Jose, California-based company is scheduled to report earnings Wednesday after the bell.The calls expire next Friday and so as long as the stock trades above $34.50 by then, the investors can exercise their right to buy the stock and collect a profit (minus their cost to purchase the option).Options can be a less costly way to play the market because if the stock fails to reach the strike price, the investor is only out the price he or she paid for the option.But they do hold big risks too since they are just a contract and so their value can go to zero quickly.
Tesla investor Ron Baron believes he can make 20 times his money:::::Billionaire investor Rob Baron: We have a chance to make 20 times our money in Tesla 12:44 PM ET Fri, 10 Nov 2017 | 03:53 Ron Baron thinks he can make billions on Tesla despite criticism that the electric car maker is overvalued and may have trouble delivering on its ambitious plans.The billionaire investor's firm has invested in Tesla for about three years, and has about a $500 million stake in the carmaker, Baron told CNBC's "Squawk Box" on Friday.He said the position has made about $150 million in profits.Baron said it can yield about 20 times his initial investment over the next 10 to 15 years."People don't have that kind of horizon in investing, and I think that is what gives us a big advantage," Baron said.Tesla certainly has its doubters, and the company has struggled with a number of challenges, including production issues that have slowed deliveries of the company's Model 3 sedan.But Baron has confidence in Tesla's CEO Elon Musk, and believes competitors will have a tough time catching up to Tesla.Paraphrasing Robert F. Kennedy, Baron said Musk "thinks about things that never were and asks why not?'"
Top VC deals: Muscial.ly, self-driving cars and a mind-reading headband:::::China's ByteDance, the company behind the news app Toutiao, acquired Musical.ly for a sum between $800 million and $1 billion, according to The New York Times and other reports.Since it was founded in 2014, Musical.ly, has amassed a reported 120 million users, many of them adolescents in the U.S.The Musical.ly mobile app is used to create and share lip-synch videos, and live video streams.The company raised $146.9 million in venture funding from ChinaRock, Susquehanna International, GGV Capital and GX Capital among others.Apple acquired imaging sensor start-up InVisage Technologies for an unreported sum.Rumors of the deal had swirled in October.The company's core technology, QuantumFilm, enables cameras to capture images in poor lighting.Investors in InVisage included: Intel Capital, Nokia Growth Partners and GGV.It's not just tech companies acquiring machine-learning start-ups.Shiseido purchased Giaran, an early stage start-up backed by MassChallenge.Giaran's virtual mirror software lets users see how different makeup will look on their skin.The software works well with new, high-definition cameras on smartphones, and uses machine learning to make product and make-up recommendations.
Disney shares jump as Wall Street getting optimistic media giant can compete with Netflix:::::Disney shares are rising Friday as analysts are bullish on its upcoming internet video streaming services, despite the company's earnings miss.The media giant reported weaker-than-expected fiscal fourth-quarter earnings Thursday.It generated earnings per share of $1.07 versus the $1.12 Thomson Reuters consensus estimate.But analysts got excited after the company said it would price its upcoming streaming service "substantially below" Netflix during the earnings conference call.The stock rose 3 percent Friday morning."We finally got some glimpse into pricing ... to convert Disney's 'gigantic' customer base into subs with pricing likely to move higher as more and more content is added," Wells Fargo analyst Marci Ryvicker wrote in a note to clients Friday."Given how just about all of our stocks tend to trade on sub numbers, we view this strategic comment as an incremental positive."Disney announced plans in August to launch a branded direct-to-consumer streaming service in 2019 and an ESPN streaming service in 2018.Ryvicker reiterated her outperform rating and $116 price target for Disney shares.In similar fashion, Goldman Sachs is bullish on Disney's upcoming ESPN streaming offering.Disney's "EPS growth is poised to accelerate reflecting a bigger and better film slate (2 Star Wars, 4 Marvel, 2 PIXAR) with ample consumer products opportunities, tailwinds from new attractions (Avatar in Orlando, Toy Story Land in Orlando and Shanghai), and an improving outlook for ESPN driven by benefits from virtual MVPDs and ESPN Plus the new OTT launching this spring," analyst Drew Borst wrote in a note to clients Friday.Borst reaffirmed his buy rating and raised his price target to $120 from $115 for Disney shares.Disney has underperformed the market this year with its shares down 1.5 percent in 2017 through Thursday, compared with the S&P 500's 15.5 percent return.One analyst is also optimistic on the future prospects of other Disney businesses."While the quarter largely missed our expectations, looking ahead, we remain upbeat on DIS shares as we head into a strong film slate, growth from recent and upcoming carriage renewals, and continued momentum at the Parks," Piper Jaffray analyst Stan Meyers wrote in a note to clients Friday."The company remains best positioned in the current fragmented media landscape to leverage its content across a growing number of distribution channels, its own global theme parks and consumer products."Meyers reiterated his overweight rating and lowered his price target to $120 from $130 for Disney shares, representing 17 percent upside to Thursday's close.CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed to this story.
Amazon faces fines following the death of a warehouse worker, the second in the same month:::::Amazon could face $28,000 in potential fines after an inspection by the state of Indiana found potential workplace safety violations at a warehouse where a 59-year-old worker was killed in late September.The Associated Press reported that the victim, Phillip Terry of Indianapolis, "was fatally crushed when a forklift's lift fell on him while he was doing maintenance work on it."Terry was killed on Sept. 24 at an Amazon facility in the Indianapolis suburb of Plainfield.In a nine-page letter to Amazon, the Indiana Department of Labor outlined four violations that could carry fines of $7,000 each.They included a failure to "provide adequate training" and to develop and document certain safety procedures.Amazon can appeal the penalties.More from Recode: Amazon has slashed seller fees to try to improve its grocery selection online It's 2017 and Amazon only has one woman among its 18 most powerful executives Amazon's invasion of Kohl's has begun An Amazon spokeswoman said the company does not comment on ongoing investigations, but released a statement saying: "Safety is our number one priority, and as we do with any incident, we are reviewing our practices and protocols to ensure the well-being of our employees.Any safety incident that occurs within our operations is one too many."Also in September, a 28-year-old worker named Devan Shoemaker was killed at an Amazon warehouse in Carlisle, Pennsylvania.Shoemaker was accidentally crushed by a truck near the facility's loading docks on Sept. 19, according to a local news report.Another Amazon worker was killed in an accident at the same facility in 2014.The Occupational Safety and Health Administration is still investigating Shoemaker's death, a spokeswoman said.Amazon has come under fire in recent years for how physically taxing some of its warehouse jobs can be.The company's warehouse workers aren't unionized.A 2014 union drive at one of its Delaware facilities failed.As Amazon's retail business continues its rapid growth, the company has been furiously building out its warehouse footprint and hiring for these facilities to try to keep up with consumer demand.Behind the magic of the Amazon Buy button, an army of warehouse workers do the hard work that make it possible.By Jason Del Rey, Recode.net.CNBC's parent NBCUniversal is an investor in Recode's parent Vox, and the companies have a content-sharing arrangement.
China's Singles Day will be an important test for online retailers like Alibaba:::::Singles Day, once a celebration for China's lonely hearts and now the world's biggest shopping spree, opens at midnight on Friday, with millions of shoppers eager to snap up cut-price deals.At a star-studded event in Shanghai, e-commerce giant Alibaba will count down the clock for the annual Nov. 11 event - a 24-hour extravaganza that outsells the U.S. Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales combined, and acts as a barometer for China's consumer spending.Alibaba alone saw $17.7 billion of goods sold on its platform at last year's Singles Day.Around China, consumers have already started scouting for deals and filling up online shopping carts, while delivery men - and robots - are gearing up for the estimated 1.5 billion parcels expected over the next six days."This is a big event for China, for the Chinese economy," co-founder and Alibaba vice chairman Joseph Tsai said ahead of the sales bonanza."On Singles Day, shopping is a sport, its entertainment.""There are today over 300 million middle-class consumers in China.Every year, their disposable income increases, they are demanding better quality goods and want a better standard of living.This powerful group is propelling the consumption of China," Tsai said.Analysts and investors will closely watch the headline sales number, which will race past $1 billion within a few minutes past midnight, and is likely to top last year's total.Spending rose by nearly a third at 2016's sale - the eighth iteration of the event - but that was slower than the 60 percent increase logged in 2015.At Alibaba's Friday night gala, co-founder and chairman Jack Ma will host guests including actress Nicole Kidman, basketball star LeBron James, and Chinese musicians and film stars such as Zhang Ziyi and Fan Bingbing.
FCC net neutrality rollback being disrupted by states: Steve Forbes-commentary:::::Imagine a crazy quilt-like patchwork of state regulations governing the internet unquestionably, the most border-free platform ever known to humanity.It would be chaos, and a massive deterrent to investment, innovation, and growth.If you think this is "fake news" from the deep and dark corners of the dark web, you will be surprised to learn it is where we could be headed if the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) does not act to prevent this disaster by establishing a clear, nationwide regulatory framework that protects the free flow of information in cyber space.President Donald J. Trump's savvy Chairman of the FCC, Ajit Pai, wisely wants to roll back Obama-era Title II net neutrality regulations.The 80-year-old so called Title II regulations were originally used to regulate railroads and then the Ma Bell telephone monopoly of the 1930's.This rollback is a big step forward.It's almost laughable to believe Title II rules would be an effective North Star guiding the next chapter of internet advancements.The lunacy of applying old, rotary- dial telephone regulations on something so dynamic is self-evident.For the U.S. to remain at the forefront of high tech, we must return to the extremely effective framework for internet policy that was put in place under President Bill Clinton and continued by George W. Bush and allowed the Internet to flourish with a light-touch regulatory approach.If Chairman Pai wants the Internet to continue to evolve, expand and flourish, he and his colleagues at the FCC have the crucial obligation to preemptively guard against online activists who are poised to unleash a torrent of harmful state-level legislation.
Musical.ly app sells for $1 billion:::::The only Chinese social-media company to build a major network outside China will be taken over by a fast-growing Chinese upstart.Musical.ly, a video-based social network popular with teenagers in the United States and Europe, is being sold for between $800 million and $1 billion to Bytedance, the company that controls the Chinese news aggregator Toutiao, according to a person familiar with the matter.The deal knits together Toutiao's 120 million Chinese users with the roughly 60 million that use Musical.ly in the United States and Europe, ultimately linking a platform in China with a more global one.Musical.ly will continue to operate a separate product, according to a statement on the deal, though the two companies will cooperate closely.More from The New York Times: 68 Things You Cannot Say on China's Internet Who's Too Young for an App?Musical.ly Tests the Limits Chinese Tech Firms Forced to Choose Market: Home or Everywhere Else Despite the dominance of established social media services like Facebook and Snap, Musical.ly rose to prominence among a teenage and tween audience by enabling users to record quick videos set to music.Young users of the app performed coordinated dance moves or lip-synced to the music.Since then the company has branched out to other types of videos, including live streaming, and has even sought to attract short-form video shows.For Toutiao, Musical.ly brings a toehold in valuable American and European markets.Ostensibly an aggregator of news content, Toutiao has evolved into something more like a Facebook newsfeed.The company uses artificial intelligence to cater an array of posts and videos to users.It has grown increasingly video heavy, and works more as an aggregator of entertainment in a country where a large number of websites vie to attract a smartphone-addicted population.For Musical.ly, Toutiao brings a huge user base in China and expertise in how to attract users.While Musical.ly has had success overseas, the company has been slow to target a Chinese market that its founders say can be more competitive and radically different from Western markets.
America’s veterans: Caught in the middle of the GOP Obamacare repeal effort:::::Analysis from RAND reveals that the ACA increased health insurance coverage rates among veterans.The study states that an Obamacare repeal would reduce the health-care options provided to veterans and also could place additional stress on the already challenged VA health-care system.There are 20 million veterans in the United States, according to the VA, and Census data reveals that 5.5 percent, or 510,000 non-elderly veterans (under 65), are uninsured.Only 3 out of 5 non-elderly veterans are eligible for Veteran Affairs health care.If they are not eligible for the VA, many veterans turn to Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act.Some also rely on both Medicaid and the VA system.Before major state Medicaid expansions took place in 2013, only 1 in 10 non-elderly veterans were insured, according to the RAND study.By 2015 uninsurance rates fell by 36 percent."What we found is non-elderly veterans were more likely to be insured in 2015 than they were in 2013," said Michael Dworsky, co-principle investigator of the RAND report study."There was not just a reduction in numbers of uninsured, but a reduction of veterans who said their only source of health coverage was the VA." Out of 2.8 million non-elderly veterans enrolled in the VA health-care system, only 25.8 percent of them rely on it as their sole source of health insurance."People very often think that people that serve in the military get health care for life, but that's not really how the VA works," Dworsky said."Although many veterans are enrolled in the VA, there is still a large number who are uninsured and have no regular access to health care."Military veterans who served for 24 consecutive months or another specified full duty period are eligible for coverage for five years after being discharged.Elderly veterans qualify for Medicare and about half of all veterans in 2016 had health insurance coverage through the government program.But that leaves many veterans who served in recent decades with a potential health insurance gap after their five-year period and before they become eligible for Medicare.Census data found that for the other half of the veteran population who were of working age (ages 19 to 64) both the number and rate of those without health insurance declined to a new low during the past four years.
Equifax executives will forgo annual bonuses to balance cost of data breach:::::Equifax executives will forgo their 2017 bonuses in the wake of the company's devastating cybersecurity incident, CEO Paulino Barros said on the company's earnings call Friday.Barros said he and other executives would receive no incentive compensation "due to the impact of the cybersecurity incident."Total incentive-based compensation, in the form of cash bonuses, accounted for $83.1 million of Equifax's total compensation in 2016, according to company filings.The incident in which hackers gained access to the personal data of more than 145 million Americans represented a "one-time charge" of $87.5 million, CFO John Gamble said on the call.- CNBC's Tucker Higgins contributed to this report.
Bitcoin plunges after upgrade is called off, but offshoot 'bitcoin cash' surges more than 40%:::::Bitcoin fell Friday to its lowest since Nov. 1 as traders bet on its offshoot, bitcoin cash, instead.The offshoot digital currency surged more than 40 percent to its highest since Aug. 19, and was last trading near $947, according to CoinMarketCap.Bitcoin cash split off from the original version of bitcoin in August as a minority group of developers decided to implement an upgrade in an effort to increase transaction speeds for the digital currency.An alternative bitcoin upgrade proposal, SegWit2x, which initially had more developers behind it, was called off Wednesday due to waning support.Bitcoin three-month performance Source: CoinDesk Bitcoin hit a record high of $7,879.06 that day after the news, but quickly fell and was trading 9 percent lower on the day Friday afternoon near $6,500, according to CoinDesk.That marked its lowest since Nov. 1."You can see people playing back and forth between bitcoin and bitcoin cash trading depending on where they think near-term catalysts may be," said Chris Burniske, author of "Cryptoassets: The Innovative Investor's Guide to Bitcoin and Beyond.""It's been a battle of investors versus traders that were stockpiling bitcoin to get their 'bitcoin2x dividend.'"Investors at the time of a bitcoin split technically receive equal amounts of the offshoot currency.Disagreements over upgrade proposals have caused uncertainty over the future of bitcoin, but some traders had been buying bitcoin ahead of splits in order to benefit from a payout of a new digital currency and a potential relief rally in bitcoin following the split.Creating bitcoin cash through the "mining" process was 13.6 percent more profitable than mining bitcoin, according to data on Coin Dance's website.Bitcoin cash performance from Aug. 1 to Nov. 10 Source: CoinMarketCap Bitcoin has tended to recover quickly from pullbacks.The digital currency's price is up seven times this year and in a sign of growing interest from institutional investors, the world's largest futures exchange, CME, is planning to launch bitcoin futures by the end of the year.Another digital currency, ethereum traded about 4 percent lower near $307.52 Friday after hitting a nearly one-month high Thursday, according to CoinDesk.
Uber drivers are 'independent contractors.' Here's how tax reform can settle the issue:::::As a diehard Mets fan, I can tell you with far too much pain and aggravation how long it's been since 1986.In the thirty-one years since the Mets have failed to win another World Series, Congress has also chosen not to meaningfully update the tax code.So while tax reform still may not be quite as rare as a championship in Flushing, whether you like or hate the current GOP proposal, modernizing the tax code is an opportunity that doesn't come around very often.The world has changed a bit since the heyday of Mookie Wilson and Keith Hernandez.We didn't have iPhones back then.No Netflix.No Google.No Facebook.No Amazon.No internet at all in fact.And certainly no sharing economy.Whether it's Handy, Uber, Lyft or any of the hundreds of startups connecting people who need a service with people who can provide a service, 45 million Americans (one in five adults) have now worked in the sharing economy (that number is projected to grow by another 20 percent over the next three years alone).The sharing economy has radically changed both the way we work and the way our economy functions.And everyone who works in the sharing economy has to deal with an outdated tax code that never even imagined the existence of this type of work or this type of approach in the first place.That needs to change.That's why lawmakers need to ensure that the tax reform bill includes the New Gig Act proposed by Senator John Thune and Congressman Tim Rice.This addition would make it clear that sharing economy workers are independent contractors who are free to come and go as they please, accept or turn down work as they please, and work for as many platforms as they want.Tens of millions of people have chosen to work in the sharing economy mainly because of its tremendous flexibility.That appeal is what drives these platforms.It needs to be codified in law and the New Gig Act finally does that.
Tesla is taking big investors for a joy ride in the Model 3:::::Tesla is inviting institutional investors for a joy ride in the Model 3 12:45 PM ET Fri, 10 Nov 2017 | 00:45 Tesla is inviting institutional investors to take a joy ride in the Model 3 this weekend.An invitation, which was viewed by CNBC, was sent to clients and prospective clients of UBS.It says drivers at the closed-door event will be accompanied by Tesla representatives and barred from taking photos or videos.The event will take place at Tesla's Red Hook showroom and service center on Saturday.A Tesla spokesperson didn't respond to a request for comment.Earlier this week, Tesla also hosted Wall Street analysts at various events.Teams from RBC Capital Markets and Goldman Sachs, for example, were permitted to drive the Model 3 (at least for a few blocks) accompanied by representatives from Tesla investor relations.Firms including Goldman and RBC issued favorable reviews of the Model 3 in updated notes on Tesla this week.However, the Model 3 has yet to be tested by the most influential car critics and auto trade publications.Tesla has been beset by production delays for its Model 3 sedans, attributing the problems to suppliers.The Model 3 concept was first announced by CEO Elon Musk in March 2016.Musk said in July that Tesla would probably be making 20,000 Model 3s per month by December.But Tesla now expects its production rate for Model 3s to hit 5,000 units a week by the end of March.As of its latest earnings report, Tesla said it had only produced 260 Model 3s.Would-be owners put down a refundable $1,000 deposit to preorder the car.They may not be eligible to recoup a $7,500 federal tax credit for electric vehicles if production is delayed too long, according to Greentech Media.Nomura Instinet's Romit Shah has given the car a test drive.He reiterated a buy rating on Tesla and compared the brand to Apple.Tesla holds so much sway with consumers that he expects them to forgive reasonable delays and buy the company's cars with or without EV tax credits.Tesla reported losses of $1.66 billion in the first three quarters of the year, and some investors are now questioning if the company has enough cash and credit to hit its Model 3 goals and more.
When Your Uber Driver Brings a Time Machine:::::Advertisement Modern Love When Your Uber Driver Brings a Time Machine Image Credit Brian Rea The name next to the tiny photo of my Uber driver looked familiar, and so did the face.If it was him, I was in for one awkward (or interesting) ride with the ex-husband of the woman now married to my ex-husband.Wrapping up a business trip, I was standing outside a hotel in Silicon Valley.My meeting had ended sooner than expected so I was headed to the airport to try to catch an earlier flight to New York.Since I wasnt in a rush, I had chosen the shared ride feature.I had two minutes to decide whether to cancel, as the car icon was closing in.I kept the reservation.I knew it was him.What are we to each other, two people whose ex-spouses are now married?The word must exist in some language, maybe French or Italian.Twelve years ago our marriages ended, and several months later our exes moved in together.His wife had been my husbands assistant, then associate.Their work involved investing in start-up companies in Latin America, so they traveled often, and we spouses often tagged along.Back in the New York City area, we regularly had dinner at each others houses.I knew their children.Over time, they moved to the Connecticut town where my husband and I had a weekend house, which meant we saw them even more.I didnt think much of it, though friends told me they thought it was creepy.The divorce shattered me.My husband and I had met near the end of college and shared a huge circle of friends.I was attracted to his fancy suburban background, a step up from my scrappier family where I was the first to graduate from college.We lived in Hong Kong, saw Angkor Wat and Easter Island.At first, our opposite natures felt complementary my curiosity, his need for the familiar.The biggest difference, or so we thought, was that I wanted children and he didnt.And if we werent going to have them, I wanted more of everything else: spontaneity and adventure.Yet he was ready to settle down.In suburbia, no less.We started unraveling.If wed had children, we would have had a reason to fight for the marriage.At the time, I said the child issue was our undoing, but we knew it was more than that.We couldnt make it past 10 years, when initial attraction often starts sliding into other kinds of marital love.And we both had turned to others for emotional support.Time really is the only thing that heals a wound like divorce.I cant remember when I stopped thinking about my ex every day, but I realized as my Uber driver wound his way through traffic toward me that it had been ages since that whole mess had ruled my life.I can conjure up my exs face but not his smell or his voice.I dont recall what it felt like to wake up next to his body.Over the past 12 years, I had barely thought of the guy whose face was now on my phone.He had emailed me after we each separated, looking for commiseration or help in his divorce case.I was too consumed by my own pain to reply.When his car pulled up, I saw a big, familiar smile through the windshield.He sprang out and said, I had a feeling it was you!After a long embrace, we got into the car, with me in the passenger seat instead of the back.It was oddly comfortable sitting next to him.He canceled the ride share passenger and we went to a cafe, where we sat for nearly two hours, chattering.We whipped out our phones to share photos.Weddings.Homes.Trips.A new wife and gaggle of stepchildren for him.A new husband and French bulldog for me.Full, happy lives.Or at least thats what the photos suggested.It made me wonder what photos from our previous marriages would have suggested about those lives.Did we feel as contented then as we both appeared to feel now?Would others have been able to see something shattering behind the smiles?And thats when we turned to a subject that once cut deeply for us both, though I cant remember who asked first: Had our exes been physically involved before our splits?He didnt know, and neither did I, though we didnt think they had, at least not technically.Most startling, though, was how it no longer mattered to either of us.That once-scalding question had lost its potency.But it took seeing him and talking about it to make me realize that.We quickly moved on.He knew my mother and best friend and wanted updates.I was thrilled to hear that his children were now promising young adults, details I could have gotten through my ex had I ever thought to ask in the occasional emails we trade.Boys who would remember me as their stepfathers ex-wife.Hes been a standup guy as a stepfather, my Uber driver said.I assumed he was, even though it caused me terrible pain that he hadnt wanted children in our marriage.They were meant for each other, we said nearly in unison, before rattling off the quirks that made them compatible and agreeing that we are all better off in our new couplings.I have been with my new love for 12 years, almost exactly as long as I had been with my ex.Two years ago we traveled to Italy.As we packed, I couldnt help remembering another trip to Italy in my previous life, a trip for a 10th anniversary that marked the beginning of the end.On our first night in Positano, I lost my footing on the cobblestone streets and knew I had broken something.A local doctor confirmed it and gave me a shot of something alcoholic.The next day we flew home, cutting our trip short.The marriage never felt the same.That foot never felt the same either.Until recently, when I noticed my toes dont feel numb anymore.When I met the man who is now my husband, I was 39 and he was 46; our window for having children was nearly closed.I knew he didnt want them, yet I couldnt pull away.I started to admit that maybe there was a reason I chose men who were skittish about fatherhood.It was easy to assign the decision to someone else.I still mourn that loss, but increasingly Im at peace with it.Rather than going deep into a few key relationships, I have an ever-expanding collection of people in my life extended family, younger friends, mentors of all ages.I have gratifying work, volunteering and time to read, travel, learn.None of this came out in the wave of photos, but looking at them made me see it.My Uber driver, whose tie to me still yearns for a name perhaps my ex-once-removed?wanted to make sure I didnt miss my flight.So we returned to the car and headed to the airport, where we hugged again and promised to keep in touch.I immediately called my husband.We rarely talk when I travel, preferring to text and email.I come home to flowers and some little surprise near the mail.If I have taken a red-eye, I jump into bed with the man and pooch I have gotten a real chance to miss.This time I couldnt hold it in.Youll never believe who my Uber driver was!I said.And then I spilled the whole story.We were on so long, I nearly missed my flight.My husband was rapt, wanting every detail, even though he would see me in a few hours.And I was glad because, for years, he hadnt wanted to hear about my first marriage, studiously avoiding the subject.But this had changed for him too, now that it was so far away.That could have been a scene in a movie, he said.In the movie version, though, I would have had a fling with the ex-once-removed.In real life, I got closure from the most unexpected source.I realized that connections at a distance, along with the passage of time, can offer telling reflections and a reminder that marriages can unravel in an instant.How could I ensure this new life wouldnt break apart the way my last one had?Months later, to protest Ubers business practices, I deleted the app, but with a twinge of regret.In a strange way, Uber had helped me sort out my feelings about the most significant men in my life and moved my current relationship into a more honest place.Who knew there was an app for that?Sign up for the Of The

Men at Work Wonder if They Overstepped With Women, Too:::::In response, some men are forming all-male text groups at companies or in their industries to brainstorm on harassment issues.Some said they planned to be a lot more careful in interacting with women because they felt that the line between friendliness and sexual harassment was too easy to cross.Others are struggling to reconcile how these behaviors could happen even among men who believe in equal rights.Joel Milton, 30, an entrepreneur in Denver with Baker Technologies, a platform for cannabis dispensaries, said he had recently decided to be more careful about corporate offsites after seeing the swell of #MeToo claims.When I hear someone on my team is having a pool party, now Ill say, Hey, maybe no managers should be there, Mr. Milton said, relaying the type of information likely to be covered in many companies employment manuals.He added that harassment was not something he had thought much about before, but that he was considering his own behavior more.Like, did I ever do anything?he said.Many companies have long mandated anti-harassment training to educate men and women about the issue.But in a report last year, the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission found that much of that training was ineffective and that workplace harassment was widely underreported.Jonathan Segal, a lawyer who was on the commissions harassment task force, said he was now fielding odd questions from men about how to behave at work.At a fund-raiser last month in Palm Beach, Fla., some men asked him if it was permissible to hug a woman and where the boundaries should be drawn.Mr. Segal said he had explained to the men that the context mattered and that pretending there was a gray zone between collegial friendliness and sexual assault was absurd.For instance, he told them, hugging an old friend is very different from going up behind a co-worker while she was at a desk typing.Photo If someone cant understand that, then maybe they just shouldnt be hugging, he said.Mr. Segal, who runs anti-harassment training, is now expanding part of the program called Safe Mentoring, which teaches men how to mentor younger women without harassing them.At a recent session, a male supervisor talked about having an extra ticket to a sporting event and feeling he could invite only a male colleague; Mr. Segal went over how to invite a female colleague without sexually harassing her.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The answer to harassment cannot be avoiding women, he said.Still, some workers said they were starting to follow the Pence rule, which was formerly known as the Billy Graham rule, after the evangelical preacher, but is now named for Vice President Mike Pence.Mr. Pence has said he does not eat alone with women who are not his wife or attend an event without her if alcohol will be served.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.A conservative writer, Sean Davis, wrote that a lot of men in media should have effectively been heeding the Pence rule all along.He said he had always followed it and that coastal, liberal America was finally waking up to how useful avoiding private meetings with women could be.The former White House adviser Sebastian Gorka also made this argument.What were seeing now is men are backing away from the role that we try to encourage them to play, which is actively mentoring and sponsoring women in the workplace, said Al Harris, who has been running workplace equality programs and writing on the topic from Chicago with his partner, Andie Kramer, for many years.Theres apprehension on the part of men that theyre going to be falsely accused of sexual harassment.Not everyone is practicing avoidance.Some men said the best route is to ask female co-workers directly if they feel harassed.Pat Lencioni, the founder of the Table Group in Lafayette, Calif., which does executive coaching for companies around issues like diversity, said he was doing just that and had asked the women at his office if they worried about harassment.I came into the office and said, Hey, guys, Ive got a question for you: This sexual harassment stuff, all these things, do you guys ever worry its going to happen here?Mr. Lencioni, 52, recalled.And they were like: No, because we know you.We know who you are.He said he thought this approach could be adopted more broadly.Other men said they had not talked about workplace harassment with anyone because they already knew what they needed to know.This is a liberal town, said Philip Rontell, a real estate agent in Walnut Creek, Calif., who added that he supported the #MeToo campaign.We all already know this stuff.When men do want to talk about workplace harassment, some said, they dont know where to go.I just dont know where those conversations are allowed to be had, said Ryan Ellis, 33, a sales manager for an e-commerce company in Santa Monica, Calif. Austin Gilbert, a recruiter in San Francisco for the company Gametime, said his industry had also had to deal with men talking in online chat rooms at work, which he said could bury and hide toxic comments.His company has closed several high school in-group type of exclusionary work chats over the years, but he worries about more.Advertisement Continue reading the main story We have a policy of telling employees that were free to review all electronic communications, Mr. Gilbert, 31, said.But thats typically not anyones job responsibility in a small company.With women empowered to call out inappropriate behavior, some companies predict that boozy after-work events for the holidays could be combustible this year.While many companies used to have the parties on Thursday or Friday evenings, some are moving them to late Monday or Tuesday afternoons, said Sarah Freedman, the vice president of operations for 23 Layers, an event planner in New York whose clients include Google and West Elm.Open bars are being replaced with game zones.One client recently asked for an extremely watered-down John Daly to be the partys signature drink, which Ms. Freeman found strange but probably wise.After-work events are the front line when it comes to harassment, and companies want more safety precautions now, she said.
Uber Hit With New Blow in London as Panel Says Drivers Aren’t Self-Employed:::::Advertisement Uber Hit With New Blow in London as Panel Says Drivers Arent Self-Employed Image Yaseen Aslam, left, and James Farrar challenged Uber in Britain on behalf of a group of 19 drivers, arguing that the ride-hailing company had denied them basic protections by classifying them as self-employed.Credit Carl Court/Getty Images LONDON Uber suffered another setback in its biggest market outside the United States after a British employment tribunal rejected the ride-hailing companys argument that its drivers are self-employed.The decision on Friday , which affirmed a ruling issued last year, means that Uber will have to ensure that its drivers in Britain receive a minimum wage and paid time off.That creates problems for a common hiring model in the so-called gig economy that relies on workers who do not have formal contracts.Companies argue that such labor practices increase flexibility on both sides of the hiring equation.But critics counter that the system is exploitative and deprives employees of important safeguards like unemployment insurance.The ruling was the second blow to Ubers business here in recent months.In September, Londons transport authority barred the company from operating in the British capital.In the case before the employment tribunal, two men, James Farrar and Yaseen Aslam, had challenged Uber on behalf of a group of 19 drivers, saying that the service had denied them basic protections by classifying them as self-employed.Uber countered with an argument it has used around the world: Its drivers were independent contractors.You can hide behind technology, but the laws are there, and they need to be obeyed and respected, Mr. Aslam, 36, said in an interview after the tribunal issued its decision.The impact of this ruling could affect thousands of drivers, and not just drivers but millions of workers across the U.K.It just means we cant be exploited, he added.The acting chief of Ubers British operations, Tom Elvidge, said the company would appeal the decision, either to the Court of Appeal or to Britains Supreme Court.The employment case here is one of several challenges that Uber faces.Although the company has expanded at a breakneck pace and grown into a behemoth valued at $70 billion, it has had to grapple with allegations that it does not do enough to vet its drivers , revelations that it used software to evade the gaze of the authorities and other issues.Complaints about an aggressive workplace culture forced Travis Kalanick, a founder of the company, to resign as chief executive this year .He was succeeded by the former chief executive of Expedia, Dara Khosrowshahi, who has displayed a more conciliatory style .As part of his softer approach, Mr. Khosrowshahi went on a charm offensive last month in an effort to win over the London transport authorities .Uber is appealing the London ban, which declared the company not fit and proper to operate in the city.Uber was allowed to continue operating in the city until a final ruling was made in the case.Mr. Khosrowshahis shift in tone comes at a crucial time.Uber is aiming for an initial public offering in 2019, and working on securing a multibillion-dollar investment from the Japanese conglomerate SoftBank.As part of its push to win over customers and drivers concerned about Ubers reputation, the company has introduced new measures and services, including allowing users to add tips to fares.Uber has also promoted its efforts, particularly in Britain, to provide drivers with benefits like access to insurance and pensions.Essentially, it has been outrunning employment law and legislators, said Andr Spicer, a professor at City Universitys Cass Business School in London.Its having to become more like a normal company, rather than one that was able to evade existing legal frameworks.Ubers operations in London are crucial to its global expansion.The company started operating in the city in 2012, and now offers its services in dozens of cities nationwide.About 40,000 people drive for Uber in the British capital, and the company says that three million customers have used the app in London at least once in the past three months.Ubers arrival in London has, however, set off a clash with the citys famous black cabs .Drivers in the centuries-old taxi system must pass an exacting test known as the Knowledge , which requires the memorization of around 25,000 streets and 100,000 landmarks.A ride in a black cab is typically far more expensive than using Uber, which cabbies complain is too lightly regulated.Opponents of Uber argue that it is able to undercut rivals on price largely because of its employment practices, which mean it can avoid paying some of the costs and contributions required by permanent employees.But the companys business model is facing challenges across Europe .The regions highest court is expected to rule by years end in a case involving whether Uber should be regulated as a taxi service, which would make it subject to rigorous safety and employment rules, or as a digital platform that simply connects independent drivers and passengers.Labor experts say that laws in most countries have failed to keep pace with advances in technology and the rise of the gig economy.In Britain, for example, the main piece of legislation that regulates how workers are treated was passed in 1996.The legislation is old, said Susannah Kintish, a partner at the law firm Mishcon de Reya who specializes in employment law.It came out when the Spice Girls had their first hit.Its just way out of date.Follow Prashant S.

Farhad and Mike’s Week in Tech: Get Ready for Robot Cars:::::So even though its only happening in Arizona, this is a big deal.Waymo is clearly leading the pack in the race to produce self-driving cars, which makes sense because of Googles multiyear head start in the space.Would you be comfortable being carted around in a self-driving car?I was, but perhaps Im just used to it since its one of the main topics I write about.Farhad: Because I live right near Waymos headquarters, this is all old hat for me.I see the companys cars including the old panda-shaped ones that lack a steering wheel every morning during my commute.Id have no problem riding in one, but I hope Arizonans know that its very annoying to share the road with these robot cars.Theyre slow!They follow the speed limit, they take ages changing lanes and they have a frustrating habit of obeying every single rule of the road.Ugh, live a little, robot car STOP is just a suggestion, not some kind of law.Mike: Yes, well, dont throw away your drivers license quite yet.Or maybe do.AT&Ts Megadeal Hits a Political Bump Mike: Moving on, a bigger piece of telecom and media news.This week, our DealBook team scooped that the Department of Justice under the Trump administration is pushing Time Warner and AT&T to sell off Turner Broadcasting Company, which owns CNN, or DirecTV as a condition of a negotiated merger that has long been in the works.Its a huge ask, and hard to see how its not politically motivated.As we all well know, President Trump is no fan of CNN.Also, Im curious to know what legal grounds the D.O.J.would use to block a merger of this size.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Interested in All Things Tech?The Bits newsletter will keep you updated on the latest from Silicon Valley and the technology industry.Farhad: The move makes for complicated politics.On the one hand, many liberals who are growing wary of ever-larger corporations might agree with the federal government putting stringent conditions on this deal.And yet its hard to tell if these conditions are legitimate, or if theyre being imposed to please a president who has repeatedly vowed to go after businesses that havent toed his line.Advertisement Continue reading the main story I wonder how this sort of thing affects liberals efforts to police big tech.In a speech this week, Senator Al Franken called for greater regulations on tech giants.Trump has suggested some affinity for that stance; during the campaign, Trump often said that The Washington Post, which is owned by Amazons C.E.O., Jeff Bezos, was covering him critically because Amazon was worried that Trump would start antitrust proceedings against the company.Now, imagine if something like that happens would the left cheer Trump, or would they side with Amazon?I truly wonder.Mike: Right, well, we all saw how well the last huge Time Warner merger went, so lets hope this one goes better!Oh, I wanted to note a fantastic story from The New York Times Magazine this week, basically on the opacity of Facebooks algorithms and how its advertising can be so effective at targeting small groups of users that some start-ups are spending all their cash there and nowhere else.Its like Russia and the 2016 election, but for brands!Is Facebook Ruining Our Lives?Farhad: Speaking of Facebook, there was a startling admission this week by Sean Parker, the Napster co-founder and former Facebook executive (played by Justin Timberlake in The Social Network).In an interview with Axioss Mike Allen, Parker said that hed become a conscientious objector on social media, which he said had been built to addict us all.It probably interferes with productivity in weird ways, he said.God only knows what its doing to our childrens brains.Watch for more of this.More and more people both in and out of Silicon Valley are worried about the long-term psychological effects of our digital age.I worry about you especially, Mike.Mike: Too busy looking at Twitter.Actually, the last thing I wanted to note: Will.i.am, the hip-hop artist and self-styled tech evangelist, has raised another $100 million in venture capital.He started on wearables and gadgets, and has pivoted to work on chatbots and devices like Amazons Alexa and Google Home.Advertisement Continue reading the main story So what do you think?Is Will.i.am the next Steve Jobs?Does raising venture capital actually require anything more than a hodgepodge of vague ideas and a series of pivots?What even is capitalism anymore?Farhad: I really dont get it.We live in a world where anyone whos made it constantly gets showered with more and more money regardless of whether theyre doing anything useful.Mike, when do we get to cash in?Mike: Never.Anyway, see you next week!Farhad: Bye!Farhad Manjoo writes a weekly technology column called State of the Art.Mike Isaac covers Facebook, Uber and Twitter.You can follow them on Twitter here: @fmanjoo and @MikeIsaac
Where Self-Driving Cars Go to Learn:::::Last December, Uber clashed with California regulators when it tested its self-driving cars in San Francisco without permission from the California Department of Motor Vehicles.The company was quickly ordered to shut down its trials.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Ubers executives called Mr. Ducey.We responded by saying we werent going to hassle them, Mr. Ducey said of Uber.Id be remiss if I didnt thank my partner in growing the Arizona economy, Jerry Brown, the Democratic governor of California.Days later, Uber loaded a fleet of driverless sport utility vehicles onto semi trucks headed for Tempe.The company now has several dozen driverless cars in a garage there that is the size of two football fields, with plans to add more cars.Governor Duceys prioritization of the sharing economy has made the Grand Canyon State an ideal environment for our self-driving pilot, Uber said.Many Unknowns Under Mr. Ducey, driverless car experiments in Arizona have multiplied over the last year.Ubers self-driving Volvo SUVs now pick up customers around Tempe on a daily basis.Waymo has dispatched more than 100 Chrysler self-driving minivans to chauffeur select families and other residents as part of a closely guarded trial; the company plans to expand to 600 vehicles by the end of the year, with the majority in Chandler.And dozens of vehicles for GM, Ford, Intel, and Lyft are also covering thousands of miles a day on the flat and sun-drenched roads around Phoenix.Some residents are ambivalent.Groups representing the blind are enthusiastic supporters of driverless cars, which could give their members more independence.Others like the idea of tech-related jobs coming to the state.But some are cautious.Im on the fence, said Jake Guadarrama, 22, a Phoenix area resident.What if the battery died on the car and it goes out of control?And will it take way from the work force?Those questions are not just academic.Already, the incorporation of driverless cars into human-driven traffic has run into problems.Around dusk on March 24, for example, Alexandra Cole, a Tempe resident, inched her 2008 Honda CRV into a busy suburban intersection in the city.With five seconds left on the pedestrian crossing signal and no cars coming toward her in the two closest lanes, she began a left turn.Advertisement Continue reading the main story She did not see Ubers self-driving Volvo SUV darting through the yellow light in the furthest lane toward her.The cars collided.Ubers vehicle flipped onto its side and crashed into two more cars waiting in traffic.The crash Arizonas first with a driverless vehicle was soon resolved.There were no injuries and police said Ms. Cole, and not Ubers car, was to blame for failing to yield on a left turn.Photo But what happened after the accident revealed a system that was unprepared for computer-operated vehicles.Mr. Ducey, Tempe officials and state transportation regulators did not get briefed on the collision.The self-driving task force set up by the governor, which has met twice in two years, also did not review the incident.Uber sent its wrecked vehicle to its Pittsburgh-based autonomous vehicle center, which the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration officials visited to investigate.N.H.T.S.A.said it could not comment because its investigation is still in progress.Ms. Cole and her insurance company declined to comment.If the crash had turned into a criminal case, police would likely have asked for data from the self-driving cars.If the carmakers refused, they might have sought warrants for the data a practice that put the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Apple into a fierce battle last year related to unlocking an iPhone used by a suspect in a mass shooting.Waymo and Uber said their policies are to comply with local laws wherever they operate.Insurance would also have been a question, with debate over who takes responsibility in a driverless car crash the company or the third-party software or parts makers or the passenger with a license since there is no driver.The insurance companies need to figure out how they will insure this, said Stephen Briggs, a spokesman for Arizonas Department of Insurance.Arizona hasnt changed its minimum insurance liability rules for self-driving car trials.The government doesnt have the resources to do this.Angel Carbajal, Tempes assistant chief of police, acknowledged there are many unknowns.This is new, so there isnt a lot of legislation yet that explains how to respond to motor vehicle collisions involving autonomous vehicles, he said.For Mr. Ducey, none of this is a problem.He said the crash was handled properly and that even if driverless technology is not fully ready, the states bet on autonomous vehicles will continue.Advertisement Continue reading the main story These are cultural opportunities for Arizona to be seen as a place to live, work and play, he said.
Plugging Into the Gig Economy, From Home With a Headset:::::While critics of the arrangement cite rising insecurity, some of Liveops star agents like Emmett Jones in Chicago, who knows of his rivals primarily as numbers on a leader board say the opportunity has been transformative.The earnest gratitude of the agents assembled here, not far from the Raleigh-Durham Airport, affirmed that.To them, Liveops is a sustaining force, a way to earn a living while being present at home.A few had driven hours to attend.Many brought friends and family members who were considering joining Liveops Nation, too.There were icebreakers (Liveops Nation Bingo).Gift-card raffles ($150?the chief executive quipped.Who approved these things?).Free enchiladas.Everyone was invited to schmooze.Advertisement Continue reading the main story John, I heard your story about how you got to us is pretty great, said the master of ceremonies, an impossibly sunny woman named Tara.Would you mind telling all these people?When the mic came to John, a former insurance claims adjuster with a gray beard and several earrings, there was a sense of imminent revelation.I was working in another glass box over near here for six years, he began.I reached the point where it was either jump off the roof or walk out the front door.The other agents laughed knowingly.He continued: My commute now is I walk down the hall, close the bedroom door behind me.More laughter.Then Johns voice softened: This is good, this is good.I get paid for when Im working, instead of souring when you get paid for 40 hours and work some more.So, Im here.Awesome, Tara said, applause drowning her out.I feel like Johns story mimics a lot of what we hear from people.According to Greg Hanover, a longtime Liveops official who became chief executive this summer, the companys goal is to make agents feel as if theyre part of a movement, not just earning a wage.Where we want to be with this is what Mary Kay has done, multilevel marketing companies, Mr. Hanover said, referring to the cosmetics distributor and its independent sales force.The direction we need to head in for the community within Liveops Nation is that the agents are so happy, so satisfied with the purpose and meaning there, that theyre telling their story.Photo Its an ambition that feels almost radical compared with Uber, whose best-known exercise in worker outreach is a video of its former chief executive berating a driver.It was heartening to discover that on-demand work could be both financially viable and emotionally fulfilling.Advertisement Continue reading the main story That is, until I began to speak with Mr. Jones and some of his Liveops competitors.The more you talk with them, the more you detect a kind of Darwinian struggle behind the facade of community and self-actualization.You start to wonder: Is there really such a thing as a righteous gig-economy job, even if the company is as apparently well intentioned as Liveops?Or is there something about the nature of gig work thats inescapably dehumanizing?Just the Right Tone Mr. Jones, who lives in Chicago, was the top rated Liveops agent for an insurer called TruStage for much of this year.An AT&T technician for decades, he decided that he needed to be at home not long after his wife was diagnosed with vertigo in 2008.I cant work and be worried about how shes doing, he said.A few years later, when his daughter told him of a friend who worked with Liveops, he was eager to sign up but refused to send in his required voice test until it was close to perfect.I must have did the voice test four or five times, he said.I wanted to make sure I gave the right tone that they were looking for.As a Liveops agent, Mr. Jones sells life policies to callers, often those who have just seen a television commercial for TruStage insurance.He estimates that he works roughly 40 hours each week, beginning around 8 most mornings, and that he makes about $20 an hour.He is such a valued worker that TruStage invited him to its headquarters earlier this year for a two-day visit by an elite group of agents, in which executives pumped them for insights about how to increase sales.Roughly two decades ago, Liveops and its competitors typically connected callers to psychic hotlines, and in some cases less reputable services.Such businesses had frequent spikes in call volume, making it helpful to have an on-demand work force that could be abruptly ramped up.The only thing people were interested in was the abandonment rate that is, the number of people who would hang up in frustration from being kept on hold said Kim Houlne, the chief executive of a Liveops rival called Working Solutions, which she founded in 1996.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The call center industry took a hit during the 2001 recession, when cost consciousness unleashed a wave of outsourcing to India.But within 10 years, many companies decided that the practice, known as offshoring, had been oversold.The savings on wages were often wiped out by lost business from enraged customers, who preferred to communicate with native English speakers.People dont feel comfortable, Ms. Houlne said, alluding to the overseas agents.By the early part of this decade, quality was in fashion.The enormous amounts of data that companies like Liveops and Working Solutions collect allowed them to connect callers to the best possible agent with remarkable precision, while allowing big clients to avoid the overhead of a physical call center and full-time workers.Today, in addition to sales calls, Liveops agents handle calls from people trying to file insurance claims, those in need of roadside assistance, even those with medical or financial issues relating to prescription drugs.The agents must obtain a certification before they can handle such calls, which sometimes takes weeks of online coursework.Liveops goes to great lengths to attend to their needs, addressing technical-support issues, even answering agents emails to the chief executive within 24 hours.Mr. Jones, like many of his fellow agents, thinks of himself as helping others in need.He said that many families will gather around a table after a loved one has died to discuss the burial.If the deceased relative had no insurance, he said, A lot of times that table is going to clear.If, on the other hand, he had even $2,000 in life insurance the minimum that TruStage sells the family members are more inclined to say, He did what he could, let me see what I could do to help out.You end up with $5,000 to $6,000.You can do a decent burial rather than none at all.Still, there is undeniably a brass-tacks quality to the work.Shortly after we hung up, I turned my attention to an assignment due that afternoon, only to receive more calls from Mr. Joness number.When I finally answered, he apologized for interrupting me, then came to the point.I have a question for you, he said.Do you have life insurance?Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Where the Price Point Is Like Uber, Liveops expends considerable effort calculating demand for its agents.For example, if an auto insurance company is running a commercial on ESPN, Liveops will ask the companys media buyer that is, the intermediary that placed the ad to predict how many calls such an ad is likely to generate.Liveops will adjust that prediction, using its own data showing how many calls similar ads have produced from similar audiences during a comparable time of year.And like Uber, the Liveops focuses on utilization in the Liveops case, the percentage of working agents actually on a call.Depending on the client, Liveops strives for rates of 65 percent to 75 percent.Lower than that and the agents, who make money only when theyre on a call, will complain that theyre not busy enough.Significantly higher and the system is vulnerable to a sudden increase in demand that could tie up the phone lines and keep callers waiting.Liveops asks agents to schedule themselves in half-hour blocks, known as commits, for the upcoming week.If the company expects demand to be higher than the number of commits, it sends agents a message urging them to sign up.(Uber does something similar, except without formal scheduling.)Sometimes it will even offer financial incentives, like a bump in the rate earned for each minute theyre on a call, or a raffle-type scheme in which people accumulate tickets for the giveaway of an iPad or a cruise.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Again like Uber, Liveops relentlessly tests the effectiveness of these tools.Referring to financial incentives, Jon Brown, the Liveops senior director of client services, said, Weve zeroed in on exactly what we need for an agent to go from 10 to 15 commits, from 15 commits to 20 commits.We know where the price point is, what drives behavior.And then there are the performance metrics.Liveops agents are rated according to what are called key performance indicators, which, depending on the customer, can include the number of sales they make, their success at upselling customers, and whether a caller would recommend the service based on their interaction.Liveops makes clear that its agents ability to earn more money is closely tied to performance.Youve heard the term meritocracy?said a Liveops official named Aimee Matolka at the North Carolina event.When a call comes in, it routes in to that best agent.Yes, our router is that smart.You guys want to be that agent, I know you do.Otherwise you wouldnt be here.It allows the agents to track their rankings obsessively through internal leader boards.(Liveops officials say that while the pressures of the job can preoccupy agents, it is up to them how much time to invest.)I lost the No.1 spot, now Im No.2, Mr. Jones said in early August, acknowledging that he checks his ranking frequently.I thought about researching to find out who it is you always want to know whos the competition but I said leave it.He added: Im a competitive person.We just toggle back and forth.If they see me jump back in, they work harder.They want that spot back.This Is My Phone Call My flight to Bangor, Me., was due after 9 p.m., and apparently sensing my unease with the North Country, the firefighter seated next to me asked if I had to far to drive when we landed.About three hours north, I confessed.Watch out for moose, he said.I assured him Id driven around deer before.He stopped me short: If you hit a deer, youll kill them, he said.If you hit a moose, theyll kill you.I found Troy Carter, the agent who had recently surpassed Emmett Jones, at his home in Fort Fairfield the next day, wearing jeans, a button-down short-sleeve shirt, and a New England Patriots hat.There were no shoes on his feet, only white socks.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Like Mr. Jones, Mr. Carter said Liveops had been a blessing, allowing him to earn a living in a part of Maine so remote that my cellphone carrier welcomed me to Canada shortly after I pulled into his driveway.When I told Mr. Carter that I had been in touch with his top competitor, he quickly pulled up the latest monthly rankings of Liveops agents selling TruStage insurance.He pointed out that while Mr. Jones, whom he recognized only by his identification number, 141806, had more sales 87 to his 82 he had far fewer paid sales, charged at the time of purchase rather than by invoice.The real thing is the paid application rate they want it around 95 percent, Mr. Carter said.He has 87 sales, but only 65 percent paid, compared to my 94 percent.This, he explained, was why he enjoyed the right to call himself the top agent for the month.Mr. Carter is what you might call a serial entrepreneur.He once started an art supply website that folded within a few months, and a penny auction site called Bid Tree that foundered for lack of a marketing budget.He sees Liveops, on which he spends 40 to 50 hours per week, as of a piece with these entrepreneurial efforts.In fact, it is something of a family business.His wife, Lori, handles incoming calls while hes busy with customers.Im a housewife/secretary/receptionist, she said.Even Mr. Carters 9-year-old son, Logan, plays a role.At nighttime, he says the last part of his prayer based on how many sales I did today, Mr. Carter said.If it was a lot of sales, hell pray, Dear Lord, help my dad get the same amount of sales tomorrow.Though Liveops agents work from a script, Mr. Carter, like Mr. Jones, adds his own flourishes.Before asking a callers gender, as he is required to do, he will say, Now I already know the answer to this question, but please confirm if youre male or female.Upon receiving the answer, he will pause momentarily before saying, I told you I already knew the answer, and break into a laugh.He might make this identical joke, with identical timing, dozens of times in a workday.Its like a comedian has a little pause before a joke, he told me.It relaxes them right off.Even with these touches, results can vary widely.Two days earlier, Mr. Carter had made seven sales, only a few shy of his record.The day I turned up, he managed only one.He said some callers had the impression they could receive $25,000 of insurance for $9.95 per month the commercial mentions both figures and begged off when Mr. Carter told them that their premiums would be substantially higher.Photo Mr. Carter has done research on how to comport himself, including watching an instructional YouTube video by the former stockbroker who was the subject of the movie The Wolf of Wall Street.He believes the key is to come off as the alpha presence.The one that asks the most questions is the one in control, he said.If they ask me questions How are you doing?Ill come back, The question is how are you doing?This is my phone call, as much as I can make it.Advertisement Continue reading the main story But on this day he repeatedly ran up against the limits of his powers.Even those who remained interested after 10 or 15 minutes of painstaking back-and-forth often demurred when Mr. Carter asked them for payment information.This one guy was outside in a wheelchair, Mr. Carter said of a caller who couldnt produce his credit card.He didnt want to go in and get it.I said, Im fine waiting, but I cant push him.These setbacks only seem to make Mr. Carter focus more.At one point, he made a swiping motion between his face and his headset with his index finger and middle finger.They recommend that you keep the microphone two fingers away, he said.Im always doing that checking that its two fingers.Ill do that for the rest of my life.It seemed, all in all, like a grueling way to make the slightly more than $30,000 that Mr. Carter estimates he takes in before taxes.The good thing is he can take hours off, Lori told me.But then he can lose his spot.Its always a fight for the top.I was reminded of the Alec Baldwin monologue from the movie Glengarry Glen Ross, except that the prize for having the most sales wouldnt be a Cadillac, it would be a set of steak knives, because the Liveops analytics team had calculated that agents would give nearly as much effort for a prize worth a small fraction of the cost.Of course, unlike the salesmen in that movie, the Liveops agents cant really be fired the third prize because they werent employees to begin with.A while later, Mr. Carter described a recent initiative in which agents were promised a bonus if 95 percent of their collective sales were paid up front.I knew it wasnt going to work as soon as they said it, he told me, because a handful of agents with low paid rates could ruin everyone elses chances.They did do a pullover sweatshirt for the top two, he added, brightening.I was second, so thats coming.
Alibaba’s Singles Day Sales Hit New Record of $25.3 Billion:::::Singles Day the frenzied annual celebration of consumption and commerce that is Chinas much larger version of Black Friday began as a protest of sorts against Valentines Day, propelled by college students in the 1990s.The events date, written numerically as 11/11, was associated with unattached singles, known as bare sticks.This years shopping festival entered new territory, blazing past $1 billion within two minutes of the holiday, starting at midnight on Saturday.By the end of the day, sales had hit a new record of $25.3 billion, more than 40 percent higher than sales on Singles Day 2016.Photo Photo Singles Day is now inextricably linked with Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce leviathan that in recent years has turned the holiday into an online and occasionally brick-and-mortar mercantile extravaganza.It routinely eclipses Amazons yearly Prime Day promotional event.Advertisement Continue reading the main story In July, Prime Day generated an estimated $1 billion in revenue during its 30-hour sale window, resulting in what Amazon called its biggest day ever.Photo Photo The event has evolved into a cultural phenomenon.On Friday night, Alibaba hosted a lavish gala in Shanghai, directed by one of the producers behind the 2016 Academy Awards.Celebrities such as Nicole Kidman, Pharrell Williams and Maria Sharapova helped count down the moments before the 60,000 participating global brands released their Singles Day deals to shoppers.Photo Photo One offer, from the Chongqing-based online alcohol brand Jiang Xiao Bai, allowed 33 fast-moving customers to make a single payment of 11,111 yuan, or $1,673, for a lifetime supply of a grain liquor known as baijiu.Singles Day, which is largely powered through Alibabas Tmall marketplace, was a test of the companys logistics network.The company promised delivery within an hour for certain products and, in advance of the shopping festival, converted nearly 100,000 stores across China into smart stores capable of processing payment using facial recognition and other advanced technologies.
Managing Email on Multiple Devices:::::Q.How do I efficiently manage my email with three devices: computer, phone and tablet?Do I have to read, save, delete email three times, or can I easily sync them?A.Most mail programs give you the choice of two ways to set up an account on a computer or mobile device either with the IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol) standard or POP (Post Office Protocol).If you want to keep your mailbox in sync across multiple devices, choose the IMAP method.Photo Compared with POP, IMAP is a newer technology for managing messages and handles checking the same mail account on multiple devices much more smoothly.With IMAP, even though you can see your mailbox in the mail program on your computer and devices, IMAP messages actually live on the mail server.When you read, delete or flag a message, you are performing that action on the mail server.The mail apps on your other devices see the change when you view the updated mailbox.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story How Do You Use Tech?Advice and tips on the technology changing how you live.In contrast, most POP mail systems in their default settings download messages directly to the device that checks in at the time, and then deletes those messages from the mail server.When you check mail with your computer or other gadgets, those devices do not get the deleted messages, but they may download newer ones which then get deleted from the server, making your mailboxes out of sync.As a workaround, some mail providers allow you to keep messages on the server without deleting them automatically after they download, but then you have to repeatedly delete a message on each device.Additionally, the messages you send stay on the Sent mailbox of the computer or device that actually did the sending.Most modern mail providers and programs support IMAP You can find instructions for setting up IMAP mail accounts for Googles Gmail, Microsoft Outlook and Mozillas Thunderbird program on their sites.Apples iCloud mail does not support POP and uses IMAP by default.
‘It’s a Black Thing’: Offensive Quip Becomes a Rallying Cry in Brazil:::::Globo is viscerally opposed to racism in all of its forms, the company said in a statement, adding that Mr. Waack had made comments that everything indicates were of a racist nature.The video was leaked by a former video editor for Globo, who said he was appalled by the remarks at the time but was afraid he could lose his job if he released the video to the public.The video editor, Diego Rocha Pereira, who no longer works for the network, said he had heard the comments as he sat in the networks control room.I rewound the video to be sure, I couldnt believe he would have said that, he told the Jovem Pan radio station.I was so disgusted, I recorded it on my cellphone.Mr. Waack has not publicly responded.In its statement, Globo said, Waack affirms he doesnt remember what he said, given that the audio is not clear, but he offers sincere apologies to those who feel they have been offended.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.On social media, the remark has been turned into a campaign, shining a light on the accomplishments of famous black Brazilians like the 19th-century novelist and poet Machado de Assis, as well as global leaders, including Nelson Mandela, and sports stars and artists.Many people have written on Twitter about their own struggles in a country with a long history of slavery and racism.One person wrote: #ItsABlackThing my mother, a black, single woman, raising 7 children without the help of a white man (my father).Brazil was the last country in the Americas to abolish slavery, in 1888.Over three centuries, some four million Africans were brought here and forced to work in fields, mines and private homes.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Today, just over 50 percent of Brazilians identify as black or biracial, and many Brazilians say there is a racial harmony here that does not exist in the United States.But others say the figures point to a different reality Brazil is a country where the life expectancy of black men is considerably lower than for their white counterparts, and where people of African descent earn 36 percent less than nonblack Brazilians.In recent years, Globo and other television networks have used their powerful positions to combat racism with more prominent roles for black Brazilians on soap operas and reality TV shows.When Brazils first black weather broadcaster on a prime-time news broadcast Maria Jlia Coutinho, known widely by her nickname, Maju was subjected to verbal abuse, her colleagues at Globo promoted the #WeAreAllMaju campaign.In the case of Mr. Waack, a veteran journalist who gained the respect of his colleagues over the years with his coverage of the fall of the Berlin Wall and numerous conflicts in the Middle East, Globo said it was in talks with him about what would happen next.
Musical.ly, a Chinese App Big in the U.S., Sells for $1 Billion:::::Photo SHANGHAI The only Chinese social media company to build a major network outside China will be taken over by a fast-growing Chinese upstart.Musical.ly, a video-based social network popular with teenagers in the United States and Europe, is being sold for between $800 million and $1 billion to Bytedance, the company that controls the Chinese news aggregator Toutiao, according to a person familiar with the matter.The deal knits together Toutiaos 120 million Chinese users with the roughly 60 million who use Musical.ly in the United States and Europe, ultimately linking a platform in China with a more global one.Musical.ly will continue to operate a separate product, according to a statement on the deal, though the two companies will cooperate closely.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Despite the dominance of established social media services like Facebook and Snap, Musical.ly rose to prominence among a teenage and tween audience by enabling users to record quick videos set to music.Young users of the app performed coordinated dance moves or lip-synced to the music.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Since then the company has branched out to other types of videos, including live streaming, and has even sought to attract short-form video shows.
AT&T Deal Puts Trump’s Antitrust Cop at Center of a Political Storm:::::Randall L. Stephenson, AT&Ts chief executive, said on Wednesday that he had never offered to sell CNN.On Thursday, appearing at The New York Timess DealBook conference, he said the company was ready to go to court against the Justice Department.To suggest that selling some of the key franchises of the business that are the most desired for your business plan makes no business sense, Mr. Stephenson said.The public spat has put a political cloud over the deal.President Trump has been critical of CNN and the deal.Several Democratic lawmakers have called for hearings to determine whether politics played a role in what is supposed to be an independent process.Photo The Justice Department declined to comment on Thursday.Pushing AT&T to unload a big part of its business to get the deal approved goes against Mr. Delrahims history, antitrust experts say.His past comments have largely been in line with more free-market-oriented Republican views, and he was widely expected to be more lenient on mergers than predecessors in the Obama administration.This is bold, said Diana Moss, president of the American Antitrust Institute, a nonprofit that generally favors stronger antitrust enforcement.It signals they are willing to consider the anticompetitive effects of big deals, and on the remedy side they would use structural remedies, which would signal a potential change in policy.Advertisement Continue reading the main story In an interview late last month, Mr. Delrahim strongly rejected the idea that the White House had tried to or could influence his thinking.At the time, he would not discuss AT&Ts bid for Time Warner or any other pending mergers.All enforcement decisions will be based on the facts and the law.Not on politics, Mr. Delrahim said.That would be antithetical to everything Ive stood for.Mr. Delrahim, 48, was born in Tehran, but his family moved to Los Angeles when he was almost 10, around the time of the Islamic Revolution.He attended the University of California, Los Angeles, as an undergraduate and then went to law school at George Washington University.After a few years in corporate law, he spent time as an aide on Capitol Hill, working on some technology and antitrust issues.President George W. Bush later nominated him to be a top official at the Justice Department, where he focused on international antitrust enforcement.After his time there, he returned to corporate law in Los Angeles, representing numerous large technology, health and telecommunications companies.In his recent interview, he said that the Justice Department did not need to intervene just because a company was big, even a monopoly.He also said the government should not startle business markets with an abrupt change in its approach to antitrust legal theory.There are people who think big is just bad, he said.They dont understand why, but there is an instinctive reaction to big business these days.He added that it was dangerous to go after companies without clear evidence that they were harming competitors.Mr. Delrahim has said his comments last year about AT&T and Time Warner were taken out of context.He has told lawmakers that the deal deserved a thorough review.He said there could be antitrust concerns when a company like AT&T, which controls distribution of television content through DirecTV and internet content through its mobile and home broadband service, bought a big media company.That view is more aligned with left-leaning consumer groups that have pushed for greater antitrust enforcement.After the news this week that the Justice Department was taking a deeper look at the deal, some Democrats, including Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, praised the tough stance.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.AT&T and Time Warner is an enormous test because we are just seeing online video disrupting the dominant cable broadband providers, said Gene Kimmelman, president of the nonprofit organization Public Knowledge and an antitrust official during the Obama administration.And it would be a disaster for consumers and the competitive landscape if those developments are wiped out or diminished by the approval of this deal.Advertisement Continue reading the main story For years, though, antitrust officials have generally approved mergers of companies that do not have competing businesses.These are known as vertical mergers, and because AT&T is a telecommunications company, while Time Warner creates media content like movies, their deal would fit that category.Problems with those mergers have generally been resolved with settlements known as consent decrees, which restrict the new companys behavior or operations.Mr. Delrahim is skeptical of such consent decrees, especially demands for behavioral remedies.The Obama administration approved Comcasts purchase of NBC Universal in 2011 with a stack of behavioral requirements, including a requirement that Comcast make NBC content available to competing cable and streaming services.During his interview last month, Mr. Delrahim said industries moved too fast for those remedies to be effective.We have major parts of our industry that are regulated by consent decrees with the Justice Department, he said, referring to settlements with behavioral remedies.I dont think Im smart enough to figure out where the market and consumer behavior will be 10 years from now, 20 years from now, 40 years from now, 100 years from now, he continued.The agency, he added, is still overseeing consent decrees that are a century old.Instead, Mr. Delrahim said, he prefers so-called structural remedies, like forcing a company to sell assets before approving a merger.He said the ultimate test for healthy competition was the consumer welfare test, which looks at whether consumers are benefiting from lower prices and options.Mr. Kimmelman said the Justice Department could be concerned about how the combined broadband, satellite and media company could hurt competitors.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The satellite service DirecTV, for example, can reach all American homes.The potential concern, Mr. Kimmelman said, is that the company may have an incentive to withhold valuable Time Warner content like HBO, TNT or CNN from rival cable and satellite providers or streaming services.The company could also make it harder for rival media companies like Starz to reach AT&T customers.The Justice Department has proposed various options to meet Mr. Delrahims demands, according to multiple people close to the discussions.In the interview last month, Mr. Delrahim defended the presidents criticism of AT&Ts bid.He said Mr. Trump was unfairly targeted for remarks about deals when other government officials were allowed to air their opinions.Whats interesting is that you see the president getting criticized for commenting on certain mergers and you have senators who will write with comments on the same exact merger, Mr. Delrahim said.I find that fascinating but maybe not new in Washington.And while he insisted that his decisions would be made independently, it was clear that Mr. Trump was not totally out of mind.When he arrived at the Justice Department in late September, Mr. Delrahim received a hat as a welcome gift.It reads: Makan Antitrust Great Again.
Legislator Targets Tech Perks in Baltimore County District:::::Photo Baltimore County Public Schools has pursued one of the most ambitious classroom technology makeovers in the United States.Now, some of its relationships with technology vendors are coming under intensified scrutiny.A Maryland state legislator said Thursday that the state needed to investigate whether industry perks played a role in the awarding of the districts technology contracts.The lawmaker, Senator James Brochin, called on the Maryland State Board of Education to conduct an audit of the contracts.In 2014, the district committed $205 million for laptops for students and staff, and millions more since for math and language software.The audit would cover the device contract, which was awarded to a vendor whose laptop came in third place in the districts hardware evaluations.Last week, an article in The New York Times examined Baltimore County, the nations 25th-largest public school district, as a case study in how tech companies court and cultivate school leaders.The Baltimore Sun has recently written about the former district superintendents travels to out-of-state events.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The Times found that tech vendors or industry-funded groups paid for meals and rooms at fancy hotels for school leaders, as well as travel to conferences to promote the districts tech initiative.And in February, the districts former superintendent participated in confidential meetings with school tech vendors companies whose contracts were later increased.Evidence offered in the recent articles indicates digital education companies having unrestricted access to key decision makers in Baltimore County Public Schools and, in turn, the awarding of contracts to those companies, Senator Brochin, a Baltimore County Democrat, said in a letter sent to state officials.This has created the illusion of impropriety, thereby eroding public trust.
Reddit Bans ‘Incel’ Group for Inciting Violence Against Women:::::An online petition called on Reddit to ban the incel community subreddit, noting that Elliott O. Rodger, a California man who killed six people in a 2014 rampage in Isla Vista near the University of California, Santa Barbara, before firing a bullet into his head, was referred to in the group as Saint Elliott.Mr. Rodger had left behind a rambling history of videos and social media posts on sites popular with sexually frustrated men.In one site, called PUAHate, for pick up artiste hate, Mr. Rodger expressed his disgust at women, questioning how they could resist his charms.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.One day incels will realize their true strength and numbers, and will overthrow this oppressive feminist system, he wrote.Start envisioning a world where WOMEN FEAR YOU.Reddits move against the group fell into the same pattern that other companies, including Facebook and Twitter, and domain registrar services, such as the ones that banned the white supremacy site The Daily Stormer in August, have taken to address violent content.I view this as part of that broader movement, Danielle K. Citron, a University of Maryland law professor who has studied the phenomenon of online hate, said on Thursday.That there are communities like Daily Stormer that we find troubling and call for violence, and we dont want to aid and abet groups that call for violence.It is not clear when the term incels was coined, but the link between misogyny and violence against women has emerged on sites where incel communities gather.Mary Anne Franks, a professor of law at the University of Miami, who has studied online abuse and harassment, said that when she read Mr. Rodgers manifesto she was reminded of George Sodini, a Pennsylvania man who shot dead three women in Pennsylvania in 2009, leaving behind an online diary that detailed his loneliness and lack of success with women.Advertisement Continue reading the main story These men got angry at the women that they see as depriving them of something they are entitled to, Professor Franks said.It was a trend in online forums, that they legitimately had a reasons to lash out, speaking of Mr. Rodger and Mr. Sodini.Last month, after Reddit initiated the broader policy to clarify its rules on what content was banned, the first to go were subreddits for Nazi, racist and white supremacist groups.The move to ban incels appears to be part of a wider sweep of subreddits that it has flushed out over the years, such as ones that encouraged people to covertly photograph women on the street, or one that promoted rape, which was banned for inciting harm.Whether it is on this particular ecoystem or alternatively within the alt-right itself, it is part of the online world that has been growing very rapidly, Heidi Beirich, the director of the intelligence project for the Southern Poverty Law Center, said.Misogyny is shockingly frequent to find on the web in these areas.
Twitter, Facing Another Uproar, Pauses Its Verification Process:::::Photo SAN FRANCISCO On Tuesday afternoon, Twitter added a small blue check mark to the account of Jason Kessler, a move known as verification that indicates a prominent persons real account.The action was quickly met with outrage.Thats because Mr. Kessler is a well-known white supremacist who has used Twitter to spread his message and organize rallies like Unite the Rights march in Charlottesville, Va., where torch-wielding protesters marched through the streets chanting racist rallying cries.Across the Twitterverse, people including the comedian Michael Ian Black came down on the company.By Thursday morning, Twitter announced it would be halting its entire general verification program.It was yet another situation that the company has had to make amends on, just a week after the accidental deletion of President Trumps Twitter account and testimony in Washington on how Russian agents used its service last year to sow discord.The system is broken and needs to be reconsidered, Twitters chief executive, Jack Dorsey, tweeted on Thursday.And we failed by not doing anything about it.Working now to fix faster.When Twitter puts a verified check mark next to a white nationalists name, is the company endorsing that person?That was what Twitter was trying to figure out on Thursday.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Interested in All Things Tech?The Bits newsletter will keep you updated on the latest from Silicon Valley and the technology industry.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Verification was meant to authenticate identity and voice but it is interpreted as an endorsement or importance, the company said on Twitter.We have created this confusion.
Will Qualcomm Agree to a Deal With Broadcom? Ask Apple:::::Photo Apple may anoint the winner of Broadcoms $105 billion bid for Qualcomm.A dispute over iPhone royalties left Qualcomm vulnerable to an opportunistic offer from its acquisitive rival.If Apple settles its dispute, it could preserve Qualcomms independence but it all depends on whether Apple thinks a bigger Broadcom would be slavishly devoted to its devices, or just surlier.Qualcomm and Apple came to blows over royalties that the chip maker collects on mobile gadgets, most of which use its technologies.The actual payments arent disclosed, but analysts generally peg them at about $10 per phone.When Apple sued Qualcomm and told its suppliers to stop paying these fees this year, it helped push Qualcomms share price down by $10 per share, in subsequent months, to the $54.84 at which it traded last Thursday, the day before Broadcoms interest was reported.Settling the lawsuit might make Broadcoms bid of $70 per share less compelling.Analysts project Apple should sell around 250 million phones next year.If it agreed to a lower royalty payment of, say, $7.50 per phone, with a post-tax margin of 85 percent, that would yield almost $1.6 billion in profit.Put this on a multiple of 10, and thats worth about $16 billion or roughly $11 per share.And thats before any catch-up payments for previously withheld sums that Qualcomm might be able to claw back.Should Apple play along?It depends on which chip maker it considers the more malleable counterpart.Broadcoms chief executive, Hock Tan, is said to be open to renegotiating the Qualcomm contract should his company prevail.The promise of $3 billion in annual cost savings from the merger more than defrays the opportunity cost of giving Apple a good deal.Winning the good graces of Tim Cook, the Apple chief executive, might also result in additional chip sales to the tech giant.Whatever Mr. Tan says, though, his priority is likely to be maximizing the returns on his new acquisition.A big motivation for acquiring rivals is usually gaining heft over customers, and Broadcom already derives over 10 percent of its revenue from Apple.Furthermore, the lengthy antitrust process for a Broadcom-Qualcomm merger means it might be a year before Mr. Tan could negotiate properly anyway.The iPhone maker may prefer its serfs smaller and more squeezable.
News Shared on Twitter Can Drive the Conversation, Study Finds:::::Dr. King and his colleagues, Benjamin Schneer, of Florida State University, and Ariel White, of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, spent almost five years on the study, with the first three years dedicated to observing, learning from and building trust with journalists.Key to getting them on board, he said, was limiting his teams involvement to a part of the process that is often arbitrary: the timing of publication.In some sense, youre flipping the coin already, he said, noting that for many non-breaking stories, publication timing is subject to the whims of editors or the news cycle.At all times, the publications retained the right to bow out of the experiment, shelve the stories or publish them when they wanted.The study is not without its critics.Creative as it may be, the paper overstates its conclusion, said Kathleen Hall Jamieson, who studies political communication and is the director of the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania.Is this methodologically ingenious?Yes.Do we know whether or not the findings are substantively important?Not based on the disclosed information, she said.Twitter is just one social media platform and social media itself is only one venue in which the national conversation takes place.Tweets also hardly amount to discussion, Ms. Jamieson said.Many people simply share links on Twitter, offering, at best, a few lines of commentary.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.Without seeing the content of the articles or the tweets, its difficult to judge the studys findings, she said.(While the authors provided the names of the outlets that participated in the experiment, they withheld the articles involved to protect the reputations of the publications.)Advertisement Continue reading the main story To those who participated, though, the experiment offered a chance to better understand their influence, a crucial issue for media organizations.When we had the opportunity to actually measure impact in a new way, we were really, really excited.This is core to our mission, said Jo Ellen Green Kaiser, executive director of the Media Consortium, a network of independent news outlets whose members accounted for the majority of those involved in the study.While most of the outlets the researchers worked with were small, independent publications, such as Truthout or In These Times, the study included some more well-known outlets, too, including The Nation, The Progressive, Ms. Magazine and Yes!Magazine, according to the authors.In all, 33 outlets participated in the final experiment, though more than a dozen more participated in earlier trial runs, which were designed differently.The authors did not say which publications participated in which part of the study.The researchers were principally involved at only two points in the publication process: the beginning and the end.Each experiment began with them choosing from one of 11 broad policy areas, such as food, immigration, reproductive rights or jobs, which had been identified as already being of interest to the news organizations.The researchers then asked a handful of outlets to volunteer to collaborate, in groups of two to five, on stories of their own choosing related to the topic.For example, the authors said, with technology as a topic, the group might decide to write pieces about how Uber drivers feel about driverless cars.The researchers then chose a two-week window in which to study discussion online, asking the outlets to publish the stories during either week, chosen at random.They would then compare the discussion on Twitter related to that topic in the week in which the pieces ran to the week in which they did not.The stories, typically published on Tuesday, could come in any form, be they straight news, investigations, interviews, opinion pieces, videos or podcasts.The outlets treated them no differently and the researchers said that, as far as they were aware, their involvement went unnoticed by readers.Awareness of the study varied at each outlet, but editors and reporters were often informed.Advertisement Continue reading the main story We really had to get whole editorial teams on board, and then often the reporters knew, too, Ms. Kaiser said.In the end, the authors conducted 35 experiments for the study over a year and a half beginning in October 2014.The authors tried to anticipate some criticisms, too.Many tweets are created by bots, they acknowledged, but they found that bot traffic was consistent each week, making it essentially background noise.The researchers also avoided weeks when known world events, say a planned presidential speech on immigration, might have influenced the results.
Uber 2.0: New C.E.O. Wants to Put His Stamp on the Company:::::Video Dara Khosrowshahi wants to make something clear: The new Uber will not look like the company he inherited.Speaking publicly for the first time since he became Ubers chief executive in August, Mr. Khosrowshahi painted a rosier vision of the future of his company.His aim: To escape from the shadow cast over the ride-hailing giant after a series of scandals shook the company to its core and resulted in the eventual ousting of former chief executive and co-founder, Travis Kalanick.The culture went wrong, the governance went wrong, the board went in a very bad direction, Mr. Khosrowshahi said in conversation with Andrew Ross Sorkin at the DealBook conference on Thursday.I think winning gives some excuses for bad behavior.Indeed, when Mr. Khosrowshahi stepped into the role in August, he had to deal with a series of scandals.Employee attrition was at a high, the companys board of directors was rife with infighting, the company faced no fewer than five federal inquiries into its business practices.And, moreover, the brand and what Uber stood for was taking a beating.The #DeleteUber hashtag surged across social media earlier this year, resulting in more than 500,000 deleted accounts.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Now, Mr. Khosrowshahi is trying to put his own imprimatur on the company in what he calls Uber 2.0.

YouTube’s Rapid Response Partisans Game the News of Tragedy:::::In a phone interview from his home in Houston, Mr. Williams told me that he had created more than 10,000 YouTube videos over an eight-year period, posting as many as 20 monologues per day, and racking up an estimated 200 million views.His hit productions have included fact-challenged videos like Barack and Michelle Obama Both Come Out The Closet, which garnered 1.6 million views, and Hillary Clinton Is On Crack Cocaine, which had 665,000.He was admitted to YouTubes partner program, which allows popular posters to earn money by displaying ads on certain types of videos, and claims to have made as much as $10,000 a month from his channel.I like to call myself a reporter who reports the news for the common person, Mr. Williams said.Whether motivated by profit or micro-celebrity, the success of sensationalists like Mr. Williams has become a vexing problem for companies like Facebook, Twitter, and Google, which owns YouTube.These companies sort and prioritize information for their users, and most have built ranking systems that boost news from mainstream outlets over stories from less credible sources.But those algorithms can be gamed in breaking news situations by users who work fast, uploading their videos in the valuable minutes between when news breaks and when the first wave of legitimate articles and videos appears.Before reliable sources put up stories, its a bit of a free-for-all, said Karen North, a professor studying social media at the University of Southern California.People who are in the business of posting sensationalized opinions about the news have learned that the sooner they put up their materials, the more likely their content will be found by an audience.Photo The phenomenon is not limited to YouTube.After last months mass shooting in Las Vegas, a Facebook safety check page featured a story from a site called Alt-Right News that made false statements about the gunman, and Googles search results displayed a conspiracy theory from 4Chan, the notoriously toxic message board.After last months terrorist attack in New York City, a trending topic page on Twitter briefly featured a story from Infowars, a conservative site that is popular among the conspiracy-minded.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Conservatives have argued that YouTube unfairly targets their videos while allowing liberal channels, such as The Young Turks, to post heated political commentary.And some dispute that there is any conscious gaming going on.There is absolutely no strategy, said Paul Joseph Watson, an editor-at-large at Infowars and a popular YouTube personality who has 1.1 million subscribers.On the day of the Texas church shooting, one of Mr. Watsons tweets appeared as a result in Google searches for the shooters name, although it has since disappeared.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Tech companies, already under fire for the ease with which they allowed Russia to interfere in last years election, have also vowed to take a harder stance on domestic misinformation.Twitters acting general counsel, Sean Edgett, told congressional investigators last week that the company would take steps to keep false stories from being featured on trending topic pages.Its a bad user experience, and we dont want to be known as a platform for that, Mr. Edgett said.YouTube, whose community guidelines prohibit hateful and threatening content, has begun using artificial intelligence to help identify offensive videos.But conspiracy theories dont announce themselves, and machines cant yet handle the complicated business of fact-checking.In Mr. Williamss case, human intervention seems to have been necessary.On Tuesday, shortly after I asked YouTube some questions about Mr. Williamss account, all of his videos disappeared, and his profile was replaced by a message saying, This account has been terminated due to multiple or severe violations of YouTubes policy prohibiting hate speech.Mr. Williams, who said he had recently left his job as an operations manager at a hazardous materials plant to focus on full-time punditry, has tangled with YouTubes hate speech policies before.The company shut down one of his previous accounts for similar infractions, which he claimed cost him 250,000 subscribers and a lucrative income stream.If YouTube didnt punish me, Mr. Williams said, I could easily be making over $30,000 a month.In a statement, YouTube said that Mr. Williamss account was banned as soon as it was flagged to us, because its terms of service prohibit repeat rule-breakers from opening new accounts.It also said that its terms prohibit advertising from appearing on videos featuring controversial and sensitive events, tragedies, political conflicts, and other sensitive topics.Even before this weeks crackdown, Mr. Williams was branching out.He sells cellphone ringtones on his website, and was considering starting his own paid streaming service.Tuesday night, just hours after he was banned by YouTube, Mr. Williams posted a video on Vimeo, another video-hosting platform.He pledged to keep insulting his favorite targets Democrats, Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama and not shy away from controversy, no matter what the policies said.Advertisement

Bitcoin Expansion Is Off the Table. At Least for Now.:::::In an email, the leaders of several of the largest Bitcoin companies said that unfortunately, it is clear that we have not built sufficient consensus for a clean block size upgrade at this time.The New York Times Explains...The price of Bitcoin shot up immediately after the email went out, hitting a new high, above $7,800, before retreating.The price has been steadily climbing and is up nearly 1,000 percent over the last year.The rising price has attracted many new users, from places like Japan and South Korea and from big hedge funds, even as the authorities in places like China have cracked down on the currency.All of the new people seeking access to Bitcoin have run up against a limit on the number of transactions that can flow through the system every 10 minutes, which was put in place during Bitcoins early years.Because of the limit, the network can process only around five transactions a second.That has led to delays on the network and has pushed up the price of getting a Bitcoin transaction through.Companies that help process Bitcoin payments have been pushing to lift the limit on Bitcoin transactions for several years, arguing that it will be necessary if Bitcoin wants to compete with Visa or PayPal.The opposing camp has argued that quickly expanding the number of transactions flowing through the network would mean only large companies could track Bitcoin transactions, taking power away from individual users.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.The proponents of keeping the so-called blocks of Bitcoin transactions small said Bitcoin should be viewed more as digital gold: a secure place to keep money, even if it cant be moved around as quickly and cheaply.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Many of the programmers working on the basic Bitcoin software the so-called core developers said they would stop working on Bitcoin if the block size was increased.They also complained that the companies pushing through the block size increase were doing so without properly consulting the community.Leaders on both sides of the Bitcoin debate have complained about receiving death threats and hacking attacks, and some top developers have migrated toward other virtual currencies.In August, some of the most outspoken proponents of expanding Bitcoin created their own version, known as Bitcoin Cash, which can handle more transactions than traditional Bitcoin.The price of Bitcoin Cash has gone up since August, but it remains only a small fraction of the size of Bitcoin.On Wednesday, the companies that had been pushing for big blocks said they were calling off their plans in order to restore some measure of peace to the community.Although we strongly believe in the need for a larger block size, there is something we believe is even more important: keeping the community together, the email said.The announcement said that the companies still believed that an increase in the size of Bitcoin blocks would be necessary, but that they were willing to wait until the community agreed on a way to deal with the issue.The people opposed to quickly expanding the network say they still wanted to make it easier and cheaper to use Bitcoin.But they hope this will be made possible by new networks built on top of Bitcoin, keeping the Bitcoin network itself more secure and decentralized.
Confirm or Deny: Jaron Lanier:::::Photo Maureen Dowd: You often get confused for the lead singer of Korn.Jaron Lanier: No, never.Im often confused with Arnold Schwarzenegger.Im kidding.Like others in Silicon Valley, you had cards printed up with the job title Visionary.No, I certainly never did.You once got a job application from Monica Lewinsky.This was the 90s and the internet was really not happening for most people yet, so I needed a new executive assistant.So we put an ad in The Times with a fax number and one of the faxes was from lawyers representing Monica Lewinsky.I was like, Is this for real?And they told me that it was real.Angela Merkel turns you on.You know, I think shes impressive.Shes actually a kind of interesting figure to me because shes suffering now for trying to bring in immigrants, but at the same time her initial impulse was not to, and she suffered worse.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Al Gore invented the internet.Confirm.The packet-switched networks had been around for a long time.But the internets a political invention.And yeah, he should be remembered much more prominently than he is as a creator of it.
Soothsayer in the Hills Sees Silicon Valley’s Sinister Side:::::A New York Times story on virtual reality pornography raised the specter of revenge porn and stalking porn, talking about clients commissioning sex dolls that look exactly like people they know in real life, maybe an ex-girlfriend they never got over or someone about whom they fantasize.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The story also noted that, given how lifelike the technology is, certainly partners will also have to negotiate whether virtual reality sex constitutes cheating.Mr. Lanier, who discourses eloquently on subjects like limerence and lust in his book, says: The future Id prefer to see is one where people use VR together to make really crazy imaginative experiences that might be sexual or might not.Where you turn into fantastical creatures and that sort of thing.Or when your bodies merge in some ways.That to me is so much more interesting than the porn.Porn is a product of the cinema era.Its an old-fashioned way of thinking, locked in the 19th century.More and more, we are wondering why, when we know the top Silicon Valley companies are not benevolent, we invite them into the most intimate areas of our lives, as Scott Galloway asks in The Four, a book about how Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google are refashioning the world.Are these entities the Four Horsemen of god, love, sex, and consumption?Mr. Galloway wonders.Or are they the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse?Even though hes prone to whimsical, esoteric tangents, I know I can get a straight answer on that from Mr. Lanier.We sit down at his dining room table amid a wild cornucopia of stuff, including a lamp with a hot pink feathered shade and black cats lounging on chairs and hanging, Cirque du Soleil-style, from carpeted staircases.There are also musical instruments a golden Wurlitzer pedal harp; a rare pre-Depression Mason & Hamlin piano that Mr. Lanier says has a uniquely American sound, a 19th-century Chinese opium bed filled with saxophones, flutes, clarinets, lutes and ouds; mandolins covering the walls, and over a thousand more instruments, from a medieval cornetto to a shakuhachi, a Japanese flute all of which Mr. Lanier can play.Like his house, his new book is crammed full of strange and mesmerizing stuff.Right after he was born, his mother, a Marlene Dietrich look-alike and Viennese pianist and stock trader who had talked her way out of a concentration camp by passing as Aryan, and his father, whose family had been mostly wiped out in Ukrainian pogroms, took Jaron someplace they thought would be safe: the westernmost corner of Texas.There, he had to confront more than his share of bullies growing up, once by swinging a baritone horn at them.His mother died when he was about 9, when her car flipped over on the freeway as she was coming back from getting her drivers license.His father, who worked for a time as the science editor of Amazing, Fantastic and Astounding pulp science-fiction magazines, then let his 11-year-old son design their new house in New Mexico: a geodesic dome.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The design, Mr. Lanier writes, looked a little like a womans body.You could see the big dome as a pregnant belly and the two icosahedrons as breasts.He tosses out that his father may have been the one to start the rumor about alligators in the sewers of New York.The wild stories about Mr. Laniers coming-of-age come in a rush, from playing piano at the Ear Inn in SoHo and avant-garde parties with John Cage and Laurie Anderson, and working for the Ear magazine, where editors would have to go up to the Dakota regularly and beg for cash from John and Yoko; to breaking out Timothy Leary from the Esalen Institute in Big Sur, Calif., to a failed first marriage to a beautiful woman who had a roommate who kept tarantula venom in their refrigerator.(Carved by trauma and tradition, her demons dragged my demons to the courthouse, he writes of their divorce.)After a takeout chicken and macaroni dinner, Mr. Lanier bids a loving good night to his wife, Lena, a child psychologist, and their 11-year old daughter, Lilibell.Then he brings out his Microsoft HoloLens headsets and a big mug of chocolate milk.Im more like the child than the parent, Im afraid, he says.I spend some time wearing the headset painting graffiti in the air with my hand, and Mr. Lanier explains why the brain can see more than the eyes.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Of the Moment The lifestyle newsletter from the Styles, Travel and Food sections, offering the latest trends to news you can use.I ask about social-media sites getting hijacked by Russians pushing propaganda aimed at putting Donald Trump in the White House.Vanity Fair has compared this juncture, with anxious lawmakers demanding accountability from the resistant tech companies, to the moment when we all had to start taking off our shoes at airports.Expect some smelly feet, Mr. Lanier says.Unlike many here, he does not think of humans as ants in his experiments.Hopefully, in this period, when were dealing with this really crude and early stuff like Facebook feeds, Instagram, Snapchat, he says, well be able to get the politics straight and find a path for people to have dignity and autonomy before the hard-core stuff comes.Unless we all kill ourselves through this other stuff, which is a possibility, too.One of the great joys of the Trump era is having your 11-year-old say, The former head of NATO said theres a one in 10 chance of nuclear war.Is that right?And Im like, Oh, great.Thank you, Trump.Thats very nice.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Lanier believes that Facebook and Google, with their top-down control schemes, should be called Behavior Modification Empires.The whole internet thing was supposed to create the worlds best information resource in all of history, he says.Everything would be made visible.And instead were living in this time of total opacity where you dont know why you see the news you see.You dont know if its the same news that someone else sees.You dont know who made it be that way.You dont know whos paid to change what you see.Everything is totally obscure in a profound way that it never was before.And the belief system of Silicon Valley is so thick that my friends at Facebook simply still really believe that the answer to any problem is to do more of what they already did, that theyre optimizing the world.The Facebook business model is mass behavior modification for pay.And for those who are not giving Facebook money, the only and I want to emphasize, the only, underlined and in bold and italics reward they can get or positive feedback is just getting attention.And if you have a system where the only possible prize is getting more attention, then you call that system Christmas for Asses, right?Its a creep-amplification device.Once Facebook becomes ubiquitous, its a sort of giant protection racket, where, if you dont pay them money, then someone else will pay to modify the behavior to your disadvantage, so everyone has to pay money just to stay at equilibrium where they would have been otherwise, he says.I mean, theres only one way out for Facebook, which is to change its business model.Unless Facebook changes, well just have to trust Facebook for any future election result.Because they do apparently have the ability to change them.Or at least change the close ones.Why would Facebook change its business model when its raking in billions?I would appeal to the decency of the people in it, he replies.And if not to them, then the toughness of the regulators.Its going to be one of the struggles of the century.I point out that after the stunning Trump win, President Obama took Mr. Zuckerberg aside and warned him to take the threat of political disinformation seriously, but the young billionaire dismissed the idea that it was widespread.Well, no one in Silicon Valley believes that anybody knows more than us, Mr. Lanier says dryly.Surely not the government.Advertisement Continue reading the main story He continues: I think there are a lot of good people at Facebook, and I dont think theyre evil as individuals.Or at least not the ones that Ive met.And I know Google a lot better, and I feel pretty certain that theyre not evil.But both of these companies have this behavior-manipulation business plan, which is just not something the world can sustain at that scale.It just makes everything crazy.I remark that Facebooks Sheryl Sandberg expressed surprise that their fiendish little invention could do something so nefarious.Photo People in the community knew, Mr. Lanier says, adding that he wrote essays and participated in debates in the early 1990s about how easy it would be the create unreality and manipulate society, how you could put out a feed of information that would put people in illusory worlds where they thought they had sought out the information but actually they had been guided the way a magician forces a card.So for somebody to say they didnt know the algorithms could do that, Mr. Lanier says in a disbelieving tone.If somebody didnt know, they shouldve known.So what happens when fake news marries virtual reality?It could be much more significant, Mr. Lanier says.When you look at all the ways of manipulating people that you can do with just a crude thing like a Facebook feed when people are just looking at images and text on their phones and theyre not really inside synthetic worlds yet when you can do it with virtual reality, its like total control of the person.So what Im hoping is that were going to figure this stuff out so we dont make ourselves insane before virtual reality becomes mature.He says that Silicon Valley has turned out both better and worse than he expected: As far as the worse part, creating a global behavior-modification empire is worse than I thought.And creating a world thats more opaque instead of less opaque is worse than I thought we should do.Its also a physically uglier place than I thought it would be.Its really a shame.If were the new Renaissance, why dont we make this amazing Tuscany here?We have these gorgeous orchards.Why dont we do something beautiful here instead of just filling it up with parking lots and horrible buildings?He says sometimes his peers in the Valley seem perfectly nice but then they will say something I just cant believe.He cites Eric Schmidts comment on privacy on CNBCs Inside the Mind of Google special in 2009, that If you have something that you dont want anyone to know, maybe you shouldnt be doing it in the first place.Really?Mr. Lanier asks.It does give me this feeling sometimes that somethings going wrong with our culture in Silicon Valley and maybe its just that thing of power corrupting and absolute power corrupting absolutely, just losing perspective.Like Zuckerberg might think, Well, I went around to a bunch of states and I ate barbecue and wrestled cattle so Ive been around all kinds of people.But to have people who you respect and listen to have fundamentally different worldviews and question your core logic and think that you may be way off track, thats a much harder thing to do.And there are people who can be very powerful and comfortable with that.Ill mention one, whose name is Barack Obama.Advertisement Continue reading the main story I ask Mr. Lanier about the sexual harassment and gender inequity problems roiling the Valley.Well, sometimes, I think theres a kind of emerging new male jerk persona of the digital age, which would be some kind of a cross between the Uber guy and the pharma bro and maybe Milo Yiannopoulos and maybe Palmer Luckey and maybe Steve Bannon, he says.Because, theres this sort of smug, superior, Ive got the levers of power, and I know better than you.Its sort of this weird combination of a lot of power and a lot of insecurity at the same time.He believes that Gamergate led to the alt right.It was one of the feeders, he says.He talks about another personality that is emerging from the digital age.If youre a mark of social media, if youre being manipulated by it, one of the ways to tell is if theres a certain kind of personality quality that overtakes you, he says.Its been called the snowflake quality.People criticize liberal college kids who have it, but its exactly the same thing you see in Trump.Its this kind of highly reactive, thin-skinned, outraged single-mindedness.I think one way to think of Trump, even though he is a con man and he is an actor and hes a master manipulator and all that, in a sense hes also a victim.Ive met him a few times over 30 years.And what I think I see is someone who has moved from kind of a New York character who was in on his own joke to somebody who is completely freaked out and outraged and feeling like he is on the verge of a catastrophe every second.And so my theory about that is that he was ruined by social media.Mr. Lanier plays me a song he composed to cheer up his wife when she was going through cancer treatments, a Cuban-style charanga flute solo played on a Japanese shakuhachi which is a crazy-hard thing to do and I pulled it off.Then he confides his fear that one of his older cats, Loof, would have been a Trump supporter.Loof is the sweetest cat in the world but shes really an anti-immigrant voter, he says.She did not like the idea of young cats coming here.She really didnt want the change.She really felt like they ruined everything.And I must point out that the new kittens who came are black kittens.They appear to be Bombay cats.Loof is not in a basket of deplorables.Shes just in a basket of blankets.As I get ready to leave, the grand illusionist offers an intriguing theory about why the internet is more obsessed with cats than dogs.I think we know that Facebook is turning us into trained dogs, he says.We know were being trained.We can feel ourselves being turned into trained circus animals.And we long for that independence that cats show.So when you look at a cat video, what youre really seeing is this receding identity that you want to cling to and find again.RELATED: Jaron Lanier submits to a round of Confirm or Deny, here.
Why Texas Shooting Could Draw Apple Back Into Security Debate:::::If a user has enabled an iPhones data-erase function, someone trying to break into the device would have 10 attempts at typing in a password.If all of those attempts failed, the iPhone would automatically wipe itself clean as a safeguard for its owners privacy.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Interested in All Things Tech?The Bits newsletter will keep you updated on the latest from Silicon Valley and the technology industry.After the F.B.I.s news conference on Tuesday, Apple said, it immediately reached out to law enforcement.We offered assistance and said we would expedite our response to any legal process they send us, Apple said.Past issues with passwords The situation is a reminder of last years fight between Apple and the F.B.I.At the time, law enforcement wanted to get into the iPhone used by Syed Rizwan Farook, who along with his wife killed 14 of Mr. Farooks co-workers at a holiday party in San Bernardino, Calif., in late 2015.In that case, a federal judge ordered Apple to help the F.B.I.The judge asked Apple to bypass or disable the security feature that wipes a phone clean after 10 incorrect password attempts.Apple argued that creating the technology to bypass its own security would compromise its users safety.Tim Cook, the chief executive of Apple, penned a 1,100-word letter to customers, warning that the governments request would lead to a chilling breach of privacy.What the authorities can do In the aftermath of the Sutherland Springs shooting, the authorities could have used Mr. Kelleys fingers for up to 48 hours after he last opened his iPhone to activate the biometric Touch ID function to gain access to the device.It is unclear why officials did not do so.After 48 hours, law enforcement would need a pass code to open the phone.In the San Bernardino case, the F.B.I.was ultimately able to open the iPhone without help from Apple.Its unclear what methods law enforcement has tried in the Texas case.Whether or not the government finds evidence on Mr. Kelleys iPhone, the case could again thrust Apple into the middle of a debate over how we balance the needs of citizens and their right to privacy with the needs of law enforcement working on tough cases.
Smartphones in Egypt Bring Biting Humor but Also Scrutiny:::::Equally important, you need to know when to put all that technology away.In the more paranoid corners of the Middle East, pulling out a glowing laptop in public is not a great idea.How is connectivity in Cairo and in the region when you travel on assignment?The internet can be teeth-grindingly slow in Egypt, to the point of me yelling, ridiculously, at the screen on deadline.Photo In 2016, Egypt ranked 146th out of 150 countries for fixed broadband download speeds, according to Speedtest.The only worse country in North Africa was war-torn Libya.Its surprising given that a major data cable, linking hundreds of millions of users, passes through one sleepy Egyptian village.The problem stems from a lack of investment in telecommunications infrastructure locally since the Arab Spring in 2011 and stifling state monopolies.We get around this with dongles connected to the 4G cellphone network, which is better, if not perfect.In conflict zones like Libya, where I covered an offensive against the Islamic State last year, I turn to my BGAN satellite data terminal and a Thuraya satellite phone.But increasingly there is at least patchy cellphone coverage in even the more dangerous places, such as during the battle for Aleppo, Syria, last year.That brings an immediacy that I once found jarring: the power to FaceTime with your mom, for instance, from a battlefront.But now that feels normal, and choices are dictated less by technology than by what simply feels right.Are Egyptians joined at the hip with their smartphones?Egyptians adore their smartphones.People have crazy-looking cases and a range of dramatic ringtones Quranic verses for conservatives, melodramatic pop tunes for everyone else.Lionel Richies Hello and anything by Celine Dion are very popular.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story How Do You Use Tech?Advice and tips on the technology changing how you live.The flip side to the smartphone mania is that it also inspires deep paranoia among the police and some ordinary citizens, known popularly here as honorable citizens.I know people whove been threatened with arrest for taking a photo of the Suez Canal (after the pyramids, one of Egypts most famous features).A photographer friend was admonished by an honorable citizen for trying to take a photo of the Nile with her phone.He accused her of being a spy.Advertisement Continue reading the main story What are the favorite apps or gadgets in Egypt?Are people on Facebook and using Google and Uber?Egypt has the largest community of Facebook users in the Arab world.Its a huge part of many peoples lives, at a time when the public square is dramatically shrinking.Since President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi came to power in 2013, protest has been outlawed and the news media is largely in thrall to the government.So people turn to social media to talk politics, mock their leaders and hunt for independent news.If Mr. Sisi makes a slip-up on television, there will unfailingly be a flurry of mocking memes flying about on Facebook within hours.It can be funny, dark or both jokes about the countrys pitiful human rights record, for instance.Its not just Western apps.Anghami is the Arab version of Spotify, Souq.com is the big online retailer (and was bought by Amazon this year), and theres a host of apps that tell pious Muslims when to pray or that help them to read the Quran.On the streets of Cairo, Uber and Careem, a ride-sharing app that concentrates on the Middle East, are slugging it out for market share.As a result, cab rides can be ridiculously cheap just a few dollars to cross town.Photo How does the Egyptian government treat tech like social media and Western apps?With wariness and frequent hostility.Egyptian officials closely monitor Facebook, Twitter and other social media sites, and posting an irreverent comment can land a user in court or in jail.A young army conscript is serving a three-year sentence for posting a photo of Mr. Sisi with a pair of Mickey Mouse ears.Since May, the government has banned over 400 websites, including Human Rights Watch, the Egyptian news site Mada Masr and, bizarrely, Medium.Earlier this year, I discovered the security services were seeking access to real-time information about ride-sharing customers once known inside Uber as God View through the Uber and Careem apps.All told, its a pretty grim picture.Beyond your job, what tech product do you love using in your daily life right now and why?I love my Bose noise-canceling Bluetooth headphones, but the most satisfying tech product Ive started using is one that cancels out the rest.A smart little alarm clock by the French designer Philippe Tabet sits on my bedside table, and means that I no longer need my smartphone to wake me up.With the phone banished to another room, I cant mindlessly scroll Twitter or Instagram at 8 oclock in the morning, and I enjoy a tiny window of mental peace.If Times editors need me urgently, they can still call my land line.Sometimes, the old-fashioned tech is best.
Our Guide to the Holiday Season’s Biggest Video Games and Consoles:::::Its blockbuster season for video games.With the holiday season on its way, the games industry is pushing out a diverse lineup of titles, from new installments of long-running franchises like Activisions Call of Duty and Ubisofts Assassins Creed to EAs long-awaited Star Wars Battlefront II.But the real crowd pleasers this year may be in hardware.Microsoft and Nintendo are offering new or upgraded consoles after Sony rereleased its PlayStation 4 console and more powerful PS4 Pro last year.The hottest hardware ticket is Nintendos Switch console, which offers gamers the option of plugging in at home or pulling it off its dock to play on the go.Even though it was released eight months ago, the Switch is still so popular that supply is expected to be a problem at the end of the year.The arrival this week of Microsofts new Xbox One X console featuring more processing power and 4K resolution, which means more defined picture quality is also expected to make waves.The console supports hundreds of games from the Xbox back catalog, including all Xbox One titles, as well as select Xbox 360 titles.Advertisement Continue reading the main story All of this is expected to fuel spending on games, which rose 7 percent to $14 billion in the first half of the year from the same period in 2016, according to the NPD Group.I expect this growth to continue to edge up through the holidays, said Mat Piscatella, who analyzes the video games industry for NPD.

What Reality TV Teaches Us About Russia’s Influence Campaign:::::Over the past few days, I reached out to several reality show producers, asking them to compare the Russian digital influence campaign and the world of unscripted TV.The more they told me about reality shows, the more the metaphor seemed to explain Russias trolling campaign how it worked, what it aimed to do and why campaigns like it will be so difficult to fight.The only thing that matters is drama.One of the more surprising findings about the Russian influence campaign is its political incoherence.The documents released so far suggest that, as in the Houston protest, the trolls didnt seem to care very much about pushing one political side over another.They were happy to push all sides to get people to argue for and against the Islamic library which suggests their ultimate goal was to sow drama.Why?Reality TV offers a guide: Because drama is easy to produce, and because drama sells.On a show where the action stems from the interplay of people living in close quarters like The Bachelor there are often producers on set who subtly, and sometimes less than subtly, prod the contestants into acting in certain ways.How often this happens, and to what degree, varies greatly from show to show and is matter of great secrecy and controversy within the industry.But pretty much everyone in the world of reality TV acknowledges that it happens to some degree on most shows, and that there are certain basic ways to manufacture drama.Sarah Gertrude Shapiro, a former producer on The Bachelor who later created Unreal, a scripted show about the reality industry, said the key to manipulating contestants into acting a certain way was to tap into their fears, passions and ego.Photo On reality TV, producers can do that because they keep detailed dossiers on everyone on set.But guess what?Russian trolls had detailed dossiers, too and they could consult them at scale.Using Facebooks exquisitely detailed ad-targeting and viral propagation systems, trolls could create content that perfectly matched your fears, passions and ego.Facebook pages are veritable instruction manuals for someone who wants to exploit you, Ms. Shapiro said.Given these tools, the Russian plan was simple: You just poke the bears, put them in a cage and let them fight.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Interested in All Things Tech?The Bits newsletter will keep you updated on the latest from Silicon Valley and the technology industry.Case in point: In response to Heart of Texas Stop Islamization post, a Facebook user upset with the Houston mosque posted a comment suggesting that it be blown up.That prompted a local civil rights group to contact the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which in turn led to a story in The Houston Chronicle about the threat and the law enforcement response.Bear poked.Advertisement Continue reading the main story But it doesnt end there.In the same way that cage-fighting bears sells on reality TV, such conflict also sells on Facebooks News Feed, which rewards posts that get a lot of engagement, as well as on Twitter and the larger ecosystem of amped-up cable news that feeds off viral content.The Russian trolls clearly understood this.They based their campaigns on well-known divisions racial, political, religious and the conflicts they generated spread far across social media, and were then widely covered by the news media.If Simon Cowell once tapped into a main artery of negativity in American life, Facebook and Twitter and 24-hour news really picked that up, said Mike Duffy, a co-founder of Ugly Brother Studios, which produces many unscripted shows, referring to the acerbic judge of American Idol and Americas Got Talent.Theyre pushing the same types of bombastic characters, and theyre seeing a ratings increase.Well never know whats really real.Theres a surprising amount of disagreement among experts about how real reality TV is.One camp suggests its not real at all.Jennifer L. Pozner, a media critic and author of Reality Bites Back: The Troubling Truth About Guilty Pleasure TV, said that reality producers go to fantastic lengths to manipulate contestants, denying them food and communication, plying them with alcohol and ultimately chopping up footage to make it look as if they have said and done things that they havent.The contestants have zero ability to contribute narratives about themselves, she said.Theres another camp that suggests that while the circumstances on most shows are contrived, the contestants emotional responses are deeply real.The way we generate drama on reality TV is to put someone in the most extreme environment possible and then watch for their genuine reaction, said Troy DeVolld, a longtime producer and the author of Reality TV: An Insiders Guide to TVs Hottest Market.In fact, he said, reality TV would be boring if that werent the case the whole reason we watch is we can tell how seriously everyone is taking whats going on, even in the most absurd of circumstances.Im not here to adjudicate this debate.But I will point out that it matches the question at the heart of the Russian-influence saga: Did Russias trolls persuade Americans to act in ways that they wouldnt have otherwise or were they merely providing us a framework for expressing our deeply held political and social ideas?The answer is not obvious.On the one hand, its clear that there are cases like the Houston protest where the Russian campaign prompted real people to take real action in the real world.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Whats less clear is whether we should discount those protesters actions and emotions simply because they were influenced by a Russian Facebook campaign.After all, both sides were genuinely angry about the mosque; whoever inspired the campaign, their feelings werent fake news.This happens on reality TV, too.Though everyone understands The Bachelor is contrived, there are Bachelor winners who have been married for more than a decade.At some point, reality TV becomes reality.This gets to whats really pernicious about the Russian campaign.It so deftly blended artifice and reality for so many people, across so many issues, in so many places that it is impossible, now, for any of us to tell where reality and fakery begin and end.Is it the trolls world, or is it ours?
China Spreads Propaganda to U.S. on Facebook, a Platform It Bans at Home:::::Last week, executives from Facebook, Google and Twitter were grilled in Washington about Russias use of American social media platforms to influence the 2016 presidential election.Photo During Facebooks time in the congressional hot seat last week, Senator John Kennedy, a Republican from Louisiana, asked whether China had also run ads to affect the United States election.Facebooks general counsel replied that to his knowledge it had not.There is no indication that China meddled in the American election, but the Communist governments use of Facebook is ironic given its apparent fear of the platform.It also hasnt been reluctant to use it as a soapbox where Chinas relationship with the United States is concerned.China has been a major priority for Facebook.Mark Zuckerberg, the companys founder, has spent years courting it.Facebook executives even set up a page to show CCTV, one of Beijings chief propaganda outlets, how to use the platform during President Xi Jinpings 2015 trip to the United States.While Chinas propaganda channels on Facebook are not nearly as subtle as Russian groups when it comes to influencing opinion, their techniques are nonetheless instructive.Rather than divisive advertisements, many of the Chinese Facebook posts replicate the sort of news propaganda delivered at home: articles stressing Chinas stability and prosperity mixed with posts highlighting chaos and violence in the rest of the world.A similar blend of stories pandas and idyllic Chinese landscapes next to heavy coverage of the mass shooting in Texas has proliferated across Chinas official Facebook channels in the lead-up to Mr. Trumps visit to Beijing, which began on Wednesday.Advertisement Continue reading the main story While much of it is unlikely to sway the average Americans mind, such posts reach people across the world, many of whom are newer to the internet and may have a less sophisticated understanding of media.Chinas state media has Facebook channels dedicated to Africa and other regions of the world, and it seems evident that it is offering itself as an alternative to the Western media for a more global audience.Photo Recently, for example, Xinhua posted an article titled Chinas IP protection system works well, says U.S. professional a rebuke of a congressional investigation into Chinese trade policies that critics say encourage intellectual property theft.A more anodyne post offered a ham-handed attempt to find common ground between China and the United States, pointing to the basketball player Yao Ming, pandas and American students making dumplings as examples of the countries close relationship.A video posted by Xinhua, which already has about 100,000 views, presents a series of man-on-the-street interviews with Chinese people talking about the United States.It begins on a positive note, with questions about Mr. Trump and what they like about the United States.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.About halfway through the video, however, the tone changes and people are asked to describe the problems they see with the United States.At that point, the interviewees get critical.U.S.A. interferes with others lives arrogantly, one woman says.Every person and nation has its own culture and customs, no need to interfere.Another woman addresses America directly: Dont be so self-important and arrogant.
Tencent of China Raises Its Stake in Struggling Snap:::::Before its market debut, Snap had been lauded as being hipper and more innovative than Facebook and other social media companies.Since going public, however, it has had to address slower-than-expected user growth, rising costs and investor doubts about its strategy for dealing with both.Other problems that the company has grappled with include overestimating demand for its Spectacles camera-equipped sunglasses, a once-hot product whose sales cooled rapidly.During a call with analysts on Tuesday, Evan Spiegel, Snaps co-founder and chief executive, said that the company was focused on issues like simplifying the ad-purchase process on its platform and making its core app easier to use, a longstanding complaint.He also promoted the companys efforts to expand its content and augmented-reality offerings.I guess were just not afraid to make changes in the long-term interest of the business, Mr. Spiegel said on the call.So I would expect us to continue learning as we grow the business and making changes that we think are in the best interest of growing the user base, growing revenue and, ultimately, providing our customers with a great product experience.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the DealBook Newsletter Every weekday, twice a day, get the news driving the markets and the latest on mergers and acquisitions.That he spoke openly about his priorities marked a change for the Mr. Spiegel, who is normally tight-lipped about his strategy.Such an approach has frustrated investors who have sought a better sense of where the company was headed.But now, Snap has the support of Tencent.The Chinese company has had a history of taking stakes in chat apps, such as Snap, in order to learn more about how they work and how they perform from a business perspective.It has long held a stake, for example, in South Koreas Kakao.In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Snap said that Tencent and its affiliates had recently acquired 145.8 million nonvoting shares through purchases in the open market.That represents nearly 17 percent of Snaps class A shares, which hold no voting power, and about 12 percent of its total shares.Advertisement Continue reading the main story We have long been inspired by the creativity and entrepreneurial spirit of Tencent, and we are grateful to continue our longstanding and productive relationship that began over four years ago, Snap said in the regulatory filing.For its part, Martin Lau, Tencents president, informed us that Tencent is excited to deepen its shareholding relationship with us, and that it looks forward to sharing ideas and experiences.A Tencent spokesman said at a company conference in Chengdu, China, that it viewed the Snap stake as a strategic investment.We saw Snap as an innovative company with a huge user base that is mostly focused on Western, developed markets, he said.Snap described Tencent as a long-term shareholder, but it did not disclose the Chinese companys total holdings.It said it had no obligation to disclose changes in Tencents holdings of nonvoting shares because of Snaps ownership structure.Tencent had the option to raise its stake in Snap in a fund-raising round before the companys initial public offering this year, but declined.So far, stock market investors do not appear heartened by Tencents move.Shares in Snap were down nearly 15 percent on Wednesday, to $12.91 well below the companys initial offering price of $17 a share.
Snapchat User Growth Disappoints in Another Down Quarter:::::In total, Snaps third quarter revenue was $207.9 million, up 62 percent from a year ago but below Wall Street estimates of $235.5 million.Its net loss was $443.2 million nearly four times the size of the loss a year ago and more than twice as large as what analysts had predicted.About half of that loss was because of the cost of stock-based compensation that the company pays its employees.Snap added 5 million users to its Snapchat messaging service from the previous quarter, but that, too was below estimates from Wall Street, which expected 8 million new users.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Interested in All Things Tech?The Bits newsletter will keep you updated on the latest from Silicon Valley and the technology industry.Snaps chief executive, Evan Spiegel, said revenue growth had been hurt by the companys move to automate its ad-buying process.That transition caused ad pricing to drop by about 60 percent from the previous year, he said, though the change is now largely complete.I am grateful that this transition is nearly behind us, Mr. Spiegel said on a call with analysts.This has been a good test for our business.Mr. Spiegel also said that Snap was redesigning its app to make it easier to use and that the company would focus on user growth in 2018, as well as on content and augmented reality.In the past, Mr. Spiegel has said little about Snaps product strategy.Unlike many other companies, Snap also does not give an estimate for future revenue in its earnings report.Mr. Spiegels talk of goals for 2018 and notes of contrition were a welcome change.For the past two quarters, analysts have expressed frustration over Mr. Spiegels unwillingness to give guidance about the companys product strategy.On stage at a recent conference, Mr. Spiegel said that he needed to do a better job communicating with investors.Snap also indicated it was cutting back on Spectacles, its video recording sunglasses.The company said it had misjudged strong early demand for Spectacles and wrote off $39.9 million of the sunglasses in the quarter.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Brian Wieser, a senior research analyst at Pivotal Research Group, said there remained reasons for optimism about Snap and he questioned Wall Streets focus on user growth.The last time I checked this isnt a subscription business, he said of Snapchat.Theyve done really well retaining their users.Theyre doing well at what they say they can do.Snap has also avoided the kind of criticism that other tech companies have faced over the use of their technology to spread false and misleading information.Last week, Facebook, Twitter and Google faced questions from Congress about how they were turned into a distribution platform for bogus news during the 2016 presidential campaign.Snap tightly controls the news and entertainment content that appears on its Discover news platform.
Uber’s New Mantra: ‘We Do the Right Thing. Period.’:::::Photo Dara Khosrowshahi has spent the past two months learning the ins and outs of Uber, the embattled ride-hailing company where he took over as chief executive in August.Now begins the hard work of repairing Ubers negative image.On Tuesday, Mr. Khosrowshahi introduced a new set of cultural values for the company, replacing a list previously conceived by Travis Kalanick, the former chief executive who in June was pushed out of the start-up he had helped to create.Introduced to employees at an all-hands staff meeting in San Francisco, the list is meant to strike a softer tone for the eight-year-old company, which has long been seen as hard-edged and combative.It includes warmer, fuzzier goals like perseverance and celebrating differences.Another entry reads: We do the right thing.Period.The list also represents something of a repudiation of the culture created under Mr. Kalanick.Uber has long held a reputation for a willingness to fight any and everyone, from competitors like Lyft to lawmakers seeking stronger oversight of the company.That aggressiveness led to difficulties in cities like London, where Mr. Khosrowshahi is scrambling to keep the service alive.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Its that forward-leaning, fearless approach that has underpinned much of Ubers success and has attracted many employees, including me, to the company, Mr. Khosrowshahi said in a LinkedIn post.But its also clear that the culture and approach that got Uber where it is today is not what will get us to the next level.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Ubers cultural baggage caught up to it this year after Susan Fowler, a former employee, penned a lengthy blog post detailing a history of sexual harassment by a superior and complaints to human resources that had fallen on deaf ears.Ms. Fowlers post was the first in a series of events, including the discovery of a program to deceive law enforcement called Greyball, that eventually led to investors pushing Mr. Kalanick to step down.Mr. Khosrowshahi has spent much of his tenure so far on an apology tour, trying to improve relations with the millions of people who drive for the company.He is also working to improve relations with the hundreds of cities Uber operates in around the world.

Sina Doubles Down to Ward Off Activists After Proxy Fight:::::On Tuesday, however, the company took steps to ensure it would not have to face an activist campaign again.It issued a new class of shares with super voting rights that have been transferred to a holding company controlled by Mr. Chao.The changes will give him a 55.5 percent voting stake in Sina and could prevent future attempts to introduce new board members or force votes on business strategy.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Sina said in a news release that it had to divert significant amount of time, attention and efforts from the companys normal business operations and strategic planning because of the proxy fight with Aristeia.The company believes any future proxy contest could be costly, time consuming and disruptive, it added, and argued it was taking the steps to protect itself from potentially disruptive and value destructive situations in the future.It also said that it would be establishing a nominating and corporate governance committee within the board to find more independent directors.Representatives for Aristeia and Sina declined to comment.Shares in the Chinese company fell about 10 percent on Tuesday.Bare-knuckle activist campaigns have been relatively rare in Asia where, in recent years, Daniel S. Loeb has taken on the owner of 7-Eleven, while Paul Singers Elliott Management has picked fights with Samsung Electronics and the Bank of East Asia in Hong Kong.Still, Sina would have appeared to have been an unlikely target for such a challenge.The company had seen its stock price increase markedly over the past year as investors bet on the growth of Chinas internet sector.But Aristeia argued that Sina was failing to hold itself to the standards expected of U.S.-listed public company boards and called for the company to consider a sale or merger of Sina or Weibo, which is separately listed, or a buyback of shares by management.
Waymo’s Autonomous Cars Cut Out Human Drivers in Road Tests:::::Waymo said its driverless cars hit the public roads last month.The company did not say whether it was testing the driverless cars in environments considered challenging for autonomous vehicles, like bridges or tunnels, or more difficult conditions, like driving at night or in rain and snow usually not a big concern in the dry Phoenix climate.While the prospect of cars without emergency drivers may raise concerns among some passengers, Waymo said it had confidence in the safety of its self-driving technology.It has included backup systems like a secondary computer to take over if the main computer fails.And though the cars are driverless, they are not entirely without humans, at least for now.Waymo employees sit in the back seat of the cars, monitoring them, a company spokesman, Johnny Luu, said.Once passengers join the tests, they will be able to contact Waymo support staff with a button inside the car.If the cars are involved in a crash, they are programmed to respond appropriately, including pulling off the road on their own.Driverless cars are regulated by a patchwork of state laws.Arizona, like many states, has no restrictions against operating an autonomous vehicle without a person in the drivers seat.On the other hand, California, where Waymo is headquartered, requires any self-driving car to have a safety driver sitting in the front.In December, Waymo published a report for Californias Department of Motor Vehicles about how frequently its car disengaged deactivating its autonomous mode because of a system failure or safety risk and forcing a human driver to take over.In the report, Waymo said this happened once every 5,000 miles the cars drove in 2016, compared with once every 1,250 miles in 2015.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Consumer Watchdog, a frequent critic of Alphabet, said that data demonstrated that the cars are not ready to drive without any human intervention and that Waymo was following the Silicon Valley model of beta testing a new technology on the public.Its the wrong approach when youre dealing with self-driving cars, said John M. Simpson, a director at Consumer Watchdog.When things go wrong with a robot car, you kill people.Researchers believe self-driving cars can be safer than cars operated by human drivers because they are programmed to adhere strictly to traffic laws, they dont get distracted, and they usually refrain from taking unnecessary risks.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Timothy Tait, a spokesman for the Arizona Department of Transportation, said the state was on pace to exceed 1,000 automobile-related fatalities this year and that its top priority is the publics safety particularly by advancing efforts to reduce crashes and deaths on its roads.We are closely monitoring emerging technologies like self-driving cars that may ultimately support safer travel and open up opportunities for populations who today are unable to drive for themselves, he said in a statement.Waymo, which started as a research and development project for Google in 2009, maintains what many in the industry consider a technological advantage over its competitors.Waymo said its autonomous vehicles had driven more than 3.4 million miles on actual roads with safety drivers as well as running 10 million miles every day in a virtual simulator.In his remarks, Mr. Krafcik said Waymo sees a ride-hailing taxi service as the first commercial application of the companys driverless car technology, though there could be other uses in logistics and public transportation.Taking the human out of the equation will fundamentally change transportation and change how people buy cars, said Mr. Krafcik, who was an executive at Hyundai Motors before joining Google.Because youre accessing vehicles rather than owning, in the future, you could choose from an entire fleet of vehicle options that are tailored to each trip you want to make, he said.They can be designed for specific purposes or tasks.
China’s Technology Ambitions Could Upset the Global Trade Order:::::Cybersecurity laws enacted this summer give the Ministry of State Security the power to conduct security reviews of technology sold or used in China, said James A. Lewis, senior vice president of the Center for Strategic and International Studies.Such a step could require companies to expose some of their most valuable secrets.At some companies, Chinese security officials conduct the inspections in corporate clean rooms in the United States, with the Chinese officials traveling on business visas, Mr. Lewis said.The companies argue that the access takes place under controlled circumstances that limit what Chinese officials might learn.If American companies have a big market in China, they say to the Ministry of State Security, Come in, Mr. Lewis said.Everyone fears retaliation.No one wants to lose the China market.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Old Rules, New Products Wary of the push, the United States has used existing rules to stop Chinese purchases of foreign businesses in areas important to national security.But many of those tools do not apply to todays deals, as A.M.D.s Chinese pact shows.A.M.D.s joint venture with its Chinese partner can be found in a gleaming industrial area of the city of Chengdu called Tianfu Software Park.The park represents Beijings vision of the future.Trees and sidewalks jammed with ride-sharing bikes sit beneath a vast strip of office towers, hotels and apartment complexes.Offices of Chinas most innovative companies, like Huawei and Tencent, sit next to outposts of their foreign analogues, like SAP and Accenture.Inside one of its glass towers, A.M.D.works with its Chinese partner, a company called Sugon, to produce new chips.Photo Under the nearly $300 million deal, A.M.D.agreed to license chip technology to a Chinese joint venture with Sugon to make chips for servers.Because A.M.D.controls that joint venture, the technology is considered to remain in American hands.Advertisement Continue reading the main story But A.M.D.struck a second partnership that the Chinese company controls.That joint venture works on applications such as integrating the chips with servers.The two ventures are on the 11th and 12th floors of the same building.Experts say the dual partnerships could help China develop a new generation of powerful supercomputers.China already makes the worlds fastest computers, but they run on homegrown chips that cannot read commonly available software for supercomputers.With A.M.D.s help, experts say, Sugon could develop chips that could make Chinas supercomputers more versatile and adaptable and replace those from foreign firms.We have worked closely with and been very clear with U.S. government officials on the strategy and specifics of the technology, which is classified as permitted for export, an A.M.D.spokesman said in an emailed statement.He added that the processors are also lower performing than other options that A.M.D.sells in America.Executives in Chengdu said there was a firewall between the two joint ventures, and the one outside of A.M.D.s control was not involved in chip development.Yet in an interview with the Chinese state news media, Zhang Yunquan, a top government researcher and head of the National Supercomputing Center in Jinan, China, said that Sugon could use the work of the joint venture to make supercomputer microchips.Such a supercomputer would be crucial in designing next-generation weapons systems, according to experts.When they first announced the partnership I was shocked, said Stacy Rasgon, a semiconductor analyst with Sanford Bernstein.Photo You would think intellectual property and joint ventures would belong under Cfius review, Mr. Rasgon said, referring to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which reviews foreign deals.It should.Its surprising it isnt.New Rules for a

basis.They are also pressing for reviews of licensing agreements and joint ventures.The United States trade representative has also launched an investigation into whether Chinese companies are stealing intellectual property.Theres concern that U.S. firms are transacting away their competitive advantages, said Greg Levesque, managing director of Pointe Bello, a research firm in Washington, and a former executive at the US-China Business Council.Such changes could ripple through the tech world.Chinese investment often means more money with fewer strings attached.Some tech companies say that is good for innovation.Chinas spending on science and research is also growing at a time when the United States government and others are cutting back.Still, many American companies fear the deck is stacked against them.The United States long believed bringing China into the World Trade Organization, which oversees global trade disputes, would ensure it would follow the rules.But the W.T.O.has proved ineffective when it comes to tech issues.At a recent dinner event in Washington, an American technology executive held up a dinner plate to illustrate the size of the China market, said a person who was there who asked not to be identified because the event was not public.Then the American executive held up a wine coaster that represented the size of his firms business.The message was clear: American companies are at risk of being muscled out of the market.Made in China 2025 seems to reject all notions of comparative advantage and future opportunities for high-value-added manufactured exports from the rest of the world to China, said Jeremie Waterman, president of the China Center at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.If Made in China 2025 achieves its goals, he said, the U.S. and other countries would likely become just commodity exporters to China selling oil, gas, beef and soybeans.

Saudi Money Fuels the Tech Industry. It’s Time to Ask Why.:::::The money from regimes that have been criticized for their human rights records from Saudi Arabias government in particular, which has plans to funnel potentially hundreds of billions of dollars into tech companies through its state-controlled Public Investment Fund stands in stark contrast to those aims.By accepting these investments, tech companies get to revel in the branding glory of global good while taking billions from a government that stands against many of those goals a government that has an abysmal record with human rights groups, that has systematically marginalized women, that has not had much legal due process and that has advocated an extreme form of Islam that has zero tolerance for just about any religious or intellectual diversity whatsoever.Look, every company has a choice about their actions and inactions, said Freada Kapor Klein, co-chairwoman of the Kapor Center for Social Impact, which advocates for a more diverse and inclusive tech industry.She said companies could choose not to do business with governments whose actions they found troubling, but many of todays tech companies have lost a moral compass.There is an elitism that makes it far too easy for them to rationalize their behavior with their belief that they are the smartest guys and, yes, its always guys in the room, she said.Unsurprisingly, this is not a topic many people want to talk about.SoftBank, the Japanese conglomerate that runs the $100 billion Vision Fund, which is shelling out eye-popping investments in tech companies, declined to comment for this column.Nearly half of the Vision Fund, about $45 billion, comes from the Saudi Public Investment Fund.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Interested in All Things Tech?The Bits newsletter will keep you updated on the latest from Silicon Valley and the technology industry.WeWork and Slack, two prominent start-ups that have received recent investments from the Vision Fund, also declined to comment.So did Uber, which garnered a $3.5 billion investment from the Public Investment Fund in 2016, and which is in talks to receive a big investment from the SoftBank fund.The Public Investment Fund also did not return a request for comment.Twitter, which got a $300 million investment from Prince Alwaleeds Kingdom Holding Company in 2011 around the same time that it was talking up its role in the Arab Spring declined to comment on his arrest.Lyft, which received $105 million from Prince Alwaleed in 2015, also declined to comment.Privately, several founders, investors and others at tech companies who have taken money from the Saudi government or prominent members of the royal family did offer insight into their thinking.Prince Alwaleed, some pointed out, was not aligned with the Saudi government his arrest by the government underscores this and he has advocated for some progressive reforms, including giving women the right to drive, a restriction that the kingdom says will be lifted next year.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The founders and investors also brought up the Saudi governments supposed push for modernization.The Saudis have outlined a long-term plan, Vision 2030, that calls for a reduction in the states dependence on oil and a gradual loosening on economic and social restrictions, including a call for greater numbers of women to enter the work force.The gauzy vision allows tech companies to claim to be part of the solution in Saudi Arabia rather than part the problem: Sure, they are taking money from one of the worlds least transparent and most undemocratic regimes, but its the part of the government that wants to do better.Another mitigating factor, for some, is the sometimes indirect nature of the Saudi investments.When the SoftBank Vision Fund invests tens of millions or billions into a tech company, its true that half of that money is coming from Saudi Arabia.But its SoftBank that has control over the course of the investment and communicates with founders.The passive nature of the Saudi investment in SoftBanks fund thus allows founders to sleep better at night.On the other hand, it also has a tendency to sweep the Saudi money under the rug.When SoftBank invests in a company, the Saudi connection is not always made clear to employees and customers.You get to enjoy the convenience of your WeWork without having to confront its place in the Saudi governments portfolio.Then, finally, theres the justification of desperation.Some companies dont have any choice but to take money thats offered to them.(In 2009, The New York Times Company took a loan from the Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim, who has been criticized for gaining his wealth through close connections with government officials.)But the tech companies that the Saudis are itching to invest in often do have a choice; they are some of the most highly valued companies of our era, and many of them have no immediate need for more money.For instance: Slack, which raised $250 million from SoftBank last month, said it had no plans for spending the money and instead had raised it to preserve long-term operational flexibility.But why take it from the Saudis?I suspect its the most obvious reason: because the money is there, and no one is making too big a fuss about it.It used to be that most of the money in tech came from more vaunted sources universities, philanthropies, pension plans and other nonprofits, which made up the bulk of funders to venture capital firms like Sequoia Capital and Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers.Now were in a new era, when giant pools of money splash through sleek-sounding Vision Funds and come out seeming squeaky clean and ready to fund the next great thing to make the world so much better, we promise.
A.I. Researchers Leave Elon Musk Lab to Begin Robotics Start-Up:::::We now have teachable robots, Mr. Abbeel said during a recent interview at the new companys offices in Emeryville, Calif., just across the bay from San Francisco.The new company is part of a much wider effort to create A.I.that allows robots to learn.Researchers in places like Google, Brown University, and Carnegie Mellon are doing similar work, as are existing start-ups like Micropsi and Prowler.io.Robots already automate some work inside factories and warehouses, such as moving boxes from place to place at Amazons massive distribution centers.But companies must program these machines for each particular task, limiting their possible applications.The hope is that robots can master a much wider array of tasks by learning on their own.Today, every motion that an industrial robot makes is specified down to the millimeter, said Sunil Dhaliwal, the Amplify founder who led the firms investment in Embodied Intelligence.But most real problems cant be solved that way.You have to be able not just to tell the robot what to do, but to tell it how to learn.Photo Mr. Abbeel and the other founders of Embodied Intelligence, including the former OpenAI researchers Peter Chen and Rocky Duan and the former Microsoft researcher Tianhao Zhang, specialize in an algorithmic method called reinforcement learning a way for machines to learn tasks by extreme trial and error.Researchers at DeepMind, the London-based A.I.lab owned by Google, used this method to build a machine that could play the ancient game of Go better than any human.In essence, the machine learned to master this enormously complex game by playing against itself over and over and over again.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Other researchers, across both industry and academia, have shown that similar algorithms allow robots to learn physical tasks as well.By repeatedly trying to open a door, for instance, a robot can learn which particular movements bring success and which dont.Much like Google and labs at Brown and Northeastern University, Embodied Intelligence is also augmenting these methods with a wide range of other machine learning techniques.Most notably, the start-up is exploring what is called imitation learning, a way for machines to learn discrete tasks from human demonstrations.The company is using this method to teach a two-armed robot to pick up plastic pipes from a table.Donning virtual reality headsets and holding motion trackers in their hands, Mr. Abbeel and his colleagues will repeatedly demonstrate the task in a digital world that recreates what is in front of a robot.Then the machine can then learn from this digital data.Photo We collect data on what the human is doing, Mr. Chen said.Then we can train the machine to imitate the human.These and similar machine learning methods have only begun to bear fruit over the past few years, but many believe they will overhaul the field of robotics.It is telling that OpenAI, a pure research lab that opened its doors less than two years ago, has now lost two big names to more commercial pursuits.Poached away from OpenAI by Mr. Musk himself, the machine learning expert Andrej Karpathy is now the director of A.I.at Tesla, working to help autonomous cars get smarter faster.And Mr. Abbeel is launching Embodied Intelligence.Andrej is stepping out of the research mode and saying: I want to do this in practice, Mr. Abbeel explained.That same thing goes for us.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.He said he believed his new start-up can rapidly push its methods into manufacturing operations like the auto industry.Although robotics already handle many tasks inside such factories, there are many others they cant yet master.That is what Embodied Intelligence hopes to change.Some researchers question how much these machine learning techniques will ultimately improve robotics, believing they are overhyped among both researchers and the news media.Machine learning is being thrown at so many problems in robotics, said Robert Howe, a professor of robotics at Harvard University.And it produces just enough results that people can trumpet it.But Mr. Abbeel is among the worlds top researchers in his field, and his decision to start a own company is an indication that machine learning will continue to push robotics forward.It is obvious that this is what you need to build flexible, agile robotics, said Geoff Hinton, a pioneer of machine learning.
Hedge Funds Push the Price of Bitcoin to New Highs:::::Now market watchers say a significant amount of the new money is coming from large institutional investors, many of them hedge funds looking to capitalize on the skyrocketing price.Many of the hedge funds were set up over the last year to invest exclusively in virtual currencies.The research firm Autonomous Next has said the number of such hedge funds has risen from around 30 to nearly 130 this year alone.More general-purpose hedge funds have also been buying up Bitcoin, like one run by Bill Miller, a well known mutual fund manager who spent most of his career with Legg Mason.Even more big investors are looking at the space after the Chicago Mercantile Exchange announced last week that it would launch a Bitcoin futures contract in the next few months.The contract will make it easier for financial institutions plugged into the exchange to get involved with the Bitcoin market without having to worry about holding Bitcoin itself.Bobby Cho, the head trader at one of the largest Bitcoin trading businesses, Cumberland, said that after years of hesitancy, institutional investors now accounted for most of his business.The vast majority of the trading we do is with institutions, Mr. Cho said.The education and research have turned into real-life activity.The New York Times Explains...The entrance of these big investors creates new risks for Bitcoin.Kevin Zhou, a longtime trader in the space, said that hedge funds were more likely than small investors to pull out a lot of money at once, and that Bitcoin was still small enough that a single funds cashing out could cause the price to drop sharply.Advertisement Continue reading the main story You could get a possible run on the bank if one large investor withdraws and that causes the price to tank, said Mr. Zhou, a co-founder of the trading firm Galois Capital.That could cause a cascade of withdrawals.The rising importance of Wall Street is an unexpected turn for a virtual currency that was invented in 2008 by an anonymous creator known as Satoshi Nakamoto and designed to operate outside the traditional financial system.The Soaring Price of Bitcoin Since the beginning of the year, the value of Bitcoin has jumped over 600 percent.$6,000 4,000 2,000 0 $7,377 2017 April July Oct. (11/5) Bitcoins, even those held by hedge funds, are recorded and stored on a decentralized database known as the blockchain, kept on a network of computers around the world.The whole system is governed by so-called open source software that is maintained by a community of volunteer programmers.The lack of backing from any government or established institution has concerned many large banks.The chief executive of Credit Suisse, Tidjane Thiam, said last week that he saw no inherent value in Bitcoin, joining the list of bankers who have called the market a bubble.But some financial leaders, including Goldman Sachss chief executive, Lloyd Blankfein, and Christine Lagarde, the head of the International Monetary Fund, have defended the idea that virtual currencies could one day play a role in the global financial system because they can be obtained by anyone with internet access.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.The debate about Bitcoin has been part of a broader explosion of interest this year in the various technological concepts introduced by the virtual currency.Many banks, including JPMorgan, have been trying to find ways to create their own decentralized databases, like the Bitcoin blockchain, that could provide a more reliable and secure way to track information.In the technology industry, there has been a rush this year of so-called initial coin offerings, a way for entrepreneurs to raise money by creating and selling their own custom virtual currencies.Initial coin offerings have taken over $3 billion from investors this year after attracting almost no interest before.These coin offerings have created their own demand for Bitcoin because the new coins generally have to be bought with an existing virtual currency like Bitcoin.The interest in Bitcoin could be dampened in the coming weeks, however, by a debate among Bitcoin followers.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Bitcoin start-ups and programmers have been fighting for nearly three years about the best way to update the software that governs the currency and the network on which it lives.The battle is expected to come to a head this month when new Bitcoin software, backed by many of the biggest virtual currency start-ups, is released.The new software aims to double the number of transactions flowing through the network.Currently, the computers processing Bitcoin transactions are limited to about five transactions per second.Most of the programmers who maintain the Bitcoin software have opposed the changes because they say it would make it harder for individuals to track their own Bitcoins.Some of the computers on the network are likely to update to the new software while others stay with the existing rules, creating a split, or fork, in the network that would result in two separate Bitcoins.A Bitcoin fork could prove disruptive and drive away investors.But several signals suggest that the proposed rule changes are not likely to win enough support to survive for long, which would leave the status quo in place.Bitcoin has already survived past attempts to fork the software and create imitators.In August, a group of former Bitcoin supporters created Bitcoin Cash, a totally separate virtual currency that makes it easier to do small transactions, like paying for a cup of coffee.The price of Bitcoin temporarily wavered before Bitcoin Cash was introduced.All previous holders of Bitcoin were automatically granted the same number of Bitcoin Cash, and the value of those has also been rising, essentially doubling in the last month.Chris Burniske, a co-author of a book on virtual currency investing, Cryptoassets, said most of the new investors werent too concerned about the exact design of Bitcoin or the current debates.I dont think a lot of the new buyers are overly concerned about the long-term technical aspects of Bitcoin, he said.They are simply approaching it as a financial instrument.
Mountain of Debt Casts Shadow Over Broadcom-Qualcomm Deal:::::Photo Chip makers like Freescale Semiconductor and NXP Semiconductors took a high-profile role in the leveraged-buyout binge that preceded the financial crisis and the distress that followed it.That makes Broadcoms roughly $105 billion unsolicited offer for Qualcomm on Monday all the more edgy.The borrowing associated with a deal, if it happens, could be in record amounts and may send ratios of debt-to-Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) uncomfortably high.Broadcoms chief executive, Hock Tan, is facing two sources of uncertainty.One is whether his counterpart, Steve Mollenkopf, is willing to engage over the deal, which offers a 28 percent premium over Qualcomms closing stock price on Thursday, before word of a potential bid began to spread.So far, Qualcomms response has been noncommittal.The other problem facing Mr. Tan is Qualcomms ongoing $38 billion bid to buy NXP which listed shakily in 2010 and bought Freescale in 2015.Mr. Tan said he would take Qualcomm with or without NXP.Then theres sheer scale.The bid, worth $130 billion including Qualcomm debt, according to Broadcom, would require nearly $90 billion in cash.The private-equity outfit Silver Lake is providing $5 billion in convertible debt, with the rest to be raised by Bank of America, Citigroup, Deutsche Bank, JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley.Add in the companies existing net debt, and the new groups total would be over $100 billion, even if more cash accumulates before the deal closes.Thats four or five times the $23 billion in combined Ebitda that Broadcom is expecting, including cost savings.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Consolidation among makers of chips for mobile phones, cars and the rest is all the rage, and Mr. Tan is an experienced deal maker with a record of quickly bringing debt down after acquisitions.But its still a cyclical industry.The merged company would have to keep big customers like Apple happy, which might mean cutting prices.Meanwhile, $3 billion in annual cost reductions, taxed and capitalized, are worth about the same as the roughly $22 billion premium, so Broadcom isnt keeping much for its own shareholders.At least one deal hurdle Washingtons examination of foreign acquirers has been pre-empted.The Singapore-domiciled Broadcom will move to the United States, Mr. Tan said last week in a news conference with President Trump.Investors seem to have caught the good feelings, pushing up the stock of both companies to the tune of more than $20 billion altogether since Thursday.As it happens, both Freescale and NXP survived a turn in the cycle despite excessive leverage.But the distress they went through should give pause for thought.
After a Tax Crackdown, Apple Found a New Shelter for Its Profits:::::Seeking the Holy Grail Since the mid-1990s, multinationals based in the United States have increasingly shifted profits into offshore tax havens.Indeed, a tiny handful of jurisdictions mostly Bermuda, Ireland, Luxembourg and the Netherlands now account for 63 percent of all profits that American multinational companies claim to earn overseas, according to an analysis by Gabriel Zucman, an assistant professor of economics at the University of California, Berkeley.Those destinations hold far less than 1 percent of the worlds population.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Criticism of such profit shifting was largely ignored until government finances around the globe came under pressure in the years following the 2008 financial crisis, when the practice led to government inquiries, tax inspector raids, media scrutiny and promises of reform.In May 2013, the Senates investigative subcommittee released a 142-page report on Apples tax avoidance, finding that the company was attributing billions of dollars in profits each year to three Irish subsidiaries that declared tax residency nowhere in the world.Under Irish law, if a company can convince Irish tax authorities that it is managed and controlled abroad, it can largely escape Irish income tax.By seeming to run its Irish subsidiaries from its world headquarters in California, Apple ensured that Irish tax residency was avoided.At the same time, American law dictated that the subsidiaries were only tax residents in the United States if incorporated there.The federal government permits taxes on any income generated by foreign units to be deferred indefinitely, as long as the company says those profits stay offshore.U.S. Profits

misunderstanding in a hearing in the U.S. Congress.Ireland had long pursued business-friendly tax policies, which helped lure jobs to the country, primarily for technology and pharmaceutical companies.Apple now has about 6,000 employees in Ireland, including customer service and administrative jobs.But by October 2013, in response to growing international pressure, Mr. Noonan announced that Irish companies would have to declare tax residency somewhere in the world.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.At that time,

other senior partners.They also expect the work that is being done for them only to be discussed amongst personnel who need to know.In building Apples new tax shelter, Appleby served as something of a general contractor.A key architect was Baker McKenzie, a huge law firm based in Chicago.The firm has a reputation for devising creative offshore structures for multinationals and defending them to tax

also asked for assurances that the local political climate would remain friendly: Are there any developments suggesting that the law may change in an unfavourable way in the foreseeable future?(A Baker McKenzie spokesman said, As a matter of general policy, we do not comment on confidential client matters.)Apple decided that its new offshore tax structure should use Applebys office in Jersey, which is one of the Channel Islands and has strong links to the British banking system.Jersey makes its own laws and is not subject to most European Union legislation, making it a popular tax haven.
Slowing iPhone Battery Drain:::::Q.Why does the iPhone battery drain so much?I have an iPhone 6 and consider myself a normal user of the iPhone.I have gone to Apples website and done everything suggested to slow the drain, but sometimes by 6 p.m. Im down below 50 percent.What else can I do?A.Battery drain can be caused by a number of factors, including the age of the battery itself.The iPhone 6 was released in 2014, and if you purchased the device around that time and have been using it regularly for three years, the battery may be losing its ability to hold a charge.Having an authorized service provider replace the battery or investing in an external battery are two options for a failing power cell.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story How Do You Use Tech?Advice and tips on the technology changing how you live.If you purchased the iPhone 6 more recently and have been regularly upgrading its operating system as Apple produces fresh versions each year your phones hardware may not be able to use the latest iOS releases as effectively as the faster processors in newer iPhones.Complaints about lousy battery life often dog new iOS versions, which in turn lead to incremental updates from Apple that are intended to provide bug fixes and improvements.Apple released a significant update to the operating system on Oct. 31, so if you have not installed it yet, upgrading to iOS 11.1 might ease some of the power-sapping issues.This iOS 11.1 update also adds dozens of new emoji characters and corrects a few performance issues.Keeping your apps updated may improve things, too.Photo You can see which apps and services are using the most power by opening the Settings app and selecting Battery; the information is listed under Battery Usage.Turning on Low Power Mode and turning off power-hungry features like Background App Refresh, Hey Siri and Location Services (when not needed) can also help.
Broadcom Targets Qualcomm in Largest-Ever Tech Deal:::::Mr. Tan has long been known as a savvy deal maker who led consolidation in the chip industry.If he pulls this deal off, his political maneuvering could be used as a sort of template for other executives.Complications are already adding up.Qualcomm is expected to reject the bid as opportunistic and too cheap.And analysts and investors have raised the prospect that a merger of the two companies might be blocked by government regulators, either on antitrust grounds or because Broadcom could still be considered a foreign company buying sensitive technology.Photo But Mr. Tan and his team have already made moves to address some of those issues.Publicly, Broadcom said the plan to move its legal headquarters to the United States was tied to Republican efforts to overhaul the tax code, including the cutting of corporate tax rates.But getting on the good side of the Trump administration which will have a say in takeovers like the Qualcomm bid was another factor, according to a person briefed on the matter.In an interview, Mr. Tan, 65, played down any connection between his headquarters announcement at the White House and the Qualcomm bid, asserting that the timing had been coincidental.We think very long term, he said.What we perceive is that the business environment has steadily improved.As we want to grow our business in the long term, that makes it easier to choose to redomicile in the U.S. to sustain our growth trends.That Mr. Tan is in the drivers seat for consolidation in the chip industry reflects his unlikely rise in the technology world.At the White House last Thursday, he recounted being an 18-year-old skinny kid from Malaysia who had been able to attend M.I.T.only because he won a scholarship.He eventually jumped into the chip business, showing off a mastery of operations and an eye for high finance and deal making.Mr. Tan ended up at Broadcoms predecessor, Avago Technologies, in 2006, soon after the investment firms Silver Lake and KKR bought the company.Avagos corporate history can be traced back to Hewlett-Packard.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Much of Mr. Tans tenure since then has been spent thinking about the long-term future of the semiconductor business.He has long been a proponent of consolidation, buying established chip franchises with healthy profit margins and selling off the parts that are not financially successful.Mr. Tans deal-making streak began in earnest in 2013, when Avago bought LSI, a maker of networking chips, for $6.6 billion.Two years later, Avago bought Emulex for $606 million, and then the much-bigger Broadcom for $37 billion.The deal for Qualcomm would be $130 billion including debt.Mr. Tan has for years pushed growth by acquisition.Underpinning the strategy is a recognition that the semiconductor business has largely matured.The rate of revolutionary change has slowed, and chip companies have focused more on price competition, leading to lower profit margins.His approach has been to gain scale by buying market leaders and then running those companies more efficiently while also investing in technologies that customers like Apple want.The Biggest Tech Deals If accepted, Broadcoms bid for Qualcomm would be the largest tech deal in history.Below are the 12 largest to date (values include debt).Broadcom-Qualcomm Dell-EMC Paypal Spinoff From eBay Qualcomm-NXP JDS-SDL Avago-Broadcom SoftBank-ARM HP Enterprise Spinoff E.D.S Spinoff From G.M.Microsoft-LinkedIn HP-Compaq Verisign-Network

better than anyone in the world, Kenneth Hao, a managing partner at Silver Lake who helped bring Mr. Tan to Avago, said in a statement.But consolidation has led to concerns that the chip industry could become concentrated in the hands of just a few big players.Qualcomm itself is in the midst of acquiring NXP Semiconductor for $38.5 billion, while Broadcom is still awaiting national security approval for its $5.5 billion takeover of Brocade Communications.Some analysts have wondered whether Broadcom, with Singapore as its legal headquarters, could face issues with the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, a government group that examines takeovers for threats to national security.But while a deal could face such a review, neither company believes that it would be the main obstacle to a transaction getting done, according to several people briefed on the bid.Broadcoms operations are largely in the United States, and its legal base is in Singapore primarily because of that countrys low tax rate.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Antitrust approval may also be a concern.In January, the Federal Trade Commission brought charges against Qualcomm, accusing the company of abusing its monopoly in certain chips by charging unreasonable rates to partners like Apple, a company with which Qualcomm has a series of long-running legal fights.But Republican antitrust enforcers, picked by Mr. Trump, may take a more lenient approach to mergers.The biggest issue may simply be that Qualcomm believes the current offer, worth about $70 a share, is too low.Qualcomms trove of patents among the most formidable in the world of wireless networking remains a hugely valuable asset.And the company could also believe that closing the NXP acquisition and reaching either a victory over or a settlement with Apple would lift its stock price.But Qualcomm, the longtime leader in cellphone chip technology, has been grappling with a sagging stock price and investor wariness that the Apple fight will continue for some time.Advertisement Continue reading the main story On Monday, Qualcomm said that its board was weighing Broadcoms offer.Mr. Tan said in the interview that he believed that, should Broadcom succeed in buying Qualcomm, he could make peace with Apple.But to win over Qualcomm, Broadcom may need to do something it hasnt done before: wage a hostile takeover, including by replacing at least part of its quarrys board.Although Mr. Tan professed a desire to reach a consensual deal, he suggested that he was prepared to take whatever steps necessary to win.We really know what our options are, and we havent really eliminated them, he said.
Want a Car Pool in Your Neighborhood? Via Says Vote for It:::::The No.1 question we get asked is, When are you coming to my part of town?said Daniel Ramot, the co-founder and chief executive officer of Via.We are thrilled to get all of New York sharing affordable Via rides, and do our share to reduce congestion and emissions in our hometown.Devin Shacket, 29, an actress who lives in Midtown Manhattan, said that it made sense to ask riders where they want to go.I really like that idea, she said.From a business standpoint, it seems very smart to offer a service people want to use in locations where it will serve them best.Vias expansion in Brooklyn will mean that Chris Lee, 26, a researcher for a real estate company who lives in Cobble Hill, will have another option to get around.Mr. Lee, who has used Via, said he would stick with the subway for his regular commute because it is cheaper, but was likely to use Via when he needed a car.Photo Vias crowdsourcing is the latest development in New York Citys rapidly changing transportation landscape, as ride-hail apps have flooded the streets with thousands of black cars and upended the yellow cab industry.Though the new app services have hurt taxi owners and drivers, they have been embraced by many riders, especially in the boroughs outside Manhattan where subway and taxi service is limited.For the first time, in July, more people in the city chose Uber over yellow cabs.Via started in 2013 with five sport utility vehicles shuttling groups of commuters back and forth from the Upper East Side, where subways are crowded.It offered an unbeatable $5 flat fee around most of Manhattan, south of 125th Street.Soon its cars were also in four neighborhoods in Brooklyn Downtown Brooklyn, Brooklyn Heights, Williamsburg, Greenpoint in Long Island City, Queens, and at the airports.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Via has even sought to get New Yorkers to share their yellow cab rides.In June, Via partnered with a competing taxi app, Curb, to give discounted fares to taxi riders around Manhattan in return for sharing the back seat with a stranger.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Today, Via has grown to more than one million registered users in New York City, Chicago and Washington.Uber also has its own version of a car pool, called UberPool, while Lyft has Lyft Line.Ana Kukoleca, 26, an accountant, said she hoped that Vias polling of customers would help establish new hubs of service and improve transportation in underserved neighborhoods.Ms. Kukoleca, who lives in Astoria, Queens, said that she had tapped her phone for an Uber or Lyft car, only to have to wait another six to 10 minutes for it to show up.I feel its the best route to go, she said.New York is very much a word-of-mouth city.

largest tech businesses, including Google, Facebook and Microsoft, sometimes pay millions of dollars a year to A.I.experts, effectively cornering the market for this hard-to-find talent.The shortage isnt going away anytime soon, just because mastering these skills takes years of work.The industry is not willing to wait.Companies are developing all sorts of tools that will make it easier for any

which it expects to be one of its primary economic engines in the years to come.And after snapping up such a large portion of the worlds top A.I researchers, it has a means of jump-starting this engine.Neural networks are rapidly accelerating the development of A.I.Rather than building an image-recognition service or a language translation app by hand, one line of code at a time, engineers can much more quickly build an algorithm that learns tasks on its own.By analyzing the sounds in a vast collection of old technical support calls, for instance, a machine-learning algorithm can learn to recognize spoken words.But building a neural network is not like building a website or some run-of-the-mill smartphone app.It requires significant math skills, extreme trial and error, and a fair amount of intuition.Jean-Franois Gagn, the chief executive of an independent machine-learning lab called Element AI, refers to the process as a new kind of computer programming.In building a neural network, researchers run dozens or even hundreds of experiments across a vast network of machines, testing how well an algorithm can learn a task like recognizing an image or translating from one language to another.Then they adjust particular parts of the algorithm over and over again, until they settle on something that works.Some call it a dark art, just because researchers find it difficult to explain why they make particular adjustments.Advertisement Continue reading the main story But with AutoML, Google is trying to automate this process.It is building algorithms that analyze the development of other algorithms, learning which methods are successful and which are not.Eventually, they learn to build more effective machine learning.Google said AutoML could now build algorithms that, in some cases, identified objects in photos more accurately than services built solely by human experts.Photo Barret Zoph, one of the Google researchers behind the project, believes that the same method will eventually work well for other tasks, like speech recognition or machine translation.This is not always an easy thing to wrap your head around.But it is part of a significant trend in A.I.research.Experts call it learning to learn or meta-learning.Many believe such methods will significantly accelerate the progress of A.I.in both the online and physical worlds.At the University of California, Berkeley, researchers are building techniques that could allow robots to learn new tasks based on what they have learned in the past.Computers are going to invent the algorithms for us, essentially, said a Berkeley professor, Pieter Abbeel.Algorithms invented by computers can solve many, many problems very quickly at least that is the hope.This is also a way of expanding the number of people and businesses that can build artificial intelligence.These methods will not replace A.I.researchers entirely.Experts, like those at Google, must still do much of the important design work.But the belief is that the work of a few experts can help many others build their own software.Renato Negrinho, a researcher at Carnegie Mellon University who is exploring technology similar to AutoML, said this was not a reality today but should be in the years to come.It is just a matter of when, he said.
Managing Email on Multiple Devices:::::Q.How do I efficiently manage my email with three devices: computer, phone and tablet?Do I have to read, save, delete email three times, or can I easily sync them?A.Most mail programs give you the choice of two ways to set up an account on a computer or mobile device either with the IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol) standard or POP (Post Office Protocol).If you want to keep your mailbox in sync across multiple devices, choose the IMAP method.Photo Compared with POP, IMAP is a newer technology for managing messages and handles checking the same mail account on multiple devices much more smoothly.With IMAP, even though you can see your mailbox in the mail program on your computer and devices, IMAP messages actually live on the mail server.When you read, delete or flag a message, you are performing that action on the mail server.The mail apps on your other devices see the change when you view the updated mailbox.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story How Do You Use Tech?Advice and tips on the technology changing how you live.In contrast, most POP mail systems in their default settings download messages directly to the device that checks in at the time, and then deletes those messages from the mail server.When you check mail with your computer or other gadgets, those devices do not get the deleted messages, but they may download newer ones which then get deleted from the server, making your mailboxes out of sync.As a workaround, some mail providers allow you to keep messages on the server without deleting them automatically after they download, but then you have to repeatedly delete a message on each device.Additionally, the messages you send stay on the Sent mailbox of the computer or device that actually did the sending.Most modern mail providers and programs support IMAP You can find instructions for setting up IMAP mail accounts for Googles Gmail, Microsoft Outlook and Mozillas Thunderbird program on their sites.Apples iCloud mail does not support POP and uses IMAP by default.
Grab Copies of Google Emails, Photos and Files:::::Q. I have decided to leave Google and move to another mail and file-storage service.How do I get my mail, photos and other files stored in my Google account?A. Google has a download page you can use to grab copies of your Gmail messages, uploaded pictures on Google Photos, calendars, contacts, Google Keep notes and more.To use it, log into your Google account and go to your Takeout page; if you use Gmail and Googles other G Suite corporate services through your employer, talk to your companys system administrator about moving your data.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story How Do You Use Tech?Advice and tips on the technology changing how you live.On the Takeout page, you can select the Google apps and services you use, and add your personal content from each one to an archive file.The pictures you download from Google Photos will be exported in the format you used when you uploaded the images.As you move down the list of apps and services, click the downward-pointing menu arrow to get more information about exporting the data from that particular Google product.Photo Once you have made your selections, click the Next button at the bottom of the page to choose the format for your archive the .zip format is probably the most universal here, as most computers can automatically open .zip archives.You can also select your delivery method, including getting a mail message with a link for downloading the archive, or copying the archive file to Microsoft OneDrive or a Dropbox folder.Keep in mind that downloading all your data does not remove it from the companys servers.It also does not remove your Google-based web activity or delete your Google account.After you make sure your archive has what you need, log into your Google account and, in the account preferences area, click the Delete your account or services link and follow the steps on the screen.
Smartphones in Egypt Bring Biting Humor but Also Scrutiny:::::Equally important, you need to know when to put all that technology away.In the more paranoid corners of the Middle East, pulling out a glowing laptop in public is not a great idea.How is connectivity in Cairo and in the region when you travel on assignment?The internet can be teeth-grindingly slow in Egypt, to the point of me yelling, ridiculously, at the screen on deadline.Photo In 2016, Egypt ranked 146th out of 150 countries for fixed broadband download speeds, according to Speedtest.The only worse country in North Africa was war-torn Libya.Its surprising given that a major data cable, linking hundreds of millions of users, passes through one sleepy Egyptian village.The problem stems from a lack of investment in telecommunications infrastructure locally since the Arab Spring in 2011 and stifling state monopolies.We get around this with dongles connected to the 4G cellphone network, which is better, if not perfect.In conflict zones like Libya, where I covered an offensive against the Islamic State last year, I turn to my BGAN satellite data terminal and a Thuraya satellite phone.But increasingly there is at least patchy cellphone coverage in even the more dangerous places, such as during the battle for Aleppo, Syria, last year.That brings an immediacy that I once found jarring: the power to FaceTime with your mom, for instance, from a battlefront.But now that feels normal, and choices are dictated less by technology than by what simply feels right.Are Egyptians joined at the hip with their smartphones?Egyptians adore their smartphones.People have crazy-looking cases and a range of dramatic ringtones Quranic verses for conservatives, melodramatic pop tunes for everyone else.Lionel Richies Hello and anything by Celine Dion are very popular.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story How Do You Use Tech?Advice and tips on the technology changing how you live.The flip side to the smartphone mania is that it also inspires deep paranoia among the police and some ordinary citizens, known popularly here as honorable citizens.I know people whove been threatened with arrest for taking a photo of the Suez Canal (after the pyramids, one of Egypts most famous features).A photographer friend was admonished by an honorable citizen for trying to take a photo of the Nile with her phone.He accused her of being a spy.Advertisement Continue reading the main story What are the favorite apps or gadgets in Egypt?Are people on Facebook and using Google and Uber?Egypt has the largest community of Facebook users in the Arab world.Its a huge part of many peoples lives, at a time when the public square is dramatically shrinking.Since President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi came to power in 2013, protest has been outlawed and the news media is largely in thrall to the government.So people turn to social media to talk politics, mock their leaders and hunt for independent news.If Mr. Sisi makes a slip-up on television, there will unfailingly be a flurry of mocking memes flying about on Facebook within hours.It can be funny, dark or both jokes about the countrys pitiful human rights record, for instance.Its not just Western apps.Anghami is the Arab version of Spotify, Souq.com is the big online retailer (and was bought by Amazon this year), and theres a host of apps that tell pious Muslims when to pray or that help them to read the Quran.On the streets of Cairo, Uber and Careem, a ride-sharing app that concentrates on the Middle East, are slugging it out for market share.As a result, cab rides can be ridiculously cheap just a few dollars to cross town.Photo How does the Egyptian government treat tech like social media and Western apps?With wariness and frequent hostility.Egyptian officials closely monitor Facebook, Twitter and other social media sites, and posting an irreverent comment can land a user in court or in jail.A young army conscript is serving a three-year sentence for posting a photo of Mr. Sisi with a pair of Mickey Mouse ears.Since May, the government has banned over 400 websites, including Human Rights Watch, the Egyptian news site Mada Masr and, bizarrely, Medium.Earlier this year, I discovered the security services were seeking access to real-time information about ride-sharing customers once known inside Uber as God View through the Uber and Careem apps.All told, its a pretty grim picture.Beyond your job, what tech product do you love using in your daily life right now and why?I love my Bose noise-canceling Bluetooth headphones, but the most satisfying tech product Ive started using is one that cancels out the rest.A smart little alarm clock by the French designer Philippe Tabet sits on my bedside table, and means that I no longer need my smartphone to wake me up.With the phone banished to another room, I cant mindlessly scroll Twitter or Instagram at 8 oclock in the morning, and I enjoy a tiny window of mental peace.If Times editors need me urgently, they can still call my land line.Sometimes, the old-fashioned tech is best.
Our Guide to the Holiday Season’s Biggest Video Games and Consoles:::::Its blockbuster season for video games.With the holiday season on its way, the games industry is pushing out a diverse lineup of titles, from new installments of long-running franchises like Activisions Call of Duty and Ubisofts Assassins Creed to EAs long-awaited Star Wars Battlefront II.But the real crowd pleasers this year may be in hardware.Microsoft and Nintendo are offering new or upgraded consoles after Sony rereleased its PlayStation 4 console and more powerful PS4 Pro last year.The hottest hardware ticket is Nintendos Switch console, which offers gamers the option of plugging in at home or pulling it off its dock to play on the go.Even though it was released eight months ago, the Switch is still so popular that supply is expected to be a problem at the end of the year.The arrival this week of Microsofts new Xbox One X console featuring more processing power and 4K resolution, which means more defined picture quality is also expected to make waves.The console supports hundreds of games from the Xbox back catalog, including all Xbox One titles, as well as select Xbox 360 titles.Advertisement Continue reading the main story All of this is expected to fuel spending on games, which rose 7 percent to $14 billion in the first half of the year from the same period in 2016, according to the NPD Group.I expect this growth to continue to edge up through the holidays, said Mat Piscatella, who analyzes the video games industry for NPD.
Add International Keyboards on an iPhone:::::Q.My new iPhone does not have a little globe key on the keyboard like Ive seen on other peoples Apple phones.Mine just has the happy face key.Why is this?A.Along with the smiling face and other emoji pictographs, the iPhone can display keyboard layouts for dozens of languages.When you add a new international keyboard, the happy face key used to insert emoji characters into text changes to the globe key.When you press and hold the globe key, a menu pops up to display your alternate keyboard choices including emoji.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story How Do You Use Tech?Advice and tips on the technology changing how you live.If you would like to add a keyboard designed for use with another language, you can do so in the iPhones keyboard settings.Tap open the Settings icon on the home screen, select General and then go to Keyboard.Then go to Keyboards and select Add New Keyboard.On the Add New Keyboard screen, scroll through the list and tap the language you want to use.(If you are using the keyboard in an app, you can also go right to the settings by pressing and holding the emoji key for a few seconds until a menu pops up with an option for Keyboard Settings.)When you return to using the iPhone keyboard in the Mail, the Notes or another text-heavy app, you should now see the globe key on the keyboard.Press and hold the globe icon for a second or two until the list of keyboards appears like the emoji set or the international keyboard you just added.Photo In addition to the Keyboard Settings shortcut (where you can adjust your preferences for auto-correction, predictive text and other typing-related tools), the pop-up menu includes icons you can use to switch to the one-handed keyboard that is part of iOS 11.When you select either the left- or the right-handed layout, the essential keys slide over to your chosen side of the screen to make typing with your thumb easier.
Microsoft Office Mobile Apps: Free or With a Fee:::::Q.Do you need a paid subscription to use the Microsoft Office mobile apps?I thought they were free for Android and iOS devices.A.The ability to use the Microsoft Office mobile apps without having to pay a subscription fee depends on the device you are using and what you want to do with the programs.The free touch-screen editions of Word, Excel and PowerPoint allow you to do basic tasks (like create a file and enter text into it) on most smaller tablets and phones.You do need to sign up for a free Microsoft account to use Microsoft Office Mobile for Android, or the iOS versions of Word, Excel and PowerPoint on an iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch.The files are stored on Microsofts OneDrive cloud server.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story How Do You Use Tech?Advice and tips on the technology changing how you live.However, if you have an iPad Pro, you get a full-feature version of the software for a free 30-day trial.After the trial ends, youd have to sign up for one of Microsofts Office 365 subscription plans.Prices start at $6.99 a month.Photo If you are working with the free versions of apps and want to unlock the rest of the editing features on an Android or iOS device, you also need to sign up for an Office 365 subscription.Once you convert to a paid plan, you can do things like track and review changes made to documents, insert page and section breaks, use more colors, make maps out of Excel data, and take advantage of all the tools included in the Office Mobile suite.A subscription for home or personal use does include other benefits, like one terabyte of OneDrive file storage, desktop applications and technical support.If the price is too steep for you, Apple iWork, Google Docs, Dropbox Paper and Zohos office apps are among the free or inexpensive alternatives.
Slowing iPhone Battery Drain:::::Q.Why does the iPhone battery drain so much?I have an iPhone 6 and consider myself a normal user of the iPhone.I have gone to Apples website and done everything suggested to slow the drain, but sometimes by 6 p.m. Im down below 50 percent.What else can I do?A.Battery drain can be caused by a number of factors, including the age of the battery itself.The iPhone 6 was released in 2014, and if you purchased the device around that time and have been using it regularly for three years, the battery may be losing its ability to hold a charge.Having an authorized service provider replace the battery or investing in an external battery are two options for a failing power cell.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story How Do You Use Tech?Advice and tips on the technology changing how you live.If you purchased the iPhone 6 more recently and have been regularly upgrading its operating system as Apple produces fresh versions each year your phones hardware may not be able to use the latest iOS releases as effectively as the faster processors in newer iPhones.Complaints about lousy battery life often dog new iOS versions, which in turn lead to incremental updates from Apple that are intended to provide bug fixes and improvements.Apple released a significant update to the operating system on Oct. 31, so if you have not installed it yet, upgrading to iOS 11.1 might ease some of the power-sapping issues.This iOS 11.1 update also adds dozens of new emoji characters and corrects a few performance issues.Keeping your apps updated may improve things, too.Photo You can see which apps and services are using the most power by opening the Settings app and selecting Battery; the information is listed under Battery Usage.Turning on Low Power Mode and turning off power-hungry features like Background App Refresh, Hey Siri and Location Services (when not needed) can also help.

the d-pad acts as face functions on the left controller.So far we've seen 2K's NBA series, Snipper Clips and Mario Kart being used this way for local multiplayer in both docked and tablet modes.So you get multiplayer functionality straight out of the box with no additional purchase required.However, if you want to play four-player games, then you're going to need to invest in an extra pair of Joy-Con controllers or some Pro controllers.We'd buy the Joy-Cons as a pair (see our comparison chart above) as you'll save a bit of cash over buying them separately.Better yet, if your friends own a Switch, ask them to bring their controllers to the party!The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild deals The reviews have heaped huge praise upon this eagerly awaited launch title, making it an essential purchase for any Nintendo Switch buyer.As with any new console, the prices of the big games can be more expensive than usual.We've shopped around for you though and have found the best prices for The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild on the Nintendo Switch.Take a look below.Nintendo Switch Micro SD memory card deals With only 32GB of internal storage, you'll be wanting to pick up a cheap memory card or two for your new Nintendo Switch for any digital purchases or the inevitable game-fixing patches.Don't fret though, they're actually surprisingly cheap, with even 64GB ones coming in at under 20/$25.What memory cards does the Nintendo Switch need?Those will be Micro SD cards also known as, depending on their size, as MicroSDHC (up to 32GB) or MicroSDXC (up to a huge 2TB soon).Nintendo will be releasing their own branded cards, but you'll be paying more, just for a label.So for now, we'd take a look at this range of cheap MicroSDXC Nintendo Switch-friendly cards.
Disney says its streaming service is going to cost less than Netflix:::::How much would you pay for a streaming service from Disney?According to the company's CEO, Robert A. Iger, subscriptions will cost less than the equivalent Netflix packages - though it's also going to have less content on offer, at least to begin with."I can say that our plan on the Disney side is to price this substantially below where Netflix is," said Iger on an earnings call, Engadget reports."It'll have a lot of high quality because of the brands and the franchises that will be on it that we've talked about.But it'll simply launch with less volume, and the price will reflect that."You can currently sign up for a new Netflix subscription from $7.99 or 5.99 a month, though the top end plan with HD and 4K will set you back $13.99 or 9.99 a month.Exactly where Disney will fall remains to be seen.Studio wars Given the huge success of Netflix, content creators like Disney have come around to the idea of launching their own services - it means more money for the studios but more of a headache for consumers who have to sign up for multiple subscriptions.With production companies now wanting to protect their own material and squeeze as much money out of it as possible, it's no surprise that Netflix is focusing even more on original shows - it plans to spend $7 billion on new content in 2018, up from the $6 billion the company spent in 2017.Disney has pencilled in 2019 as the launch date for its new service and in the meantime is starting to pull its content off Netflix.At least when it does arrive on the scene, it might not cost you all that much extra.

much they cost too.BT Sport Pack on Sky | 12 months | 20 activation | 25.99pm Unless you have BT broadband, this is the cheapest way Sky TV customers can get BT Sport on their TV.This BT Sport package

you want to avoid that pixelated vaseline look (Snobs?Us?)then this BT Sport deal deal gives you the range of channels in shiny high-definition.The BT Sport deal starts at 25.99 a month for the first three months, then it'll be 30.99 for the remaining nine months of the contract.On the plus side, that's only a fiver more a month than the standard definition package - you wouldn't even get two

The jet age is over – here comes supersonic, hyper-mach travel:::::Who wants to fly for 19 hours?In March 2018, Singapore Airlines will begin a 19-hour direct service from Singapore to New York aboard a new ultra long-range Airbus A350-900ULR.Meanwhile.Qantas has challenged the aviation industry to develop by 2022 aircraft that can fly for three or four hours longer, therefore making it possible to fly non-stop from Sydney to London.That's technically impressive, perhaps but what about making journeys shorter, not longer?Commercial aviation has lacked an aircraft capable of exceeding the speed of sound since the 2003 retirement of Concorde, which first flew in 1969 and could travel at twice the speed of sound.Concorde was the pinnacle of aviation achievement, able to fly from New York to London in under three hours, but it firmly belonged to the 20th century.Now its time for 21st century technology to take over.Several supersonic planes are now on the drawing board that will fly faster than the speed of sound.Sixty years after the dawn of the jet age, were still flying at 1960s speeds, says Blake Scholl, chief executive officer and founder of Boom, one of the companies planning a supersonic plane.Concordes designers didnt have the technology for affordable supersonic travel, but now we do.Seventy years after Chuck Yeager broke the sound barrier in the Bell X-1, the hyper-mach era could be close.
OnePlus 5T release date, news and rumors:::::Update: OnePlus has confirmed that the 5T won't support wireless charging.We've also had word from a source that the OnePlus 5T will cost the same as the OnePlus 5.You can read the full story here, or scroll down further for everything else we know about the phone.Sitting safely in the top ten of our favorite smartphones right now, the OnePlus 5 is one of the best phones you can buy at the moment... but that said, in some markets it's currently off sale.On the official OnePlus website you can no longer buy the OnePlus 5, which is particularly strange as the handset is less than six months old.Why would OnePlus drop the phone from its range so early?The answer now seems clear, as OnePlus has confirmed that the OnePlus 5T is on the way.This doesn't come as much of a surprise, since last year the company revealed the OnePlus 3 in June followed by a new replacement handset called the OnePlus 3T in November 2016.Rumors and leaks are revealing much about the upcoming phone, so here's everything we've seen so far about the OnePlus 5T.Cut to the chase What is it?A new flagship phone from OnePlus A new flagship phone from OnePlus When is it out?November 16 launch, November 21 release November 16 launch, November 21 release What will it cost?Likely the same as the OnePlus 5 at $479 (449, around AU$630) Confirmed for a November 16 launch, November 21 release Likely to cost less than most flagships We expect it to be priced at $479 (449, AU$630) for the cheapest version There's still a lot that we don't know about the 5T, but the "where" and "when" we'll first be able to see the phone ourselves is clear as day.We've received an invite for a launch event in Brooklyn, NY on November 16.And guess what, so have you!If you're able, you can spend around $40 to attend the event to check out the phone yourself.Guess which city we're going to party in for the #OnePlus5T launch!pic.twitter.com/su68h87kQSNovember 5, 2017 We now also have a clear sign of how much the OnePlus 5T is going to cost, and it looks like there won't be a price jump from the launch of the OnePlus 5.TechRadar has seen a document that shows the price of buying the OnePlus 5T through a business on O2's network in the UK.The price listed is the same as it cost for the OnePlus 5, heavily suggesting it'll stay the same for consumers too.That's obviously only pricing information for the UK, but it would be strange for the company to then raise the price in other territories.Those documents also suggest there will be a 64GB version of the phone, which will likely cost $479 (449, AU$599) and a 128GB variant at $539 (499, AU$699).That's some very good news if you were hoping the price of the phone wouldn't increase.Further to our information, OnePlus CEO Pete Lau has also alluded to a similar price for the new phone too.OnePlus 5T design and screen Similar design to the OnePlus 5, but larger screen Rumored 6-inch display with an 18:9 ratio Currently uncertain on the screen resolution though Rumors for the OnePlus 5T are starting to ramp up speed, but the most information we've seen so far has come from one source known to GizmoChina.The site is confident in the anonymous source and the leak is quite extensive, suggesting the phone will come with a 2160 x 1080 resolution, 18:9 ratio 6-inch display.That would make the OnePlus 5T look a lot like the Samsung Galaxy S8, iPhone X and LG V30 that we've already seen launch this year.The render below is supplied by the same source and shows how the 5T has super thin bezels.The source can't currently confirm whether it will have curved screen edges or not and there's no sign of what the phone looks like from the rear.Source: GizmoChina It's also important to note that this render looks identical to the Oppo F5 that leaked previously, but the source is adamant this is the OnePlus 5T and that it will look the same as the phone from OnePlus's parent company Oppo.Another image has also leaked out, this time a lower quality render showing the handset in black, sporting a seemingly identical design to the picture above.Credit: Slashleaks And hang on... what have we here?Yet another rendering recently leaked out to the web (below), showing some shrunken down bezels and a fingerprint sensor around the back of the device.Again the source is GizmoChina, so most of these leaks seem to be coming from the same place.However, we've also now seen what appears to be a live photo of the phone, and it shows the same design, with slim bezels above and below the display.Arrived in Paris, here at the #PGW playing Vainglory on @oneplus phone with @FNATIC!Come play with us if you are here!pic.twitter.com/nqVrWVMQ0mNovember 2, 2017 Another leaked teaser was provided to Android Authority that shows a dark and gloomy image of the phone.You can tell it's a OnePlus device because of the Never Settle tagline on the screen, but it doesn't show much we didn't already know.Image credit: Android Authority This further hammers home the rumors of a full-screen display and much slimmer bezels, but apart from that there's not much more revealed in this OnePlus 5T teaser.Not one to be left out, prolific Twitter leaker @evleaks has also revealed the OnePlus 5T name and a shot of what appears to be the top half of the handset, complete with some slender looking bezels - potentially cutting the blank space above and below the space in half from the OnePlus 5.Top-half of OnePlus 5T (2.5t?Ha).pic.twitter.com/pmfhdQSgWQOctober 30, 2017 OnePlus has also officially revealed that it will be keeping the 3.5mm headphone jack on the OnePlus 5T, prior to which a tweet from the company account had heavily hinted at the legacy tech sticking around, so you'll be able to use your current wired headsets with the phone.OnePlus 5T camera New camera sensors rumored to be two 20MP sensors working together Upgraded Portrait mode has been teased by the CEO of OnePlus With a number of leaks also suggesting there will be two 20MP sensors on the back of the OnePlus 5T, the co-founder of OnePlus Carl Pei has also tweeted some images that look to be taken with the phone's rear camera.You can see one below that likely shows the portrait mode on the OnePlus 5T while we have also seen Pei tease the camera in further shots and OnePlus CEO Pete Lau has done a similar thing too."What phone is he taking that photo with?..."pic.twitter.com/PZMIEP1gkvOctober 30, 2017 OnePlus 5T specs and battery Likely packs the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 with lots of RAM Largely similar specs to what we saw on the OnePlus 5 No wireless charging There isn't an upgrade to the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 chipset found inside the OnePlus 5, so we can safely assume the company will decide to include that same setup with 6GB or 8GB of RAM inside the OnePlus 5T.Our source that gave us the pricing information at the top of this page also suggests the phone will come in either 64GB or 128GB storage sizes.That likely means we won't see a 256GB variant.All those specs are backed up by a major leak of details just a few days before the phone's official unveiling.There's also no official word on whether the phone will come with microSD support, but it's not something OnePlus usually supports.OnePlus may also upgrade the battery on the OnePlus 5T to power that new screen with an AnTuTu benchmark spotted by GizChina saying it be a 3,450mAh cell (compared to the 3,300mAh one in the OnePlus 5).However, one thing the company definitely won't be doing is adding wireless charging support, as it's said it believes its wired Dash Charger is a superior option.
The best Amazon Black Friday deals 2017:::::With another Black Friday fast approaching, we've pulled together the very best discounts on tech from Amazon on this page, so you can refer to them quickly and get a head start on other shoppers.Amazon usually has some of the very best Black Friday deals, and this year should be no different.You don't have to spend ages searching around the site yourself (though feel free if that's what you'd prefer), because we're prepared to bring together all the must-see deals for your bargain-hunting pleasure.Whether you need a smart assistant for the living room, an upgrade on your ailing mobile phone , or a wearable to track your fitness over Christmas and into the new year, you're sure to find something of interest in our Amazon Black Friday 2017 round-up.When do the Amazon Black Friday deals start?While Black Friday itself is on November 24, Amazon has officially announced the dates for its full Black Friday event, and we hope you're sitting down for this, because it's a long one.This year, Amazon's Black Friday deals season is lasting a whopping 10 days, starting at midnight on Friday November 17, running through until Sunday November 26.That means there will be 10 days of 'Deals of the Day'.These deals will last for the whole day - or as long as stock does.What sounds really good though is that these Deals of the Day won't be replicated on different days and they won't be reduced further on subsequent days.So if you spot a Deal of the Day that looks like a great price in the days before Black Friday, you won't have to worry about Amazon selling it for less on Black Friday itself.Anything to cut down on buyer's remorse is good in our books!Of course, there's nothing to stop a different retailer charging less, but Amazon are going to be super competitive this year.And if anyone can afford to undercut the competition, it's Amazon.What's more, you'll have thousands of 'Lightning Deals' to pick from, if you can move quickly enough: this year Amazon is upgrading them from four hours to six, though the super hot ones usually go within an hour - hopefully Amazon has its warehouses well stocked.Both the Lightning Deals and Deals of the Day will cover a huge variety of items.Thankfully, you'll be able to apply filters to only see content relevant to you.Here at TechRadar we'll be calling out some of our favorite Deals of the Day right here on this page.We're expecting great Amazon deals on gaming consoles, TVs, laptops, games, Blu-ray box sets, cameras, electric toothbrushes, Philips Hue and more must-have items.Naturally, we're hoping to bag a few bargains ourselves.Amazon Prime and Black Friday If you're already a member of the Amazon Prime subscription club, you've already got a head start on everyone else for Black Friday; if not, it's something worth considering ahead of time.So, for instance, you're going to get a half-hour head start on some of the Lightning Deals on Amazon that don't stick around for long.You might also get extra discounts on prices that have dropped already, or you might get deals that don't apply to non-Prime members throughout the course of the day.We're not sure exactly what Amazon will do when Black Friday arrives, but it's a good bet that you're going to be at an advantage if you've signed up for Amazon Prime , whether that's through nabbing exclusive deals or through getting at the deals before anyone else.At the moment a subscription costs you 79 (or $99) a year, or slightly more if you go month-to-month, and of course there are a host of other benefits besides improved access to the Black Friday deals.Amazon even runs its own deals day called Amazon Prime Day - exclusively for Prime members every summer.Included in your benefits are Amazon Prime Video, Amazon Prime Music, plenty of cloud storage for your photos, faster (usually free next day) delivery times throughout the year, and more besides.If you don't have a membership, why not sign up for a free Amazon Prime 30-day trial and enjoy the full benefits during the Black Friday shopping season?Amazon Lightning Deals Amazon loves its Lightning Deals: as the name suggests, these are very short-lived offers that usually involve items where the stock is low, so if you don't jump in when you've got the chance, you might miss out.Lightning Deals don't stick around for long and as mentioned earlier, they'll only be around for up to six hours.You can often pick up some very tasty discounts though.To quote straight from Amazon, a Lightning Deal is "a promotion in which a limited number of discounts are offered on an item for a short period of time", and the easiest way to find them is to click through on Today's Deals page.Don't forget that Prime members get early access to the Lightning Deals on Amazon, so it might be worth you signing up if you haven't already.Black Friday deal predictions We're still over a week away from this year's Black Friday sale, but you can make some pretty good educated guesses as to what may possibly get a discount based on a) what else is on sale throughout the year and b) what's been on sale during previous events.While we've picked out our favourite historical deals a little further down the page, you can almost certainly guarantee that Amazon's own line of products including the Echo and Echo Dot speakers, Fire stick, Fire tablets and Kindle e-Readers.Also, if you're a Prime member, it's worth keeping an eye on the Early Access deals that are on offer, with a wide variety of items from wearable tech to homeware on offer.As for odds-on deals, expect to see the Xbox One and PS4 heavily discounted, massive savings on Blu-rays and computer accessories.Amazon Black Friday deals Ahead of Black Friday 2017, here are the best deals we saw during Black Friday 2016, just to whet your appetite for this year's extravaganza.PS4 Black Friday deals - we didn't have the supercharged PS4 Pro to drool over last year but we did have the original console on sale for under 200 with two games, plus the 500GB edition, with Lego Star Wars and The Force Awakens Blu-ray, for 229.99.More recently Sony has been offering the Pro version of the console together with Horizon Zero Dawn for a mere 349.99.Xbox One/One S Black Friday deals - last year the Xbox One X was just a rumour, but Amazon treated buyers to the 500GB Xbox One S plus Minecraft plus Forza Horizon 3 for 199.99.Xbox Live 12 Month Gold memberships were going for 24.99 apiece too.Since the last Black Friday we've also seen the same 199.99 price attached to an Xbox One S bundle that includes Forza Horizon 3 and Destiny 2.Computing Black Friday deals - there were a host of computing deals last year, including 200 off the ASUS Flip UX360UA 13.3-inch Touchscreen Zenbook Notebook (down to 599.99) and a very capable HP Slimline 410-135na Desktop machine for just 329.99.More recently, Amazon has been seen knocking 180 off its Vibox Vision 2SXLW Gaming PCs, putting them down to 639.95 with free delivery.If you want a gaming rig at a low price, it's well worth checking out.Audio Black Friday deals - audiophiles were certainly spoiled during Black Friday 2016, with more than 50% off the Sennheiser HD 598 headphones, down from 199.99 to 89 on the day, and the Sonos Play:1 smart wireless speaker down to 138 from 169.Another great deal we saw recently on Amazon was 55 knocked off the Sony MDR-ZX770BN wireless and noise-cancelling headphones - which means you could pick them up for just 95.For some high-fidelity home entertainment, we've also seen the Denon RCDM40DAB receiver down to 179, a tempting reduction of 70.Camera Black Friday deals - those after a discounted camera during Black Friday 2016 could've gone for the Canon EOS M3 and lens, available for 409 rather than 479.99, or the GoPro HERO Session Bonus Bundle Action Camera, down to 149 from 200.97.The Canon EOS 200D was recently reduced from 679.99 to a mere 549.00 which is an incredible discount and a whopping saving of 130.99.Phone Black Friday deals - we saw a lot of great deals covering smartphones last year, including the excellent Wileyfox Swift 2 , discounted from 174.99 to 119.99, and a significant 180 drop for the Sony Xperia X , down from 499.99 to 319.99 on the site.Another fine deal we spotted recently was 60.99 off the Blu Vivo 5R, a reduction of more than a third, which meant you could get it for 109.Smart Home Black Friday deals - smart home enthusiasts had plenty to tempt them with 30% off the Netatmo Smart Thermostat on Amazon on Black Friday 2016, down to just 99.99 from 142.37, and up to 40% off various bits of Philips Hue lighting kit as well.Television Black Friday deals - plenty of bargain hunters picked up a smart TV last year.You could, for example, have got yourself a Panasonic TX-40DX600B 40-inch TV for 429 instead of 549.99, or a Sony Bravia KD49XD7004BU 49-inch TV for 550 instead of 799.Wearable Black Friday deals - smartwatches and fitness trackers were a big part of Black Friday 2016 too, with 50 off the Fitbit Blaze in gunmetal, for instance, knocked down from 179.99 to 129.99, and up to 40% off various Withings activity trackers during the day.Amazon on Black Friday 2017: what you need to know Amazon might have its own in-house discount day of sales for Prime members, but that doesn't stop it going all-in when it comes to Black Friday, and there aren't many retailers who can match it for the breath or size of its discounts.If you want to find the biggest discounts on Black Friday, be sure to check in on Amazon.Thanks to Amazon's rather cluttered interface though, it's not always easy to get to the many great deals on offer - and hopefully, that's where we can help out.On this page we'll be highlighting the best offers for you to save you a lot of clicking and scrolling around.We've been given a sneak preview of some of the Black Friday 2017 discounts that Amazon's planning, and while we can't share them with you yet, there are some treats in store -

Huge OnePlus 5T leak reveals everything you could want to know:::::The OnePlus 5T is officially scheduled for its grand arrival on November 16, but thanks to a hands-on post that hit the web this weekend, we now know pretty much everything there is to know about the phone in advance.Courtesy of an unboxing article that went up on ZDNet.de and has since been pulled, we know the specs are almost identical to the OnePlus 5: a Snapdragon 835 and Adreno 540 GPU, 6GB or 8GB of RAM, and 64GB or 128GB of internal storage.You get a dual 16MP camera on the back, and a single one on the front, just like its predecessor.As leaks go it's pretty comprehensive, but we'd already heard a lot of this information from previous leaks.It's very much a minor upgrade for OnePlus this time around, which you would expect from a "T" variant anyway.Stretch that screen The biggest difference from the OnePlus 5 is the screen, which gets stretched to a 6-inch, 1,080 x 2,160 pixel display at an 18:9 aspect ratio.The OnePlus 5T also ditches most of the bezel margins, like many a flagship in 2017.The fingerprint sensor moves to the back.As we revealed a couple of days ago, the device won't have wireless charging built in (OnePlus thinks its own Dash Charge is superior), and we've also been able to verify that the phone is going to go on sale at the same price as the OnePlus 5, at least in the UK.That means you're looking at a starting price of around $479, 449 or AU$599.Oh, and there is a headphone jack, as well as a USB-C port, so you can use your existing headphones with the device.Be sure to check in next Thursday when we'll bring you everything OnePlus has to say about the phone.Via Android Police

Uber loses in London again in its battle over driver rights:::::Uber's not having the best of times in London at the moment: today it lost its appeal over a decision on driver classification.An employment tribunal has upheld a decision made last year drivers are not self-employed but must be treated as workers employed by Uber.That means drivers are entitled to workers' rights, including the minimum wage, holiday pay, and paid rest breaks, which they wouldn't get if they were classed as self-employed.Uber says it's going to appeal again, possibly in the Supreme Court.One of the drivers at the centre of the case welcomed the decision: "I'd like Uber to sit down and work out how as quickly as possible that every driver who is working for Uber get the rights they are entitled to," James Farrar told the BBC.More appeals Uber, on the other hand, says drivers prefer the flexibility of being self-employed."Almost all taxi and private hire drivers have been self-employed for decades, long before our app existed," Tom Elvidge, Uber UK's acting general manager, told The Guardian, emphasising the improvements the company has made with illness and accident cover for drivers.The decision comes as Uber battles to keep on operating in London in any capacity at all - it's currently working through an appeal against a ban put in place by Transport for London, over concerns about crime reporting and background checks for drivers.Both the London ban and driver right issues have a while to play out yet, but these decisions are likely to go way beyond the 50,000 Uber drivers currently working in the UK - any legal rulings will have repercussions for all the up-and-coming services based on a flexible, freelance workforce, including the likes of Deliveroo.
Volvo XC60: sleek, sophisticated and safe:::::In recent years Volvo has managed to dust off its rather dull image and, released from the shackles of Ford ownership, has acquired a new design swagger and confidence and nowhere is this more in evidence than with the new XC60.The XC60 is an incredibly important car for the Swedish brand, with the first-generation model having been Volvo's best-selling car of recent years and the top-selling mid-sized SUV across Europe.Now, though, premium rivals from Audi, BMW and Mercedes, and most recently Jaguar, are muscling in on the act, so this second-generation XC60 needs to be pretty special.Scandi chic We drove Volvo XC60 D4 AWD Inscription Pro Engine: 2.0-litre 4-cylinder diesel Power output: 190bhp Max speed: 127mph 0-62mph: 8.4 seconds Price: from 37,205 (model as tested: 55,755) The XC60 is certainly a handsome-looking car, and we reckon Volvo has got the balance just right it's not as brash as an Audi Q5 or BMW X3, but it's sophisticated enough to stand out from the crowd, with some nice little touches like the 'Thor's Hammer' daytime running light arrangement.Volvo clearly hasn't spent all of its design budget on the exterior climb inside the XC60 and you're cocooned in a welcoming mix of matte woods and light colours.The quality of finish is superb.The clean, minimalist look is thanks in part to the large 9-inch touchscreen interface in the middle of the dash.Rather than orienting the display horizontally, Volvo has opted for a vertical positioning specifically for navigation; it reckons we want to see where we're heading, not what's either side of us, and when you put it like that it makes a lot of sense.The navigation system works a treat, but it's the overall user experience of the touchscreen interface that impresses.It's your window to pretty much every facet of the XC60's entertainment, convenience and safety functions, and it's very intuitive to use.The XC60 also offers plenty of connectivity.There are Apple CarPlay and Android Auto options, and two USB connectors, while it's possible to stream music through Spotify or use other entertainment and info apps.Image 1 of 9 Image 2 of 9 Image 3 of 9 Image 4 of 9 Image 5 of 9 Image 6 of 9 Image 7 of 9 Image 8 of 9 Image 9 of 9 There's a customizable 8-inch digital instrument display up front (our Inscription Pro model featured an even larger 12.3-inch display), which can also relay a version of the satnav, as well as road sign info and distance alerts.Our test car also came with an optional (750) heads-up display, which can project a similar array of information just below your line of sight; we found this incredibly useful, and rarely needed to glance down at the digital instrument display.Our XC60 was also equipped with a Bowers & Wilkins 15-speaker sound system that kicked out 1,100 watts.It's a pricey optional extra at 2,500, but the sound quality is breathtaking if you love classical music you'll love the fact that the system has been designed to replicate the sound as if you were sitting in the central seat of the Gothenburg Concert Hall, as well as a recording studio or stage.World-class safety tech Volvo built its reputation on safety, pioneering numerous features that are now standard on most cars, and it continues to burnish those credentials with the XC60.This is a car packed with features designed to keep you safe, including three technologies that are new for a mid-size SUV.First up is Steer Assist, which automatically provides steering input in an emergency to help avoid a collision.Next is Oncoming Lane Mitigation, which is designed to prevent head-on collisions, while the third is the optional Blind Spot Information System with Steer Assist, which automatically applies the steering to bring the car back into its own lane and away from any vehicles that might be in your blind spot.Clever stuff.Designed to make long motorway journeys a bit less tiring, the tech uses a forward-facing camera and radar to detect your lane and any vehicles in front Our car was also kitted out with Volvo's semi-autonomous Pilot Assist drive technology.Designed to make long motorway journeys a bit less tiring, the tech uses a forward-facing camera and radar to detect your lane and any vehicles in front.Set the desired cruising speed and the system will then assist with the steering (up to 80mph), while taking care of the brakes and accelerator.We tested it out on a pretty windy dual carriageway, and it worked a treat.It's a little unnerving at first, but once you've got over that initial fear and put your faith in the tech, it's brilliant.With just a couple of fingers resting on the steering wheel the XC60 happily cruised along, inputting turns into the steering wheel while slowing and braking with the flow of traffic, and even coming to a near-complete stop when necessary.On the road Every XC60 model comes with all-wheel drive, but our car was also equipped with electronically controlled air suspension this enables automatic lowering at high speeds to improve aerodynamics, while the ground clearance can be increased by over 40mm when driving off-road.While the extra grunt of the 235bhp D5 model might be tempting for some, our 190bhp D4 delivered a responsive and assured ride.There are four selectable drive modes that adjust engine responsiveness and the height of the car, while individual settings allow you to tailor each element to your liking.Verdict This latest XC60 embodies Volvo's core principles of practicality and safety, and builds on those with a sleek, sophisticated body that's complemented by a luxurious interior.Add a large dollop of advanced tech, and the XC60 is a hugely impressive SUV.
New patent reveals the redesigned curves of LG's upcoming VR headset:::::LG is building a rival to the Oculus Rift and the HTC Vive: we've seen a prototype in action, we think it's going to be called the LG UltraGear, and now a leaked patent has given us a fresh look at how the finished device is actually going to look.Courtesy of Dutch site LetsGoDigital, the patent shows a design that's been tweaked from the original prototype version we saw earlier this year.One of the biggest changes is that the headset can be opened at the front, so the eyepieces split apart - presumably to make it easier to take a break from the immersive world of VR.There are also integrated earbuds built into the headset for your audio needs.One of the sketches shows a user still listening to music with the split headset resting around his neck.A dial at the back is used for tightening and loosening the device.We've had confirmation that the headset is going to support SteamVR games, so there should be plenty of content available when it sees the light of day.If it's going to stand a chance it's also going to need to be priced fairly competitively.Based on the prototype, it will have the edge over its rivals in terms of specs, with a 1,440 x 1,280 pixel resolution per eye.On top of that it's offering a 110-degree field of view, and a refresh rate of 90Hz - though all those details are subject to change.Like the Vive and Rift, it needs to be tethered to a Windows 10 PC.What we don't know yet is when we might see the finished version of the LG UltraGear, if that is to be its name.CES 2018 seems like a smart bet, and as soon as LG has anything official to share, we'll report back.
BlackBerry Motion UK release date is November 17:::::The latest BlackBerry smartphone is heading to the UK very soon, without a physical keyboard.The BlackBerry Motion has already arrived in other countries and TechRadar has been hands on with the phone in the Middle East, but now you'll be able to get your hands on it too.However, unlike the BlackBerry Priv and BlackBerry KeyOne, the Motion does not have the brand's famous physical keyboard.Rather, it sports a 5.5-inch full HD display with a home button below it with a built-in fingerprint scanner.It also boasts a large 4,000mAh battery which BlackBerry claims can last two days on a single charge, and the Motion is the first BlackBerry branded device to come with a IP67 dust and water resistant metal body.On top of this, the Motion packs in a Snapdragon 625 chipset, 4GB of RAM, 32GB of internal storage, 12MP rear camera, 8MP front camera and Android 7.1.Privacy for your privates A new security feature BlackBerry has brought to the Motion is Locker mode, which can be found in the camera app.It allows you to take secure photos by tapping your finger on the fingerprint scanner, rather than the on-screen shutter key.Shots taken with your fingerprint are then saved in a locked folder that does not back up to the cloud or any other accounts, ensuring all your *ahem* candid shots remain private.The BlackBerry Motion release date is expect to be November 17 at Carphone Warehouse, but it's also available from John Lewis, Argos and Amazon.The Motion price was confirmed as 399 when pre-orders went live as well.
The best Samsung Galaxy Note 8 deals pre-Black Friday 2017:::::The new Samsung Galaxy Note 8 certainly has a point to prove and it's now available buy.It's never going to be your go-to option if you're on a tight budget, but it's got the screen size and specification smarts to be a competitor to the much lauded iPhone X.And the price has just fallen - drastically.If you're among the number baying for a Note 8 deal, you've come to the right place.Deals are now available from all the major retailers and networks - check out our price comparison tool below for the best prices.Plus, we've picked out five of our favourite deals and tell you more about this mammoth mobile.It might seem a tad unfair, but we can't not mention the Galaxy Note 7 debacle when talking about its successor.Samsung's 2016 aborted project due to overheating and fire risks means that we've had to wait two years for a fully functioning Note-branded phablet from the South Korean tech behemoth.But we can now move forward from that chapter in tech history.But prices started high and haven't fallen much since.So if you're after a bargain, it might worth waiting for Black Friday 2017.See also: Galaxy Note S8 deals | iPhone X deals | Mobile phone deals | SIM only deals | Samsung Galaxy Note 8 review The best Galaxy Note 8 deals in the UK Samsung Galaxy Note 8 | 150 upfront (with 10OFF code) | 12GB data | Unlimited minutes and texts | 37pm Well this came from nowhere, like a bolt from the blue - the blue network that is, this is a killer O2 deal.The price is the lowest we've seen anyway, but then consider that you get a massive 12GB of data to play with as well.An utterly exceptional deal from Mobiles.co.uk.Total cost over 24 months is 1038 View this deal at Mobiles.co.uk Samsung Galaxy Note 8 | 119 upfront | 8GB data | Unlimited minutes and texts | 42.99pm Well nothing comes even close to that O2 deal at the moment.But this is the one to go for if you're tempted by the UK's fastest 4G network.8GB is a very healthy amount of data to keep you streaming and surfing away from the home and office Wi-Fi and it's a decent balance between upfront cost.Good, just not as good as the O2 tariff..

The latest iPhone X problem is a bright green line on the side of the display:::::Well, this isn't good - after squashing a few software bugs, admitting that performance isn't great in cold weather, and warning users that some burn-in is to be expected on the new iPhone X, the latest issue Apple has to deal with is a bright green line appearing down the side of some users' handsets.All par for the course for a company launching a premium smartphone these days it would seem - the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL have had their fair share of problems too - but at least this particular issue seems to be limited in terms of the number of people affected.9to5Mac reports that complaints about the mysterious green line first surfaced last weekend and there are currently a total of 35 people (and rising) who've logged the issue with Apple - not a huge number in terms of the millions of handsets Apple is shifting, but it's not what you want from your brand new flagship phone.My new #iPhoneX appears a green line on the screen, and the faceID cant recognize me when I with glasses.@Apple @AppleSupport pic.twitter.com/Fgj5fg9v2xNovember 6, 2017 Looking at the photos posted to Twitter, this does seem like a genuine issue, albeit one that most users haven't come across.Right now Apple hasn't offered any solutions for a fix, bar sending your new iPhone X back for a replacement.For many months now rumors have been swirling that Apple only just got the iPhone X ready in time for the end of 2017, and that the phone will be in short supply for months to come.For its part, Apple has promised that it hasn't cut any production corners in its efforts to get the tenth anniversary iPhone out to the masses.For now this looks like a minor bug on a select number of handsets - bad luck if yours is one of them.If Apple acknowledges the issue, or we see more reports of the dreaded green line, we'll let you know here.
Best movies on Netflix UK (November 2017): 150 films to choose from:::::UPDATE: The superb La La Land has been added to our best movies on Netflix UK list.A throwback to the MGM musicals of old, it's filled with catchy tunes, some wonderful foot work and superb central performances from Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling.It's a movie that was well worthy of its Best Film Oscar... which it controversially received then lost in a matter of minutes.Netflix UK has a lot of movies on offer, but if you only have time for the best then you're in the right place.Here you'll find a list of the best Netflix movies you can get in the UK right now and it's constantly updated so you know you're never missing out.Netflix has become known for its TV shows (especially its originals) but that doesn't mean you should be discounting the movies on the platform.Many of them are well worth watching and as you'll see from our extensive list, there are plenty to choose from once you've exhausted yourself by TV binge-watching.To keep things neat, tidy and easy to navigate, we've broken up our movie picks into categories.For each category we've chosen a selection of movies that you shouldn't miss with further recommendations listed at the end of each category.In all there's over 150 movies to choose from here, all picked because they are, simply, the best films on Netflix to watch right now.From comedy to indie, to horror and kids, there's a movie category for everyone.Keep checking back, too.Unlike its TV output that seems to stay on Netflix for longer, its movies tend to appear and disappear quite fast.We keep this best Netflix movies list updated as often as we can, so please bookmark us.Enjoy!
Your iPhone X screen may slow down in cold weather, but a fix is coming:::::Little over 24 hours after a report on Reddit noting that an iPhone X started to become unresponsive when used in cold weather, Apple has already acknowledged the issue and says it's working on a fix.Darus 214 on Reddit was the first to raise the issue, claiming that as soon as he walks outside into cold temperatures the screen starts to become unresponsive, which meant he isn't able to swipe on websites and it doesn't recognize his finger easily.Considering that's the main way of interacting with the iPhone X, this can get very frustrating.Apple has issued a statement to Loop In Sight that says it has already heard the reports of the issue, but that it's often the case that the screen unresponsiveness stops on its own after a few moments.That said, the company is still working on a software update that it hopes will tackle the issue altogether.Exactly how a software update will tackle this issue remains to be seen as a problem with the screen freezing suggests it may be a hardware fault instead.Working on a fix Apple said: We are aware of instances where the iPhone X screen will become temporarily unresponsive to touch after a rapid change to a cold environment.After several seconds the screen will become fully responsive again.This will be addressed in an upcoming software update.Apple also has some guidance on using iOS devices in low or high conditions and recommends keeping it at an ambient temperature of between 0C and 35C.A post on the Apple website from September states, "Using an iOS device in very cold conditions outside of its operating range might temporarily shorten battery life and could cause the device to turn off."Battery life will return to normal when you bring the device back to higher ambient temperatures."Basically, you shouldn't be using your iPhone in either very cold or really hot conditions, and that's usually the case for most phones in 2017.Hopefully this iPhone X software update should help fix it for those users who need to use their phone in the cold.Via BGR
This Flying Spaghetti Monster colander makes pasta perfect:::::Enlarge Image Ototo Design Pasta is so much more fun to eat when the Flying Spaghetti Monster helps out in the kitchen.The fictional deity is the subject of an appropriately themed colander, letting you recreate the internet icon in real life as part of your dinner.Not familiar with this spaghetti creature?It and the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster were created to mock those who oppose teaching evolution in schools.The Flying Spaghetti Monster was first mentioned in a satirical letter written by Bobby Henderson in 2005 to protest the Kansas State Board of Education decision to permit teaching intelligent design as an alternative to evolution in public school science classes.Since then, the Flying Spaghetti Monster has become a rallying figure for those who oppose intelligent design and creationism replacing science in schools.This Flying Spaghetti Monster colander is designed by Lior Rokah Kor for the Israel-based company Ototo Design.The yellow plastic strainer measures 7.6 by 12 by 8.6 inches (19.5 by 31 by 22 cm) for the monster's body and two eyes on either side that also serve as handles.This creative colander retails for $18 (roughly 14, AU$23).This colander is a great conversation piece for any pasta party.Or better yet, take it to your school's next potluck fundraiser to remind everyone about the power of satire, science and a scrumptious pasta meal.
Microsoft CEO tells iPad users to 'get a real computer':::::Technically Incorrect offers a slightly twisted take on the tech that's taken over our lives.Drew Angerer/Getty Images There's been so much news this week, what with the XBox One X being launched and the iPhone X undergoing teething troubles.(Its teeth are chattering in the cold, apparently.)You might, therefore, have missed a touching tweak of Apple's cheek offered by Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella on a trip to India.He was there to create excitement around the idea that the Microsoft brand has changed.In many ways, the job Nadella has done to try to make Microsoft relevant in the modern world -- and still a competitor in some spheres to Apple -- has been praiseworthy.Indeed, he seems to be so confident now that he'll cheerily make quips about Apple.As TechRadar's Sahil Mohan Gupta reports, Nadella walked into a room and couldn't help but chuckle."Nadella spots that I and a colleague have iPads and cheerfully says, 'You need to get a real computer, my friend,'" said Gupta.And you thought Nadella's overarching strategy was to be on good terms with everyone.It's curious how rival companies choose to periodically belittle Apple, then withdraw, only to succumb to the temptation all over again.Microsoft, for example, has insisted that Windows 10 computers can do more than Macs.The company has laughed at Apple's claim that the iPad Pro is a computer.One of its executives has also suggested that the iPad Pro is merely an example of Apple copying Microsoft.It's not as if Microsoft is alone.This week, Samsung emerged from a period of ignoring Apple in its ads to insult the last 10 years of the iPhone.Neither Microsoft nor Apple responded to a request for comment.Though Apple has long ignored competitors in its ads, its executives haven't always refrained from mocking other companies.Why, last year Apple's senior vice president of worldwide marketing, Phil Schiller, observed that using an old PC is "really sad."Though Nadella's comment is surely industry humor, he does believe Microsoft is different from both Apple and Google."I don't want to take away from whatever success Apple or Google are having," he told TechRadar."We are very different companies.We are not some middleman in the marketplace.We are a tool creator, we are not a luxury good manufacturer.That's not who we are.We are about creating technologies so that others can build."Not a luxury good manufacturer?All right, now that is a bona fide Apple burn.Does the Mac still matter?Apple execs explain why the MacBook Pro was over four years in the making, and why we should care.The Smartest Stuff: Innovators are thinking up new ways to make you, and the things around you, smarter.
Bid on this Robby the Robot movie prop:::::For the right price, you could be the new master of a pop culture icon, who also just happens to be a robot.Robby the Robot -- famous for popping up in such TV shows as "The Twilight Zone," "Lost in Space," "The Man from U.N.C.L.E.," "The Monkees," "Mork & Mindy," "Columbo" and even "The Love Boat," just to name a few -- is now up for sale in Bonhams' "Out of This World" movie memorabilia auction in New York City on Nov. 21.Robby the Robot made his first big-screen appearance in the 1956 Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer film "Forbidden Planet," a sci-fi take on Shakespeare's "The Tempest."Robby played the mechanical servant created by a scientist named Dr. Morbius, who programs the robot using knowledge of the Krell, a race of highly intelligent beings that once populated the planet Altair IV, where the movie takes place.Getty Images Robby's design and construction, from materials including metal, plastic, rubber, wood, glass and Plexiglas, cost MGM around $125,000.Robby's unusual robot design included sphere-like arms, legs, and dome, all made of acetate.Robby's front neon tubes blink, which gave the robot the appearance of talking, and Robby runs on five 12 volt DC motors and can be controlled with a remote attached by a cable.After "retiring" from film and TV, the famous prop found a home with various collectors until he was ultimately bought and restored by filmmaker and collector Bill Malone.This original Robby that's up for auction is fully operational and is expected to sell for seven figures.Tech Culture: From film and television to social media and games, here's your place for the lighter side of tech.Special Reports: CNET's in-depth features in one place.

Launch of 'Space Kingdom' delayed by out-of-bounds plane:::::NASA/Bill Ingalls The first self-proclaimed nation in space will have to wait at least one more day to get off the ground.An Orbital ATK rocket and Cygnus capsule carrying Asgardia-1, the cubesat that comprises the entirety of the digital country Asgardia's territory, was forced to abort its launch from NASA's Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia on Saturday when an aircraft strayed into restricted airspace nearby.The launch, which was also set to resupply the International Space Station, was scrubbed at the last minute when an unidentified aircraft "was detected in the vicinity of the launch pad," according to NASA.Asgardia-1 is one of over a dozen toaster-sized cubesats that will be deployed from the Cygnus capsule by NanoRacks after its monthlong stop at the ISS.The small satellite is essentially a file server carrying Asgardia's constitution and various files uploaded by "citizens" of the nation, which currently exists more as a sort of online club but has plans to eventually build human settlements in space, on the moon and beyond.The rocket carrying the nation/satellite will attempt to launch again Sunday morning at 4:14 a.m. PT.
Schiit Vidar is an affordable amplifier that wows the Audiophiliac:::::I reviewed Schiit's overachieving $699 Freya all-tube preamplifier last weekend, now it's the matching $699 Vidar solid-state power amplifier's turn, and it's a honey!Let's start with a quick rundown of the things that set Vidar apart from similarly priced amps, first it's a Class AB, not 'D amp, and audiophiles such as myself tend to prefer the sound of AB designs.Vidar doubles its power output from 100 watts into 8 ohm speakers to 200 watts per channel into 4 ohm speakers.Again, 4 ohm drive capability isn't a sure thing for amps in the Vidar's price class.And it's made in the US, with parts mostly sourced from US companies.Enlarge Image Lee Shelly Connectivity is straightforward, there's a pair of RCA inputs, one XLR input for mono operation, and a pair of speaker wire binding posts.One snag, the power on/off switch is inconveniently located on the amp's rear end.You can start with one Vidar, but if you crave more power you can buy a second Vidar to use the two of them as single channel mono amps each delivering 400 watts into 8 ohm speakers (there's no 4 ohm power rating).The two amps won't take up that much space, Vidar is considerably more compact than average, it's just 9 by 13 by 3.8 inches.It's a beefy, little guy.To test out the Vidar, I set it up with the Schiit Freya preamp, the Oppo BDP-105 Blu ray player, Schiit Bifrost or Mytek Brooklyn digital converters and switched between Magnepan .7 and KEF LS50 speakers for all of my Vidar listening tests.Vidar comes with a five-year warranty, and it's sold direct from Schiit with a 15-day return policy.Listening to Schiit sound Vidar was a perfect match with the Magnepan .7 flat panel speakers, so that's what I used for my first round of auditions.Bingo, the best of the .7s sound -- transparency, big as outdoors soundstage, gorgeous midrange -- they were all there, and I noted the treble was better than I've heard in a while.Magnepan treble can sound soft, but here with Vidar the cymbals were brilliant.Vidar's skillset dazzled with the Magnepans and it's rare to hear such an affordable amp do this well with these speakers.Enlarge Image Lee Shelly The KEF LS50 speakers also loved the Vidar, and bass output of this little speaker really surprised me.With Kid Koala's sampled and synthesized "12 Bar Blues" CD, the LS50s low-end slam belied their size.With the stereo mix on Kraftwerk's "3D" Blu-ray, the soundstaging was in fact remarkably three-dimensional, and the palpable textures of the synths and their super tight basslines demonstrated Vidar's grip on the LS50s' woofers.It's a great recording.Staying with German prog rock I played Can's "Future Days" CD, and the hallucinatory soundscapes occupying my listening room made me smile, this 1973 masterpiece still surprises me.Pair the Vidar with Schiit's smaller tube preamp, the $349 Saga, and that pair together runs just over $1,000.Add a set of $500 ELAC Uni-Fi UB5 monitor speakers, and that would be a hell of a system!
Jeremy Heiden's 'Blue Wicked' album is on nearly every audio format:::::Steve Guttenberg/CNET It's 2017, everybody's streaming music so why is singer/songwriter Jeremy Heiden releasing his music on every format he can get his hands on?Isn't it too late for that?Sure, you can stream his music on Spotify and Tidal, but Jeremy Heiden's "Blue Wicked" album is also available on CD, LP, cassette, MiniDisc, Digital Compact Cassette, Elcaset, vinyl picture disc and so many more.The guy really likes physical formats.I'm with him, and looking back I'm fascinated by the number and variety of audio formats that have vanished over the years.The longevity of the LP and CD as popular formats still selling tens of millions of units each year well into the 21st streaming century is no less mindboggling.Enlarge Image Jeremy Heiden Heiden designs the art for the packaging for each format of "Blue Wicked"; he and his producer Ralf Porankiewicz handle the transfers and mastering."Blue Wicked" is something of a best-of Jeremy Heiden collection, some of the tunes are 20 years old.The earlier tunes were recorded on ADAT digital tape, later ones were done on Pro Tools at 48 kHz/24 bit resolution.He likes really obscure analog formats like Elcaset, I forgot all about that one!It's a big tape cartridge Sony thought would appeal to folks who wanted the sound quality of reel-to-reel tape, but in a smaller, more convenient shape.It didn't work, Elcaset was a disaster.Heiden pointed out that no record companies ever released pre-recorded Elcasets, so "Blue Wicked" is the first.I've had hands-on experience with most of the other formats, but I never saw or heard an Elcaset.It's super rare.And he's not just focusing on ancient analog formats, Heiden's preparing surround mixes for DVD and Blu-ray.His affection for the MiniDisc recordable optical disc format runs deep, and he strives to make each format sound as good as possible.No wonder Heiden's developed a small, but passionate following of insatiable format freaks.He takes delight in researching formats, tracking down blank media and recording machines.It's a calling, he just has to do it.What about 8-track stereo tape cartridges you ask?That format was hugely popular from the mid 1960s to early 1980s.Heiden's on it, he has an 8-track "Blue Wicked" scheduled for December release, and there might even be another 8-track coming with a surround mix!So I was hardly surprised that a 7 inch analog reel-to-reel tape "Blue Wicked" is in the works!Enlarge Image Daniel Anderson Trying to stump Heiden I asked, "What about a 78 RPM record?"and he didn't flinch.He's open to any and all formats, because he just loves the idea of having his music on every conceivable format.Come to think of it, Jack White put out a '78 a few years ago, his affection for analog audio is well known.Heiden didn't rule out an SACD, and he hasn't yet received any requests for "Blue Wicked" on the Digital Audio Tape cassette format, but he's ready to do a few if people want 'em!Heiden has nine customers that have bought "Blue Wicked" in every format, and he might be the only artist who's set out to do as many formats as he can.It's feedback from customers sharing Heiden's love of obscure formats that has fueled his ongoing search.The only format that Heiden can't imagine getting out any time soon is LaserDisc, but you never know.Obviously this isn't a get rich quick scheme, he just really loves doing it.Check out Jeremy Heiden's Web site for more information about his music and which formats are available now.
HQ Trivia is your new favorite mobile game with a cash prize:::::Screenshots by Jason Parker/CNET The game HQ Trivia (currently only for iOS) has been exploding in popularity since its debut in the beginning of September.Here's why: It's a live streaming trivia game you can play on your iPhone that kicks off every day at 3 p.m. EST and again at 9 p.m. EST, where if you answer all the questions correctly, you can win real money.HQ Trivia was developed by Intermedia Labs, the creators of the now defunct 6-second video app Vine.But instead of short-form video, HQ Trivia is a twice-a-day (once-a-day on weekends) live stream that lasts roughly 15 minutes.Here's how it works: You log in as the game is about to kick off, and after a short intro from the live hosts, you'll get your first of 12 trivia questions, with three multiple choice answers for each.You have 10 seconds to make your choice before the game locks up and the answer is revealed.That's long enough to answer but not long enough to cheat with Google.If you answer a question wrong, you're eliminated and can watch the rest of the show without participating.But if you answer all 12 questions correctly, you'll split the prize pool with all the other contestants who made it through.The prize pools are currently set to $500 on weekdays, and I've seen as much as $1,500 on weekends.During Friday's game it was announced the prize pool would be $2,500 this Sunday.The pools will likely continue to go up as more people start playing the game, and from my experience so far, this game hasn't nearly reached its peak.Trivia HQ came on the scene in early September and didn't catch on right away.I've been playing for only the last week, and I've noticed an incredible bump in contestants (the count is shown in the upper left part of the screen as you play).Last week, I played and saw roughly 29,000 players playing along with me.Last night I logged in and there were close to 45,000 players.This game is definitely catching on.Screenshots by Jon Kim/CNET There's no telling how popular HQ Trivia will get, but now's the time to jump in to see how long the fun ride lasts.It's Complicated: This is dating in the age of apps.Having fun yet?Crowd Control: A crowdsourced science fiction novel written by CNET readers.
I raced Lego drivers in VR on a real-life roller coaster:::::Screams of terror pierced the air as I made my way up the steps to what used to be the terrifying Project X roller coaster.Legoland Malaysia, together with Merlin Magic Making, had given it a tech makeover: It's now the ostensibly less intimidating Great Lego Race.Still, I was nervous.The Great Lego Race marries virtual reality and good old roller coaster thrills, then adds a dash of Lego fun.Riders zoom into a world made entirely of Lego bricks, where they careen aboard a Lego car and race Lego characters.The Malaysian theme park will be the first to launch the experience, later this month, followed by its resorts in Florida and Germany next year.VR roller coasters aren't new.Last March, England's Alton Towers theme park opened the world's first such attraction, the Galactica.But previous rides have been targeted at an older crowd and at roller coaster enthusiasts.The Great Lego Race, on the other hand, is aimed at kids, perhaps Lego's biggest fans.Enlarge Image CNET This could be the sort of thing virtual reality needs to steer toward a more economically vibrant future.Consumers haven't exactly been rushing to buy the bulky and often pricey gear required to trick themselves into believing they've landed in computer-generated worlds, whether under the sea or out in space.That's in spite of a big push into VR over the last several years by tech giants ranging from Google and Facebook to Samsung and Sony.Now Playing: Watch this: Top 5 virtual reality headsets available Before you hop on the ride, staff at the Great Lego Race hand you a Samsung Galaxy S8-powered Gear VR headset equipped with headphones (and decorated with Lego eyes).It doesn't matter where you sit in the coaster, because you'll find yourself in the driver's seat of your very own Lego car.Make sure the headset's securely fastened so it doesn't slide down your cheeks like mine did after the ride's first drop.Once I'd slipped into my gear, I found myself in a Lego car parked in a garage and removed from the real world.As the roller coaster began moving, the garage doors opened and my virtual Lego car began driving itself onto a racetrack.There's no steering; You're just along for the ride.Spectators on the grandstand cheered as I entered.As I looked around, I found myself joined by fellow Lego racers: Trendsetter, Pharaoh, Surfer Girl, Wizard and Pirate Captain.I've never been a fan of roller coasters, but this time I could feel excitement creeping in as our cars began speeding away.Enlarge Image Legoland Malaysia When the real-world roller coaster action kicked in, the virtual world reacted accordingly.Swerves and turns along the course are translated into your driver's attempts to avoid crashing into falling objects or rogue Lego racers, and the ups and downs are turned into bumpy roads or rapids in VR.Needless to say, sudden drops are most exhilarating -- I could only watch as my Lego car tumbled down a slope 18 meters high, or off a broken track.It's lots of fun, and the fruit of hard labor.The creators went on countless rides over two and a half years to identify every twist, turn and drop along the course, which were then added to the story line that makes up the VR experience and recorded on every headset, according to Thomas Wagner, CEO of VR Coaster, one of the companies involved in the Great Lego Race project.Tracking hardware on the coaster transmits the rider's position along the track via Bluetooth to the headset, ensuring that what you see in VR is in sync with what you're experiencing in the real world.Enlarge Image Zoey Chong/CNET As with all new tech, glitches can happen.During the ride, the wrong experience was playing on our headsets in my coaster so we had to get off and wait to board the next car.In another coaster, riders said the Lego car they saw themselves sitting in wouldn't move out of the garage, so they didn't know where and when to expect the turns and drops, essentially riding blind.It turned out the problems we had were with the tracking hardware on the coaster, according to the staff, though issues can also happen with the headset.If you do end up on a coaster with faulty equipment, though, Legoland Malaysia says you'll be allowed to go on the next ride without having to queue all over again.The ride officially launches Nov. 22.Hopefully these kinks get ironed out so others can feel as much joy as I did.By the end of the race, I couldn't wipe the smile off my face.Rebooting the Reef: CNET dives deep into how tech can help save Australia's Great Barrier Reef.The Smartest Stuff: Innovators are thinking up new ways to make you, and the things around you, smarter.

Molten lava consumes GoPro camera in viral video:::::Erik Storm's GoPro camera filmed its own fiery death.The event was "an honest accident that produced an amazing story," Storm, the owner and lead guide for Hawaii's Kilauea EcoGuides, told me.Storm set down his camera to film the lava and then became distracted.Now Playing: Watch this: Molten lava overtakes a GoPro "I was telling a story about the Polynesian goddess Pele to my guests when my GoPro was hit by the lava," he said. "I am very passionate about what I do and sometimes get lost in providing our guests with cultural and scientific information."In the video, the lava slowly covers the camera and its waterproof housing, and then flames blaze up.Erik Storm The video dates to August 2016, when Storm took a private tour group to Kilauea volcano and set down his GoPro to film the lava flow.The footage is now going viral thanks to attention from PetaPixel."I thought the camera was for sure done when it was engulfed in the lava," Storm said."I had a geologist rock hammer with me, and that is how I was able to get it out of the now-cooling rock."Erik Storm If Storm was surprised to turn around and see his camera buried in lava, another surprise awaited him when he got home.He hammered the now-hardened rock off, and saw the camera's blue Wi-Fi light still blinking.The camera would turn on, but was no longer usable because its lens had melted.But there was good news."The SD card popped right out and the footage was intact," Storm said.Some who've seen the footage don't believe Storm's story.Erik Storm "I have been accused of doing this intentionally, which is definitely not the case," he said."I am by no means rich, why would I put a $400 camera in jeopardy intentionally?And if I did this to gain attention why would I have not tried to get all that attention back in August of 2016 when this happened?"Don't get any bright ideas about creating your own viral video by following Storm's lead."It is VERY important to note that flowing lava in Hawaii is extremely sacred and should be respected as such," he warns."No one should ever poke the lava with anything, cook with the lava, or throw anything into or in front of the flowing lava....This is a very sacred place that commands respect."
Can you stand on liquid mercury? Watch a scientist try:::::Cody Don Reeder (known as just "Cody" to fans of his YouTube science videos) had a compelling question: "Can I stand on liquid mercury?"So, naturally, he answered it with an experiment posted on his Cody's Lab channel.Liquid mercury is a mesmerizing substance that's also potentially poisonous to humans.Cody wanted to keep the heavy mercury completely corralled, so he placed a reinforced plastic-lined box inside an industrial-strength plastic tub.He filled the box with 640 pounds (290 kilograms) of liquid mercury.According to the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, liquid mercury has a density 13.6 times that of water.Is that enough to hold up Cody's body weight?Cody lightly tested the surface with a bare foot, but then put on boots to protect an open wound.Balance turned out to be one of the biggest challenges as Cody ended up floating above the bottom of the container.Is that the same as standing on mercury?Not quite, but Cody speculates it may be possible to stand on it if you had a wider stance and a lot of practice.Cody, a geology student, has a thing for mercury.We caught up with him in late 2016 when he tried to flush mercury down a toilet.That was another can't-look-away experiment that used a mere 240 pounds (109 kilograms) of mercury.This latest test really amps up the amount.Cody says he may try this experiment again with more mercury and a larger container.Until then, we know you can at least float on mercury.
Nintendo could make 25 million Switch consoles next year:::::The Nintendo Switch may be a whole lot easier to find this holiday season and beyond, according to a new report by the Wall Street Journal.Nintendo has allegedly ramped up production to make 25 million to 30 million consoles per year starting April 2018, the Journal said.This new rumor supports an earlier report that Nintendo would make 2 million Switch consoles per month.Now Playing: Watch this: Nintendo just announced a ton of new Switch games The hybrid device that bridges the gap between an in-home console and a portable gaming rig was off to a rocky start when it arrived in March with a relatively steep price tag, a dearth of games and a stock shortage.Now, the popularity of Super Mario Odyssey and a new deal with Hulu that streams your favorite shows on the Switch are giving the gadget sturdier footing.CNET Review Nintendo Switch This clever hybrid console delivers on its promise of being a home-and-away gaming machine, but its serious lack of games will have everyone but Zelda fanatics holding off for now.SEE IT $299.99 at Amazon.com Nintendo further hopes its Black Friday bundle will lure Mario fans to make the Switch switch.Nintendo did not immediately respond to CNET's request for comment.
Disney streaming service should cost a lot less than Netflix:::::Disney's future streaming service will challenge Netflix, the reigning streaming champ, with lower prices, CEO Bob Iger said in an earnings call earlier this week.In August, Disney announced its plans to pull movies like "Moana" from Netflix and instead stream them along with future films like the sequel to "Frozen" on its own service, which will launch in 2019.Iger said: "I can say that our plan on the Disney side is to price this substantially below where Netflix is.That is in part reflective of the fact that it will have substantially less volume.It'll have a lot of high quality because of the brands and the franchises that will be on it that we've talked about.But it'll simply launch with less volume, and the price will reflect that."Now Playing: Watch this: A look at how Disney gave water a little sass in 'Moana' Iger went on to say that the company's main goal starting out will be to attract as many subscribers as possible, diverting at least some of the wind out of Netflix's sales.Disney-owned brands include Pixar, Lucasfilm (of Star Wars), Marvel Studios (think of all those "Thor" and "Avengers"-themed shows and films) and the ABC television network.While Marvel shows developed for Netflix are expected to stay on that service, such as "Daredevil" and "Jessica Jones," features like "Rogue One: A Star Wars Story" will likely move to Disney's service.Disney first signed a deal to stream content through Netflix in 2012.
Prehistoric wolf-sized otter had a surprisingly killer bite:::::Enlarge Image Artwork by Mauricio Anton Modern-day otters are pretty charming.They're playful and cute.But you might not think Siamogale melilutra, an otter that lived 6 million years ago, was cute if you met one.A study led by the University at Buffalo found the large, prehistoric otter was likely a top predator with a shockingly powerful bite.The ancient otters got up to 110 pounds (50 kilograms) in size.North American river otters can get up to around 30 pounds (14 kilograms), though the endangered giant otter found in South America can weigh over twice that.The researchers used fossils to help create 3D computer models of the prehistoric otter's jaws to compare with modern otters.Today, smaller otters have sturdier jaws than larger ones.The wolf-sized prehistoric otter defies this modern trend with researchers saying its jaws "were six times sturdier than expected.""Our findings imply that Siamogale could crush much harder and larger prey than any living otter can," said lead researcher Z. Jack Tseng with the University at Buffalo.Enlarge Image Z. Jack Tseng The otters' actual diet is unknown, but the jaws could have crushed everything from rodents to large mollusks, which would have been handy in environments they lived in."In the shallow swamp of South China, it's possible that an abundance of big clams drove these giant otters to acquire their rare traits, including their crushing teeth and robust jaws," said paleontologist Xiaoming Wang with the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County.The researchers published the findings this week in the Scientific Reports journal with the title "Feeding capability in the extinct giant Siamogale melilutra and comparative mandibular biomechanics of living Lutrinae."Virtual reality 101: CNET tells you everything you need to know about VR.CNET Magazine: Check out a sample of the stories in CNET's newsstand edition.
Some iPhone X users have a bright green line on their screens:::::iPhone X owners have taken to Twitter, Reddit and forums to report a green line running down one side of their phones, MacRumors reports.@AppleSupport my iPhone X already has an issue.There is a green bar along the right hand side of the phone.Restart doesnt fix.Known issue?pic.twitter.com/Hp3HKhVMfs mix0mat0sis (@mix0mat0sis) November 7, 2017 None of the six iPhone Xs in CNET's possession -- including several purchased at retail -- exhibit the green line issue.Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.This issue should be covered by the company's standard warranty, however, and owners have reported that Apple is exchanging iPhone Xs that display the green line for fresh phones.Now Playing: Watch this: It didn't take much to break the iPhone X If your iPhone X goes green, contact Apple Support -- via @AppleSupport on Twitter, online chat, your local Apple Store or your country-specific Apple customer service number -- to report the problem and ask for a replacement.Be prepared to have your order information on hand.As more consumers get their hands on the iPhone X, Apple's most expensive phone by far, various issues continue to emerge.Electronics warranty company SquareTrade demonstrated the iPhone X's fragility by scuffing and breaking its screen, and CNET's own test unit cracked on the first drop.Apple has also said that it will address reports of the X having issues while operating in cold weather through a future software update.
The Piano Guys shoot glorious iPhone X music video:::::Fog rolls across the floor.Two men sit with a piano and a cello, silhouetted against an achingly bright light.It's gorgeous.It's the new music video from chart-topping music group The Piano Guys and it was filmed entirely on an iPhone X.The song is an instrumental cover of pop star Niall Horan's "Flicker."The stirring composition melds beautifully with the dramatic smartphone film work.The video debuted on Thursday and The Piano Guys say this is the first music video they're aware of that was shot exclusively using an iPhone X.The iPhone X has barely been out for a week, so The Piano Guys had to work fast to get this video out.They gave themselves just 24 hours to conceptualize, write and record the song.As if that deadline wasn't pressing enough, they then gave themselves just 60 minutes do the filming.You can watch the video in its full 4K glory if you like.The Piano Guys shot the video in the middle of the night, which shows off the iPhone X camera's low-light capabilities.Though the iPhone X will probably generate a whole lot more videos of sassy cats than art pieces like "Flicker," at least we know it's capable of great things.
First 'space nation,' Asgardia, set to blast off from Earth:::::The first nation in space finally launches Saturday aboard a commercial spacecraft set to blast off from NASA's Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia.Asgardia Although the physical territory of Asgardia will consist solely of what's basically just a floating file server in orbit, the self-proclaimed "space kingdom" insists the deployment of the satellite Asgardia-1 is just the beginning of a much grander vision of a true space state.Asgardia is probably one of the few self-declared sovereign states you could fit in a backpack.Asgardia-1, a small cubesat that's roughly the size of a loaf of bread, is among the 14 cubesats that will be launched from Wallops early Saturday aboard an Orbital ATK Cygnus spacecraft bound for a long stop at the International Space Station.It will then have to wait at the ISS for a month before Cygnus detaches and heads to a higher altitude where the satellite can be deployed.Asgardia-1 will carry some key files, like the national constitution, flag and database of all its "citizens" (citizenship requires little more than filing out an application online and agreeing to the terms of the constitution), but most of its storage is filled with files uploaded by citizens.So far, over 100,000 humans have accepted the terms of the constitution and uploaded over 18,000 files to the satellite, according to Asgardia's website.The cubesat "will be our foundation stone, from which we will look to create a network of satellites that will help protect our planet against asteroids, solar flares, manmade space debris and other space hazards," Asgardia's leader and current one-man government, Russian nanoscientist Igor Ashurbeyli, said earlier this year.The reaction to the space nation-building project has been mixed.While over half a million would-be Asgardians have requested citizenship, others point out that the idea of claiming territory in space could conflict with existing law."(The Outer Space Treaty) says very clearly that no part of outer space can be appropriated by any state," Professor Sa'id Mosteshar, director of the London Institute of Space Policy and Law, told the BBC.It's also a stretch to consider Asgardia's free orbiting cloud storage service an actual nation for even more fundamental reasons.The ramshackle treehouse I built in my backyard has been declared sovereign territory by at least one young girl dabbling in imaginary megalomania, but because no other nation on Earth has acknowledged that claim of independence, it carries about as much weight as Asgardia's assertion of nationhood.That said, my treehouse made from old closet doors and some plywood is arguably a more viable nation-state candidate since it's at least possible a human could take up physical residence there, another requirement to meet the generally accepted definition of a country.But the rationale for Asgardia-1 is that it represents a humble first step towards far greater ambitions."The ultimate goal of Asgardia is to protect Earth from space threats," reads the FAQ on Asgardia's official website."In order to preserve humanity and biodiversity of the Earth, Asgardia will organize and ensure the building of space arks (man-made inhabitable territories) and protective platforms in space to be used in the event of threats to the safety of humanity on the Earth and for space tourism, in the absence of threats.Asgardia's long-term vision includes human settlements on the moon and possibly on other celestial bodies."Now that sounds more like a space kingdom.It also sounds similar to the vision of other space pioneers like Elon Musk and his audacious plan for a million-person colony on Mars.You can watch coverage of the Orbital ATK launch from Wallops below on NASA TV beginning at 4 a.m. PT Saturday.Crowd Control: A crowdsourced science fiction novel written by CNET readers.Solving for XX: The tech industry seeks to overcome outdated ideas about "women in tech."
Netflix drops Louis C.K. special after sexual misconduct claims:::::Laura Cavanaugh/Getty Netflix said Friday it's dropping plans to pursue a second stand-up special with comedian Louis C.K., following a report about claims he engaged in sexual misconduct dating back about two decades."The allegations made by several women in The New York Times about Louis C.K.'s behavior are disturbing," a Netflix representative said in a statement Friday."Louis' unprofessional and inappropriate behavior with female colleagues has led us to decide not to produce a second stand-up special, as had been planned."Netflix released "Louis C.K.2017," the first of two planned Louis C.K.specials, in April.In a statement later Friday, Louis C.K.said "these stories are true.""I have been remorseful of my actions.And I've tried to learn from them.And run from them.Now I'm aware of the extent of the impact of my actions," he said."I have spent my long and lucky career talking and saying anything I want.I will now step back and take a long time to listen."You can read his full statement here.The backlash against Louis C.K.is the latest in a string of flare-ups involving high-profile Hollywood figures and allegations of improper sexual conduct.A Times story last month about numerous sexual harassment allegations against Hollywood movie producer Harvey Weinstein sparked many women and men to share their own stories using the #MeToo hashtag.Netflix earlier this month severed ties with Kevin Spacey, the star of its groundbreaking original series, "House of Cards," after claims he'd had a sexual relationship with a minor and harassed young men working on his projects.At Netflix rival Amazon Studios, top executive Roy Price resigned last month after allegations he sexually harassed a female producer.On Thursday, the Times reported five women's claims that Louis C.K.made inappropriate sexual advances.Netflix didn't go so far as premium cable network HBO, which on Thursday not only cancelled plans for Louis C.K.to join a televised comedy benefit but also said it would remove his programming from its on-demand services, such as streaming platforms HBO Go and HBO Now.Other popular streaming platforms didn't immediately respond to messages asking if they planned any action on the comedian's content.Hulu offers five seasons of his FX program "Louie" to stream, and Amazon has a number of comedy specials and other programming with Louis C.K.available on its Prime Video service.In addition to the hits to Louis C.K.'s projects on streaming platforms, his upcoming film "I Love You, Daddy" won't be released by its distributor, and FX said it was conducting a review in light of the reports.First published Nov. 10 at 9:55 a.m. PT.Update at 10:31 a.m. PT: Added selections from Louis C.K.'s statement.The Smartest Stuff: Innovators are thinking up new ways to make you, and the things around you, smarter.Special Reports: CNET's in-depth features in one place.
Popular teen app Musical.ly sells for reported $800M:::::Screenshot:Ty Pendlebury/CNET Popular social music app Musical.ly has been bought by Beijing Bytedance Technology for a reported $800 million, according to Bloomberg.Bytedance, a company valued at $20 billion and which produces the Toutiao news aggregation app, announced the news on Friday morning but did not announce the financial terms, according to Bloomberg.Musical.ly lets users lip-sync along to short music clips or sing and dance a capella and upload it to the site.Users can share, like and comment on the clips, which run between 15 seconds and a minute in length.Musical.ly, founded in Shanghai by Louis Yang and Alex Zhu in 2014, reached 90 million downloads within two years.Musical.ly isn't the first social app to attract high bids after Yahoo bought Tumblr in 2013 for a reported $1 billion and Facebook bought WhatsApp for $16 billion a year later.
2018 Dodge Demon begins shipping to dealers nationwide:::::After many months of waiting with bated breath, those who purchased a 2018 Dodge Challenger SRT Demon are one step closer to getting the 840-hp beast in their garages.Dodge announced Friday that the 2018 Demon has officially started shipping to dealerships.The car, which puts out 840 hp once you dump some race gas into it, is a drag-strip beast that just so happens to be street legal, albeit barely.It's not meant for the faint of heart, with a 2.3-second 0-to-60 time and the ability to break the 10-second barrier in the quarter mile.Enlarge Image Jon Wong/Roadshow Every Demon that ships from the factory will come with a leather-bound manual, written by the editors of Hot Rod, which describes the Demon's technical wizardry and offers tips and tricks for getting the car set up for quarter-mile runs.Options abound, many of which can be had for $1.You want removable rear seats?That'll be $1.Another buck will get you the Authentication Package, which gives you multiple build sheets and a portfolio to hold all your important documents.Another $1 will net you the Demon Crate, which offers the powertrain control module that lets you unlock the race-gas tune, a new air filter, skinny front drag wheels and a whole host of branded hand tools.It all rests inside a foam case that fits in the trunk.Other, costlier options abound, as well.You can get a set of Pirelli performance tires, so you don't run through the drag tires out on the street.There's a four-point harness bar available through Speedlogix that bolts into established holes behind the removable rear seats.There's also a dedicated Vbox data logger available that includes an in-car camera, for all the data geeks out there.The options may seem like a bargain, but the cost of entry is still rather steep.With a suggested retail price of $84,995, your wallet is going to take a hit no matter what.If you're a potential owner who's waiting to take one out for a late November drive, I'd suggest investing in some winter tires, too.

Everything as a Service: Cloud providers solve problems in-house IT can't and do it more quickly and for less money:::::Software as a Service is often the first step companies take into the cloud.But, today's cloud providers offer on-demand services for a wide range of business and IT functions.We've moved beyond SasS, PaaS, and IaaS into an 'Everything as a Service' or XaaS world.In their 2017 research report, Everything as a Service: Why companies are making the switch to SaaS, IaaS, PaaS, and more, Tech Pro Research (TechRepublic's sister site) outlined several trends in the "as-a-service" movement.Businesses use 2-3 services on average and email is most often outsourced service Among the survey respondents, Tech Pro Research found that companies used an average of 2-3 cloud services for both IT operations and non-IT business functions.The most popular service, which shouldn't come as a surprise, was email.Productivity apps, such as word processing and spreadsheets were second, followed by video conferencing.Within IT, the most often used services were datacenter and computing, backup and disaster recovery, network infrastructure, and databases.Download the special report: The future of Everything as a Service (free PDF) Easier maintenance, lower costs, and increased speed drive cloud service adoption Three three critical concerns dominated the list of reasons companies made the jump to cloud services; maintenance, cost, and speed.Half of respondents picked automatic maintenance as why they use external vendors instead of in-house IT.Right behind that, 45 percent indicated that the cost of maintaining and deploying these services was less.And the same number said that not only are deployments cheaper, but they're also faster.Cloud providers solve problems in-house IT staff can't Money and maintenance were also on respondents' minds when Tech Pro Research asked them about the positive and negative experiences they'd had with cloud service providers.Over half of respondents said their cloud providers "keep systems running so we don't have to worry about maintenance."Not having to worry about disaster recovery and saving money, were also at the top of the list.More interestingly however, businesses also reported that vendors are solving problems that in-house IT staff can't.The most often reported negative outcomes were unresponsive customer service departments, constant vendor personnel turnover, and constant price increases.Everything as a Service infographic and research report Tech Pro Research condensed many of the key findings from their everything as a service report into the infographic shown below.You can also download the full report from TechRepublic and ZDNet's premium content site, Tech Pro Research.The report contains more information such as which cloud vendors businesses are using most often for both business and IT functions.Also see:
New GoDaddy, Square integrations to ease selling for SMBs:::::GoDaddy plans to offer two new Square integrations, the cloud platform company announced Thursday.The integrations are designed to help SMBs with online and offline selling by only requiring one Square account to sell in both realms.The first integration allows customers to pay businesses on GoCentral, GoDaddy's mobile website builder, for products using Square, according to a press release.Users will be able to book appointments online through the second integration.With this integration, service-based businesses will also be able to receive payments and sync their calendars with their clients, according to the release.SEE: Building a practical chart of accounts: Two sample documents (Tech Pro Research) For both integrations, companies can connect their existing Square account to their GoDaddy website.Business owners will only need one Square account to cover online and in-person accounts, simplifying money flow tracking for small businesses."Teaming up with Square will simplify the path to success for a wide range of small businesses from clothing and apparel makers to fitness trainers," Greg Goldfarb, vice president of commerce products at GoDaddy, said in the press release.The announcement comes after Square announced a strong third quarter earlier this week.While discussing the financial report, CEO Jack Dorsey said the company had been focused on helping sellers transition from online to in-person sales and vice versa.The GoDaddy integrations may help that, as sellers who already have a Square account for physical sales do not need to set up anything else to sell online and accept payments.The press release did not say when the integrations will be available.The 3 big takeaways for TechRepublic readers GoDaddy announced plans for two integrations with Square, both designed to simplify how customers can pay SMBs.Customers will be able to pay businesses on GoDaddy through Square.Service-based businesses will be able to book appointments and then sync their calendars with their clients.Through the plan, SMBs only need one Square account to accept payments in-person and online, making it easier to keep track of payments.Stay informed, click here to subscribe to the TechRepublic Tech News You Can Use newsletter.Subscribe Also see
Cybersecurity predictions for 2018: it's going to be "a lot more of the same":::::When it comes to defending cyberattacks, "this has been a tough year, and 2018 is going to be a tougher year," according to Richard Ford, chief scientist at Forcepoint.TechRepublic's Dan Patterson met with Ford to discuss what cyberattacks businesses should start preparing for in 2018.Ford said SSL attacks will be a "predictable surprise."We're ignoring how it's creeping up, he added, and we're going to start seeing more malware in the next year using SSL to hide behind.SEE: How risk analytics can help your organization plug security holes (Tech Pro Research) As we look ahead to cybersecurity in 2018, "it's going to be a lot more of the same," Ford said.Social media will continue to be leveraged as a way to hack, and any point of contact in the system will become a point of vulnerability.Ford also predicted a rise in more business email compromise.Companies need to be smart in how they're going to defend against threats, he said.In the coming year, Internet of Things (IoT) devices entering the market will continue to increase.IoT is difficult because we're not very good at patching it yet, he said, and the disruption of things is where attackers will start looking."If you think it's annoying having your files encrypted, it's going to be more annoying when you can't unlock your car," he said.Read more
Equifax breach gives IT $87.5 million reminders to apply critical security patches:::::Equifax reported costs of $87.5 million due to its "cybersecurity incident."Despite massive fallout from one of the largest data breaches in history, Equifax still reported a 4% increase in revenue for the third quarter of 2017, compared to Q3 2016.The company did report profit losses of 27%, however, which may be due to the money it has had to dedicate to what it described as production costs, professional fees, and consumer support.Dedicating $87.5 million to addressing the costs of such a massive breach may not have produced any tangible security results for Equifax, or at the very least helped it figure out who attacked them.Mr. Smith goes to Washington Former Equifax CEO Richard Smith testified before the Senate on Wednesday, revealing that the company still had no idea who was behind the attack.He did, however, note that they knew precisely why the attack happened: An unpatched Apache vulnerability.The breach in question was reported and assigned a CVE number in March 2017.It was even given a rating of 10the most critical score on the scale.Despite that, the Apache server at Equifax running the vulnerable software remained unpatched as of May, leading to the theft of over 145 million customer profiles.SEE: How to calculate the cost of data breaches (TechRepublic) This isn't a unique incidentthrow a dart at a list of major security incidents in the past few years and you're likely to hit one that was caused by unpatched vulnerabilities.From WannaCry to all the vulnerabilities leaked by the Shadowbrokers (all of which have been patched by Microsoft), hackers are largely targeting systems with known, exploitable vulnerabilities.Don't get stuck with the bill The average data breach is nowhere as costly as Equifax's, but at $3.62 million it could still be enough to cripple a new or growing business.Not everyone can bounce back as easily as a behemoth like Equifaxeven big companies like Yahoo have been crippled by the attacks they've faced.SEE: The Four Volume Cyber Security Bundle (TechRepublic Academy) There's a key lesson for business leaders to take away from the Equifax breach and the muddled, unclear responses the Senate got out of Smith and former Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer: Don't get caught with your cybersecurity pants down.Had Equifax simply taken the time to patch a vulnerability, Mayer would have been alone at that Senate hearing.It didn't, though, and that should be a wakeup call to everyone.The top three takeaways for TechRepublic readers: Equifax's third quarter earnings revealed that the company lost $87.5 million dealing with its recent data breach, which may have led to a profit loss of 27% over Q3 2016.Despite huge recovery spending, former Equifax CEO Richard Smith said the company still had no idea where the attack came from.They do know what happened, though: It failed to apply an Apache patch that could have stopped it.The average data breach costs far less than Equifax's, but the average breach still has a similar theme: Unpatched vulnerabilities.Keep your systems up to date to avoid a similar fate.Know what's coming before the hackers do: Subscribe to our Cybersecurity Insider newsletter.Subscribe VladislavStarozhilov, Getty Images/iStockphoto Also see:
Phishing attacks, not breaches, represent the biggest security risk for Google users:::::Google upped security protections for 67 million accounts after studying hijackers in black markets, the company said in a blog post Thursday.The company's research labeled phishing as the top threat to Google account security.Working with researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, the tech giant studied how hijackers steal sensitive data, like account passwords, from March 2016 to March 2017.Past Google research found that around 15% of internet users had experienced an account takeover.SEE: Security awareness and training policy (Tech Pro Research) Researchers found that third-party breaches exposed the most data (3.3 billion credentials), followed by phishing scams (12 million credentials), and then by keyloggers (788,000 credentials).Attackers using phishing or keyloggers were more likely to be successful, with 12-25% of attacks grabbing a password.Due to an increasing number accounts using two-step verification, getting the password wasn't always enough for attackers.Over three-fourths of attackers using phishing or keyloggers tried to get a user's IP address or location.Less than 20% tried to get information about the user's phone, including phone number."Our findings were clear: enterprising hijackers are constantly searching for, and are able to find, billions of different platforms' usernames and passwords on black markets," the blog said.Google applied their findings to their existing "defense in-depth" security measures, boosting the security of millions of accounts, according to the blog.The blog didn't clearly state when those measures were put in place, or what exactly was changed.Programs like Safe Browsing and the new Advanced Protection option are already in place for Google accounts.Two-step verification kicks in whenever an account is accessed on a new device or uncommon location.There are additional ways to protect your accounts.The blog post recommended users check, add, and update recovery information for their Google accounts through Google's Security Checkup.Chrome users can also generate passwords and save them in one spot using the Smart Lock tool.The 3 big takeaways for TechRepublic readers Google studied black markets and hijackers for a year, finding that phishing is the top threat against the security of Google accounts.Some 12-25% of attempts to grab passwords using phishing or keyloggers were successful, and over three-fourths of attackers tried to get a user's location to beat two-step verifications.To stay safe, Google recommends using Security Checkup to add recovery information and Smart Lock to generate passwords and securely store them.Stay informed, click here to subscribe to the TechRepublic Google Weekly newsletter.Subscribe Also see
Don't click that! How to spot an invoice impersonation attack that pretends to be from a coworker:::::Finance workers are seeing a wave of phishing attacks that send victims a link to a fake invoice that appears to come from a trusted party, according to a new threat spotlight report from security firm Barracuda Networks.These emails don't usually appear to be out of the ordinary, and guide the recipient to click on a link to an invoice.The sender's name is carefully chosen by the attackers to be someone the recipient knows and trusts.If a victim clicks on the link, it typically begins downloading a doc.file for the supposed invoice.This is usually a malware download that could trigger ransomware, or steal the recipients' credentials from the browser.SEE: Security awareness and training policy (Tech Pro Research) "As we continue to see these attempts grow in popularity, it's important to be aware of the warning signs in the messages," Lior Gavish, vice president of engineering and content security services at Barracuda Networks, wrote in the report.In the examples cited in the report, both include a payment request and linktwo major concerns."You should always tread carefully around payment requests via email, and if there's ever a doubt, any suspicions should be sorted out before ever acting on the request," Gavish wrote."Secondly, it's important to remember that any link you click could be malicious, so if you aren't certain that a particular link is safe don't click on it."The best way to prevent these attacks is via continuous employee training and testing to increase their security awareness, Gavish wrote.Many companies have begun running internal phishing attacks against their own employees as a way of educating them about the different types of cyberattacks.Companies can also consider layering employee training with email security solutions that offer sandboxing and advanced threat protection to block malware before it reaches corporate email servers, as well as deploying anti-phishing protections.The 3 big takeaways for TechRepublic readers 1.Finance workers are seeing a wave of phishing attacks that send victims a link to a fake invoice that appears to come from a trusted party.2.If a victim clicks on the invoice link, it typically begins downloading malware that could trigger ransomware, or steal the recipients' credentials from the browser.3.The best way to prevent these attacks is via continuous employee training and testing to increase their security awareness, as well as email protection tools.Image: iStockphoto/weerapatkiatdumrong Stay up to date on all the latest cybersecurity threats.Click here to subscribe to the TechRepublic Cybersecurity Insider newsletter.Subscribe Also see
Apple releases iOS 11.1.1, fixing pesky Siri and autocorrect bugs:::::On Thursday, Apple released iOS 11.1.1, the latest OS update that fixes a few pesky bugs, but fails to solve battery drain issues.Perhaps most notably, the update will fix an issue with keyboard autocorrect, which was turning the letter "I" into "A [?]," much to the irritation of business users and others.Many users reported the bug after purchasing an iPhone X for $1,000 when it was released on Friday.The update also fixes the problem where the "Hey Siri" command randomly stops working, according to the release notes.SEE: Job description: iOS developer (Tech Pro Research) However, iOS 11.1.1 does not seem to contain any new security fixes.It also doesn't appear to fix the battery drain issue that many users reported, according to ZDNet.However, you can find a workaround for that problem here.An upcoming update will also address another problem reported by iPhone X users, in which the phone's screen becomes temporarily unresponsive to touch after a rapid change to a cold environment.To download iOS 11.1.1, you can go to Settings > General > Software Update on your device, and begin the download.You can also connect your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch to a computer running iTunes, and then carry out the updatehowever, this method is slower and takes up significantly more space.Apple has patched a number of bugs in the past year, with many related to security, as TechRepublic's Brandon Vigliarolo reported.Last week, researchers participating in the Pwn2Own 2017 contest successfully hacked an iPhone 7 running iOS 11.1, and were able to drop malicious code into the device.And in the last several months, the company had its secure enclave decrypted, had been sending unencrypted Exchange credentials, faced another Wi-Fi attack in iOS 10 with Broadpwn, and was having keychain contents intercepted as plain text.The 3 big takeaways for TechRepublic readers 1.On Thursday, Apple releases iOS 11.1.1, fixing bugs with autocorrect and Siri.2.The update does not appear to include any security fixes, or battery drain fixes.3.Apple has patched a number of bugs in the past year, with most related to security vulnerabilities.Image: CNET Stay up to date on all the latest Apple news.Click here to subscribe to the TechRepublic Apple Weekly newsletter.Subscribe Also see
85% of big data projects fail, but your developers can help yours succeed:::::A year ago, Gartner estimated that 60% of big data projects fail.As bad as that sounds, the reality is actually worse.According to Gartner analyst Nick Heudecker this week, Gartner was "too conservative" with its 60% estimate.The real failure rate?"[C]loser to 85 percent."In other words, abandon hope all ye who enter here, especially because "[T]he problem isn't technology," Heudecker said.It's you.Old dogs, new tricks Well, not you exactly, but rather the difficulty of grafting modern big data practices onto existing infrastructure and into company cultures that are ill-prepared to embrace big data.After working through scads of botched big data projects, Heudecker told me that the primary causes of failure are the difficulty inherent in integrating with existing business processes and applications, management resistance, internal politics, lack of skills, and security and governance challenges.It's interesting that management would be a key blocker of big data projects, given that they've been the biggest cheerleaders for big data, touting its power to transform their businesses on earnings calls and to the press.Ask them how those projects have turned out, in fact, and 80% will tell you that they've been super successful and have delivered significant value, according to a NewVantage Partners survey.SEE: Research: How big data is driving business insights in 2017 (Tech Pro Research) Get into a postmortem with the teams actually responsible for running these projects, however, and you get that 85% failure rate that Gartner has uncovered.Ironically, this may partly derive from a tendency for executives to trust their gut rather than data, as a Fortune Knowledge Group survey revealed.Probe the NewVantage respondents a bit more and they, too, admit to a cultural mismatch that is nettlesome to overcome: If there is any sobering trend in these results, it lies in the apparent difficulty of organizational and cultural change around Big Data.More than 85 percent of respondents report that their firms have started programs to create data-driven cultures, but only 37 percent report success thus far.Big Data technology is not the problem; management understanding, organizational alignment, and general organizational resistance are the culprits.If only people were as malleable as data.People are not this malleable, of course, and executives aren't solely at fault.Look down the org chart and there's plenty of political infighting over who will own the project, how broadly to run it, and who is equipped to staff it (answer: not nearly enough people).All of which trends toward virtually no projects delivering a successful outcome, by Gartner's reckoning.Not that you should lose hope.A ray of big data light The problem, Heudecker went on, is that "Organizations...need a plan to get to production.Most don't plan and treat big data as technology retail therapy."This isn't surprising, since big data vendors, from legacy stalwarts to buccaneering startups, all basically promise the same thing: Buy my expensive and hard-to-use technology stack and you'll magically get [insert the buzzphrase of your choice; I like "360 view of the customer"].It's this promise of magic that keeps funding big data IPOs, but it's this same promise that almost certainly assures a company of abject big data failure.The key is to better align expectations.SEE: How your executives will screw up your next analytics project (TechRepublic) There's also the problem of moving too fast.Hortonworks' Ronda Swaney, for example, urges enterprises to quickly build out small, departmental successes into holistic, company-wide initiatives.While that sounds pragmatic (it's certainly better than going big right from the start), a company's culture may not be able to keep pace with attempts to quickly scale out projects, and the very DNA that made the small-scale project successful would likely prove insufficient to carry the broader project to a successful conclusion.In general, however much vendors may want their customers to go big with big data, the last few years of rampant big data failure suggest that a far better way is to start small, and build slowly.Indeed, I'd go one step further and suggest that companies seed these projects in a more bottom-up fashion, driven by developers.Let them experiment and grow projects organically.Given the current 15% success rate of big data projects, it's time to try something different.Image: iStockphoto/demaerre Click here to subscribe to Big Data Essentials Subscribe Also see
Why preventing IoT attacks isn't just the responsibility of security experts:::::Internet of Things (IoT) flaws can leave your company vulnerable to a multitude of attacks.TechRepublic's Dan Patterson met with Anthony Grieco, senior director and trust strategy officer at Cisco, to discuss how enterprises can best defend themselves against threats targeting IoT devices.Businesses need to understand that they have IoT devices deployed in their enterprise, whether it's a connected TV or a connected HVAC system."Every business that we're dealing with today is touching on, or using IoT in some way, shape, or form, fundamentally," Grieco said.SEE: Research: Defenses, response plans, and greatest concerns about cybersecurity in an IoT and mobile world (Tech Pro Research) When we look at the overall approach to IoT security, it's easy to look at the risk side, and harder to look at proactively dealing with cybersecurity in that space, he said.One aspect enterprises should consider with cybersecurity is: segmentation.Companies need to think about how to bring virtual barriers between connected devices and other assets within the enterprise, he said.Segmentation allows a "point of visibility" so companies can see what happens in that "thing space" where they've connected devices to their network.That gives them the opportunity to operationalize security in that space.Enterprises should look for anomalies, and create capabilities to respond to instances that might happen, he added.The number one goal for a company should be to make employees aware of the role they play in cybersecurity.In the past, the issue of cybersecurity has been "an expert-only conversation."However, to build an understanding, cybersecurity experts must "shift their mindset to be teachers, and not just owners of the expertise," said Greico.See Also:
Billing data in EHRs is attracting more unwanted attention from cybercriminals:::::There is no denying electronic health records (EHRs) are a good idea from a medical perspective.When doctors and other medical personnel can access patient data when they need it, this can increase the likelihood of patients receiving accurate diagnoses and better healthcare.As to what patient information is available in EHRs, the HealthIT.gov site notes these records typically contain the following: Administrative and billing data Patient demographics Progress notes Vital signs Medical histories Diagnoses Medications Immunization dates Allergies Radiology images Lab and test results The HealthIT.gov site states who EHRs are built for and why: "An EHR is more than just a computerized version of a paper chart in a provider's office.It's a digital record that can provide comprehensive health information about patients.EHR systems are built to share information with other health care providers and organizationssuch as laboratories, specialists, medical imaging facilities, pharmacies, emergency facilities, and school and workplace clinicsso they contain information from all clinicians involved in a patient's care."SEE: Identity Theft Protection Policy (Tech Pro Research) Why are cybercriminals interested in EHRs?Sadly, medical Personally-Identifiable Information (PII) housed in EHRs is of significant interest to the criminal element as well."So far this year, the healthcare sector has reported 233 breach incidents to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, state attorney generals and media," writes Jessica Davis in an Aug. 4, 2017 article for Healthcare IT News."More than 3.16 million patient records have been breached."If that is not enough evidence: "On the black market, the going rate for your social security number is 10 cents," writes Mariya Yao in an April 14, 2017 Forbes column."Your credit card number is worth 25 cents.But your EHR could be worth hundreds or even thousands of dollars."SEE: Online security 101: Tips for protecting your privacy from hackers and spies (PDF) (TechRepublic) It does not take long to realize EHR repositories are like one-stop convenience stores with impressive inventories.EHR information of particular interest is "administrative and billing data."Paul LaBrec, a researcher at 3M Health Information Systems, describes administrative and billing data as information generated for the administration of payment for health services delivered by healthcare providers and facilities.He adds: "These forms collect patient information such as patient demographics (name, address, birth date, gender and marital status), employment and insurance status, occupational limitations, dates of service, diagnoses and procedures, service provider information and charges for services."LaBrec states that administrative and billing data may not always be part of an EHR; however, it is becoming more popular to have it included in the EHR, as Mike Miliard explains in a June 26, 2017 Healthcare IT News article.Miliard writes, "A want ad recently appeared on the website of Verona, Wisconsin-based electronic health record colossus Epic Systems Corp. for 'bright, motivated individuals to join our new billing services team as we enter the world of medical billing.'"Besides stolen financial PII, patients can run into trouble if those who compromise the EHRs are intent on causing physical harm, such as removing any mention of life-threatening allergies from a patient's EHR.Another consideration is that, unlike deactivating stolen credit cards, it is unrealistic to delete or disable a patient's health record.What steps can healthcare leaders take?In my 2016 TechRepublic article Why healthcare is a prime target for hackers, and how to treat the problem, several experts suggested solutions involving creating a dedicated security team and improving policies.However, from the evidence above, any solution has seemingly fallen short.Healthcare IT News reporter Jessica Davis in her article asks Protenus cofounder and President Robert Lord for his thoughts.Protenus is a company that helps monitor patient privacy when using EHRs via big data techniques."The healthcare sector will only stop being so vulnerable when the advances in data collection, sharing and analytics are matched with similar advances in our understanding of how to protect patient data," Davis quotes Lord."Healthcare has invested tens of billions of dollars in deploying systems to leverage data to improve patient outcomesand appropriately so.But we still have massive problems with the abuse of that data and those systems."Lord continues: "Healthcare executives, at a fundamental level, should stop thinking about security and privacy as a cost center and more as a strategic pillar of their organization.We've continued to see increased awareness and incremental improvements, but not the needed dramatic leap forward."Lord suggests the healthcare industry is having growing pains with the introduction of EHRs.The only solution they propose is to match investment by other industries and stop being the low-hanging fruit.Hopefully public pressure will be a factor as well.Patients suffer most if not all the damage, yet have little or no input into how their medical PII is handled.Stay up to date with the latest IT news and tipssubscribe to our Cybersecurity Insider newsletter.Subscribe Also see
Storage dictionary in 18th edition evolves with the times:::::Storage developer Carlos Pratt is a busy man, having recently left his job at IBM to work at a stealth-mode cloud startup, but his passion is wordsPratt in his spare time leads a team producing the Storage Networking Industry Association's ever-changing dictionary.The dictionary team published its 18th edition online in September 2017 and in print last month.This year's digital version is 330 pages and adds definitions for many aspects of non-volatile memory, which is a modern twist on an old idea of designing computers around RAM instead of conventional drives (even if they're solid-state).Additions for next year should start to become clear around February or March, when the team begins debating dictionary term entries submitted online, Pratt explained.The last few years saw dramatically increased involvement from people in the networking industry and from other trade associations, he said, hinting of growth beyond purely storage terms.SEE: Quick glossary: Virtualization (Tech Pro Research) Pratt, based around Tucson, AZ, said his interest in documenting storage-talk began when he represented IBM to SNIA's Green Storage Initiative several years ago."We had to come up with a lot of new definitions because the work there was emphatic about being the counterpart for the industry to the EPA's Energy Star," he explained."I made the mistake of not taking a step back when everyone else did."But he developed a devotion for the job.Pratt led the team on a major dictionary refresh in 2015, removing terms once ubiquitous such as floppy disk.He predicts that RAID will eventually be deleted as new forms of data protection such as mirroring become dominant.At one point someone realized the entire dictionary team had for many years overlooked an entry for 'bit,' which they promptly corrected, Pratt said.Now, he noted, "As long as there are binary computers, there will be bits."Pratt said they won't make that same mistake by 2020 when presumably there will be new entries for quantum computing and its basic building block of the qubit.Currently the Q definitions are tied for the least quantity, with only quality of service, quiesce, quiescent state, and quota.J-words juxtapose the Qs with Java, JBOD, Jini, and jitter.(Why there's no entry for the flash version of JBOD is unclear, Joe.)He acknowledged that you practically need a dictionary to understand some of the technical terms.When asked about a plain-English version for storage industry newcomers and non-technical workers such as marketing and sales staff, Pratt said he'd ask the SNIA technical council if they are interested in developing that.Also conspicuously missing from the dictionary is a changelog fully documenting what's new and what's been removed.Something you definitely won't find are made-up marketing words, as Pratt said his team is careful to avoid definitions that appear to subjectively favor certain products.He'd veto any such marketing-hype definitions and said he hopes SNIA higher-ups would support that choice.But inconspicuously lurking are Easter eggs, a term every old-school programmer knows as industry shorthand for a hidden joke.See an example in the digital edition's entry for refreshment: "A type of migration where the contents of some media are copied onto newer media of the same type," but also, "A synonym for beer."Stay up on the latest enterprise storage newssubscribe to our Data Center Trends newsletter.Subscribe Also see
How to use BorgBackup over your network:::::Image: Jack Wallen If you use the Linux platform for various servers or desktops, you know that for every task there can be multiple possible solutions.One very good example of that is in the realm of backups.There are tons of routes to choose when trying to backup your dataeven when you're looking to backup your data over a network.One such solution is the open source BorgBackup.BorgBackup (or Borg, for short) is a deduplicating backup program that supports compression, authenticated encryption, and backing up over a network.I want to walk you through the process of installing Borg, creating a local repository, and then backing up to a remote repository on your network.This will only cover a fraction of what Borg can do.To get the most out of this solution, make sure to give the official documentation a read.With that said, let's get our Borg on.Installation Borg is found in the standard repositories, so installation is simple.I will be demonstrating on the Ubuntu platform.If you work with a different distribution, modify the installation command as needed.To install Borg, open up a terminal window and issue the command: sudo apt install borgbackup That's all there is to it.Do note, you must have Borg installed on both local and remote machine.With this installation out of the way, you're ready to rock.Create a local repository I'm going to first walk you through the process of creating a local repository with Borg.Once you understand that, then you can move on to create a remote repository.We'll be creating a repository that makes use of an encryption key (because ...security!).The command to create a local repository looks like this: borg init --encryption=repokey /REPOSITORY Where REPOSITORY is the direct path to the directory to be used.Let's say, for example, you have the directory /data to be used as a repository.Obviously, before you use this directory, the user who will run the command must have read/write access.For this, you'd issue the command sudo chown USER:USER /data (Where USER is the actual username).To create the /data repository, issue the command: borg init --encryption=repokey /data You will be prompted to create (and verify) an encryption password for the new repository.Once you've created the repository, it can be used to backup files and directories.Say you have the directory ~/Documents and you want it backed up to your new repository, with the name THURS (as we're backing it up on Thursday).The command for this would be: borg create /data::THURS ~/Documents You will be prompted for the encryption passphrase for the repository.Once authenticated, the ~/Documents directory will be backed up to /data.If you issue the command borg list /data, you will see a listing of the newly created backup (Figure A).Figure A Remote repositories Now that you have a basic understanding of how Borg works, let's create a remote repository and then backup to it.Before you can do this, you must be able to SSH into the remote machine.If you don't already have the necessary server installed (on the remote machine), you can do so with the command: sudo apt install openssh-server With that secure shell connection working, you can then create a remote repository with a command like so: borg init USER@IP:/REPO Where USER is the remote username, IP is the IP address of the remote server, and REPO is the directory to be used as the repository.Let's say we're going to use the remote directory /BACKUP, with the user jack, on the remote remote machine at IP address 192.168.1.90.The command for this would be: borg init jack@192.168.1.90:/BACKUP You will first be prompted for the ssh password for the remote user.Next you'll be prompted for a passphrase for the backup.Once you've verified that password, you will then be asked if you want to display the newly typed passphrase.Accept the default (N) and the repository will be created.Backing up to the remote repository is similar to backing up locally.Let's backup the ~/Documents directory to our newly created remote repository.The command for this looks like: borg create jack@192.168.1.90:/BACKUP::THURS ~/Documents The above command would create a new backup on the remote repository, named THURS.You can list that backup with the command: borg list jack@192.168.1.90:/BACKUP Our newly created backup will be listed (Figure B).Figure B Resistance is futile At this point, you know just enough to be dangerous with Borg.This tool is capable of quite a bit more, so make sure to comb through the official documentation to learn more of what it can do.Once you start using Borg, resistance will be, of course, futile.Automatically sign up for TechRepublic's Open Source Weekly Newsletter for more hot tips and tricks.Subscribe Also see
How the Jeeves programming language could improve online privacy:::::"As part of the first generation who came of age on the internet, I enjoyed the benefits of participating in the digital life, like instant messaging my friends when I was supposed to be doing homework," writes Jean Yang, an assistant professor of computer science at Carnegie Mellon University, in her The Conversation post Building privacy right into software code.Yang adds she learned the hard way that user privacy was not always utmost on the minds of those who create applications and software platforms (e.g., cookies lead to her mother realizing she had secretly been using AOL Instant Messaging).SEE: Information Security Policy (Tech Pro Research) Yang's early experiences did not dampen her interest in computing technology; in fact, it led to a career in teaching computer science and research into programming languages.Mindful of her earlier experiences, Yang wondered if something could be done to improve online privacy.Since programming languages are her area of expertise, she started there.How out-of-date programming languages can lead to privacy issues Yang discovered that many of today's popular languages make it difficult for programmers to protect the privacy of individuals, adding, "It's bad enough that this state of affairs means programmers have lots of opportunities to make privacy-violating errors."She points out programmers are not exclusively to blame; besides programming errors, shortcomings found in programming languages are equally significant.The programming languages Facebook developers use are a good example."As older languages develop into today's programming environments, security and privacy remain as add-ons, rather than built-in automatic functions," writes Yang."Though programmers try to keep instructions for different functions separate, code dedicated to enforcing privacy and security concerns gets mixed in with other code, and spread throughout the software."SEE: 15 books every programmer should read (free PDF) (TechRepublic) The decentralized nature of information leaks caused by out-of-date programming languages is familiar to Yang; it is part and parcel of the privacy issues she experienced years ago.Using Facebook's platform as an example again, Yang mentions that privacy-related code is scattered throughout the programs used to run Facebook's infrastructure, and that requires programmers to be aware of all the privacy-related components in a complex software environment.Yang adds, "To make sure nobody finds out where I am unless I want them to, the programmer must tell the system to check my privacy settings everywhere it uses my location value, directly or indirectly."Let computers do the work Why not take the task of privacy protection away from humans and entrust it to computers?"We canand shoulddevelop programming models that allow us to incorporate security and privacy into software in a simpler fashion," suggests Yang.That suggestion is based on language-based information flow security (PDF).It is relatively new technology that automatically checks programs to ensure that sloppy programming is not inadvertently violating privacy or other data-protection rules.However, Yang cautions that language-based information flow security models are not the end-all answer."Even with tools that can check programs, the programmer needs to do the heavy lifting of writing programs that do not leak information," she advises."This still involves writing those labor-intensive and error-prone privacy checks throughout the program."Introducing Jeeves, a policy-agnostic programming paradigm As part of her Ph.D. program at MIT, Yang took on improving the pitfalls found in language-based information flow security.The results?Yang and fellow team members came up with a new programming model.In her dissertation (PDF), Yang writes: "As a solution to the problem of information leaks, I propose a policy-agnostic programming paradigm that enforces security and privacy policies by construction.I present the implementation of this paradigm in a new language, Jeeves, that automatically enforces information flow policies describing how sensitive values may flow through computations."In her column, Yang offers a simple explanation: "In these systems, programmers attach security and privacy restrictions directly to every data value."Jeeves removes the need for humans to write code that repeatedly checks which information should be sharedthat is handled directly and automatically by the computer system."That means one less thing for programmers to think about," adds Yang."It also helps users feel more confident that some element of a complicated piece of softwaremuch less a human errorwon't violate their personal privacy settings."SEE: Gallery: Inside the pop-up store that reveals the truth about web privacy (ZDNet) Conclusion With software programs now involved in nearly every facet of our lives, the potential for problems has increased significantly.Yang offers this conclusion: "If our computers can protect our privacy, that would be a huge improvement to our rapidly changing world."Stay on top of IT security news and tipssubscribe to our Cybersecurity Insider newsletter.Subscribe Also see Image: Hani Eriani, Getty Images/iStockphoto
How to get more battery life with Windows 10's new Power Throttling feature:::::If you have a laptop running on a 6th, 7th, or 8th generation Intel Core Processor and you have upgraded to the Windows 10 Fall Creators Update, your system will automatically begin taking advantage of the new Power Throttling feature.This will enable you to get roughly 10% more life out of your laptop's battery.Microsoft has said it plans to expand support to other processors in the future.But for now, let's take a look at how the Power Throttling feature works.How does it work?Prior to the Power Throttling feature, the CPU was always running all apps at full capacity all the time, regardless of whether they were in the foreground or background.Windows reduced power to all apps only after periods of inactivity, i.e., when the laptop was idle.Thus the power savings was either all or nothing.With the Power Throttling feature, when an application is relegated to the background, Windows will put any CPU resources dedicated to that application into a low power state.The app is still running, but only using the most energy efficient operating mode of the CPU.In this way, the app can operate, but with minimal drain on the battery.Windows 10's Power Throttling feature also incorporates a sophisticated detection system that can differentiate between those apps running in the background that are important to you and those that aren't.To do so, Windows 10 monitors app usage and bases its decisions on the demands of running apps and the apps you regularly interact with even though they're in the background.It will then make sure that apps that are important get the power they need, while apps that aren't don't.For example, if you are listening to music and relegate your music app to the background, Windows will determine that even though that app is in the background, it is still performing a task that is important to you and will make sure that app receives the power that it needs to perform its task.On the other hand, a word processing app that is relegated to the background isn't doing any real work, so power to that app will be throttled back.Even so, a power throttled app will still be able to perform necessary tasks such as an automatic save operation for a word processing app.Taskbar Notification Area If your laptop meets the requirements and you are running on battery power, you'll find that you can adjust the overall level of Power Throttling that Windows 10 will employ system wide from the Taskbar Notification Area via the Power icon.Just click the Power icon and you'll see the power mode slider, which has four positions, as shown in Figure A.Figure A The power mode slider allows you to determine how aggressively you want to apply the Power Throttling feature.This slider lets you determine how aggressively you want to apply the Power Throttling feature.The four positions range from Battery Saver, which provides the maximum power throttling, to Best Performance, which disables Power Throttling.In between, you'll find the Better Battery and Better Performance positions.When you plug in your laptop, you'll see that the power mode slider shows (plugged in) and automatically jumps to Best Performance, which again disables Power Throttling.You can see this state in Figure B.Figure B When your laptop is plugged in, Windows 10 disables the Power Throttling feature.Viewing Power Throttling Of course, if your laptop is using the Power Throttling feature, you'll want to see it in action.You can do so in Task Manager after you add the Power Throttling column.To begin, right-click on the Taskbar and select Task Manager.When the window appears, select the Details tab, right-click on the Name column header, and choose Select Columns.Then, select the Power Throttling check box, as shown in Figure C, and click OK.Figure C Select the Power Throttling check box.Once you do so, the Power Throttling column will appear in the Details tab's display.As you can see in Figure D, I moved Power Throttling to the left and positioned it next to the Name column.I also moved the Status column down.I then sorted the display by the Power Throttling column.Figure D You can see Power Throttling in action by enabling the column in Task Manager.If you look at the Windows Store app process (WinStore.App.exe), you can see that Power Throttling is enabled for the app and its Status is listed as Suspended.This status indicates that the Windows Store app is minimized in the background and is drawing minimal battery power.Looking at the File Explorer process (explorer.exe), you can see that even though Power Throttling is enabled for it, File Explorer's Status is Running because it is still in the foreground and I was just using it.Disabling the Power Throttling feature By default, Windows 10 will enable the Power Throttling feature for every app it can.However, you may find that certain apps don't work well with the Power Throttling feature.If so, you can disable the Power Throttling feature for that app.Of course, you can disable the Power Throttling feature system wide using the power mode slider.But to disable the feature for a single app, access Settings and select System | Battery.Then, select Battery Usage By App.When you see the screen shown in Figure E, locate and select the app to expand the Battery Usage panel.Then, clear the Let Windows Decide check box.Figure E You can disable the Power Throttling feature for a single app.Stay on top of the latest Microsoft developments.Sign up for TechRepublic's

Facebook to provide digital training in 30 US cities to close the tech talent gap:::::Amidst a tech skills shortage, Facebook is venturing to 30 US cities to provide digital and social media training to unemployed people and SMBs throughout 2018, the company announced Thursday in a blog post.Called Facebook Community Boost, the program will provide programming targeted to different audiences to better equip them to compete in an increasingly digital economy.Four types of trainings were outlined in the blog post: Those for people looking for work, for entrepreneurs, for SMB owners, and for people new to the internet.SEE: Job description: Digital campaign manager (Tech Pro Research) People looking for work will get training to boost in-demand digital and social media skills.Around two-thirds of SMB leaders using Facebook said a candidate's digital skills are an important consideration in the hiring process.Internet newcomers will be able to gain knowledge on online safety and general digital literacy, getting additional information on how they can stay connected to their communities on Facebook using event and group features.Business owners and entrepreneurs can learn about growing their online presence and customer base using Facebook.They may also learn how to turn a business idea into the real deal.Over half of SMB leaders on Facebook said the platform has helped them increase sales, according to the blog.A recent report from Robert Half Technology found that 77% of job candidates lack the digital media skills that businesses need.Some of the most in-demand skills include social media management and marketing, which overlap with what Facebook plans on teaching.However, it is unclear if Facebook plans on offering skills trainings that don't pertain directly to Facebook itself.Facebook will work with local organizations to administer the training sessions in cities including Houston, St. Louis, and Des Moines.The full list of cities wasn't released, but a link for interested cities was included in the post.Other tech giants have invested in similar education programs.For example, in October, Google put up $1 billion in grant money to support nonprofits working to close the education gap.The 3 big takeaways for TechRepublic readers Facebook will provide digital and social media training to people in 30 cities in 2018.Sessions will be tailored for unemployed people, internet newcomers, business owners, and entrepreneurs.The trainings can benefit SMB owners looking to grow their business and people looking to pick up skills to jump into the tech industry.Stay informed, click here to subscribe to the TechRepublic Tech News You Can Use newsletter.Subscribe Also see
What to look for when buying a new computer, laptop or hybrid:::::Skip in Skip x Embed x Share CLOSE The choices can be overwhelming: PC vs laptop?Chromebook or Apple?Columnist Marc Saltzman guides shoppers through the computer-buying process.USA TODAY Battery life is key for todays laptops, with some models delivering up to 15 hours between charges.(Photo: Dell/handout) Buying a new computer is a lot like ordering a pizza: You think its a fairly simple task until you realize how many choices you need to make.But if your existing machine is so old it could barely run solitaire, youre probably due for an upgrade.The good news is two-fold: there are many new exciting developments in the computer space, and there are many deals to be had over Black Friday, Cyber Monday and leading up to the holidays.Aside from figuring out your budget, of course, the following are some questions you might want to ask yourself to help decide whats right for you.More: Best apps to save you money over Black Friday and beyond More: The best Black Friday deals you can get right now More: Black Friday 2017: What to buy, what to skip What will I use it for?While most Chrome OS computers are inexpensive and underpowered, Googles recently unveiled Pixelbook (from $999) is powerful and pricey.(Photo: Google/handout) How you plan on using your new computer should dictate what kind to buy.If you only want a computer for light tasks such as Web browsing, reading email, and checking on social media then you could go with modest specifications (specs), which should have a modest price, too.Something with an Intel Core i3 or i5 should be sufficient.On the other end of the spectrum, if youre looking for a machine that can handle high-end computer games, virtual reality or video editing, youll need to invest in a faster processor, better graphics capabilities, and more RAM (system memory).An Intel Core i7, NVIDIA graphics, and 16GB or 32GB of RAM (instead of 4GB or 8GB) is a good idea.When it comes to storage, more and more laptops have a solid-state drive (SSD) instead of a hard disk drive (HDD), which makes these laptops thinner, lighter, faster and more energy efficient.Like the flash memory in your smartphone, SSDs are also less prone to damage because there are no moving parts.That said, I like to say purchasing a computer should be like buying kids clothes: go a little bigger than you need today, so you can grow into it for longer-term savings.You dont want to have buyers remorse by picking something underpowered, only to replace it in a year from now.Stick with a brand youve had a good experience with, or ones your friends and family highly recommend (and critics, too).What OS should I go with?Most computers sold today have Windows 10 preinstalled.It combines a classic desktop look but with the option for larger tiles, as introduced in Windows 8.(Photo: Microsoft, handout) This question may also be tied to the What will I use it for?decision, especially if theres software you want to run that only works with a specific operating system (OS).Otherwise, youve got three main choices today: Windows, Mac and Chromebook.(Yes, theres Linux, too, but not a mainstream pick.)Stick with the operating system youre most comfortable with.If youre not sure, or feel like a change, know that each OS has its advantages.Windows 10 is the most popular choice today.Its offered by nearly all the biggest computer brands such as Dell, HP, ASUS, Lenovo, Acer and so on plus Microsoft makes their own Surface-branded PCs, too.Its easy to use, works with the most software and hardware out of any OS, and the Windows Hello feature means you can log onto your device by simply looking at your computers camera.Windows 10 offers multiple ways to interface with your content, whether its a keyboard, trackpad or mouse; using a stylus pen on the screen for greater precision (often called digital inking); fingertips on a touchscreen; or by using your voice with the Cortana personal assistant.Apples Mac family are also a popular pick.Since Apple is the only one that manufacturers Macs like the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro there is generally better quality control, and built with premium materials.Macs tend to last a long time (but not their chargers), though Macs cost more, on average, when compared to Windows and Chromebooks with comparable specs.Many find them easier to use than other operating systems (thought that boils down to personal preference, of course).Apple includes many of its top software for free (or a free download from the Mac App Store), plus there is a lot of software for Macs today, too.Apples MacBook family are a popular pick for its sleek design, durability, and longevity.(Photo: Apple/handout) Powered by Googles Chrome OS, Chromebooks are generally more affordable than Windows and Macs, but there are some premium Chromebooks available, such as Googles own Pixelbook ($999), which includes Google Assistant for voice interaction.Chromebooks usually ship with popular Google apps already preinstalled, such as Gmail and Google Maps.Generally speaking, Chromebooks have modest specs, such as little local storage, but most Google apps are cloud-based anyway.Chrome OS is billed as a lean, fast operating system, designed for mostly basic tasks, and with good value.Affordable and portable, yet usually underpowered, Googles Chrome OS is available through many popular compute makers, including ASUS.(Photo: ASUSTeK Computer Inc./handout) What form factor do I choose?If its been a while since you shopped for a laptop, youll notice many are incredibly thin and light, making them much easier to carry around with you to and from coffee shops, the office, school, airplanes, and so on.Many Windows-based laptops are 2-in-1s, as they can transform from a laptop to a tablet and back again.Some 2-in-1s are called convertibles as they convert from laptop mode to tablet by simply bending back the screen, which is on a 360-degree hinge, and disables the keyboard in favor of tapping and swiping the screen.While less popular, other 2-in-1s are called detachables as the screen detaches altogether, which you can then bring with you as a tablet.While laptops are often preferred because theyre portable, stationary desktop computers might be more ideal for younger kids.Why?If you put it in a highly trafficked area of the home, you can keep an eye on where they're going online.They're usually less expensive than laptops and harder to break since they're less mobile.Many desktop computers today are all-in-ones, with the guts of the computer built in behind the monitor.(Photo: HP/handout) Many of todays desktops are often all-in-ones, which is when the computer is built into the back of the large monitor, so theres no tower to take up additional space.Ideal to place anywhere in a home such as a kitchen counter, in a home office, or a teenagers room many all-in-ones have a touchscreen and often ship with a wireless keyboard and mouse.But if youre buying a desktop for a gamer, an all-in-one isnt as modular, since its not so easy to update storage, memory or graphics cards.Instead, a tower setup may be best for a gamer.As you can see, theres a lot to decide when buying a new computer its not a one-size-fits-all scenario but along with how much you have to spend, ask yourself these three questions to help you whittle down your options.Follow Marc on Twitter: @marc_saltzman.E-mail him at askmarcsaltzman@gmail.com.Skip in Skip x Embed x Share CLOSE With the 2017 MacBook Pro Apple introduced a new Touch Bar to their classic design.Is the new feature a hit or a miss?Check out the video to find out!Reviewed.com Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2mfKmFf
Snap's Spectacles, Google and others prove glasses and tech don't mix:::::Skip in Skip x Embed x Share CLOSE Glasses and tech do not make a successful marriage, says USA TODAY's Jefferson Graham.This is a simple truth for 2017 and beyond: we dont want to wear glasses to enjoy our tech.That became loud and clear this week courtesy of Snap, Inc., the parent company of communication app Snapchat.The gadget graveyard now includes 3-D TVs, Google Glass and a case could be made for virtual reality headsets, as well.Count how many people you know who use a headset or watch 360-degree footage online.But none made a bigger belly flop than Snaps Spectacles, the colorful $129 video glasses which were initially scarce until they went mass market.Now, there are apparently warehouses with thousands of unsold merchandise gathering dust.This week, Snap said it took a $40 million writedown on the product.Comedian Nemr poses in new Snapchat Spectacles video sunglasses (Photo: Jefferson Graham) The message is clear.Despite enthusiasts and analysts telling us that we will eventually move beyond desk and mobile computing to wear something on our head that beams and/or records images or connects to the Internet, we dont.Earlier this year, we quoted the respected analyst Gene Munster from Loup Ventures, who told us that within 10 years, the smartphone as we know it will have come and gone, to be replaced by a wearable product.He said that would probably be glasses that would connect to our friends, show us the latest social media post, play videos and the like.I was skeptical then, and even more so now.I called Munster this week to tell him so, and replayed my opinions of the glasses graveyard, but hes not changing his tune.He still believes that in a decade, the phone is toast and replaced by a wearable.The way we interact with technology now is with the phone, he says.You take it out of the pocket and use hands or voice to interact with it.There will be a new way to experience computing, and well be wearing glasses to get it.Its hard to see how we get there after all these clear consumer failures.One of us is right on this.Lets check in in 2027 and see who came closer to the future.Meanwhile, looking for a great deal on Spectacles?Auction site eBay has many used models available for just $50.For the first time, Waymo's self-driving test vehicles are operating without human drivers ready to take over.(Photo: Alphabet) In other tech news this week Speaking of the future, more Jetsons-style news for 2017 came from ride-hailing service Uber and Googles self-driving Waymo unit this week.Waymo announced with great fanfare its self-driving car service in Phoenix will soon drive passengers around, without a driver at the wheel.And Uber is looking to as soon as 2020 to offer flying taxi service in Los Angeles and Dallas.(That's right, a taxi that somehow flies in the sky.In just three years.Yeah, we're a tad skeptical on that one, too.)Separately, a self-driving Las Vegas shuttle bus started service in Glitter Gulch, but it had an accident within just two hours after launching.Twitter 280.The days of having to struggle through a 140 character-tweet to get your point across are soon history.Twitter said this week it is expanding the character requirement to 280, after testing it with select users since September.The beauty and challenge of Twitter was always the brevity of tweets.So get ready for some long-winded social posts.That's a Snap.The creators of the Snapchat app said it would soon disappear, to be replaced by a new, easier-to-use version.This came in response to Snaps third earnings report as a public company, and like the previous ones, this weeks edition was also, in a word, terrible.The company reported losses of $443 million, a $40 million write-down for the Spectacles debacle, and the decision to start again with an app that wouldn't be as confusing.Snap wouldnt say when the new app would be available, but Business Insider reported that its coming in December.Additionally, Chinese company Tencent said it invested $2 billion for a minority stake in Snap, worth about 10% of the firm.Apple had a killer opening weekend, selling out of the new iPhone X within two days, and reporting online order delivery wait times of 3-4 weeks.But while Apple caught the attention of consumers with the X, that other new iPhone, the 8, just didnt catch on.Apple sold fewer iPhone 8's in the third quarter than last year's 7, the 8 Plus or even the two-year-old 6S, according to researcher Canalys.As the

Only 1% of Chinese women use tampons. P&G wants to change that:::::An ad for Tampax tampons to be used during China's Singles' Day shopping holiday on Nov. 11, 2017.The ad text reads, "Tmall 11.11 Global Shopping Festival, Tampax tampons, Open your Tmall app and search for our flagship store."(Photo: Tampax) SAN FRANCISCO Consumer giant P&G used Saturday's $25.3 billion online shopping holiday to sell Chinese women a product they rarely buy: tampons.Just 1% of Chinese women use these alternatives to menstrual pads, as compared to about 60% in the United States, according to Tampax, which invented them in 1933.That sales potential has prompted Procter & Gamble's Tampax brand to launch a new, China-specific branded tampon during the annual Singles' Day deals event e-commerce giant Alibaba held Nov. 11.This year's sales represented a 39% increase over last year.Menstruation products represent a $5.9 billion industry in the United States and a $35.4 billion one worldwide.Sales are expected to top $40 billion globally in the next three years, according to Global Industry Analysts.Singles' Day began as Valentine's Day-like holiday in the 1990s among university students in China.Since 2009 Alibaba (BABA) has rebranded it as a shopping day, marketed as a "get something for yourself day" that's grown into a multi-billion dollar sales event.The shopping event is also a big target for U.S. retailers looking to reach Chinese consumers.In 2016, 37% of total buyers purchased from international brands or merchants with the United States the top seller of imported goods, according to Alibaba.Citigroup estimates sales could rise as high as $24 billion this year.Unmentionable An ad for Tampax tampons to be run during China's Single's Day shopping holiday on Nov. 11, 2017.The text above the woman read, "Explore the new world.Tampax wishes you a happy 11.11" (Photo: Tampax) The something just for me ethos of Singles Day was perfect for Procter & Gamble, which chose Singles Day last year as a test run for bringing tampons out in the open to Chinese women.Periods are still considered unmentionable in Chinese society, where women tend to use euphemisms such as getting a visit from my aunt to describe them.That's why Chinese swimmer Yuanhui Fu made such waves during the Rio Olympics last year when she openly said she was having her period after a difficult race.Chinese women praised her on social media for her courage in admitting to menstruating.A hashtag about the topic on Weibao, Chinas Twitter equivalent, was used more than half a million times in the days after the race.Fu was also criticized, mainly by men, who said that for women to swim while menstruating was unhealthy and unhygienic.Three months later Tampax used 11.11 as a test, selling 5,000 Tampax kits as pre-sales in the run up to the actual day.These types of sales are much like pre-Black Friday sales in the United States.Once it realized there was a market, Tampax used Alibabas platforms to gain insight into what Chinese women thought of tampons and what kinds of marketing and design might help them reach more customers, the company said.That included a strong focus on water sports, including sponsoring outings to water activities in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou and a trip for some lucky customers to the tropical island nation of the Maldives.Advertisement for Danbishuang tampons.(Photo: Courtesy of Ye Deliang) An ad for Tampax that ran on 11-11 features a blond woman in a red bikini surfing on a pink Tampax applicator.Behind her, another woman scuba dives and one paraglides.while sailboats sail, a Tampa-branded dirigible hangs in the air and a champagne bottle pops.This year Tampax went all out during Singles' Day, pushing ads and marketing material online meant to specifically appeal to younger Chinese women who may be more open to new ideas and less bound by older social constraints.Its goal in China is to enable Chinese women to gain a true sense of liberation during their menstrual period, said Hong Zhang, manager of external relations for feminine care for Tampax China.We want them to feel that on those days, there are no restrictions on their daily lives.If they want to get glammed up, if they want to do physical exercise, hike, or even go swimming in the ocean with tampons, they can do it all," he said.Alibaba touts its ability for Proctor & Gamble to use its powerful platforms to reach China's 1.3 billion people.Unlike Amazon in the United States, Alibaba hosts a complex ecosystem of sites, including the eBay-like Tabao; TMall, where brands sell directly to consumers; and the business-to-business site Alibaba.com.Alibaba also owns AliPay, used by 520 million Chinese as an online payment system."Through efforts like this, we are proud to empower the lives of millions of women in China who are looking for quality products and better lifestyles," said Chris Tung, chief marketing officer for the Alibaba Group in Hangzhou, China.Boxes of tampons are displayed in a pharmacy, Monday, March 7, 2016, in New York.A group of women has filed a lawsuit accusing New York of unlawfully taxing tampons and other feminine hygiene products.The suit argues that medical items are exempt from sales tax in New York.(AP Photo/Mark Lennihan) ORG XMIT: NYML110 (Photo: Mark Lennihan, AP) Moving beyond tampons In the United States, the feminine hygiene market is actually moving beyond tampons.Increasingly younger women are opting for what they feel are more natural and eco-friendly options, often made by women.This can range from reusable period underwear to natural latex menstrual cups, reusable natural sponge tampons, washable cloth pads and homemade cloth sanitary pads.American women have also railed against the so-called tampon tax, pushing to have feminine hygiene products exempted from sales tax, because, like food and prescriptions, they're considered life essentials.Many states have carved out other sales-tax exceptions over the years, often based on local interests or aggressive lobbying.China still has a ways to go in this trajectory.The country didn't get its first domestic tampon until last year, when an engineer launched the Danbishuang brand, which means Crimson Jade Cool.Contributing: Zlati Meyer in New York City.Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2i2TqZp

it doesnt matter whether this is through a wireless connection or by cable.Open a browser and type in the router's IP address.The IP address is a set of numbers and the default depends on your router's manufacturer.The common ones are 192.168.1.1, 192.168.0.1, or 192.168.2.1.Check the DHCP Client List or Attached Devices section that shows what gadgets are connected to your router.Typically, they are listed by IP address, MAC address and/or Name.Once youve surveyed this list of connected gadgets, figure out which ones belong to you.You should recognize the name of your main computer, and your tablet or smartphone should have the name of the manufacturer or model.If you can't make sense of the list, or you cant identify certain devices, simply turn off each gadget one by one.You can also disable each gadget's Wi-Fi.For tracking purposes, jot these network details down or take a quick pic using your smartphone so you can reference them later.If youve switched everything off and still see unknown gadgets, you know you have a culprit.Now, theres a much simpler way: You can use the aptly named Wireless Network Watcher.This free program gives you a list of gadgets connected to your Wi-Fi network.You can quickly fire it up whenever you want to check or just leave it open for real-time monitoring.Easy.Encrypt your connection Skip in Skip x Embed x Share CLOSE Jefferson Graham offers 4 tips on how to protect your home network from a hack on #TalkingTech.You may find intruders, or you may not.Either way, you can protect your Wi-Fi connection (and your personal data) by encrypting your connection.Every router on the market offers several encryption options.One type to avoid is WEP, which is outdated and easy to circumvent.Instead, look for any encryption that starts with WPA2, the most recent being WPA2-PSK AES.The WPA2 family of encryption should protect your router from any run-of-the-mill hacker.Read more detailed instructions for securing your Wi-Fi against intruders.Its possible that your network is already encrypted, yet outsiders are still accessing your Wi-Fi.If so, change your password immediately.You can also reset your router to factory settings (consult your manual) and set up your Wi-Fi signal from scratch.This will mean changing the default password, enabling encryption, picking a new SSID and turning off any remote management features.Just remember, if you change your encryption password, youll have to update the password on all your devices as well.Even WPA2 encryption isnt perfect.Cyber-security experts recently discovered a massive Wi-Fi hack called KRACK.Click here to learn how to protect your network from this new attack.Fence out your guest network Friends and family always want to use your Wi-Fi.They ask politely, phone in hand because they hate to burn up their data plans when they can just use your connection.Instead of handing them your real password, use your routers Guest Network.This feature lets you share your Internet connection with your guests while keeping them off your main network, preventing them from seeing your shared files and services.To avoid confusion with your main network, set up your guest network with a different network name (SSID) and password.Although the guest network is available to guests, maintain the same level of security as your primary network.This means developing a strong password and restricting access to your shared files and devices.Make sure that local access is set to off, which will prevent guests from tampering with your system.Want a really cool tip?You dont have to give out your passwords at all.Heres a way that you can share your network's password using a QR code.Turn off remote administration Remote administration is a feature that allows you to log into your router over the Internet and manage it.If youve ever called tech support, you may have experienced something similar: A faraway technician speaks with you on the phone, and then operates your computer as if hes sitting right next to you.Remote administration is a handy tool, especially when you need to fix a problem, but it leaves your computer vulnerable to hackers.Unless you absolutely need it, turn this feature off.You can find this under your router settings, usually under the Remote Administration heading.You can always switch it on again, if the need arises.The last thing you need is to invite strangers on to your home network.More: One mistake people make using public Wi-Fi More: Wi-Fi connection problems are the worst.Here are three ways to solve them.More: 6 ways to speed up slow Wi-Fi What questions do you have?Call my national radio show and click here to find it on your local radio station.You can listen to the Kim Komando Show on your phone, tablet or computer.From buying advice to digital life issues, click here for my free podcasts.Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2Ar3GBA

The dead can unlock iPhones, offering possible clues to a killer's plan after memories go:::::Skip in Skip x Embed x Share CLOSE See how Apple's new facial recognition system works in real life.USA TODAY A conductive model of a finger, used to spoof a fingerprint ID system.Created by Prof. Anil Jain, a professor of computer science at Michigan State University and expert on biometric technology.(Photo: Anil Jain) SAN FRANCISCO Your shiny new smartphone may unlock with only your thumbprint, eye or face.But it turns out you don't need to be alive to get past this unique security barrier, opening new frontiers for individual privacy and law enforcement.The FBI is struggling to gain access to the iPhone of Texas church gunman Devin Kelley, who killed 25 people in a shooting rampage.The devastating tragedy has unearthed a gruesome idiosyncrasy of modern biometric technology: a living person isn't necessary to unlock many devices.It turns out the agency likely could have unlocked Kelley's phone with his thumbprint, if he had enabled Touch ID to unlock it and officials had done so within 48 hours of Kelley's death by his own hand.More: FBI has Devin Kelley's iPhone.But it can't unlock it, obscuring clues to Texas shooter More: Texas church shooting: Who is Devin Kelley?That time limit passed and the phone remains locked, but it raises a question few buyers of the latest iPhone or Samsung typically consider does someone need to be alive for today's increasingly common biometric recognition systems to work?In many situations they don't, said Anil Jain, a professor of computer science at Michigan State University and expert on biometric technology.Biometrics has to do with body measurements.In computer circles its about using specific individual body measurements as a way to confirm identity.These include fingerprints to open phones and computers and facial recognition software that can now open PCs and Macs.Beyond computers, some very sophisticated secure entryway systems make use of iris recognition, hand geometry and voice recognition.In the case of the iPhone that belonged to Kelley, the limiting factor was the 48-hour clock on how long a fingerprint can be used to unlock the phone.This presumes Kelley had Touch ID enabled on his phone, which the FBI has not confirmed.However about 80% of iPhone users do, according to Apple.Touch ID has existed on all iPhone since the 5S was released in 2013 until the iPhone X, which replaces the Touch ID fingerprint with facial recognition.Forty-eight hours after the last time an iPhone is unlocked with a fingerprint, the fingerprint function stops working and the user is required to tap in their passcode.If the FBI had tried in that 48-hour period, would it have worked?A human finger used to create a conductive model of a finger that was capable of spoofing a fingerprint ID system.Created by Prof. Anil Jain, a professor of computer science at Michigan State University and expert on biometric technology.(Photo: Anil Jain) Decomposition and fingerprints Probably, said Jain, depending on how decomposed Kelley's body was.A rotting body changes shape, including the digits, which distorts the fingerprints.How fast the body rots depends on where it was found or stored.Body parts under water and in very hot climate will decompose much faster, Jain said.A study done in 2016 at Oak Ridge National Laboratory found that both iris and fingerprint biometric data could be obtained from bodies up to four days after death in warmer seasons and for as many as 50 days in winter.Capacitive sensors The other hurdle is having something that the fingerprint scanner can read.Some older systems used optical scanners, which were relatively easy to spoof.Most systems today use capacitive systems which use the electrical properties of the human skin to build up a highly specific digital map of the ridges and valleys of the finger.Despite that, there have been reports of people making simple dental mold models of fingers to reproduce exact print pattern and using them to open smart phones.So it might have been possible for the FBI to simply make a cast of Kelley's finger to attempt to open his phone.More sophisticated systems are harder to spoof and generally require a living digit, as after death the conductive property of the skin is quickly lost.But it can be accomplished by making a conductive copy of the deceased's finger, said Jain.In his lab, researchers have accomplished this by first making an impression of a finger using the same material dentists used to make molds of teeth.In their case, it's the finger of a living student.Next they put conductive silicone or gelatin inside the mold to make a cast.Once the fake finger is extracted from the mold, it can be used to spoof a conductive fingerprint scanner.Jain said the lab has unlocked multiple devices using this technology.The eyes are the windows of the soul One of the features on the Samsung Galaxy Note 8 is iris recognition that enables hands-free unlocking.(Photo: Samsung/handout) The Samsung Galaxy 8 smart phone incorporates iris scanning as one identification option for users.This, too, can be thwarted, though it's more difficult.The same decomposition issues that face those trying to copy a finger are also true for the iris, so time is of the essence.Its also not possible to make a cast of the iris as its encased within the eyeball.However a good picture of the iris, which presumably could be taken soon after death, could be used to spoof a system.A security researcher in Berlin reported being able to engage the Galaxy 8's iris-recognition ID system simply by making a life-size print of an image of an eye and then gluing a contact lens to the picture to give it depth.Others have been able to spoof iris-recognition systems with photos alone.So as long as a photo of the iris in question was taken before it began to decompose, it might be possible to get into some systems.Show me your face (Photo: Getty Images) The new iPhone X replaces fingerprint recognition with Face ID.Modern facial recognition systems are harder to spoof in part because they build 3D rather than flat digital models of the face.This is why when iPhone X users start facial recognition, they have to move their head around so the system can get multiple images from which to build its digital model of their face.A dead body makes this difficult.It would be hard to turn the head around because of rigor mortis, which can occur as soon as four hours post mortem, said Jain.One way to get around that might be to move the camera around the stationary head, he suggested.Using a cast of the entire head to scam Face ID is something Apple's already thought of.On its Face ID Security page, the company explains that the Face ID system is specifically trained to spot and resist spoofing attempts to unlock phones with photos or masks.Apple also allows users to engage an additional level of security that requires the user to look at the phone to unlock it, to make it impossible to unlock a phone simply by pointing at the face of its sleeping user.Read or Share this

Facebook launches Facebook Local, with some Yelp-like features:::::Skip in Skip x Embed x Share CLOSE Facebook Inc said on Monday it was testing the idea of dividing its News Feed in two, separating commercial posts from personal news in a move that could lead some businesses to increase advertising.Time Facebook launched Facebook Local on Nov. 10, 2017.(Photo: Facebook) SAN FRANCISCO Facebook on Friday launched a new app, Facebook Local.It gives users a single place to find restaurants, bars, cafes and nearby activities but also folds in friends reviews of the places they might want to go.There are actually multiple things happening in the app.First, users can search for places and happenings, including events your friends might be attending.Theres also an Event section that shows nearby events.These can be filtered by time, category and location.Another tab shows users' Facebook events, and gives them the option of pulling their other calendars into the app as well.The app is a re-branded and expanded version of Facebook Events, which was launched a year ago.The new apps power and potential scale comes from the companys 70 million business pages, hyper-localized because it also includes reviews, photos and locations shared from friends' check-ins.Given that people post about where theyve been and what they thought of it as a matter of course on Facebook, this could make it a strong contender in a way that Events was not.How much a threat this could be to Yelp isn't clear yet, but it's another step towards further tying users into Facebook's ecosystem.And for now, at least, it's advertising free.More: Facebook unveils 30-city program to boost small business' digital skills More: Yelp shares hammered after it cuts sales outlook in face of competition Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2AsFYF6
A Foolish Take: Adults want the Galaxy S8, teens want the iPhone X:::::Skip in Skip x Embed x Share CLOSE Theres no denying Apples iPhone X is beautiful, but its bezel-less screen is costing not only the company big, but the environment too.Nathan Rousseau Smith (@FantasticMrNate) reports.Buzz60 Smartphone preferences vary by age.Most adults surveyed preferred Samsung's Galaxy S8 as a holiday gift instead of the iPhone 8, 8 Plus, or X.(Photo: Samsung) Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) launched the long-anticipated iPhone X last Friday, and diehard fans lined up to claim the priciest iPhone ever.However, Ebates' latest holiday survey indicates that demand for device varies widely between adults and teens in the U.S.Most adults surveyed preferred Samsung's (NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) Galaxy S8 as a holiday gift instead of the iPhone 8, 8 Plus, or X.However, most teens favored the iPhone X and iPhone 8 over the other two phones.That difference is surprising, since adults have more spending power than teens.An unlocked Galaxy S8 costs $720-$750; the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus start at $699 and $799, respectively; and the iPhone X starts at $999.But there are other considerations.The S8 still offers a headphone jack and a fingerprint scanner popular features the iPhone X lacks.Yet trend-conscious teens don't seem to care.Piper Jaffray's latest teen survey found that 82% of teens expect their next phone to be an iPhone, up from 81% in the spring.That loyalty should persist well into adulthood, as Apple locks them into its iOS ecosystem.Most adults surveyed preferred Samsung's Galaxy S8 as a holiday gift instead of the iPhone 8, 8 Plus, or X.However, most teens favored the iPhone X and iPhone 8 over the other two phones.(Photo: Ebates and Propeller Insights) More:A Foolish Take: Pew says majority in U.S. get news from social media More:A Foolish Take: Millennials are more frugal than you think More:A Foolish Take: How loyal are Amazon Prime members?Leo Sun has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Apple.The Motley Fool has the following options: long January 2020 $150 calls on Apple and short January 2020 $155 calls on Apple.The Motley Fool has a disclosure policy.The Motley Fool is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news, analysis and commentary designed to help people take control of their financial lives.Its content is produced independently of USA TODAY.Offer from the Motley Fool: Offer from The Motley Fool: The 10 best stocks to buy now Motley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent more than a decade beating the market.In fact, the newsletter they run, Motley Fool Stock Advisor, has tripled the S&P 500!* Tom and David just revealed their ten top stock picks for investors to buy right now.Click here to get access to the full list!*Stock Advisor returns as of Oct. 9, 2017.Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2jiMMlh
Russia Twitter trolls deflected Trump bad news:::::Skip in Skip x Embed x Share CLOSE An exclusive AP analysis found that disguised Russian agents on Twitter rushed to deflect scandalous news about Donald Trump just before last year's election while refocusing criticism on the mainstream media and Hillary Clinton's campaign.(Nov. 9) AP This April 26, 2017, file photo shows the Twitter app on a mobile phone in Philadelphia.Russian agents on Twitter attempted to deflect bad news around President Trump's election campaign in October 2016 and refocused criticism on the mainstream media and the Clinton campaign, according to an exclusive AP analysis of an archive of deleted accounts.(AP Photo/Matt Rourke, File) (Photo: Matt Rourke, AP) SAN FRANCISCO Disguised Russian agents on Twitter rushed to deflect scandalous news about Donald Trump just before last year's presidential election while straining to refocus criticism on the mainstream media and Hillary Clinton's campaign, according to an Associated Press analysis of since-deleted accounts.Tweets by Russia-backed accounts such as "America_1st_" and "BatonRougeVoice" on Oct. 7, 2016, actively pivoted away from news of an audio recording in which Trump made crude comments about groping women, and instead touted damaging emails hacked from Clinton's campaign chairman John Podesta.Since early this year, the extent of Russian intrusion to help Trump and hurt Clinton in the election has been the subject of both congressional scrutiny and a criminal investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller.In particular, those investigations are looking into the possibility of collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russians.AP's analysis illuminates the obvious strategy behind the Russian cyber meddling: swiftly react, distort and distract attention from any negative Trump news.The AP examined 36,210 tweets from Aug. 31, 2015, to Nov. 10, 2016, posted by 382 of the Russian accounts that Twitter shared with congressional investigators last week.Twitter deactivated the accounts, deleting the tweets and making them inaccessible on the internet.But a limited selection of the accounts' Twitter activity was retrieved by matching account handles against an archive obtained by AP."MSM (the mainstream media) is at it again with Billy Bush recording ... What about telling Americans how Hillary defended a rapist and later laughed at his victim?"tweeted the America_1st account, which had 25,045 followers at its peak, according to metadata in the archive.The tweet went out the afternoon of Oct. 7, just hours after The Washington Post broke the story about Trump's comments to Bush, then host of "Access Hollywood," about kissing, groping and trying to have sex with women, saying, "when you're a star, they let you do it."More: All eyes on Trump and Putin attending Vietnam summit More: A year later, Bernie Sanders calls Donald Trump's election an 'unprecedented disaster' for America More: Judge issues gag order in Paul Manafort, Rick Gates money laundering case Skip in Skip x Embed x Share CLOSE The top Democrat on the House committee probing Russian election meddling said Tuesday that America's 'democracy is under threat' from Russia - and also from President Donald Trump.(Nov. 7) AP Within an hour of the Post's story, WikiLeaks unleashed its own bombshell about hacked email from Podesta's account, a release the Russian accounts had been foreshadowing for days."WikiLeaks' Assange signals release of documents before U.S. election," tweeted both "SpecialAffair" and "ScreamyMonkey" within a second of each other on Oct. 4."SpecialAffair," an account describing itself as a "Political junkie in action," had 11,255 followers at the time."ScreamyMonkey," self-described as a "First frontier.News aggregator," had 13,224.Both accounts were created within three days of each other in late December 2014.Twitter handed over the handles of 2,752 accounts it identified as coming from Russia's Internet Research Agency to congressional investigators ahead of the social media giant's Oct. 31 and Nov. 1 appearances on Capitol Hill.It said 9 percent of the tweets were election-related but didn't make the tweets themselves public.That makes the archive the AP obtained the most comprehensive historical picture so far of Russian activity on Twitter in the crucial run-up to the Nov. 8, 2016, vote.Twitter policy requires developers who archive its material to delete tweets from suspended accounts as soon as reasonably possible, unless doing so would violate the law or Twitter grants an exception.It's possible the existence of the deleted tweets in the archive obtained by the AP runs afoul of those rules.The Russian accounts didn't just spring into action at the last minute.They were similarly active at earlier points in the campaign.When Trump reversed himself on a lie about Barack Obama's birthplace on Sept. 17, declaring abruptly that Obama "was born in the United States, period," several Russian accounts chimed in to echo Trump's subsequent false claim that it was Clinton who had started the birther controversy.Skip in Skip x Embed x Share CLOSE Fortune went to Siberia to find out.Time More: Short of impeachment, 6 ways Congress can limit Trump damage to America More: Art of dissent: Protesting Russia's Putin with Pussy Riot More: 8 takeaways from Carter Page's testimony about his contact with Russians Others continued to push birther narratives.The Russian account TEN_GOP, which many mistook for the official account of the Tennessee Republican Party, linked to a video that claimed that Obama "admits he was born in Kenya."But the Russian accounts weren't in lockstep.The handle "hyddrox" retweeted a post by the anti-Trump billionaire Mark Cuban that the "MSM (mainstream media) is being suckered into chasing birther stories."On Sept. 15, Clinton returned to the campaign trail following a bout with pneumonia that caused her to stumble at a 9/11 memorial service.The Russian account "Pamela_Moore13" noted that her intro music was "I Feel Good" by James Brown then observed that "James Brown died of pneumonia," a line that was repeated at least 11 times by Russian accounts, including by "Jenn_Abrams," which had 59,868 followers at the time.According to several obituaries, Brown died of congestive heart failure related to pneumonia.Racial discord also figured prominently in the tweets, just as it did with many of the ads Russian trolls had purchased on Facebook in the months leading up to and following the election.One Russian account, "Blacks4DTrump," tweeted a Trump quote on Sept. 16 in which he declared "it is the Democratic party that is the party of slavery, the party of Jim Crow & the party of opposition."TEN_GOP, meanwhile, asked followers to "SPREAD the msg of black pastor explaining why African-Americans should vote Donald Trump!"Barbara Ortutay reported from New York.AP Data Journalist Larry Fenn contributed from New York.Skip in Skip x Embed x Share CLOSE The former Trump campaign adviser recently told the House intelligence committee he spoke with a Russian government official in Moscow in 2016.Video provided by Newsy Newslook Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2i1aYoW

Stitch Fix? Rent the Runway? I tried 5 clothing services in a month. Here's what I found.:::::Skip in Skip x Embed x Share CLOSE Stitch Fix?Le Tote?Rent the Runway?Columnist Jennifer Jolly tries the lot and says what she likes best.Jennifer Jolly for USA TODAY Stitch Fix stylists select five items to send based on a buyers online profile.(Photo: Stitch Fix) These days you can order up just about anything on-demand.Doctors, drivers, hairdressers, even a new mattress all hours of the day and night.But fashion?Well, that can be a tougher nut to crack.Style, size, fit, cost, occasion all of the considerations that go into getting dressed are anything but one size fits all.Online clothing box service Stitch Fix filed for IPO in late October, and a new one-to-one personal stylist option called Allume just launched.Analysts say online styling services already account for more than $1 billion of revenue out of the $350 billion U.S. market for apparel and that its just getting started.As Ive learned first hand, it takes time, effort, and a bit of money up front, to find the right clothing service fit for you.I tried out five different services over the past month: Stitch Fix, DailyLook, Allume, Rent the Runway and Le Tote.Try and buy Stitch Fix and DailyLook are both try and buy type services.You sign up online, answer questions about your size, style, shape, budget and lifestyle, and pay a $20 styling fee for Stitch Fix, or $40 fee for DailyLook Elite.Those fees are applied as credit toward anything you end up buying from your box.Both sites decide what to send you based on the information you give them in their questionnaires, your social media profiles and Pinterest boards (if you have them, I dont), and a real live stylist who reviews everything and tries to figure out what will work best for you.What shows up at your house is always a surprise, and you really just have to hope for the best.Stitch Fix Stitch Fix clothing subscription (Photo: Jennifer Jolly) My Stitch Fix box took about two weeks from the time I signed up to the time it arrived at my doorstep.All the others took one week or less.It had five items inside, and the company gave me three days to try to them, figure out if I wanted to buy any of them, then send the rest back with a prepaid label.The clothing inside the first box was mostly a miss.There was a dark green sweater that looked great on, but itched like crazy, a royal blue Tahari dress that looked identical to something I already have in my closet, a black blazer that was an interesting idea, but didnt do anything for me once I put it on, and a purple sleeveless blouse was too big, and again, just nothing special.I ended up buying the one pair of jeans they included, from a brand called Pistola ($88), that Ive already worn three times.I love them.Stitch Fix also sends a sheet of Style Cards, which shows you how to wear and accessorize your new item.But did it deliver what I asked?I guess.I asked for help bridging the gap in my wardrobe from on-air clothes (i.e., what I wear on the Today Show) and my typical everyday work-from-home outfits of workout tights, T-shirts and zip-up athletic jackets.I have to say, this was better than any other time Ive tried Stitch Fix, because Ive learned to write a lot more notes in general, and to update the Style Profile a few times before submitting it.According to several dozen reviews of the site, the more you use the service, and the more feedback you give, the better it gets.I wish there was a way to leave photos for my stylist, and maybe thats what some people do with the Pinterest connection.But as someone whos already insanely time-crunched, thats the last thing I need to spend time doing right now.Still, Im going to give it one more try.Best for: time-crunched professionals who dont like shopping, but want to try new styles that are good quality for an affordable price.Expect to use it more than once for it to really work.DailyLook Elite Daily Look Elite clothing subscription (Photo: Jennifer Jolly) L.A.-based DailyLook took just four days to arrive, sent eight items and gave me five days to try it all on before returning it.It also has a way to shop and add what you like to your online closet.As you fill out your style profile, it gives a page of different looks and asks, Which looks most resemble the way you dress?They also ask you to list celebrities whose style you like (I left it blank), and added specific notes for my stylist.Heres what came: A long gray cardigan, a tweed-knit cardigan, a floral tank top, two long sleeve jersey wrap tops, another fitted, black novelty sweater, a pair of skinny jeans and a navy blue lace off-shoulder top.I bought the Juliet lace top ($89), and the Just Black Karly mid rise cropped jeans ($78).The results from DailyLook were the most surprising of any of the services.The the two things I thought I would love did not look good on (the two cardigans), and the one thing I thought was a no way in hell, (the lace top) I ended up buying.That sort of discovery is pretty cool overall.Best for: a more fashion-conscious person who wants access to the latest trends, seasonal fashions, and a hipper, more LA vibe.Rent the Runway Rent the Runway clothing subscription (Photo: Jennifer Jolly) Rent the Runway is great for borrowing really expensive gowns for special occasions, especially if you know exactly how a particular brands style and fit looks on you.The site gives you access to luxury designer fashion, jewelry, and handbags, some of which runs in the thousands of dollars.Shipping is free, and they dry clean everything too.But, for enhancing your everyday wardrobe, its not great.I signed up for Rent the Runways $159 Unlimited plan a little more than a year ago.The premise is simple, pay the monthly fee, borrow three items at a time (it has now changed to four items), keep whatever you want as long as you want, and swap out the others as often as you want as well.The idea of having access to designer clothes on rotation is well worth the $159 per month to me, but thats not really what you get.It takes a full week to ship items back and forth.So you order, wait a week, try stuff on, hope something works, send back what doesnt that takes a week too and then start over again.That means three weeks a month are spent just shipping things back and forth and Ive never been able to get more than one shipment per month.This might be different depending on where you live, but thats how its always worked for me.The company just updated their offerings to include an $89 per month Update plan that sounds like what Ive had for the last year, and promises their $159 Unlimited plan now gives you access to 450-plus designer brands.Best for: serious fashionistas with a sense of designer clothing that looks best on their body.LeTote Le Tote clothing subscription (Photo: Jennifer Jolly) LeTote is another fashion rental service, but more for everyday wear.Its the most flexible and least expensive of all the services I tried out.You choose the subscription you want; $59: three garments and two accessories in every tote, $69: four garments in every tote, or $79: five garments and three accessories in every box.They suggest the clothes they think best suit you based on a style questionnaire, but you can swap out anything they recommend for something you think looks better.(I swapped out everything in my first box.)You can wear the clothes for as long as you want, and then send them back, minus whatever youve decided to buy for a decent discount.LeTote has free two-three-day priority shipping, so it was the fastest to arrive of all the services.They also let you shop many styles and brands, add them to a virtual closet, and update it all as much as you want.Best for: casual clothing, maternity wear, clothing in the $100 or less range.Allume Allume clothing subscription website (Photo: Jennifer Jolly) Allume is the new kid on the block in terms of these kinds of fashion sites and different from these other four because its an actual one-to-one personal shopping service.You sign up online, take a detailed style quiz, then get paired with an experienced stylist.The two of you arrange a time to text with one another, a sort of initial consultation that takes about 20 minutes via text.My Allume stylist spent a ton of time via texts listening to what I want, understanding what I feel comfortable wearing and

back in put together two more lookbooks based on feedback from the first one.What arrived at my doorstep was my favorite of all the clothing, which isnt surprising since we worked together to find the best of the best: a pair of flair Frame jeans, a Smythe blazer, two graphic tees, a tank top, and a See by Chloe top.I had fit issues with most everything though.I never felt pressured to keep or buy anything, and will set a much lower price in the future.I've looked into hiring a personal stylist in the past, and the cost was always around $2,000.Allume does it all for a $20 styling fee that gets

How do Facebook ads target you?:::::Skip in Skip x Embed x Share CLOSE Lawmakers on Wednesday released a trove of Facebook ads linked to a Russian effort to whip up tensions around sensitive social issues.The ads were released as representatives from tech companies faced tough questions by Congress members.(Nov. 1) AP An ad placed on Facebook on Oct. 19, 2016 by Russian-linked groups, believed to be part of an attempt to sway the U.S. electorate in the 2016 presidential race.(Photo: Facebook) SAN FRANCISCO The House Intelligence Committee is preparing to release to the public the 3,000 ads the Russian-based Internet Research Agency bought on Facebook as part of its coordinated disinformation campaign to sway the electorate, information that may help explain how voters were duped and which campaign benefited.The unprecedented disclosures bring to the forefront questions some of Facebook's two billion monthly users may have about computer algorithms that underwrite what ad gets shown to which user: why was I shown one ad and not another?Did I see any Russian ads, and could I have known?The largely automated ad system has turned the 13-year-old Facebook into one of the world's most valuable companies by allowing businesses, from small entrepreneurs to large chains, to show specific ads to finely sliced groups of users.Here's what happens.Facebook's brand has helped it rack up over2 billion users.(Photo: Facebook) How do Facebook ads target users?In the days when print, radio and television were the only games in town, advertisers selected the publication or TV show they wanted to advertise in and perhaps the specific section or program.For a national publication or show they might be able to specify a certain area of the country, but that was about the extent of it.Ads on Facebook are several orders of magnitude more specific.The company constantly collects information about its users, including age, gender, education and income level, job title, relationship status, hobbies, political leanings, favorite TV shows and movies, what kind of car they drive and what kinds of products they buy.In addition, Facebook tracks the pages users like, the ads they click on and the sites they browse.Some of the information is collected directly by Facebook, some of it is purchased from data broker companies that use public records and buying behavior to learn about you.More: Russia exploited race divisions on Facebook.More black staffers, diversity could have have helped.More: House Intel leaders to release Facebook ads purchased by Kremlin-linked groups More: Russian fake accounts showed posts to 126 million Facebook users More: Facebook makes political ads more transparent ahead of Russia hearings Facebook then uses that information to decide to whom to show a specific ad.If you clicked on an InstaPot ad, you might be shown ads for other types of pressure cookers, or more generically, cooking.If your interests were the Bible, faith or Christianity, you could have been shown an ad placed by the Russians showing Jesus and Satan arm wrestling, with the caption, "Satan: If I win Clinton wins!Jesus: Not if I can help it!Press 'Like' to help Jesus win!"What's the difference between a post and an ad?Not much, sometimes.When an organization posts something on its Facebook page, its Facebook friends see it as simply content that appears in their News Feeds.The organization also has the option of "boosting" the posting by paying to have it seen by people who are not friends of the page.In that case, their posting gets a "Sponsored" note on it, so the people whose News Feeds it appears in know that it's an ad.The same is true if someone buys an ad on Facebook, the "Sponsored" note will be attached to the content.But there's a catch.If someone who sees that ad, or that boosted post, decides to share it with their Facebook friends, the "Sponsored" tag no longer appears because it's no longer a paid ad.An ad placed on Facebook on Aug. 4, 2016 by Russian-linked groups, believed to be part of an attempt to sway the U.S. electorate in the 2016 presidential race.(Photo: Facebook) So if ACME FishFood Inc. posts a piece on its Facebook page about The Care and Feeding of Goldfish, then boosts the piece or pays for it to be distributed as an ad, it will contain a "Sponsored" tag.But if someone forwards it along to a friend on Facebook, they will only see it as a post, not as a paid advertisement.It's this kind of ad, one so compelling that people begin to forward it along to their friends, that advertisers (and the Russians) aim for.One example distributed earlier this month by the House Intelligence Committee shows a line of Texas Border Patrol agents on horseback with a dramatic sky filled with lightening behind them.The caption reads, "Don't mess with TX Border Patrol.Always Guided by God."'It's known as 'hacking the attention economy' and social media has made it even easier to do, said Jeff Hemsley, a professor of information studies at Syracuse University who studies viral social media.How much does this cost?Pricing for Facebook ads is somewhat non-intuitive.The more popular an ad is, the less the organization placing it pays.Thats because Facebook is always trying to balance making money from ads with showing people what it thinks they will want, on the theory that if it shows them a lot of content they dont like, they'll leave.In the aggregate, the price of an ad depends on how much demand there is in the system, how many advertisers are trying to reach people with the specific requested profile (new moms who live in the Pacific Northwest, say) and even what time of day it is, said Logan Young, a vice president of strategy at BlitzMetrics.Facebook uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to make all these determinations on the fly, looking at what the specific user has done in the past and also what people who fit the same profile of interests have done when they've seen the ad, or a similar ad.As we scroll through our Facebook News Feeds, it is constantly running instant, computer-controlled auctions in the background, deciding what ads to show us and how much to charge for them.In the case of the Russian ads, pricing may not have mattered because the desire appears to have been to create feelings among the electorate rather than to make money.Facebook's split testing option, which allows an ad buyer to test multiple ads to see which one resonates best with viewers.(Photo: Facebook) A page showing some of the detailed targeting that buyers can use to target ads to specific groups on Facebook.(Photo: Facebook) How do ad sellers know which ads work best?Its become pretty standard for organizations placing ads on Facebook to create multiple variations of their ad and then test them to see which generate the most viewer engagement.Ads can be sent out for as little as $1 a day, so its simple to test multiple ads, see which one resonates the most and then use it.Sometimes ads might target slightly different groups.In that case, an agency might test which ads resonate best with which group and target each specifically with the ads that seem to work best.Not all work.For example, an ad that features a coloring book image of Sen. Bernie Sanders and was aimed at members of the gay and lesbian community, for example, was seen by only 848 people and got just 54 clicks.An ad placed on Facebook on March 24, 2016 by Russian-linked groups, believed to be part of an attempt to sway the U.S. electorate in the 2016 presidential race.(Photo: Facebook) The way Facebooks algorithms work, the content that does best is often that which elicits some sort of strong reaction, either negative or positive, that would encourage people to either like or forward along the content.In the case of the Russia ads, it look as if this type of testing might have been going on.According to testimony by Facebook's general counsel Colin Stretch, less than $3 was spent on 50% of the ads.That could mean that the Russians created multiple ads, tested them in small batches and decided at least 50% weren't worth placing broadly.Can I change what ads I see?Facebook users have the power to influence the ads they see not only by how they interact with ads in their News Feed, but also by changing the their ad settings.To do that, go to your Facebook Profile, then click on the Settings link.From there, look for the word Ads and click to see and set your "Ad Preferences."Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2hOZOn0
The iPhone has an autocorrect problem. Here's how to fix it:::::Are you having a tough time typing a lowercase "i" on the iPhone lately?It's not just you.Apple said some users are having issues related to the autocorrect feature, where it will automatically correct text if it's misspelled.For an unexplained reason, in iOS 11, the mobile software update launched in September, autocorrect replaces a lowercase "i" to an "A" with a question mark in a box.It's appears widespread, judging from reactions on Twitter: does anyone else phone auto correct the letter i to A ?KB (@kaylaborn24) November 7, 2017 No autocorrect eye did not mean I pic.twitter.com/sG1iZXWdxK Kelly (@k3llytweets) November 6, 2017 According to a support page on Apple's website, the autocorrect issue will be fixed in a future software update.However, there is a workaround to avoid this: 1.Go to your general settings (tap the Settings app, then General).From there, pick Keyboard, then Text Replacement.2.Tap the "+" to add a new entry.3.In the phrase portion, type a capital "I."In the shortcut section, type a lowercase "i."Of course, if the iPhone's autocorrect is still annoying, there are other ways to tame it.Follow Brett Molina on Twitter:

Dinosaurs extinct because asteroid hit the wrong spot on Earth, scientists say:::::A picture taken on September 18, 2017 shows the skeleton of a dinosaur on display at the Dinosaur Hall of the American Museum of Natural History in New York City.(Photo: Angela Weiss, AFP/Getty Images) Dinosaurs might still be roaming the Earth if the celestial object that smashed into the present-day Gulf of Mexico had hit almost anywhere else on the planet.By hitting the rocky terrain of the Yucatan Peninsula about 65 million years ago, however, the impact sent the soot into the air that would trigger a chain reaction and lead to mass extinction.Even with the impressive 5.6-mile diameter of the object, believed to be an asteroid, that caused the event, the odds that it would have wiped out the dinosaurs were only 13%, the Japanese scientists Kunio Kaiho and Naga Oshima have found, according to new research they published on Thursday in the journal Scientific Reports."They were unlucky," Kaiho told Britain's Guardian newspaper.Gambling with extinction Impacts on this scale are rare enough, but the object that initiated what scientists call the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event happened to also hit an area rich in hydrocarbon and sulfate.The force of the impact heated the materials, "forming stratospheric soot and sulfate aerosols and causing extreme global cooling and drought," the scientists report in the paper.German scientists have also speculated on the significance of the site of impact.More: Bandit-masked, feathered dinosaur hid from predators and prey using camouflage "The amount of hydrocarbon and sulfur in rocks varies widely, depending on location," the scientists found; 87% of the Earth's surface did not harbor enough of these deposits."The site of asteroid impact, therefore, changed the history of life on Earth," the scientists wrote.The presumed site of the collision on the Yucatan is a subterranean, partially submerged crater about 180 kilometers wide and 20 kilometers deep.'Particularly bad time' With soot blocking the sunlight, the Earth's average temperature dropped by about 10 degrees Celsius (18 F), destroying plant life and driving the existing ecosystem to collapse.In the end, about 75% of animals were extinct, including nearly all dinosaurs.In 2014, the Edinburgh University paleontologist Steve Brusatte said dinosaurs might have survived the impact "if it had hit a few million years earlier or later.""The asteroid hit at a particularly bad time," he wrote in the journal Nature, speculating that a decrease in the diversity of plant-eating dinosaurs about 66 million years ago might have made the ecosystem more vulnerable to extinction-level events.The impact might have been a stroke of bad luck for dinosaurs, but it also led to "the subsequent macroevolution and diversification of mammals," including humans, Kaiho and Oshima write.Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2i6dpXb
Twitter suspends verification program after white supremacist rally organizer gets blue check:::::Skip in Skip x Embed x Share CLOSE Yesterday, Twitter decided to verify Jason Kessler, an organizer of the August neo-Nazi rally in Charlottesville that left one woman dead.USA TODAY In Charlottesville, Va., on Aug. 11, 2017.(Photo: Mykal McEldowney, USA TODAY Network) SAN FRANCISCO Twitter has suspended its verification program following outrage over handing a blue checkmark to the organizer of the deadly Charlottesville rally in August.This week, Twitter verified the account of Jason Kessler who, after the death of Heather Heyer, tweeted that Heyer was a "fat, disgusting Communist" whose death "was payback time.""Looks like I FINALLY got verified by Twitter," Kessler wrote in a tweet Tuesday."I must be the only working class white advocate with that distinction."Twitter has not said why it verified Kessler's account.In general, Twitter verifies accounts belonging to a person of "public interest" such as celebrities, journalists and politicians but says that verification is not intended to be an endorsement of that individual.But having a verified account on Twitter is a status symbol that confers perks such as appearing at the top of searches.Looks like I FINALLY got verified by Twitter.I must be the only working class white advocate with that distinction.pic.twitter.com/IMXqtmhgvn Jason Kessler (@TheMadDimension) November 7, 2017 "Verification was meant to authenticate identity & voice but it is interpreted as an endorsement or an indicator of importance," Twitter said in a tweet announcing its decision to pause the verification program."We recognize that we have created this confusion and need to resolve it.We have paused all general verifications while we work and will report back soon."More: Twitter suspends alt-right accounts More: Twitter's alt-right purge could backfire More: Twitter accused of political bias in right-wing crackdown More: Twitter vows new crackdown on abuse after Harvey Weinstein boycott CEO Jack Dorsey recently renewed his pledge to wipe out violent groups, hate symbols and speech and tweets that glorify violence.He conceded Thursday that Twitter's verification system is broken."Twitter has made a mess of everything related to race, racial harassment, online hate and this is just one more example of their inability to get it together on this front," said Heidi Beirich, spokeswoman for the Southern Poverty Law Center.We shouldve communicated faster on this (yesterday): our agents have been following our verification policy correctly, but we realized some time ago the system is broken and needs to be reconsidered.And we failed by not doing anything about it.Working now to fix faster.https://t.co/wVbfYJntHj jack (@jack) November 9, 2017 Anyone can apply to be verified on Twitter yet the decision-making process is opaque.White nationalist Richard Spencer has a blue checkmark, but WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has never managed to get his account verified.I was at @Twitter when #Ferguson was on the wall in the Commons.I was at #Twitter when #BlackLivesMatter was on the wall in the Commons.I am glad I am not @Twitter when this happened.@Twitter you have legitimized people who would deny me existence based on my race.https://t.co/1WavV9TWxq Leslie Miley (@shaft) November 9, 2017 Michael Ian Black, who has more than 2 million followers on Twitter, took the company and its CEO to task."Verifying white supremacists reinforces the increasing belief that your site is a platform for hate speech.I don't want to give up Twitter, but I may have to.Who do you value more, users like me or him?"Black tweeted.Leslie Miley, a former Twitter employee who is African American, also tweeted his disgust over Kessler's verification."I was at @Twitter when #Ferguson was on the wall in the Commons.I was at #Twitter when #BlackLivesMatter was on the wall in the Commons.I am glad I am not @Twitter when this happened.@Twitter you have legitimized people who would deny me existence based on my race," he wrote.Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2hWCfZG
China's 'Singles Day' online shopping spree brings in billions:::::Chinese workers transport goods for delivery at a sorting center for JD.com on Singles Day, otherwise known as '11.11' Global Shopping Festival, in Beijing, China, on Nov. 11, 2017.(Photo: How Hwee Young, EPA) Chinese shoppers on Saturday spent billions of dollars in an annual online commercial extravaganza that was once meant as a celebration for lonely hearts.The 24-hour shopping festival, which began at midnight, has broken its own record every year since being launched in 2009, with last year's sales mark of $17.8 billion already exceeded by midday, according to the organizer, e-commerce giant Alibaba.That amount in 2016 surpassed the 2015 total by 32%.The event, now indulged in by all consumers whether with or without a better half, takes pride of place in the calendar of manufacturers and retailers in the country, making up a significant share of annual orders for many businesses.More: Tampax hopes China's Singles' Day will help women switch to tampons With more than half of China's 1.3 billion people being smartphone users, it is no surprise that more than 90% of orders were made by mobile, most of them on taobao.com, Alibaba's main e-commerce platform.Just five minutes after midnight, Alipay, Alibaba's online payment system, was already processing 256,000 transactions per second, double the highest rate recorded last year.The volume of sales means that delivery people will be kept busy over the next six days carrying an estimated 1.5 billion parcels to their new owners.But some of their work this year will be taken over by robots, as China pushes ahead with its policy of increasingly automating menial tasks.Huge waste production Not all are enthusiastic about the massive consumer orgy, however, with environmentalists accusing Alibaba of promoting a culture of over-consumption that creates mountains of waste.Greenpeace said "Singles Day" deliveries last year resulted in 130,000 metric tons (143,000 short tons) of packaging waste in what it called a "disaster for the environment."It says such online shopping festivals are, in fact, more carbon-intensive than "brick-and-mortar shopping."Such objections are, however, not likely to hold Alibaba back from its push toward expanding "Singles Day" onto the global market.The success of the event has also been a boon to many once-struggling Chinese towns and villages that are now dubbed "Taobao villages" after refocusing their local economies around manufacturing for online buyers.This article originally appeared on DW.com.Its content was created separately to USA TODAY.Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2i6WqEl

This pizza maker is an Easy-Bake Oven for adults—and it's awesome:::::Do you love pizza?Do you want to have friends over for a dinner party but hate cooking/have picky eaters in your friend group/refuse to clean up after your messy AF friends?Then have I got some news for you.The Pizzarette (MSRP $120-$200) is a countertop pizza oven that is designed to cook 4-6 fresh, Lunchables-sized pizzas at a time.Credit: Reviewed / Jackson Ruckar We put the countertop contraption to the test to see if it can live up to its claimsand we were pretty surprised by what we found.The claim The Worlds Funnest Pizza Oven [in which] pizzas only take 5-10 minutes to cook!Short cooking times allow you to enjoy the conversation and quickly try a variety of different toppings & combinations for your very own mini pizzas!The manufacturer also promises fast, even cooking, easy cleaning and storage, and an artful display.Credit: Reviewed / Jackson Ruckar How it works Its pretty simplePlace the domed terracotta cover over the oven and plug in the unit.There's no on/off switch or control switches: Just plug it in.Let the oven sit for 15 minutes to heat up while you assemble your pizzas.Credit: Reviewed / Jackson Ruckar The package comes with a dough cutter to fit perfectly on the included spatulas.When you (and the Pizzarette) are ready, put the pizzas onto the 2 perforated metal spatulas and slide them in for 5-10 minutes or until fully cooked.Alternatively, you can slide the pizzas from the spatulas directly onto the baking sheet (more on that later).Credit: Reviewed / Jackson Ruckar Who is it for?People who want to make cooking a social event.Picture a dinner party that doesnt keep you in the kitchen, but rather fosters tailor-made dishes designed and cooked by your guests.It gives the same communal vibe as a raclette machine or Chinese hot pot party, and is also great for groups rife with picky eaters or dietary restrictions.Credit: Reviewed / Jackson Ruckar Credit: Reviewed / Jackson Ruckar Does it work?For the most part, yes.Its well-designed and does what its supposed to: Its a fun concept that cooks any kind of pizza in under 10 minutes and is easy to clean.We did run into a few issues, though.Uneven cooking: Even with dual heating elements and the terracotta dome, the back edge of the pizzas were browned and crisp while the front edge close to the openings were underdone.To achieve an evenly-cooked za, youll need to rotate the pie 180 halfway through cook time.Credit: Reviewed / Jackson Ruckar Too hot to handle: The handle at the top of the terracotta dome becomes too hot to touch after 20 minutes of use.You will need an oven mitt to lift the lid, though you shouldnt have to do this often since you can make one pizza after another by just sliding the trays into the slots.Spatula difficulty: If you cook the pizzas directly on the perforated metal spatulas, they come out perfectly round and flatbut they take a few extra minutes than if you cook them directly on the baking sheet.However, beware: When you slide the pizzas directly onto the baking sheet, the raw dough inevitably buckles and folds, resulting in an uneven result and lots of topping overflow.However, these pies do cook a lot faster on the direct heat.Credit: Reviewed / Jackson Ruckar You can probably guess which pizza was cooked on the spatula (hint: right).Overflow-age: You will need to employ some trial and error to learn the right ratio of toppings to crust.If you overload your pizzas even a little, your toppings will send cheese oozing over your crust and onto the baking sheet, creating a bit of a smokey mess.The non-stick base was very easy to clean, though, so this didn't cause too much of a headache.A damp cloth did the trick.Credit: Reviewed / Jackson Ruckar Is it worth it?The 4-person model retails for $120, and the 6-person model sells for $200.They only come with 2 spatulas, and an additional 2 will cost you $15.Thats a pretty hefty cost, but Im not here to judge: We all know this gadget isnt a necessity in the home.It's built for a niche audience and fun, likely infrequent use.Credit: Reviewed / Jackson Ruckar If you are interested in a novelty pizza oven, the Pizzarette does pretty much exactly what it claims to: It's fun, it cooks pizzas quickly, and both the setup and cleanup are a snap.There is a very slight learning curve: I mastered my pizza craft by the third batch.I was surprised at how well it performed, and I can definitely see this being a crowd pleaser at a dinner party.If you are OK with rotating your pizzas halfway through cook time for even results and have a couple hundred bucks to spare, Id say go for it.We've definitely tried worse!

Don't throw out that shrunken sweater—here’s how you can fix it at home:::::It was my own fault.I usually clean my wool sweaters in the washing machine with cold water on a delicate cycle.I know, you probably wash all your sweaters by hand or send them to the dry cleaners.But my method had always worked beforeuntil the day I accidentally dialed up the wrong cycle.And I didnt realize that I had washed in hot water until it was all over.When I unloaded the washing machine, I nearly cried.My sweaters were tiny.I shook them out, which did not help at all, and laid them flat to dry.Then I hid them in the back of my closet.When fall came, I missed my teal sweater, which was always so warm and cozy.And I decided to try to bring it back from ruin.I figured if I could relax the wool enough, I could stretch it back into shape.I'm a knitter, and I've been blocking sweaters for years, so heres what I did.1.Add 1/3 cup hair conditioner to a sink filled with lukewarm water.Some people use a special wool wash called Eucalan or even baby shampoo for this phase.Credit: Reviewed.com / Cindy Bailen Use a third of a cup of conditioner to relax the sweater.2.Soak the sweater for at least 15 minutes.Credit: Reviewed.com / Cindy Bailen Fill the sink with tepid water, pour in the conditioner, and submerge the sweater.3.Drain the sink.Dont rinse or wring out the sweater, but press the water out gently.Credit: Reviewed.com / Cindy Bailen Let the water out, but don't rinse or wring the sweater.Lay the sweater on a towel.Roll it up to get more of the moisture out.Credit: Reviewed.com / Cindy Bailen Roll the sweater in a clean, dry towel.5.Place the sweater on a dry towel or two.Reshape it to size.A nerdy way to make sure you get the size right is to trace one of your non-shrunken sweaters onto a large sheet of paper, and use it as a template for reshaping.I didn't, but you could try it.Credit: Reviewed.com / Cindy Bailen Lay the sweater out flat on a clean towel.Let it dry overnight.This worked much better than I expected.And I cant even tell you how happy I am to have my favorite sweater back in the rotation.Obviously, you should never wash a wool sweater in hot water.But if you accidentally do, now you know how to fix it.
Bitcoin tumbles from record after upgrade is called off:::::Skip in Skip x Embed x Share CLOSE Some people don't understand what Bitcoin is, but some people stand to make a fortune off the cryptocurrency.Here are the five people who stand to make a killing when they finally cash in on Bitcoin.Time (Photo: Getty Images) Bitcoin fell Friday to its lowest since Nov. 1 as traders bet on its offshoot, bitcoin cash, instead.The offshoot digital currency surged more than 30% to its highest since Aug. 19, and was last trading near $876, according to CoinMarketCap.Bitcoin cash split off from the original version of bitcoin in August as a minority group of developers decided to implement an upgrade in an effort to increase transaction speeds for the digital currency.An alternative bitcoin upgrade proposal, SegWit2x, which initially had more developers behind it, was called off Wednesday due to waning support.More: The costly mistake bitcoin investors are probably making More: Bitcoin jumps $400 in one day and soars to a new record high More: Bitcoin cryptocurrency blasts past $7,000 mark in record rise Bitcoin hit a record high of $7,879.06 that day after the news, but quickly fell and was trading more than 7% lower on the day Friday afternoon near $6,621, according to CoinDesk.That marked its lowest since Nov. 1."You can see people playing back and forth between bitcoin and bitcoin cash trading depending on where they think near-term catalysts may be," said Chris Burniske, author of Cryptoassets: The Innovative Investor's Guide to Bitcoin and Beyond."It's been a battle of investors versus traders that were stockpiling bitcoin to get their 'bitcoin2x dividend.'"Investors at the time of a bitcoin split technically receive equal amounts of the offshoot currency.Disagreements over upgrade proposals have caused uncertainty over the future of bitcoin, but some traders had been buying bitcoin ahead of splits in order to benefit from a payout of a new digital currency and a potential relief rally in bitcoin following the split.Creating bitcoin cash through the "mining" process was 13.6 percent more profitable than mining bitcoin, according to data on Coin Dance's website.CNBC is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.Its content is produced independently of USA TODAY.Skip in Skip x Embed x Share CLOSE Bitcoin is booming, digital currency hedge funds are sprouting at the rate of two a week and the value of all cryptocurrencies has surged tenfold this year to more than $170 billion.Newslook Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2i2j6VX

Glasses are a dud for tech:::::Glasses and tech do not make a successful marriage, says USA TODAY's Jefferson Graham.
Review: McLaren 720S is a jet fighter for the street:::::Skip in Skip x Embed x Share CLOSE The British automaker's new car has quite a few interesting features.USA TODAY McLaren 720S is the English automaker's latest high-tech machine.(Photo: McLaren) SEARS POINT, Calif. Troll the parking lots of Google and Apple and there's a good bet you'll spot the latest high-tech talisman on four wheels: the 2018 McLaren 720S.Where most auto companies strive to inject a dollop of tech in their automobiles, racing-steeped McLaren arguably is a tech company that makes cars.No surprise then that a McLaren plays a starring role in HBO's comedy Silicon Valley as an exceedingly obnoxious venture capitalist's ride of choice.Between an abundant use of carbon fiber (lighter, stronger and pricier than steel), a slavish devotion to engineering (a six-year Cambridge PhD project resulted in a chassis that reacts to road data) and design aesthetics that scream cutting-edge cool (consider the car's winged doors that open up and out), the Surrey, England-based automaker consistently creates machines that are basically grounded fighter jets.McLaren 720S The Drive World Copyright: McLarenAutomotive Ref: McLaren-720S-TheDrive-488.TIF (Photo: McLaren's 720S features a track-focused interior filled with Alcantara suede.)Most folks have heard of Ferrari or Porsche, but maybe not McLaren.It's named after Bruce McLaren, a onetime racer who turned his passion for precision into an automotive enterprise.In the 1990s, McLaren debuted with a road car dubbed the F1.At close to $1 million, it seemed ludicrous.Now that car easily goes for ten times as much.Excluding the exclusive $1 million-plus McLaren P1 hypercar, the latest and greatest McLaren up until this point was the rakish 650S.But much like the new $999 Apple iPhone X is to the iPhone 7, McLaren's engineers pulled out their calculators and managed to improve on their design in almost every way.For example, the 720S has hidden air channels that improved cooling by 15%.Aerodynamic efficiency has doubled thanks in part to a new rear wing profile.Dry weight even decreased to 2,828 lbs.despite added equipment.And a tweaked swivel angle for the doors that ensures you won't hit nearby cars on opening.So what's it like to drive?The McLaren 720S center screen provides drivers with the ability to dial in just how much grip they want the rear tires to have, one of many high tech features on the vehicle.(Photo: McLaren) The car we tested at Sonoma Raceway under the watchful guidance of the track's Simraceway Performance Driving Center instructors stickered at an outrageous $374,000 (including $90,000 in tech and carbon options).Crazy?Yes.But what's crazier still is that you can buy 10 of these automotive rockets for the price of just one Bugatti Chiron.Advantage McLaren.Steering on this car is precise to the point of being intuitive if not downright anticipatory.You feel less like someone driving a car and more like a surgeon wielding a scalpel.Driving even the nicest of performance cars afterwards feels a bit like steering a bus.The 4-liter, twin-turbo V-8 creates 720 horsepower, but delivers the fury in progressive doses so that the transition between full-throttle acceleration to lift-off-the-pedal engine braking to stomping on the brakes quickly becomes a seamless dance after mere minutes in the vehicle.The McLaren 720S has doors that open up and out, which look amazing - but the seats are low and take some effort to get in and out of.(Photo: McLaren) The best is last.In a nod to the 1950s and '60s when cars were truly race-on-Sunday, drive-to-work on Monday transportation, the 720s can switch at the flick of a few settings from a raging track monster to a fairly tractable street car.All this said, there is an element of wonderful if impractical ridiculousness to this car.For starters, McLaren points out that the redesigned carbon fiber tub the cocoon that cradles the driver and passenger in quiet and safety resulted in a much smaller door sill than the outgoing 650S model.That may be so, but getting in and out of the 720S remains comical for all but the most nimble among us.Check your ego at the scissor door.McLaren, the Surrey, England-based sports car maker, makes fewer than 5,000 cars a year, largely by hand.(Photo: McLaren) The 720S has a stereo, but there's no need.Hit the start button and the engine screams to life in a way that will scare animals and small children.And apparently our car's exhaust could be beefed up.Can't imagine.In fact, that I-am-McLaren, hear-me-roar attitude persists throughout the drive, which means that you need to be prepared for a range of reactions.Let's just say you'll see some thumbs-up gestures, and maybe some fingers-up ones.The car is polarizing yet thrilling.Demanding yet intuitive.Technological yet minimalist.Sounds like a lot of people we know in Silicon Valley.WHAT STANDS OUT Performance: From road to track, the car dominates the scene Visibility: Staggeringly good for a supercar Getting in and out: Be prepared to hit the yoga studio first 2018 MCLAREN 720S What?The company's top-of-the-line two-seater When?Available now Where?Made in Surrey, England What makes it go?A 4-liter twin-turbo V-8 that produces 720 horsepower How thirsty?15 city, 22 highway, 18 combined How big?15 feet long, 6 feet wide How much?Starts at $284,000 (about $100,000 more than the entry-level 570 series); but as tested $374,000 due to a slew of track-focused tech options and acres of pricey carbon fiber Overall: The ultimate technology statement Follow USA TODAY reporter Marco della Cava on Twitter.Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2AuA3PL

Cord cutting swells in third quarter, but Net TV services offset defections:::::Skip in Skip x Embed x Share CLOSE Tame your budget-busting cable bill with these money-saving tips!USA TODAY (Photo: Getty Images) Cord cutting continued during the third quarter of the year with hundreds of thousands of defectors from traditional pay TV providers.But the net result is a glass half full or half empty, depending on your point of view.As the pay TV marketplace evolves -- and fledgling streaming video services take hold -- consumers may find fewer deals as TV providers focus on high-paying customers for full-sized traditional TV bundles.With cable, satellite and telco TV providers began releasing their July-September financial performances, some analysts estimated that cord cutting losses could hit 1 million for the quarter.In the end, that number will be about right, with pay TV companies possibly losing more than 1 million subscribers.Follow USA TODAY Tech on Facebook But that doesn't tell the whole story.Dish Network, which was the last publicly-traded pay TV provider to release its third-quarter earnings, on Thursday reported it lost about 129,000 pay TV subscribers during the quarter.That result came after accounting for 145,000 customers in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, which Dish removed from its total because of hurricanes hitting there, and 16,000 net new pay TV subscriber additions in the U.S. states.Dishs Net-delivered subscription live TV service Sling TV, launched in February 2015, helped offset losses of Dish's satellite service.Similarly, DirecTV Now helped offset AT&T's lost subscribers to its DirecTV satellite and U-verse fiber-delivered TV services.Overall, the pay TV industry will probably lose a net total of about 400,000 subscribers for the last quarter, says Bruce Leichtman, president and principal analyst for Leichtman Research in Durham, N.H. That compares to about 250,000 lost subscribers during the July-September period a year ago, he says.Some U.S. losses could also be attributed to the hurricane disrupting service to subscribers in Texas and Florida, he said.And other direct-to-consumer broadband-delivered pay TV services such as Hulu, PlayStation Vue and YouTube Live, which have not released subscriber numbers, "would obviously make up for some of those losses," Leichtman said.Evercore ISI analysts Vijay Jayant and James Ratcliffe agreed in a note to investors Thursday that when all broadband-delivered subscriptions services are taken into account, by their estimates, "the acceleration in traditional Pay TV net losses (year-over-year) was almost entirely offset by an acceleration in (virtual multichannel video programming distributors) subscriber gains."Going forward, traditional pay TV providers may focus on higher-paying customers, while letting lower-paying customers opt for broadband-delivered TV services, which cost $25-up monthly, Leichtman says.Dish Network's Q3 results offer some insights: the company cut subscriber acquisition costs by 20%, while the average monthly revenue per subscriber fell only 2.5% to $87.23."Its the mix of consumers and provider strategies that are impacting the market," Leichtman said.Follow USA TODAY reporter Mike Snider on Twitter: @MikeSnider.Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2hXrnKY

This investment turned $1,000 into $2.2 billion in less than 8 years:::::Skip in Skip x Embed x Share CLOSE Some people don't understand what Bitcoin is, but some people stand to make a fortune off the cryptocurrency.Here are the five people who stand to make a killing when they finally cash in on Bitcoin.Time That's a compound annual return of 571%.A $1,000 investment in bitcoin back in March 2010 would have purchased approximately 333,333 bitcoin (assuming no fees), which as of Nov. 1, 2017, would have yielded a value of $2.2 billion.(Photo: Getty Images) Traditionally, the stock market is the go-to investment for people who understand the value that time and compounding can bring to the table.Over its long history, the stock market has returned an average of 7% annually, inclusive of dividend reinvestment.This works out to a rough doubling of your invested nest egg once a decade.The world's top investment this decade Recently, though, all eyes have been on the incredible returns of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin.This year, bitcoin is approaching a nearly 600% gain, and it's up well over 2,000% since its low point in 2015.By comparison, the broad-based S&P 500 has taken decades to return what bitcoin has in just two years.In fact, bitcoin's market cap recently touched $110 billion, which is larger than quite a few established Dow Jones Industrial Average components.Admittedly, few, if any, people could have envisioned what bitcoin would become back in 2009 when it debuted or in March 2010 when it was first listed on the now-defunct BitcoinMarket.com exchange.However, if you were lucky enough to grab hold of any amount of bitcoin back in March 2010, when it hit a low of $0.003 (that's three-tenths of one cent), you'd be sitting on a veritable gold mine right about now.A $1,000 investment in bitcoin back in March 2010 would have purchased approximately 333,333 bitcoin (assuming no fees), which as of Nov. 1, 2017, would have yielded a value of $2.2 billion.That's right, folks: $1,000 to $2.2 billion in just seven years and eight months.That's just your run-of-the-mill compound annual return of 571%.More:Bitcoin for beginners: Everything you need to know More:Bitcoin's creator may be worth $6 billion but people still don't know who it is More:The costly mistake bitcoin investors are probably making Explaining bitcoin's meteoric rise What lit a fire under bitcoin and allowed it the opportunity to grow so quickly?It pretty much boils down to three factors.The most logical explanation is the potential for blockchain, which is the digital and decentralized ledger that underlies most virtual currencies.Blockchain is what logs all transactions without the need for a financial intermediary like a bank, and it's usually open source, which makes altering logged data almost impossible.This added security is what makes this new technology such an attractive option for the financial services industry.Though still in its infancy, pundits suggest that blockchain could be worth billions.Second, bitcoin has been moved by news-driven events.Examples include a handful of brand-name companies announcing that they'd begin accepting bitcoin as a form of payment in 2014, as well as Japan revealing earlier this year that it would begin accepting bitcoin as a form of legal tender.This year, bitcoin is approaching a nearly 600% gain, and it's up well over 2,000% since its low point in 2015.(Photo: Getty Images) Perhaps the biggest recent news comes from futures trading giant CME Group (NASDAQ: CME), which announced this past week that it plans to launch futures trading for bitcoin.Doing so should help reduce some of the wild volatility tied to bitcoin by allowing institutional investors an easier way to invest in the virtual currency.At the same time, it gives CME Group a brand-new channel of trading revenue considering the popularity of bitcoin.Third, emotions and scarcity have played a role.As noted, listing on the CME futures trading platform will broaden the scope of trading for institutional investors, but it hasn't always been this way.In fact, bitcoin has predominantly been priced by retail investors since institutional investors were barred from trading in bitcoin.Retail investors are far more likely to allow their emotions to get the better of them than institutional investors, which has led to very strong rallies, and declines, throughout bitcoin's eight-year history.Three major concerns about bitcoin's parabolic move However, bitcoin's meteoric rise may ultimately not last long.One concern is that regulation acts as a double-edged sword for bitcoin, and virtual currencies as a whole.Increased regulation in the space would help to validate that these virtual currencies have some sort of value.Conversely, regulations can also close doors for cryptocurrencies.An example would be China and South Korea both outlawing initial coin offerings, as well as China announcing that it would be shutting down all of its domestic cryptocurrency exchanges.Bitcoin's blockchain is where its value lies, not the virtual currency.Yet, many are enamored with the potential for the currency itself.(Photo: Getty Images) A second issue is that while few people would dispute what blockchain could bring to the table, no one has any idea what its true value is.Investors have a storied history of overestimating the adoption of new technology.It's happened time and again throughout history, and there's nothing to say that blockchain isn't the next hot thing on the list.For the time being, blockchain technology is only being tested in small-scale and pilot projects, suggesting it could be some time before it has any chance of broader adoption.Building on this point, there's absolutely nothing to suggest that bitcoin's blockchain will be the one big businesses choose.Although bitcoin recently upgraded its blockchain in order to boost capacity, speed up settlement times, and lower transaction fees, it's competitor Ethereum that's drawn far more interest from enterprises given its smart contract protocols built into its blockchain.With such a low barrier to entry in developing blockchain, bitcoin could find itself exceptionally vulnerable on its current perch.But the biggest concern of all might be that investors are misconstruing what's really important.Bitcoin's blockchain is where its value lies, not the virtual currency.Yet, many are enamored with the potential for the currency itself.Buying into bitcoin gives you no stake in a company.Instead, you own virtual currency that you'd likely struggle to live off if you needed to buy basic goods and services.Now more than ever, I'll reiterate my view that bitcoin looks like a bubble waiting to pop.More:Follow USA TODAY Money and Tech on Facebook Skip in Skip x Embed x Share CLOSE Bitcoin is booming, digital currency hedge funds are sprouting at the rate of two a week and the value of all

Exclusive: Rupert Murdoch twice discussed CNN with AT&T CEO - sources:::::NEW YORK (Reuters) - Rupert Murdoch telephoned AT&T Inc (T.N) Chief Executive Randall Stephenson twice in the last six months and talked about cable network CNN, sources briefed on the matter told Reuters on Friday.According to one of the sources, the 86-year-old executive chairman of Twenty-First Century Fox Inc (FOXA.O) offered to buy CNN in both conversations.Another source said Murdoch had zero interest in owning CNN.Representatives of Twenty-First Century Fox, AT&T and Time Warner, CNNs parent, declined comment.CNN has become the focal point in antitrust approval of AT&Ts $85.4 billion deal to buy Time Warner Inc (TWX.N), hatched in October 2016.U.S. Department of Justice staff have recommended that AT&T sell either its DirecTV unit or Time Warners Turner Broadcasting unit - which includes CNN - a government official told Reuters on Thursday, in order to gain antitrust approval.On Thursday Stephenson said he had no interest in selling CNN and that he was ready to defend the deal in court if necessary.According to one of the sources on Friday, Murdoch called Stephenson twice, unprompted, on May 16 and Aug. 8 and on both occasions asked if CNN was for sale.Stephenson replied both times that it was not, according to the source.TRUMP COMMENTS WEIGH The fate of CNN has broader political significance.U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly attacked the network for its coverage of his campaign and his administration, while he has publicly praised Murdochs Fox News.In the run-up to last years election he vowed that as president his Justice Department would block AT&Ts purchase of Time Warner.He has not commented on the transaction since taking office in January.Trumps comments have provoked concern that he may improperly influence the U.S. Department of Justice to block the deal.The White House has said Trump has not spoken to the attorney general about the matter.Nevertheless, a group of eight Democratic U.S. senators on Friday wrote to Makan Delrahim, head of the Justice Departments antitrust division, urging the department to oppose any attempt by the White House to interfere with antitrust law enforcement decisions, particularly for political reasons.Rupert Murdoch stands at the U.S. Open men's final in New York, September 10, 2017.REUTERS/Mike Segar Delrahim said he had not had any contact with the White House or the attorney general on the matter, speaking at an event at the USC Gould School of Law in Los Angeles later in the day.Ive got to keep my nose down and be a law enforcer and do whats good and what Ive committed to doing to the American people, said Delrahim.But he appeared to voice doubts about AT&Ts reasoning that the purchase of Time Warner would not result in a company with too much power because the combined company would have to compete with powerful new online rivals such as Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) and Facebook Inc (FB.O).Delrahim referred to a comment by former President Ronald Reagan that the nine most terrifying words in the English language are: Im from the government and Im here to help.FILE PHOTO: Rupert Murdoch, executive chairman of News Corporation, reacts during a panel discussion at the B20 meeting of company CEOs in Sydney, July 17, 2014.REUTERS/Jason Reed//File Photo Id say you should be equally terrified when someone in an incumbent company, whatever industry, comes to you and says Im here to help you against the evils of Netflix, Amazon, Google and Facebook, said Delrahim.Some of these pro-competitive comments and justifications remind me of that quote strongly.NO SENSE It would not be the first time Murdoch has attempted to take control of CNN.His Twenty-First Century Fox made an $80 billion offer for Time Warner in 2014 but abandoned the plan in the face of Time Warners resistance.At that time, Fox had planned to divest CNN - which competes with Fox News - in order to avoid antitrust issues.There is no law against a company owning two cable networks, but there is a Federal Communications Commission prohibition on owning two broadcast networks.A Fox deal with CNN could also raise antitrust concerns because of the market share that a combined company would have among cable news viewers.I have been called and asked if I would sell CNN by numerous people, Stephenson told the New York Times DealBook conference on Thursday.But he added: Selling CNN makes no sense.Fox has held talks in the last few weeks to sell most of its film and television assets to Walt Disney Co (DIS.N), CNBC reported this week, which would leave the company with its Fox News, sports programming and broadcasting stations.. Twenty-First Century Fox would sell its stake in European satellite broadcaster Sky Plc (SKYB.L) in a deal with Disney, according to CNBCs report.Fox is trying to buy the 61 percent of Sky it does not already own but the bid is strongly opposed by some lawmakers and has been subject to lengthy regulatory scrutiny.Time Warner shares closed up 4 percent at $90.60.
Bitcoin slides by over $1,000 in less than 48 hours:::::LONDON (Reuters) - Bitcoin dropped below $7,000 on Friday to trade more than $1,000 down from an all-time high hit on Wednesday, as some traders dumped it for a clone called Bitcoin Cash, sending its value up around a third.A bitcoin (virtual currency) coin placed on Dollar banknotes is seen in this illustration picture, November 6, 2017.REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration Bitcoin has been on a tear in recent months, with a vertiginous sevenfold increase in value since the start of the year that has led to many warnings the bitcoin market - now worth well over $100 billion - has become a bubble that is about to burst.It reached a record high of $7,888 around 1800 GMT on Wednesday after a software upgrade planned for next week that could have split the cryptocurrency in a so-called fork was suspended.But it has quickly retreated from that peak, falling to as low as $6,718 around 1330 GMT on Friday.It later recovered a touch to trade around $6,880 by 1645 GMT, but that was still down almost 4 percent on the day.Bitcoin is all ups and downs, said Thomas Bertani, chief executive of Eidoo, a cryptocurrency wallet provider that recently became the first startup in the space to take out a full-page advert in the Wall Street Journal newspaper.The market realized that the price rise was an over-reaching, so people started selling... (and) there are many long and short positions that amplify price movements.As bitcoin tumbled, Bitcoin Cash, which was generated from another software split on Aug.1, surged, trading up as much as 35 percent on the day to around $850, according to industry website Coinmarketcap.Bitcoin Cashs transactions are processed in so-called blocks that are larger in capacity than bitcoins, so can therefore in theory allow for more transactions to be processed at any given time, making transaction fees much cheaper.The fork that had been planned for next week, known as SegWit2x, had also intended to increase the capacity of the blocks, and could thus have reduced fees for bitcoin transactions.Any investors, therefore, that see bitcoin more as a currency than a store of value might be choosing to buy into Bitcoin Cash now that Segwit2x had been scrapped, Bertani said.People who had been supporting Segwit2x could as an alternative move to Bitcoin Cash, he said.There are good reasons to believe that Bitcoin Cash could be an alternative for people who believe that low fees on bitcoin transactions are needed today.
Nvidia shares set record as Volta chips ensure future growth:::::(Reuters) - Shares of Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O) hit a record on Friday, after it posted stellar quarterly results powered by higher demand for graphics chips used in gaming and data centers, and the rapid adoption of its new Volta chips for AI and driverless cars.The logo of Nvidia Corporation is seen during the annual Computex computer exhibition in Taipei, Taiwan May 30, 2017.REUTERS/Tyrone Siu Shares of the chipmaker rose about 6 percent in morning trade on Friday - hitting a record of $217.18.Nvidias gaming revenue in the latest quarter blew past Wall Street estimates but it was the data center business, the driver of future growth, that made analysts stand up and take notice as revenue in the unit more than doubled.Revenue from the data center business, Nvidias second-biggest revenue contributor, rose to $501 million, beating analysts estimate of $474.2 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Datacenter results have been stronger than forecast and we underestimated the value the market would assign to this franchise, Nomura Instinet analyst Romit Shah wrote in a client note.Shah raised his rating on the stock to neutral from reduce.The company, which gets the bulk of revenue from gaming where it supplies chips for gaming consoles, has seen explosive growth at its data centers operations.Nvidia launched the Volta chips in May as part of its Tesla V100 data center graphic processing unit (GPU) that will power systems from artificial intelligence (AI) to driverless cars.Voltas launch we suspect was a major catalyst for Intel to go back to the drawing board with its AI chip Nervana, the tactical need to use AMD GPU, and the hire of Raja Koduri to head Intels new Graphics effort, said Rosenblatt Securities analyst Hans Mosesmann.Early this week, chipmaker Intel Corp (INTC.O) partnered with bitter rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD.O) for a graphics chip that will help the chipmakers take on Nvidia.Intel also named AMDs ex-GPU head, Koduri, as chief architect of the newly-formed Core and Visual Computing Group.Shipments of the Tesla V100 GPU began in Q2 and ramped significantly in Q3 driven primarily by demand from cloud service providers and high-performance computing, Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress said on a conference call on Thursday.Nvidias data centers business, which caters to clients such as Amazon.com Incs (AMZN.O) Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Corps (MSFT.O) Azure, was a point of concern after a disappointing showing last quarter.But the Volta chip changed all that.The ramp of Volta seems to be tracking well, and more importantly, has significant runway ahead, in our view, as a broader set of customers adopt the new architecture in the coming quarters, Goldman Sachs analysts wrote in a client note.The company claims that Volta will fuel breakthroughs in every industry and humanity's moonshots like eradicating cancer, intelligent customer experiences and self-driving vehicles.bit.ly/2iJPeNN At least 14 analysts raised their price target on the stock.SunTrust Robinson analysts were the most bullish with a price target of $253.Nomura raised its target to $190 from $110.Out of 37 brokerages covering the stock, 20 have a buy or higher rating; 14 on hold and 3 on sell or lower.Including Friday gains, Nvidia shares have soared more than 100 percent this year, making it a top percentage gainer on the Philadelphia SE Semiconductor index .SOX.
Disney shares rise as focus turns to streaming commitment:::::(Reuters) - Walt Disneys (DIS.N) shares rose 3 percent on Friday, as Wall Street shrugged off poor financial results and focused instead on the media giants commitment to build a service that will compete aggressively with video streaming pioneer Netflix.FILE PHOTO: The logo of the Disney store on the Champs Elysee is seen in Paris, France, March 3, 2016.REUTERS/Jacky Naegelen/File Photo Disneys sharper focus on streaming comes amid subscriber losses at its legacy cable networks that include ESPN and ABC, which many viewers are deserting for cheaper, on-demand streaming options.On Thursday, Disney Chief Executive Bob Iger talked up his commitment to streaming, calling it the companys highest priority this year.In a step that will further cement Disneys strong position as a content powerhouse, Iger also unveiled a deal to develop a new Star Wars trilogy.Perhaps more importantly, Iger said Disneys planned streaming service would be substantially cheaper than Netflix.Analysts said the lower price likely reflected Disneys relatively smaller content slate but that the move could help the service gain subscribers quickly.We think Disney wants strong uptake early on and that this move recognizes that the equity market rewards strong (streaming) subscriber growth, RBC Capital Markets analyst Steven Cahall said.To compete better with Netflix and other streaming services, Disney has also said it will keep new Disney releases out of Netflix, starting from 2019.Disney was making all the right strategic decisions as it builds out the streaming business, Evercore ISIs Vijay Jayant said.The company is developing family-friendly streaming services that will sell directly to consumers.It will launch a sports-focused service called ESPN Plus in early 2018.According to news reports, Disney has held talks in recent weeks about a potential acquisition of most of Twenty-First Century Foxs (FOXA.O) media assets including FX, National Geographic and its movie studio.While Iger declined to comment on the speculation on Thursday, analysts said a deal could help Disney expand its content library as it prepares to launch the streaming service.Disney's shares have been a laggard on the Dow Jones industrial average .DJI, having fallen about 1.5 percent this year through Thursday, compared to the 18.7 percent gain the index has seen.Netflixs stock, which has climbed 52 percent this year, was down 2 percent on Thursday morning.
Uber loses UK appeal bid to overturn workers' rights decision:::::LONDON (Reuters) - Taxi app Uber [UBER.UL] lost a bid on Friday to overturn a decision by a tribunal which had said its drivers deserved workers rights such as the minimum wage, in a blow to the company as it also battles to keep its license in London.Uber immediately said it would appeal to higher courts against Fridays decision by the Employment Appeal Tribunal (EAT) in central London.The U.S. ride-hailing service has faced regulatory and legal setbacks around the world amid opposition from traditional taxi services and concern among some regulators.It has been forced to quit several countries, such as Denmark and Hungary.Last year, two drivers successfully argued at a British employment tribunal that Uber exerted significant control over them to provide an on-demand taxi service and should grant them workers rights such as holiday entitlement and rest breaks.That decision did not automatically apply to the apps 50,000 drivers in Britain but was seen as likely to prompt more claims.It could benefit workers at thousands of companies including firms in the gig economy, where individuals work for multiple employers without a fixed contract, such as courier Deliveroo.The Independent Workers Union of Great Britain, which backed the two drivers, said these companies were choosing to deprive workers of their rights.Todays victory is further proof, as if any more was needed, that the law is clear and these companies are simply choosing to deprive workers of their rights, said Jason Moyer-Lee, the IWGBs general secretary.A photo illustration shows the Uber app on a mobile telephone, as it is held up for a posed photograph, with London Taxis in the background, in London, Britain November 10, 2017.REUTERS/Simon Dawson Uber says its drivers enjoy the flexibility of their work and are self-employed, entitling them in British law to only basic entitlements such as health and safety.The firm argued in September that its drivers operate in the same way as minicabs, or private hire vehicles, which sprung up in Britain more than 50 years ago.Slideshow (3 Images) On Friday it confirmed it would appeal against the latest decision.A spokesman said the company had 14 days to submit its application and decide whether to apply to take the case to the Supreme Court, Britains top judicial body.Over the last year we have made a number of changes to our app to give drivers even more control, said Uber UKs Acting General Manager Tom Elvidge in a statement.The main reason why drivers use Uber is because they value the freedom to choose if, when and where they drive.Yaseen Aslam, one of the drivers involved in the case, said they would continue their fight to ensure workers rights were respected.I am glad that the judge today confirmed what I and thousands of drivers have known all along: that Uber is not only exploiting drivers, but also acting unlawfully, he said.Uber, which is valued at around $70 billion with backers including Goldman Sachs and BlackRock, will be back in court on Dec. 11 to appeal a decision by Londons transport regulator to strip the app of its license.Transport for London shocked Uber in September by deeming it unfit to run a taxi service and refusing to renew its license, citing the firms approach to reporting serious criminal offences and background checks on drivers.
Equifax warns on post-breach costs, revenue hit:::::(Reuters) - Equifax Inc on Friday issued a fourth-quarter profit outlook that fell short of Wall Street expectations, saying the massive breach of its consumer data earlier this year would hurt sales and result in costs of $60 million to $75 million during the period.Credit reporting company Equifax Inc. corporate offices are pictured in Atlanta, Georgia, U.S., September 8, 2017.REUTERS/Tami Chappell Executives at the credit-reporting company blamed the expected revenue decline on delays in contract signing from business and government customers, which began in the third quarter and continued into the current quarter.Were hoping to win back their trust and then be able to regain the business that weve indicated has been deferred, Chief Financial Officer John Gamble said in the call.Were still working through that process.Equifax shares were little changed in midday trading.They have dropped around 25 percent since the companys Sept. 7 disclosure of the breach that exposed sensitive data on 145.5 million consumers.Analysts on Fridays call probed Equifax for further details on its recovery effort.The company declined to provide estimates on total costs from the breach or say how much might be covered by insurance.When is your cyber security going to be up to code, or up to standard, or however you want to define that?asked Wells Fargo Securities analyst William Warmington.This is a journey, interim Chief Executive Paulino do Rego Barros Jr responded, saying the firm was working to make sure its security team could protect current systems.The company forecast fourth-quarter adjusted profit of $1.32 to $1.38 per share, below the average forecast of $1.42 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.It said fallout from the breach will cut revenue by 3 percent to 4 percent in the quarter.The company expects revenue of $825 million to $835 million, compared to the average analyst forecast of $833.65 million.Investors are looking for clues to help assess whether the breach will have a long-term impact on the companys sales and profit, Stephens Inc analyst Brett Huff said.The latest management commentary generally supports the view that the long-term business model looks at least okay, said Huff, who has an equal weight rating on Equifax shares.Equifax also said it has halted a share buyback program.
China shopping festival smashes record with $25 billion haul:::::SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Alibaba (BABA.N), the Chinese e-commerce giant, said on Saturday its Singles Day sales extravaganza hit $25.4 billion, smashing its own record from last year and cementing it as the worlds biggest shopping event.Once a celebration for Chinas lonely hearts, Singles Day has become an annual 24-hour buying frenzy that exceeds the combined sales for Black Friday and Cyber Monday in the United States, and acts as a barometer for Chinas consumers.As tills shut midnight on Saturday, Alibabas live sales ticker registered 168.3 billion yuan, up 39 percent from 120.7 billion yuan last year.The dollar figure was up more steeply due to the strength of the yuan against the greenback this year.The event began soon after a star-studded event in Shanghai late on Friday.As midnight hit, a deluge of pre-orders helped drive a billion dollars of sales on Alibabas platforms in the first two minutes and $10 billion in just over an hour.In terms of scale it just dwarfs any other event out there, said Ben Cavender, Shanghai-based principal at China Market Research Group.At just past the halfway mark, the headline gross merchandise volume swept past last years dollar total just shy of $18 billion.Shortly afterwards, sales surpassed the 2016 total in the local currency.The event gets shoppers around China scouting for bargains and loading up their online shopping carts, while delivery men - and robots - brace for an estimated 1.5 billion parcels expected over the next six days.This is a big event for China, for the Chinese economy, Joseph Tsai, Alibabas co-founder and vice chairman, said.On Singles Day, shopping is a sport, its entertainment.Tsai said rising disposable incomes of Chinas over 300 million middle-class consumers was helping drive the companys online sales - and would continue.This powerful group is propelling the consumption of China, he said.The final total - more than the GDP of Iceland or Cameroon - leaves other shopping days in the shade.Cyber Monday in the United States saw $3.45 billion in online sales last year.Investors closely watch the headline number, though some analysts say the way it is calculated is too opaque.The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission launched a probe into Alibabas accounting practices in 2016, including into its Singles Day data.That investigation is as yet unresolved.Jack Ma, Chairman of Alibaba Group, and actor Nicole Kidman attend a show during Alibaba Group's 11.11 Singles' Day global shopping festival in Shanghai, China, November 10, 2017.REUTERS/Aly Song Last year, the sales number rose by nearly a third at the eighth iteration of the event - though that was slower than the 60 percent increase logged in 2015.SLOWER GROWTH?At Alibabas Friday night gala, the companys co-founder and chairman, Jack Ma, hosted guests including the actress Nicole Kidman, singer Pharrell Williams and Chinese musicians and film stars such as Zhang Ziyi and Fan Bingbing.The excitement around the shopping blitz, however, masks the challenges facing Chinas online retailers such as Alibaba and JD.com Inc (JD.O), which are having to spend more to compete for shoppers in a broader economy where growth is slowing.Slideshow (6 Images) A lot of the lower hanging fruit has been picked and theres increased competition for a share of consumer spending, said Matthew Crabbe, Asia Pacific research director at Mintel.The sale did though beat his forecast of 20 percent growth.Online retailers were being forced to push offline as well as overseas to attract new shoppers, and the overall online retail market was close to saturation, raising questions about whether current rapid growth could be sustained.Theyre having to spill over out of the purely online realm into the wider consumer market, Crabbe said.This has sparked deals to buy bricks-and-mortar stores in China, and overseas tie-ups especially in Southeast Asia.Technology, too, has been key, with virtual reality dressing rooms and live fashion shows to attract shoppers.Alibaba also said it had turned 100,000 physical shops around China into smart stores for this years event.Goods perused by people at the stores, but then bought and paid for on Alibabas platforms, were added towards the sales total.China Market Research Groups Cavender said brands were also increasingly making smaller price cuts to avoid margins getting killed, and were often asking for deposits in advance.In previous years, prices were often halved.Fu Wenyue, a 23-year-old dresser in Shanghai, said offers this year were smaller but more personalized as brands used big data to hone their targets.Fu spent 4,000 yuan on clothes, cosmetics and kitchen utensils in pre-event sales, and kept shopping on the day.In actual fact, I think I spent even more than I did last year, she said.
Amazon seeks staff in European insurance push:::::LONDON (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc is expanding its nascent European product insurance business, according to recent job adverts, which industry watchers say could signal the start of broader ambitions in insurance.The logo of Amazon is seen at the company logistics center in Lauwin-Planque, northern France, February 20, 2017.REUTERS/Pascal Rossignol Amazon Protect, which provides extensions to manufacturers warranties for items like mobile phones or washing machines bought on Amazons website, launched last year in Europe.It is Amazons only insurance business globally.Recent job advertisements for the EU product insurance division described launching a new business and creating a new palette of services.This is a sure sign disruption is on the way for the UK insurance market, said Patricia Davies, financial services analyst at data and analytics firm GlobalData.An Amazon UK spokesman declined to comment.Specialist insurers are concerned that Amazon and other online players will encroach on their territory, and are looking to partner with them.Investment in insurtech firms in Europe has risen sharply in the first half of 2017, often with the backing of big insurers.[nL5N1LW28W] Amazon Protect launched in Britain in April 2016, quickly expanding to the firms main European markets of France, Germany, Italy and Spain.Its policies give customers an extension on manufacturers two-year warranties for up to five years, insuring against accidental damage, breakdown and theft.The Warranty Group, which underwrites Amazon Protect policies, did not respond to a request for comment.Amazon posted the jobs on LinkedIn and Where Women Work in recent weeks.Along with internal and external partners, we are re-defining the warranties and product insurance experience, disrupting the way traditional product insurance services are acquired and delivered and creating a new palette of services, one job ad, which is no longer accepting applications, said.Another asked: Would you like to take part in launching a new business?Insurers have been looking at ways of tapping into the so-called connected home, for instance by offering home insurance cover which will alert you if your pipes have sprung a leak.Amazons launch of voice-activated home personal assistant Alexa could give an opportunity for it to expand into this area of home insurance, Davies said.I dont expect them to come up with traditional insurance products, she said.
U.S. safety board to probe self-driving shuttle crash in Las Vegas:::::WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Federal transportation safety officials headed to Las Vegas on Friday to investigate a collision this week between a self-driving shuttle bus on its first day of service and a truck, which was blamed on human error.The first public self-driving shuttle, launched as a pilot project sponsored by AAA and Keolis is shown in downtown Las Vegas, Nevada, November 10, 2017.Courtesy of AAA/Keolis/Handout via REUTERS The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board, which has the power to issue safety recommendations and determines probable causes of crashes, wants to learn more about how self-driving vehicles interact with their environment and the other human-driven vehicles around them, said NTSB spokesman Christopher ONeil.There have been other crashes involving self-driving vehicles but this was the first involving a self-driving vehicle operating in public service, ONeil said.Four NTSB investigators were expected to arrive in Las Vegas on Friday.The Navya Arma, an autonomous and electric vehicle operated by Keolis North America, went into service on Wednesday.A few hours later, a delivery truck backed into the stopped shuttle, according to a reporter on the shuttle and one of its sponsor companies.Las Vegas police issued the truck driver a ticket, the city government said in a blog post.The shuttles front end sustained minor damage, including a crumpled front fender, and resumed service on Thursday.The shuttle did what it was supposed to do, in that its sensors registered the truck and the shuttle stopped, the city said.The Automobile Association of America (AAA) of Southern Nevada, one of the shuttles sponsors, said it would assist the safety boards investigation.Working together and sharing information will ensure this new technology is safely implemented for the public, and thats AAAs top priority, the organization said in a statement.The shuttle is also sponsored by the city of Las Vegas, Keolis North America and the Regional Transportation Commission of Southern Nevada.Reporter Jeff Zurschmeide, who was on the shuttle at the time of the crash, said the self-driving vehicle did what it was programmed to do but not everything a human driver might do.Thats a critical point, Zurschmeide wrote on digitaltrends.com.We had about 20 feet of empty street behind us (I looked), and most human drivers would have thrown the car into reverse and used some of that space to get away from the truck.Or at least leaned on the horn and made our presence harder to miss.The crash follows a rising number of incidents involving human drivers behaving improperly or recklessly around self-driving cars.There have been 12 crashes in California alone since Sept. 8 involving General Motors Cos self-driving unit, Cruise Automation.All were the fault of human drivers in other vehicles, GM told regulators.The NTSB investigated a May 2016 crash of a Tesla Inc Model S that killed a driver using the vehicles semi-autonomous Autopilot system.In September, the board recommended that auto safety regulators and automakers take steps to ensure that semi-autonomous systems were not misused.
Equifax profit falls as hacking costs take toll:::::(Reuters) - Equifax Inc (EFX.N) on Thursday reported lower quarterly profit, and quarterly revenue missed estimates, as the credit bureau warned that its massive data breach had prompted some customers to hold back business.FILE PHOTO: Credit reporting company Equifax Inc. corporate offices are pictured in Atlanta, Georgia, U.S., September 8, 2017.REUTERS/Tami Chappell/File Photo The breach, which compromised sensitive data of 145.5 million people, has harmed the companys reputation and prompted investigations in every U.S. state, a federal criminal probe and hundreds of lawsuits.Equifax said it was not possible to estimate how much it would cost the company to respond to the probes and litigation.The Atlanta-based company said it recorded $87.5 million in expenses related to the hack during the quarter, including legal fees, investigation of the breach, and free credit monitoring for U.S. consumers whose data was exposed in the breach.Equifax estimated a range of additional costs between $56 million and $110 million to continue providing the free services.The company warned there could be further attacks.We cannot assure that all potential causes of the incident have been identified and remediated and will not occur again, it said in a quarterly filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.Eric Johnson, dean of Vanderbilt Universitys Owen Graduate School of Management, said that uncertainty could cost Equifax future business.They need to be able to nail those pieces and have a clear explanation of what happened and how they solved it, said Johnson.I think they can get there, but they arent there now.Johnson estimated the costs from the breach will total in the hundreds of millions of dollars, but that lost revenue could be even larger.The company said the breach was already taking a toll on sales.We believe that certain of our customers have determined to defer new contracts or projects unless and until we can provide assurances regarding our ability to prevent unauthorized access to our systems and the data we maintain, it said in the SEC filing.Equifax needs to do a better job of communicating whether it believes the hackers are still inside its network, said Mark Rasch, a former U.S. federal cyber-crimes prosecutor who advises businesses on responding to breaches.What I want to know is How did they get in?and How are they preventing hackers from getting in the future?They havent answered those questions, said Rasch.The SEC is one of more than a dozen regulatory bodies investigating Equifax over the hack.Additionally, several agencies, including the U.S.Attorneys Office for the Northern District of Georgia, had probes into the trading activities of some Equifax employees before the breach was made public, the company said.Equifax reported third-quarter revenue of $834.8 million, missing analysts average estimate of $845.94 million, according to I/B/E/S Thomson Reuters.Net income attributable to Equifax fell to $96.3 million, or 79 cents per diluted share, from $132.8 million, or $1.09 per diluted share, a year earlier.Adjusted for one-time costs, such as hacking- and merger-related expenses, Equifax said it earned $1.53 per share, topping analysts average estimates by 4 cents.Shares of Equifax, which reported after the closing bell, were down a penny in aftermarket trading at $108.94.The stock is down around 24 percent since Sept. 7, when Equifax disclosed the breach.

WiFi-equipped school buses help students get online:::::CNN has produced this story in partnership with the GSMA #caseforchange project.To find out more about how mobile connectivity can change the world, follow #caseforchange on YouTube, Facebook and Twitter.(CNN) The digital age continues to spark creative developments in education.Wireless gadgets are now commonplace in the typical American classroom.But while technology is helping thousands of students reach new heights in their education, many others are falling behind.Dubbed "the homework gap" by researchers, students without the use of reliable internet access at home find it harder to complete and submit homework assignments, further expanding the inequality already seen in low-income communities.While some US schools provide their students with laptops or iPads, according to Pew Research Center , almost 5 million American households with school-aged children lack broadband in the home.Low-income homes with children are four times more likely to lack broadband as middle or high income families.Innovative methods With the gap widening, some school districts have taken it upon themselves to change this dynamic by introducing an innovative solution.WiFi school buses are one new approach to help students without access to fast broadband at home get connected.The school buses are equipped with routers and students use a public network to connect to the internet.This allows children who have long commutes, which can be two hours each day, to finish homework assignments on their journey.Richmond County School System in Augusta GA is one of the school districts piloting a WiFi school bus program.According to a national survey in 2012, 24.4% of Richmond County's population lived in poverty with a high school graduation rate of just 61.8%.Many households in the community did not have broadband access so the district, which has more than 30,000 students, introduced two WiFi school buses in 2016.Kaden Jacobs, Richmond County School System's director of communications, says that the WiFi buses were introduced to close the digital divide students in the district were facing."Our goal is to offer all students in Richmond County equal access to broadband that is required for students to meet academic rigor and obtain 21st-century skills," says Jacobs.The buses transport children to and from school and were parked at two community centers daily during the summer.The district is currently analyzing how the program has impacted grades.A global issue But the homework gap is not just an American problem -- schools all over the world are trying to battle the digital divide.Cell phone ownership in developing nations is increasing substantially.According to a report by Pew Research Center , cell phones are as common in Nigeria and South Africa as in the United States.A report by Ericsson Mobility suggests that by 2020 around 70% of the world's population will be using smartphones.Using this new trend to their advantage, schools around the world are implementing mobile learning programs as a tool to connect students outside of the classroom.One example is a program in Niger that used exercises on a mobile phone to improve reading and numeracy in adult education.In South Africa, a Nokia program called MoMath Project let children answer math problems via their cell phones and reportedly improved math skills by an average of 14%.Equal opportunity Keith Krueger is the CEO of Consortium for School Networking (CoSN) a nonprofit professional association for education technology leaders.He strongly believes the homework gap is a major issue that needs to be addressed all around the world."Teachers expect that students can do their homework from home, which requires Internet.While many low-income students [in the United States] have a phone, it typically is on a data plan.Imagine trying to write your senior thesis or apply for college on a smartphone using WiFi at a McDonald's," says Kreuger.Innovative solutions like the WiFi school buses are crucial in helping to end this divide, says Kreuger.Kreuger continues: "It makes bus time a new study hall to do homework.And, this is equally true for times when students are transported to sporting or other school activities."Until last year Coachella Valley Unified School District in California used WiFi school buses.The buses were then left overnight in low-income neighborhoods for students to use.Google also recently granted money to a school in South Carolina to equip their buses with WiFi access.Innovations to bridge the homework gap might even help create more equal societies.As Kreuger puts it: "This is today's civil right -- ensuring that all students have access to equal educational opportunity in a digital world."

Japan is building the world's fastest supercomputer:::::This feature is part of Vision Japan , a series about the visionaries who are changing Japan, and the places that inspire this innovation.See more here .(CNN) Japan is building the world's fastest supercomputer, which it hopes will make the country the new global hub for artificial intelligence research.The supercomputer is expected to run at a speed of 130 petaflops, meaning it is able to perform a mind-boggling 130 quadrillion calculations per second (that's 130 million billion).Once complete (the target date is April 2018), the AI Bridging Cloud Infrastructure (ABCI) will be the most powerful supercomputer in the world, surpassing the current champion, China's Sunway TaihuLight, currently operating at 93 petaflops.What makes a computer 'super'?While the ABCI will not have a mouse or screen, it's not vastly different from a personal computer -- just souped-up, a whole lot faster, and much, much bigger."The current supercomputer system is one million times faster than your personal computers," explains Satoshi Sekiguchi, a director general at Japan's National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology.Sekiguchi calculates that it would take 3,000 years for a personal computer to achieve what a supercomputer can do in just one day.In terms of size, Japan's supercomputer will be comparable to a parking lot with space for 30 to 40 cars."The supercomputer that is currently under development would take up about 1,000 square meters of floor space," says Sekiguchi.What will it be used for?The ABCI could help Japanese companies develop and improve driverless cars, robotics and medical diagnostics, explains Sekiguchi."A supercomputer is an extremely important tool for accelerating the advancement in such fields," he says.Its supersonic speed will also help Japan develop advances in artificial intelligence technologies, such as "deep learning."But supercomputers are to thank for smaller everyday inventions too."The initial design of paper diapers was actually done using a supercomputer," explains Sekiguchi."However, mothers continue to use them without knowing that fact."Photos: Supercomputers breaking barriers Sunway-TaihuLight Chinese supercomputer Sunway-TaihuLight is currently the fastest supercomputer in the world, operating at 93 petaflops.That means it's

Sean Parker: Facebook Exploits Human 'Vulnerability':::::Justin Sullivan/Getty Images FILE - Tech entrepreneur Sean Parker speaks during the 2011 Web 2.0 Summit on Oct. 17, 2011, in San Francisco, Calif. Napster founder and former president of Facebook Sean Parker on Wednesday shared that he believes the social media giant was designed with potentially addictive features that he believes exploit "a vulnerability in human psychology."While speaking with Axios, Parker said that the "thought process" held during the creation of Facebook was as follows: "How do we consume as much of your time and conscious attention as possible?""And that means that we need to sort of give you a little dopamine hit every once in a while, because someone liked or commented on a photo or a post or whatever," Parker told Axios."And that's going to get you to contribute more content, and that's going to get you, you know, more likes and comments."Parker called that process a "social-validation feedlack loop.""It's exactly the kind of thing that a hacker like myself would come up with because you're exploiting a vulnerability in human psychology," he told Axios.Parker said he and other founders of the now-ubiquitous social media platform knew what they doing and "did it anyway."NBC Bay Area has reached out to Facebook for comment.Flashing back to when Facebook was just getting going, Parker also said that even if people were against signing up at the beginning because they valued genuine and in-person human interaction, they would eventually cave.The shift to digital human interaction has most likely changed the way people operate, Parker believes."It probably interferes with productivity in weird ways," Parker told Axios."God only knows what it's doing to our children's brains."
Twitter Stops All Verification Requests After Approving Charlottesville Organizer’s Account:::::Counter protesters confront Jason Kessler, an organizer of "Unite the Right" rally, after Kessler tried to speak outside the Charlottesville City Hall on August 13, 2017 in Charlottesville, Virginia.Twitter said Thursday that it will "pause" its verified account system in the wake of criticism over an organizer of the Charlottesville rally having received a coveted blue check mark on his profile.Jason Kessler, a white nationalist who has taken credit for organizing the "United the Right" rally that led to the death of a counterprotester, promoted his new Twitter verification on Tuesday.His profile features a confederate flag and notes that he has written for far-right websites.Kessler was charged with a felony perjury charge just last month for allegedly lying to a judge that he was not the aggressor when a man was assaulted earlier this year.Back in August, Kessler used Twitter to insult Heather Heyer, the women who was killed while protesting at the Charlottesville rally.He had called her fat and a disgusting communist, and said that her death was payback time.He later claimed he was hacked, then blamed prescription drugs and alcohol as the reason behind the tweet.He briefly deleted his account.Narcan Explained: What Is It and How Do You Use It?Ninety-one people in the U.S. die every day from opioid-related overdoses, but theres a tool that can reverse the effects of an overdose that more and more law enforcement agencies and paramedics are now carrying with them as part of their standing operating protocol.Its called Narcan, and here is what you need to know about what it is, how it works and how to use it.(Published Friday, Nov. 10, 2017) The move to verify Kesslers account comes after Jack Dorsey, CEO of Twitter, had recently said the service was planning to toughen rules on hate speech then take on its verification policy.Not as high a priority as enforcement, but its up there, he said last month, Bloomberg reported.Twitter explains on its website that verification is for accounts in the "public interest" and "a verified badge does not imply an endorsement."But the verified account of a white supremacist caused an outburst from Twitter users against Kessler.Some users claimed Dorsey was a Nazi supporter for allowing Kesslers account to be verified."Verification was meant to authenticate identity & voice but it is interpreted as an endorsement or an indicator of importance," Twitter's support account said in response."We recognize that we have created this confusion and need to resolve it.We have paused all general verifications while we work and will report back soon."Chuck Todd on 70 Years of 'Meet the Press' Chuck Todd, host of "Meet The Press," talks to NBC's Eric Hinton on the legacy of the iconic show as it celebrates its 70th anniversary, the impact of the Trump presidency on his media colleagues and living up to the standard of Tim Russert.Todd also talks about the upcoming Meet the Press: Film Festival taking place in collaboration with the American Film Institute.AFI announced its full slate of official selections, 16 short-length political documentaries produced by filmmakers from across the country which will be shown at the Landmark Atlantic Plumbing Cinema in Washington, D.C., on November 13.Film screenings will be organized under seven issues and followed by Q&As with the respective filmmakers and an NBC News correspondent.(Published Wednesday, Nov. 8, 2017) Dorsey retweeted the message and assured he was working to fix the problem."We shouldve communicated faster on this," he said, acknowledging that the "system is broken."Twitter also faced criticism over its policies last month when actress Rose McGowan was briefly unable to post on the service after a tweet about sexual harassment included a private phone number.
Facebook Wants Nude Selfies to Combat 'Revenge Porn':::::Facebook is asking some users to send nude photos of themselves in an effort to combat social media "revenge porn."People in Australia who are concerned that a former partner may distribute intimate photos of them on Facebook can use Messenger to send the photos to be "hashed," according to the office of Australia's e-safety commissioner.Users would fill out a form before sending the message to themselves using the Messenger app.Facebook said the process involves storing image-matching data, and the photos themselves would not be saved, though they would be reviewed by a trained Facebook team.Australian e-safety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant said it is one of four countries the others being the U.S., U.K. and Canada participating in the test program, but Facebook told "Today" that it is still in talks with the other three nations about expanding there."This pilot has the potential to disable the control and power perpetrators hold over victims, particularly in cases of ex-partner retribution and sextortion, and the subsequent harm that could come to them," Inman Grant said in a statement.One in 25 Americans who use the internet have had sensitive images posted without their permission or have had someone threaten to do so, according to a study from the Data & Society Research Institute last year.The U.S. Marines were hit by a non-consensual image-sharing scandal this year, prompting Commandant Gen. Robert B. Neller to ask the men in his Corps this March, "How much more do the females of our Corps have to do to be accepted?"In the digital world today, deleting something never really deletes it, Adam Levin, founder of cybersecurity firm CyberScout, told "Today.""The reality is that we're living in a world where breaches have become the third certainty in life, where hackers are sophisticated, they're determined, they're persistent, they're very creative and there is no right to be forgotten," Levin said.Outside of the Facebook Messenger pilot project, anyone who thinks they have been a victim of revenge porn can report the photos through Facebook's dedicated reporting process, revamped in April.

Netflix Subscribers Being Targeted By 'Well-Designed' Email Scam:::::Consumer reporter Susan Hogan is Working 4 You to ensure you don't fall for a scam that looks like an innocent email from Netflix.(Published Monday, Nov. 6, 2017) An Australian cyber security firm is warning Netflix subscribers about a scam email aiming to steal users personal information by tricking them into thinking that accounts are in danger of being suspended, "Today" reported.MailGuard posted an image of the email in a blog post Friday, calling it "relatively well-designed" because of its ability to generate "individualized messages with specific recipient data."Users of the streaming service reported receiving suspicious emails that tell recipients their Netflix billing information needs updating and that they must "restart their membership."The email contains a link that takes subscribers to a fake Netflix website where they are asked to log in and enter information including credit card numbers.A screenshot of the phishing email targeting Netflix subscribers was published by cyber security firm MailGuard.Photo credit: MailGuard "Of course, this website is completely bogus and is just a mechanism for the scammers to steal the victims identity and credit card information, MailGuard said.It was not immediately clear how many of Netflix's more than 109 million worldwide subscribers have received the email.

Supply run to space station delayed by stray plane:::::A supply run to the International Space Station has been delayed a day by a stray plane.Everything was going well in Saturday morning's launch countdown in Virginia.But at the last minute, a plane flew into the restricted airspace at Wallops Island.That prompted NASA's commercial shipper, Orbital ATK, to call off the liftoff.The Virginia-based company will try again Sunday morning to launch its unmanned Antares rocket with 7,400 pounds of cargo.The Cygnus capsule contains fresh fruit, vegetables and ice cream bars for the six station astronauts, plus mealworms and micro clover for student experiments.Sunday's 7:14 a.m. launch should be visible as far north as Boston and as far south as Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.But sunrise will make it hard to see.This will be Orbital ATK's first launch from its home base in more than a year.The last time it made a space station delivery, it used another company's rocket flying from Cape Canaveral, Florida.The space station crew, meanwhile, took advantage of the lull to beam down thanks to U.S. veterans and wish everyone a happy Veterans' Day.Online: Orbital ATK: https://www.orbitalatk.com/
The Latest: Merkel calls for all to fight climate change:::::The Latest on the global climate change conference in Bonn, Germany (all times local): 3:50 p.m. German Chancellor Angela Merkel says every country needs to pitch in to keep global temperatures from rising.Merkel said in her weekly podcast on Saturday that climate change was an urgent problem, and that every country has to help limit global warming to below "2 or, even better, 1.5 degrees Celsius" the target set by the 2015 Paris climate accord by the end of the century.Diplomats from around the world are meeting in the German city of Bonn to discuss implementing the Paris accord.Merkel also said it's the responsibility of the industrial countries to develop environment-friendly technologies that are future-oriented, but "don't lead to a loss of jobs."She said: "We don't gain anything if steel mills, aluminum plants and copper mills leave our countries and go somewhere else where environmental regulations are less strict because then we haven't made any gains for world climate."2:50 p.m. Pope Francis is blasting "shortsighted human activity" for global warming and rising sea levels and is urging leaders at climate talks in Germany to take a global outlook as they negotiate ways to curb heat-trapping emissions.Francis met Saturday with a delegation of leaders from the Pacific islands and told them he shares their concerns about rising sea levels and increasingly intense storms that are threatening their small islands.He decried in particular the state of oceans, where overfishing and pollution by plastics are threatening fish stocks and sea life that are critical to Pacific livelihoods.He said several causes were to blame, but that "sadly, many of them are due to shortsighted human activity connected with certain ways of exploiting natural and human resources, the impact of which ultimately reaches the ocean bed itself."12:30 p.m. Gov.Jerry Brown of California is part of a group of American cities, states, business and universities vowing to fight climate change despite the Trump administration's decision to pull out of the Paris climate accord.Speaking Saturday at a climate conference in Bonn, Germany, Brown says "we have a federal system, and states have real power as do cities.And when cities and states combine together, and then join with powerful corporations, that's how we get stuff done."The group calling itself "America's Pledge" said states, cities and private groups have been taking considerable steps to reduce emissions by promoting renewable energy use and climate-friendly transportation systems.Brown said "we are doing real stuff in California."His speech was briefly interrupted by anti-coal and anti-fracking protesters, who held up banners and shouted "We're still in!Trump's still out!"11 a.m. A group of U.S. states, cities, businesses and universities said Saturday they are still committed to curbing global warming even as U.S. President Donald Trump's administration is walking away from the Paris climate accord.But the alliance, which has an economy larger than Japan and Germany combined, says it won't be able to achieve the necessary cut in greenhouse gas emissions without some efforts at the federal level.Former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg told a global climate meeting in Bonn, Germany that "the American government may have pulled out of the Paris agreement, but the American people are committed to its goals, and there is nothing Washington can do to stop us."Jordans reported from Berlin.Kirsten Grieshaber contributed from Berlin.
US sage grouse policy heading back to square one:::::Federal scientists and land managers who've been crafting strategies to protect a ground-dwelling bird's habitat across the American West for nearly two decades are going back to the drawing board under a new Trump administration edict to reassess existing plans condemned by ranchers, miners and energy developers.Federal officials are wrapping up a series of public meetings with three sessions starting Tuesday in Utah ahead of a Nov. 27 cutoff for comment on Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke's order last month to consider revisions to land management amendments for the greater sage grouse that were adopted under the Obama administration.Zinke says he wants to make sure the amendments don't harm local economies in 11 western states and allow the states to have maximum control over the efforts within their borders.Conservationists say it's a thinly veiled attempt to allow more livestock grazing and drilling, similar to Trump's efforts to roll back national monument designations, but on a much larger scale.They warn it could land the hen-sized bird on the endangered species list in 2020 when the U.S.Fish and Wildlife Service is scheduled to review its 2015 decision not to list it."They appear to be dismantling the whole land-planning amendment system and starting over," said Patrick Donnelly, the Center for Biological Diversity's Nevada state director."It's revisionist history," he told a Fish and Wildlife Service official during a scoping meeting-turned-brainstorming session at a Sparks hotel-casino Wednesday night.Instead of recording public testimony, agency officials marked up easel pads with lists of criticisms, concerns and suggestions.About 80 participants moved between five breakout groups including "minerals," ''livestock grazing," and "wildlife and vegetation."They treaded familiar ground.Disagreement reigned over the size of protective buffer zones around grouse breeding grounds, states' role in setting federal policy and whether cattle or wild horses cause more habitat degradation.There was general agreement that invasive cheat grass is fueling one of the biggest threats - catastrophic wildfires - but little consensus on what to do about it."I don't understand why we're starting all over again," shouted a man who briefly disrupted the meeting and refused to provide his name.Nevada Farm Bureau Vice President Doug Busselman said research increasingly suggests properly regulated grazing reduces fire fuels.But he said existing policy is "taking a restrictive approach ... and then watching massive fires sweep across the landscape, setting up the process for expansion of cheat grass, then more fire."The U.S. House Natural Resources Committee heard the same thing last month from Idaho House Speaker Scott Bedke, a fifth-generation rancher who blames grazing restrictions for a wildfire that wiped out his family's winter grazing allotment this year."In the process of placating anti-grazing activists, federal agencies have made the No.1 threat to the greater sage grouse in Idaho worse," Bedke said.Idaho Gov.C.L."Butch" Otter, a Republican, filed one of a series of lawsuits aimed at blocking the Obama plans.Conversely, Republican Gov.Matt Mead of Wyoming, Democratic Gov.John Hickenlooper of Colorado and Democratic Gov.Steve Bullock of Montana have expressed concern that altering existing plans could undermine efforts to prevent a listing.Nevada GOP Gov.Brian Sandoval also has cautioned against wholesale changes, although he applauded Zinke's recent lifting of a temporary ban on new mining claims across about 15,600 square miles (40,400 square kilometers) adopted under Obama.Montana Fish and Wildlife Commission Chairman Dan Vermillion said existing protections took a diverse group of stakeholders years to work out."Those plans were essential to keeping sage grouse from becoming endangered," he wrote in a Nov. 7 letter to Zinke.That's the message Karen Boeger delivered in Sparks."We all duked it out on these plans," said Boeger, a retired teacher and member of the Nevada Chapter of Backcountry Hunters and Anglers who previously served on a Bureau of Land Management advisory board."We've hardly gotten out of the chute.Let's give it a chance."The bureau's acting deputy director, John Ruhs, understands the frustration."A lot of folks have been engaged in this topic for a long time.Some have been at the table going back 15 years or more," said Ruhs, who's worked for the agency in Nevada, Oregon, Colorado and Idaho."We're trying to find the best methods to allow all uses of the land to occur and still ensure protection of habitat," he said."It's a tall order."Donnelly, whose Arizona-based group has sued over failure to list hundreds of species, said the intent of the Obama amendments "was very clear: Prevent the listing of the sage grouse."That goal seems to have gotten lost, he said."We heard a lot about mineral withdrawals and local collaboration, but all in the name of what?"Donnelly asked."Are we still committed to conserving sage grouse, or is the intention to mine and drill every acre of the West?If that's the case, we are plunging head-long toward listing the grouse."
Amid booming economy, homelessness soars on US West Coast:::::In a park in the middle of a leafy, bohemian neighborhood where homes list for close to $1 million, a tractor's massive claw scooped up the refuse of the homeless - mattresses, tents, wooden frames, a wicker chair, an outdoor propane heater.Workers in masks and steel-shanked boots plucked used needles and mounds of waste from the underbrush.Just a day before, this corner of Ravenna Park was an illegal home for the down and out, one of 400 such encampments that have popped up in Seattle's parks, under bridges, on freeway medians and along busy sidewalks.Now, as police and social workers approached, some of the dispossessed scurried away, vanishing into a metropolis that is struggling to cope with an enormous wave of homelessness.That struggle is not Seattle's alone.A homeless crisis of unprecedented proportions is rocking the West Coast, and its victims are being left behind by the very things that mark the region's success: soaring housing costs, rock-bottom vacancy rates and a roaring economy that waits for no one.All along the coast, elected officials are scrambling for solutions."I've got economically zero unemployment in my city, and I've got thousands of homeless people that actually are working and just can't afford housing," said Seattle City Councilman Mike O'Brien."There's nowhere for these folks to move to.Every time we open up a new place, it fills up."The rising numbers of homeless people have pushed abject poverty into the open like never before and have overwhelmed cities and nonprofits.The surge in people living on the streets has put public health at risk, led several cities to declare states of emergency and forced cities and counties to spend millions - in some cases billions - in a search for solutions.San Diego now scrubs its sidewalks with bleach to counter a deadly hepatitis A outbreak that has spread to other cities and forced California to declare a state of emergency last month.In Anaheim, home to Disneyland, 400 people sleep along a bike path in the shadow of Angel Stadium.Organizers in Portland lit incense at a recent outdoor food festival to cover up the stench of urine in a parking lot where vendors set up shop.Homelessness is not new on the West Coast.But interviews with local officials and those who serve the homeless in California, Oregon and Washington - coupled with an Associated Press review of preliminary homeless data - confirm it's getting worse.People who were once able to get by, even if they suffered a setback, are now pushed to the streets because housing has become so expensive.All it takes is a prolonged illness, a lost job, a broken limb, a family crisis.What was once a blip in fortunes now seems a life sentence."Most homeless people I know aren't homeless because they're addicts," said Tammy Stephen, 54, who lives at a homeless encampment in Seattle."Most people are homeless because they can't afford a place to live."Among the AP's findings: Official counts taken earlier this year in California, Oregon and Washington show 168,000 homeless people in the three states, according to an AP tally of every jurisdiction in those states that reports homeless numbers to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.That is 19,000 more than were counted two years ago, although the numbers may not be directly comparable because of factors ranging from the weather to new counting methods.During the same period, the number of unsheltered people in the three states - defined as someone sleeping outside, in a bus or train station, abandoned building or vehicle - has climbed 18 percent to 105,000.Rising rents are the main culprit.The median one-bedroom apartment in the San Francisco Bay Area is significantly more expensive than it is in the New York City metro area, and apartments in San Francisco are listed at a higher price than those in Manhattan.Since 2015, at least 10 cities or municipal regions in California, Oregon and Washington - and Honolulu, as well - have declared states of emergency due to the rise of homelessness, a designation usually reserved for natural disasters."What do we want as a city to look like?That's what the citizens here need to decide," said Gordon Walker, head of the regional task force for the homeless in San Diego, where the unsheltered homeless population has spiked by 18 percent in the past year."What are we going to allow?Are we willing to have people die on the streets?"With alarming frequency, the West Coast's newly homeless are people who were able to survive on the margins - until those margins moved.For years, Stanley Timmings, 62, and his 61-year-old girlfriend, Linda Catlin, were able to rent a room in a friend's house on their combined disability payments.Last spring, that friend died of colon cancer and the couple was thrust on Seattle's streets.Timmings used their last savings to buy a used RV for $300 and spent another $300 to register it.They bought a car from a junk yard for $275.Now, the couple parks the RV near a small regional airport and uses the car to get around.They have no running water and no propane for the cook stove.They go to the bathroom in a bucket and dump it behind a nearby business.They shower and do laundry at a nonprofit and buy water at a grocery depot.After four months, the stench of human waste inside the RV is overwhelming.Every inch of space is crammed with their belongings: jugs of laundry detergent, stacks of clothes, pots and pans, and tattered paperback novels.They are exhausted, scared and defeated, with no solution in sight."Between the two of us a month, we get $1,440 in disability.We can't find a place for that," he said."Our income is (about) $17,000 ... a year.That puts us way out of the ballpark, not even close.It might have been enough but anymore, no.It's not."A new study funded by the real estate information firm Zillow and conducted by the University of Washington found a strong link between rising housing prices and rising homelessness numbers.A 5 percent rent increase in Los Angeles, for example, would mean about 2,000 more homeless people there, the authors said.Nationally, homelessness has been trending down, partly because governments and nonprofit groups have gotten better at moving people into housing.That's true in many West Coast cities, too, but the flow the other direction is even faster.And on the West Coast, shelter systems are smaller."If you have a disability income, you make about $9,000 a year and renting a studio in Seattle is about $1,800 a month and so that's twice your income," said Margaret King, director of housing programs for DESC, a nonprofit that works with Seattle's homeless."So everybody who was just hanging on because they had cheap rent, they're losing that ... and they wind up outside.It's just exploded."Nowhere is that more evident than California's Silicon Valley, where high salaries and a tight housing market have pushed rent out of reach for thousands.In ever-shifting communities of the homeless, RVs and cars cluster by the dozens in the city where Google built its global headquarters and just blocks from Stanford University.Ellen Tara James-Penney, a lecturer at San Jose State University, has been sleeping out of a car for about a decade, ever since she lost her housing while an undergraduate at the school where she now teaches four English courses, a job that pays $28,000 a year.Home is an old Volvo."I've basically been homeless since 2007, and I'm really tired," she said."Really tired."She actually got her start in the high tech industry, before being laid off during the tech meltdown of the early 2000s.Like many who couldn't find work, she went to college, accumulating tens of thousands of dollars in student debt along the way.Now 54, she grades papers and prepares lesson plans in her car.Among her few belongings is a pair of her grandmother's fancy stiletto pumps, a reminder to herself that "it's not going to be like this forever."Increased housing costs aren't just sweeping up low-income workers: The numbers of homeless youth also is rising.A recent count in Los Angeles, for example, found that those ages 18 to 24 were the fastest-growing homeless group by age, up 64 percent, followed by those under 18.Los Angeles and other cities have made a concerted effort to improve their tallies of homeless youth, which likely accounts for some of the increase.One of the reasons is the combined cost of housing and tuition, said Will Lehman, policy supervisor at Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority.A recent study by the University of Wisconsin found that one in five Los Angeles Community College District students is homeless, he said."They can pay for books, for classes but just can't afford an apartment.They're choosing to prioritize going to school," Lehman said."They don't choose their situation."Michael Madigan opened a new wine bar in Portland a few years ago overlooking a ribbon of parks not far from the city's trendy Pearl District.Business was good until, almost overnight, dozens of homeless people showed up on the sidewalk.A large encampment on the other side of the city had been shut down, and its residents moved to the park at his doorstep."We literally turned the corner one day ... and there were 48 tents set up on this one block that hadn't been there the day before," he said.Madigan's business dropped 50 percent in four months and he closed his bar.There are fewer homeless people there now, but the campers have moved to a bike path that winds through residential neighborhoods in east Portland, prompting hundreds of complaints about trash, noise, drug use and illegal camping.Rachel Sterry, a naturopathic doctor, lives near that path and sometimes doesn't feel safe when she's commuting by bike with her 1-year-old son.Dogs have rolled in human feces in a local park; recent improvements she's made to her small home are overshadowed by the line of tents and tarps a few dozen yards from her front door, she said."I have to stop and get off my bike to ask people to move their card game or their lounge chairs or their trash out of the way when I'm just trying to get from point A to point B," she said."If I were to scream or get hurt, nobody would know."For Seattle resident Elisabeth James, the reality check came when a homeless man forced his way into a glass-enclosed ATM lobby with her after she swiped her card to open the door for after-hours access.After a few nerve-wracking minutes, the man left the lobby but stayed outside, banging on the glass.Police were too busy to respond so James called her husband, who scared the man away and walked her home.The man, she believes, just wanted to get out of the rain.A neighborhood pocket park has become a flashpoint, too: When James took her 2-year-old grandchild there, she saw people injecting heroin."I'm not a NIMBY person, but I just think that we can do so much more," said James, who founded an activist group called Speak Out Seattle last year."I wanted to do something that was effective, that brought frustrated people together to find solutions.We're spending a lot of money to house people and we're getting a bigger problem."The crisis is not limited to large metropolises.In Oregon City, a suburban, working-class town of 36,000 people, the police department this summer added a full-time position for a homeless outreach officer after roughly half the calls concerned trash, trespassing, human waste and illegal encampments.The city has no overnight shelters and never had a significant homeless population until about three years ago.On a recent fall day, officer Mike Day tromped into a greenbelt across from a strip mall to check on a man he recently connected with a counselor, calmed an intoxicated man and arranged emergency care for a man who was suicidal."How many social workers have you met that go into the woods to follow up with the homeless population and to help with mental health?This is a bit of a hybrid position, certainly, and maybe it's not exactly the role of a police officer - but it's a creative approach to find a solution to the problem," he said.The question was, "What can we do differently?Because right now, it's not working."All along the West Coast, local governments are scrambling to answer that question - and taxpayers are footing the bill.Voters have approved more than $8 billion in spending since 2015 on affordable housing and other anti-homelessness programs, mostly as tax increases.Los Angeles voters, for example, approved $1.2 billion to build 10,000 units of affordable housing over a decade to address a ballooning homeless population that's reached 34,000 people within city limits.Seattle spent $61 million on homeless-related issues last year, and a recent budget proposal would increase that to $63 million.Four years ago, the city spent $39 million on homelessness.Sacramento has set a goal of moving 2,000 people off the streets in the next three years and may place a housing bond before voters in 2018.Appeals for money have angered residents who see tent encampments growing in their cities despite more spending."Those are like whack-a-mole because they just sprout up and then they disappear and then they sprout up somewhere else," said Gretchen Taylor, who helped found the Neighborhood Safety Alliance of Seattle in 2016.Seattle is initiating competitive bidding among nonprofit organizations for city dollars going toward homelessness programs.It's also pouring money into "rapid rehousing," a strategy that houses people quickly and then provides rental assistance for up to 18 months.Like San Francisco, Seattle has started opening 24-hour, "low-barrier" shelters that offer beds even if people are abusing drugs, have a pet or want to sleep together as a couple.But the city's first 24-hour shelter has only 75 beds, and turnover is extremely low.A team of specially trained police officers and social workers has also been visiting homeless camps to try to place people in shelter.After repeated visits - and with 72 hours of notice - the city cleans out the camps and hauls away abandoned belongings.These efforts are starting to yield results, although the overall number of homeless people continues to swell.Nearly 740 families moved into some type of shelter between October 2016 and August 2017, and 39 percent of the people contacted by the new police teams wind up sheltered, according a recent city homeless report.That's an improvement from a 5 percent shelter rate 18 months ago, said Sgt.Eric Zerr, who leads that effort.But the approach has its detractors.The American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit alleging the sweeps violate the constitutional protections against unreasonable search and seizure.And a debate is raging about whether the sweeps are necessary "tough love" or a cruel policy that criminalizes poverty in a city with a reputation for liberalism."When a city can't offer housing, they should not be able to sweep that spot unless it's posing some sort of significant health and safety issue," said Sara Rankin, a professor with the Homeless Rights Advocacy Project at the Seattle University School of Law."If someone doesn't have a place to go, you can't just continue to chase them from place to place."Above all, the West Coast lacks long-term, low-income housing for people like Ashley Dibble and her 3-year-old daughter.Dibble, 29, says she has been homeless off and on for about a year, after her ex-boyfriend squandered money on his car and didn't pay the rent for three months.Evicted, Dibble says she lived in the back of a moving truck and with several different friends around Seattle before winding up on the streets.She sent her toddler to live with the girl's paternal grandparents in Florida.She and her new boyfriend were sleeping under tarps near Safeco Field, home of the Seattle Mariners, when an outreach team referred them to a new shelter.Now, Dibble talks to her daughter daily by phone and is trying to find a way back into housing so she can bring her home.With an eviction on her record and little income, no one will rent to her."I've had so many doors slammed in my face, it's ridiculous," Dibble said, wiping away tears.Seattle's DESC operates 1,200 so-called "permanent supportive housing units" -housing for the mentally ill or severely addicted who can't stay housed without constant help from case managers, counselors and rehabilitation programs.The nonprofit completes a new building every 18 months and they immediately fill; at any given time, there are only about eight to 10 units free in the whole city - but 1,600 people qualify.Among this population, "almost nobody's going to get housing because there isn't any," DESC's Margaret King said."It doesn't really matter."There is so little housing, and so much despair.Nonprofit workers with decades of experience are shocked by the surge in homeless people and in the banality of the ways they wound up on the streets."It's a sea of humanity crashing against services, and services at this point are overwhelmed, literally overwhelmed.It's catastrophic," said Jeremy Lemoine, an outreach case manager with REACH, a Seattle homeless-assistance program."It's a refugee crisis right here in the States, right here under our noses.""I don't mean to sound hopeless.I generate hope for a living for people - that there is a future for them - but we need to address it now."Associated Press writers Janie Har in San Francisco, Julie Watson in San Diego and Chris Weber in Los Angeles contributed to

Space station getting delivery from Virginia for a change:::::The International Space Station is getting a delivery shipped from Virginia for a change.Orbital ATK, one of NASA's chief suppliers, plans to launch the capsule Saturday morning from Wallops Island, aboard an unmanned Antares rocket.It will be Orbital ATK's first supply run from its home turf in more than a year.The 7:37 a.m. launch should be visible as far north as Boston and as far south as Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, although the rising sun will make it tough to see.The last time Orbital ATK sent up supplies, in the spring, it used another company's rocket in Cape Canaveral, Florida.The Cygnus capsule holds 7,400 pounds of cargo, including fresh fruit and vegetables for the station's six-man crew, and mealworms and micro clover for student experiments.
Email scam targets Netflix's millions of subscribers:::::An email scam has been specifically targeting Netflix's millions of subscribers, threatening to suspend their accounts if they dont update their billing information.Interested in Netflix?Add Netflix as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Netflix news, video, and analysis from ABC News.Add Interest The email asks its readers to click the link, leading them to a fake Netflix homepage and prompting them to enter their private information, according to MailGuard, an Australian cybersecurity firm.A well designed Netflix email targets some of the 110 million Netflix subscribers worldwide!Check out the steps: https://t.co/kUK2o4WR3S pic.twitter.com/LBV6WLuSbP Action Fraud (@actionfrauduk) November 6, 2017 Netflix said it is aware of the ongoing scam, adding that the company takes security seriously and has measures in place to detect fraudulent activity.Unfortunately, scams are common on the internet and target popular brands such as Netflix and other companies with large customer bases to lure users into giving out personal information, Netflix said in a statement to ABC News.The company will never ask for any personal information to be sent over email and advises its subscribers to be careful of phishing emails that lead to false websites, according to its security page.Thomas Trutschel/Photothek via Getty Images The phishing scam invites victims to use the fake online form to enter their address, drivers license number, credit card details and more, said MailGuard.Scammers can make their fake emails and bogus websites look pretty convincing, so its always a good idea to check carefully that the email comes from the actual company domain and not a scammer, advised MailGuard on their company blog.
US cities, states defy Trump, still back Paris climate deal:::::A group of U.S. states, cities, businesses and universities said Saturday they are still committed to curbing global warming even as U.S. President Donald Trump's administration is walking away from the Paris climate accord.But the alliance, which has an economy larger than Japan and Germany combined, says it won't be able to achieve the necessary cut in greenhouse gas emissions without some efforts at the federal level."It is important for the world to know, the American government may have pulled out of the Paris agreement, but the American people are committed to its goals, and there is nothing Washington can do to stop us," former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg said at a global climate meeting in Bonn, Germany.Gov.Jerry Brown of California echoed those comments."In the United States, we have a federal system, and states have real power as do cities.And when cities and states combine together, and then join with powerful corporations, that's how we get stuff done," he said.His speech was briefly interrupted by anti-coal and anti-fracking protesters, who held up banners and shouted "We're still in!Trump's still out!"The group calling itself "America's Pledge" said states, cities and private groups have been taking considerable steps to reduce emissions by promoting renewable energy use and climate-friendly transportation systems."This is a pledge, and it's a pledge that you can cash, because it's real," Brown said."We are doing real stuff in California."In a report, however, the group said that "we cannot underscore strongly enough the critical nature of federal engagement to achieve the deep decarbonization goals the U.S. must undertake after 2025."Daniel Firger, one of the report's contributors, said it was intended to show that many in the U.S. aren't prepared to wait for Trump to change his mind on climate change again or wait for the next administration to tackle the issue."The good news around Trump's announcement to withdraw is that it has galvanized a groundswell of bottom-up support from all corners of the U.S. economy," Firger told The Associated Press.Cities, regions and businesses in other nations around the world could look to the group for inspiration and support, he said, noting that the lessons learned by local authorities and businesses in the U.S. could be applied elsewhere.Also Saturday, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said in her weekly podcast that every country needs to pitch in to keep global temperatures from rising.Merkel also said it's the responsibility of the industrial countries to develop environment-friendly technologies that are future-oriented, but "don't lead to a loss of jobs.""We don't gain anything if steel mills, aluminum plants and copper mills leave our countries and go somewhere else where environmental regulations are less strict because then we haven't made any gains for world climate," she said.Jordans reported from Berlin.Kirsten Grieshaber contributed from Berlin.
Trump not invited to Paris climate summit next month:::::French authorities said President Donald Trump is not among more than 100 world leaders invited to Paris for a climate summit next month.French President Emmanuel Macron plans a summit to push his "Make our Planet Great Again" agenda on Dec. 12, the anniversary of the 2015 Paris climate accord.The summit aims at promoting green projects and providing new funding sources, a few weeks after separate talks that are currently being held at a global climate conference in Bonn, Germany.A French diplomatic official said the countries whose heads of state are being invited are those who are "especially committed" to applying the Paris accord.An invitation will soon be sent to invite the United States "at a diplomatic level," the official said.He was spoke on customary condition of anonymity.Officially called the "One Planet Summit" in English, the event is also when Macron is going to announce the winners of his offer of a generous fellowship to U.S. climate scientists who come to do their research in France.In June, Trump said that the U.S. would pull out of the 2015 Paris accord unless he can secure a better deal.The same day, Macron said "wherever we live, whoever we are, we all share the same responsibility: make our planet great again" and called on U.S.-based scientists to come to France to work on climate-related issues, in an unprecedented English-language speech from the French presidential palace.French organizers are expecting about 2,000 participants, including non-governmental organizations, foundations, banks, startups, local governments, city mayors and others.France co-organizes the summit with the United Nations and the World Bank.
Russia named as likely source of Europe radioactivity spike:::::An apparent accident at a Russian facility is suspected of causing a recent spike in radioactivity in the air over much of Europe, according to a report by France's nuclear safety agency.The Institute for Radiological Protection and Nuclear Safety says the release of the isotope Ruthenium-106 posed no health or environmental risks to European countries.It said the "plausible zone of release" was between the Volga River and the Ural Mountains, and suggested random checks on food imports from the region as a precaution.In a report released Thursday based on monitoring in multiple European countries, IRSN said the Ruthenium appeared to come from an accident in late September involving nuclear fuel or the production of radioactive material.The French agency said the Ruthenium didn't appear to come from an accident in a nuclear reactor because that would have released other elements.Germany's Federal Office for Radiation Protection said last week that elevated levels of Ruthenium were reported in Germany, Italy, Austria, Switzerland and France since Sept. 29, but posed no threat to public health.After reports of a Ruthenium-106 leak from a plant in the southern Urals first appeared, Russia's state-controlled Rosatom corporation said in a statement last month that it hadn't come from its facilities."The claim that the contamination had a Russian origin is unfounded," it said.The French report says the radioactivity peaked in late September and early October and affected a "majority of European countries" but is no longer detected in the atmosphere over Europe.However it said if such an accident had happened in France, authorities would set up a perimeter around the accident site to monitor health, safety and food quality.Ruthenium-106 is used for radiation therapy to treat eye tumors, and sometimes as a source of energy to power satellites.The French agency also said Ruthenium releases could come from the re-entry of a satellite into the Earth's atmosphere, but that the International Atomic Energy Agency reported that no satellites powered by Ruthenium re-entered the atmosphere during the time period.France, which has an extensive nuclear energy industry, has reported a series of low-level nuclear incidents recently but none involving Ruthenium or threats to public health.Vladimir Isachenkov in Moscow contributed.
John Glenn's Ohio birthplace places historic marker:::::The Ohio birthplace of the late John Glenn is celebrating its place in history with a historic marker commemorating the astronaut and U.S. senator who died last year.Officials in Cambridge unveiled the marker Thursday.Glenn was born there on July 18, 1921.The mayor, officials at the local convention and visitors' bureau and a graduate student researching Glenn collaborated on the project.It's part of increased efforts to honor Glenn's legacy since his death at age 95.Glenn was the first American to orbit the Earth and served 24 years as a Democrat in the Senate.An effort had failed to have his Cambridge home listed on the National Register of Historic Places.Officials said the National Park Service considered his home in nearby New Concord, beginning at age 2, "most suitable."
Sheep can recognize Baaaa-rack Obama's face, new study shows:::::A new study shows that sheep have the ability to recognize human faces from photographs on computer screens.The Cambridge University study published Wednesday also shows that sheep can recognize the faces of their human handlers without any prior training.It had been known that sheep can recognize familiar faces of other sheep and of humans.The researchers say this study of the ability of sheep to recognize faces may be useful in research into Huntington's disease and other human brain disorders that affect mental processing.Lead scientist Professor Jenny Morton says sheep have advanced face-recognition abilities comparable to those of humans and monkeys.Among the faces they were trained to recognize were Barack Obama and Harry Potter actress Emma Watson.The research was published in Royal Society: Open Science.

How to protect your smartphone from fake apps Video:::::Transcript for How to protect your smartphone from fake apps Back now with that frightening headline about fake apps.More than a million phones vulnerable to potential hackers this week after people downloaded a fake version of a popular messaging app and it turns out this happens more often than you may think.Gio Benitez is here with more.Good morning, gio.Reporter: Good morning.We're talking about nearly 3.5 million fake malicious apps out there at any time that hackers can use to see everything you do on your phones.The latest app was disguised as the popular whatsapp and Google removed it and suspended the developer.As you're about to see, the risk is very real.We're inside a coffee shop in Washington, D.C. With a group of young people who have no idea that some of them are about to be hacked.Here we go.Reporter: Here's why, just this September a massive breach made headlines.One of the biggest outbreaks ever.Reporter: Hackers introduced 50 malicious apps also known as doppelgangers, fake apps that mirror the real thing into the Google play store.Then millions of unsuspecting android users download the bad apps, a total of 4.2 million times.One of those apps disguised as a seemingly simple app called lovely wallpaper.You don't realize it's a fake.So if you download a nasty version of minecraft, for example, you actually seem to get minecraft and it seems to work but in the background the attackers are able to access your information.Reporter: James line is a cybersecurity expert at sophos and gave android phones to all of our volunteers as part of our demonstration.We told them to use the phones as they normally would.What they don't know is James has already installed a malicious app on the phones.Now watch with the group sitting in another part of the coffee shop.We can retrieve their tech messages.There it is.Hey, it's me, stunning.There's a little emoji.Reporter: Next James triggers one of their cameras.He will have no idea the camera is just activated and there's a photo of one of our users.Hi, guys.Reporter: It turns out every one of our volunteers had signed into their social media accounts.Did anyone notice anything strange happening on your phones.Not realizing James had stolen all of their passwords.The person should have noticed something going on was you.Oh, was that -- did you take that of me while I was on my phone?Reporter: While you were 0 the phone.This is the selfie cam.That's scary.Reporter: We decided to up the ante with one of the students taking him outside.He had no idea that inside the coffee shop -- Tracking him now and can see where he is.Reporter: James was live streaming his camera and pinpointing his location.He has access right now to this.Oh, no.James can even control his text messages.What is this?Hey, can you send me your password.I didn't text that.You didn't.It says you did.Reporter: James says someone doesn't even have to be on their phone to be hacked.Even when you weren't using the phone, we still got a picture of you.Oh, what?How?So the phone was just sitting there on the table looking right up at you.Reporter: Experts say the danger is far greater than just a stolen selfie.Once inside the criminals into your phone they can access user names and password, credit cards.Basically to be able to profit from your device without you knowing.Reporter: And Google tells us it has been tracking this particular malware for months and it's constantly removing bad apps from the playstore and added to its review proceed Sures but the company says it relies on the communities of users and developers to watch and find those ma wlishs app.I'm watching that.I'm so scared.I want to go back to a land line but what should people do if you already have been hacked?It's not enough to change your password.It's not enough.Once the hacker is in, the hacker is in.So really if you think you have a bad app you have to delete it and then you have to wipe your phone.You have to restore it but when you're looking at those app store, you want to make sure you're looking at the company, the developer of that app.Make sure it's a legitimate company and then download it only if you know it's legit.Wow.Thanks, gio.That was very, very informative.It sure was.This transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.

US cities, states defy Trump, still back Paris climate deal:::::A group of U.S. states, cities, businesses and universities said Saturday they are still committed to curbing global warming even as U.S. President Donald Trump's administration is walking away from the Paris climate accord.But the alliance, which has an economy larger than Japan and Germany combined, says it won't be able to achieve the necessary cut in greenhouse gas emissions without some efforts at the federal level."It is important for the world to know, the American government may have pulled out of the Paris agreement, but the American people are committed to its goals, and there is nothing Washington can do to stop us," former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg said at a global climate meeting in Bonn, Germany.Gov.Jerry Brown of California echoed those comments."In the United States, we have a federal system, and states have real power as do cities.And when cities and states combine together, and then join with powerful corporations, that's how we get stuff done," he said.His speech was briefly interrupted by anti-coal and anti-fracking protesters, who held up banners and shouted "We're still in!Trump's still out!"The group calling itself "America's Pledge" said states, cities and private groups have been taking considerable steps to reduce emissions by promoting renewable energy use and climate-friendly transportation systems."This is a pledge, and it's a pledge that you can cash, because it's real," Brown said."We are doing real stuff in California."In a report, however, the group said that "we cannot underscore strongly enough the critical nature of federal engagement to achieve the deep decarbonization goals the U.S. must undertake after 2025."Daniel Firger, one of the report's contributors, said it was intended to show that many in the U.S. aren't prepared to wait for Trump to change his mind on climate change again or wait for the next administration to tackle the issue."The good news around Trump's announcement to withdraw is that it has galvanized a groundswell of bottom-up support from all corners of the U.S. economy," Firger told The Associated Press.Cities, regions and businesses in other nations around the world could look to the group for inspiration and support, he said, noting that the lessons learned by local authorities and businesses in the U.S. could be applied elsewhere.Also Saturday, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said in her weekly podcast that every country needs to pitch in to keep global temperatures from rising.Merkel also said it's the responsibility of the industrial countries to develop environment-friendly technologies that are future-oriented, but "don't lead to a loss of jobs.""We don't gain anything if steel mills, aluminum plants and copper mills leave our countries and go somewhere else where environmental regulations are less strict because then we haven't made any gains for world climate," she said.Jordans reported from Berlin.Kirsten Grieshaber contributed from Berlin.
US sage grouse policy heading back to square one:::::Federal scientists and land managers who've been crafting strategies to protect a ground-dwelling bird's habitat across the American West for nearly two decades are going back to the drawing board under a new Trump administration edict to reassess existing plans condemned by ranchers, miners and energy developers.Federal officials are wrapping up a series of public meetings with three sessions starting Tuesday in Utah ahead of a Nov. 27 cutoff for comment on Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke's order last month to consider revisions to land management amendments for the greater sage grouse that were adopted under the Obama administration.Zinke says he wants to make sure the amendments don't harm local economies in 11 western states and allow the states to have maximum control over the efforts within their borders.Conservationists say it's a thinly veiled attempt to allow more livestock grazing and drilling, similar to Trump's efforts to roll back national monument designations, but on a much larger scale.They warn it could land the hen-sized bird on the endangered species list in 2020 when the U.S.Fish and Wildlife Service is scheduled to review its 2015 decision not to list it."They appear to be dismantling the whole land-planning amendment system and starting over," said Patrick Donnelly, the Center for Biological Diversity's Nevada state director."It's revisionist history," he told a Fish and Wildlife Service official during a scoping meeting-turned-brainstorming session at a Sparks hotel-casino Wednesday night.Instead of recording public testimony, agency officials marked up easel pads with lists of criticisms, concerns and suggestions.About 80 participants moved between five breakout groups including "minerals," ''livestock grazing," and "wildlife and vegetation."They treaded familiar ground.Disagreement reigned over the size of protective buffer zones around grouse breeding grounds, states' role in setting federal policy and whether cattle or wild horses cause more habitat degradation.There was general agreement that invasive cheat grass is fueling one of the biggest threats - catastrophic wildfires - but little consensus on what to do about it."I don't understand why we're starting all over again," shouted a man who briefly disrupted the meeting and refused to provide his name.Nevada Farm Bureau Vice President Doug Busselman said research increasingly suggests properly regulated grazing reduces fire fuels.But he said existing policy is "taking a restrictive approach ... and then watching massive fires sweep across the landscape, setting up the process for expansion of cheat grass, then more fire."The U.S. House Natural Resources Committee heard the same thing last month from Idaho House Speaker Scott Bedke, a fifth-generation rancher who blames grazing restrictions for a wildfire that wiped out his family's winter grazing allotment this year."In the process of placating anti-grazing activists, federal agencies have made the No.1 threat to the greater sage grouse in Idaho worse," Bedke said.Idaho Gov.C.L."Butch" Otter, a Republican, filed one of a series of lawsuits aimed at blocking the Obama plans.Conversely, Republican Gov.Matt Mead of Wyoming, Democratic Gov.John Hickenlooper of Colorado and Democratic Gov.Steve Bullock of Montana have expressed concern that altering existing plans could undermine efforts to prevent a listing.Nevada GOP Gov.Brian Sandoval also has cautioned against wholesale changes, although he applauded Zinke's recent lifting of a temporary ban on new mining claims across about 15,600 square miles (40,400 square kilometers) adopted under Obama.Montana Fish and Wildlife Commission Chairman Dan Vermillion said existing protections took a diverse group of stakeholders years to work out."Those plans were essential to keeping sage grouse from becoming endangered," he wrote in a Nov. 7 letter to Zinke.That's the message Karen Boeger delivered in Sparks."We all duked it out on these plans," said Boeger, a retired teacher and member of the Nevada Chapter of Backcountry Hunters and Anglers who previously served on a Bureau of Land Management advisory board."We've hardly gotten out of the chute.Let's give it a chance."The bureau's acting deputy director, John Ruhs, understands the frustration."A lot of folks have been engaged in this topic for a long time.Some have been at the table going back 15 years or more," said Ruhs, who's worked for the agency in Nevada, Oregon, Colorado and Idaho."We're trying to find the best methods to allow all uses of the land to occur and still ensure protection of habitat," he said."It's a tall order."Donnelly, whose Arizona-based group has sued over failure to list hundreds of species, said the intent of the Obama amendments "was very clear: Prevent the listing of the sage grouse."That goal seems to have gotten lost, he said."We heard a lot about mineral withdrawals and local collaboration, but all in the name of what?"Donnelly asked."Are we still committed to conserving sage grouse, or is the intention to mine and drill every acre of the West?If that's the case, we are plunging head-long toward listing the grouse."
Can a chatbot help you find love?:::::Image copyright Getty Images I've been nervously chatting to Lara on the dating platform Match.com for two minutes.She's flattered me about my age ("so young!")and she says she's going to take care of me.I like her already - but Lara is not real.She - or rather, it - is a chatbot, an artificially intelligent computer program developed to communicate with people online.The bot was launched in France in 2016 and then rolled out in the UK in April 2017, to help potential clients get started in their search for love by setting up their Match profile for them.It was the first to be released by a major dating site and the firm claims that 300,000 people a month complete their dating profiles with help from Lara.Image copyright Match.com The chatbot is not a voice-controlled interface - you communicate by typing - but it can operate in 12 languages, asking users simple questions about what they are looking for and what they are like.Experts say it can also encourage people to be more honest about what they really want, rather than write what they think others will want to see."The profile is the big hurdle [for the industry]," says Mark Brooks, a dating sector consultant."People don't really want to create a profile, it's not much fun."But if you are having a conversation with somebody they will be more willing.And if you can create a profile from a conversation it will probably be closer to the truth."Match says Lara boosted registration rates by 30%, and it can now also recommend matches based on user data.Image copyright Getty Images While the bot isn't supposed to break hearts, the chat is affable, friendly, informal.It asks friendly questions, you answer, and there's a short, reassuring response before the next request for information.Try to go off script, however, and you won't get very far."How are you?"I asked Lara."Hello, hello," she replied with a winking emoticon."Do you have any hobbies?"(I never said I was good at chatting people up)."I don't understand.Which gender are you?"she replied, giving me a choice of two buttons to press."Do you understand me?""Oops, your email address is invalid," she responded, with a sad face.Perhaps we're not soulmates after all."[Clients] know it's a bot, they are 100% aware they are not talking to a human," says Xavier De Baillenx, innovation lead at Match."You have to engage users with the right tone of voice," he adds."We tested Lara with no personality, Lara with jokes - and we found that having a personality can be more effective."The Match group has now also launched Julia, a similar chatbot for its over-50s dating site Our Time and Mr De Baillenx says there are more "agents" on their way.But why aren't there more of them in the dating space already?Perhaps one reason is that people can be notoriously rude to bots.Microsoft's Twitter bot experiment Tay had to be disabled within a day when those who communicated with it taught it to be racist and misogynistic, and a popular Japanese app called The Boyfriend Maker was terminated when its virtual boyfriends started engaging in very lewd chat.Image copyright Twitter Image caption Microsoft's Twitter experiment Tay developed extreme views very quickly "I call this the 'abducted by aliens' problem," said Ludwig Konrad Bull, MD of Elixirr, speaking at the recent iDate conference in London."You would never write on a form that you've been abducted by an alien.But for some reason, you're more likely to say that to a bot."If you look at how similar a robot is to a person, the more similar the robot is to the person, the more empathetic that person is towards the robot, but right before the robot seems just like a person people start really despising it.People don't want machines to be as intelligent as humans right now."Mr De Baillenx says not many of Match's customers try to do "weird things" with Lara.But John Taylor, CEO of action.ai, believes chatbots aren't yet mature enough for people to resist trying their luck - the language skills are just not there, as I discovered with Lara."A chatbot is about how you have a conversation with a business or a person who is not real," he says."We want people to talk naturally to a chatbot and be understood.But the technology is not there today.We have technology which solves that problem but it's not broadly available on the market."Xavier de Baillenx admits that the language side "is not so easy"."With Lara we spend quite a long time on understanding human language," he says.Repeat business In future though, a chatbot could offer a lot more to the dating space than getting you started on your search for love - which could prove lucrative for those in the business."It's a strange industry," says Mark Brooks."If we do a good job we wave goodbye to our customers."There's a lot we are missing out on by not helping people with their relationships once they have found that person."Whether people are ready to accept relationship advice from the likes of Lara remains to be seen."Maybe chatbots can be used to train people how to date.There's a lot of psychology involved, best practice.It could probably give you tips and tricks," says Srini Janarthanam from Chatomate, talking at at iDate."And if you don't get to date anybody else, maybe you can date the chatbot."
YouTube to restrict 'disturbing' children's videos, if flagged:::::Image copyright YouTube: Kids Fun TV Image caption One unofficial cartoon shows Peppa Pig having teeth pulled at the dentist YouTube is to restrict the availability of videos showing children's characters in violent or sexual scenes if they are reported by viewers.Last week, a blog post by writer James Bridle highlighted how YouTube was still being swamped by bizarre and indecent videos aimed at children.The site says it already stops such videos earning advertising revenue.YouTube said its team was "made up of parents who are committed to improving our apps and getting this right".But critics say YouTube is not taking enough action by waiting for viewers to report inappropriate videos.'Something's wrong' The problem of video-makers using popular characters such as Peppa Pig in violent or sexual videos, to frighten children, has been widely reported.However, Mr Bridle's blog post went deeper into what he called the rabbit hole of children's content on YouTube.He gave examples of videos aimed at children that were not necessarily violent or sexual but were sinister, "disturbing" or otherwise inappropriate.Often it appeared that the videos had been algorithmically generated to capitalise on popular trends.Image copyright YouTube: Animals For Kids Image caption In one clip, Spiderman and Elsa, from Frozen, fire machine guns "Stock animations, audio tracks, and lists of keywords being assembled in their thousands to produce an endless stream of videos," he said.Many used popular family entertainment characters such as Spiderman, and Elsa from Frozen, and had been viewed millions of times."Someone or something or some combination of people and things is using YouTube to systematically frighten, traumatise, and abuse children, automatically and at scale," he wrote.YouTube says it has already barred such videos from earning advertising money when they are reported by viewers, to try to remove the incentive to produce them.However, many of the videos do not get reported by viewers and continue to carry advertisements.YouTube has now said it will give such videos an age restriction if they are reported by viewers, so they cannot be viewed by people under 18.Image copyright YouTube: Babyfun TV Image caption Some of the videos are not rude or violent but use Disney characters in odd situations Age-restricted videos are blocked from appearing in the YouTube Kids app, which is primarily curated by algorithms.They also cannot be viewed on the YouTube website unless people are logged in with an adult's account.However, a report in the New York Times found that inappropriate videos have previously slipped through the net.YouTube says it uses human reviewers to evaluate whether flagged videos are appropriate for a family audience.In his blog post, Mr Bridle said he did not know how YouTube could stamp out the problem."We have built a world which operates at scale, where human oversight is simply impossible, and no manner of inhuman oversight will counter most of the examples I've used in this essay," he said.
Apple fixes iPhone letter 'i' bug:::::Image copyright APple Apple has addressed a glitch that caused some iPhones to unexpectedly start auto-correcting the letter "i" to a capital "A" and a question mark.The issue emerged when people updated their phones to version 11.1 of the iOS operating system.In a tweet, Apple said people could "fix it by installing the latest software update".The update also addresses an issue with Siri.The company has not explained what caused the problem.The problem was highlighted last week when people trying to tweet messages such as "I got a new iPhone" found their posts were appearing as "A[?]got a new iPhone".At the time, Apple outlined a temporary fix for the problem on its website.The fix involved editing the keyboard settings in iOS so that the right character, either an upper or lower case "i", was used.An online discussion forum on Apple's website includes comments from people affected by the bug."This is super-annoying," wrote one.
Government urged to act over computer science GCSEs:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The lack of skilled teachers is the biggest problem, the report found More than half of England's secondary schools, 54%, did not offer GCSE computer science in 2015-16, a report from the Royal Society has found.It urged the government to increase spending on computer education tenfold over the next five years to ensure youngsters can "unlock the full potential of new technologies".The biggest issue was the lack of skilled teachers, the report found.The Department for Education said more pupils were choosing the subject."We want to ensure our future workforce has the skills we need to drive the future productivity and economy of this country and that is why the government made computing a compulsory part of the national curriculum," said a spokesperson."Computer science GCSE entries continue to rise more quickly than any other subject."We recently saw an increase in entries to Stem subjects [science, technology, engineering and maths] for the English Baccalaureate (EBacc) and the number of girls taking Stem subjects at A-levels has increased by over 17% since 2010."Since 2012, the department has pledged 5m to the Network of Teaching Excellence in Computer Science programme, which has built a national network of nearly 400 computer science specialists (who) schools can commission to provide bespoke training for their teachers."Computer science in numbers The number of schools not offering the subject at GCSE represented 30% of the total number of pupils in England Across the UK, the report found that that only 11% of students in England took GCSE computer science In 2017 only 20% of GCSE candidates in the subject were female and the figure fell to 10% at A-level Bournemouth had the highest percentage of pupils (23%) opting to take computer science Hartlepool, Harrow and Bracknell Forest had the highest proportion of school offering the subject at GCSE level, not including the Isles of Scilly which has a 100% rate as it teaches it at its only school Two in three schools near the UK's technology hub in East London, did not offer it to pupils as a GSCE option Other London boroughs, including Islington, Kensington & Chelsea, Tower Hamlets and the City of London also had a low proportion of schools offering the subject The Royal Society, the UK's independent scientific academy, is concerned about how the lack of computing expertise will affect the future workforce.Prof Steve Furber, who worked on the report, said: "Computing teachers have told us that they feel the government rushed in a new curriculum without giving them the support or money to deliver it."The report paints a bleak picture in England, which meets only 68% of its computing teacher recruitment targets and where, as a result, one in two schools don't offer computer science at GCSE, a crucial stage of young people's education."He added that, "overhauling the fragile state of our computing education" would require an ambitious, multipronged approach.The Royal Society called for: A 60m investment in computer education over the next five years The training of 8,000 secondary school computing teachers Analysis by Rory Cellan-Jones, BBC News technology correspondent This report highlights what some teachers have been telling me for a while - that the revolution in computing education in the UK has stalled.Five years ago a head of steam built up behind the idea that children needed to be taught coding and that the ICT GCSE was not fit for purpose, teaching little more than how to use Microsoft Office.The government responded by taking ICT off the National Curriculum and replacing it with computer science.But this course is proving far more demanding of both pupils and teachers, and many schools have decided that it is just not worth the bother at a time when resources are tight.Some ICT teachers who had always argued that it was a practical course, attractive to a far wider range of children, are now saying "I told you so".But across the world of computing education there's agreement on one thing - more money needs to be spent on training teachers in this vital subject.Prof Furber's views were echoed by technology firms Microsoft and Google, who are both working to increase computer skills among schoolchildren.Google's UK managing director Ronan Harris said: "There is still much more to do to ensure young people across the UK have access to computer science education."Whatever school they attend or whatever field they plan to go into, every student should have the opportunity to understand the principles and practices of computing."And Microsoft's UK chief executive Cindy Rose said: "The risk, if we don't make these investments now, is that too many young people struggle to access new opportunities and the UK loses its advantage in a world being transformed by technology."
Phishing helps hackers hijack accounts, says Google study:::::Image copyright designer491 Image caption Many people still use passwords that are very easy to guess Cyber-thieves grab almost 250,000 valid log-in names and passwords for Google accounts every week, suggests research.The study by Google and UC Berkeley looked at the ways email and other accounts get hijacked.It used 12 months of log-in and account data found on websites and criminal forums or which had been harvested by hacking tools.Google said the research helped secure accounts by showing how people fell victim to scammers and hackers.During the 12 months studying the underground markets, the researchers identified more than 788,000 credentials stolen via keyloggers, 12 million grabbed via phishing and 1.9 billion from breaches at other companies.Phishing involves attempts to trick people into handing over personal information and keyloggers are programs that record every key someone presses when using a computer.Physical location The most useful information for cyber-thieves came from keyloggers and phishing attacks as these included valid passwords in 12%-25% of attacks, it found.Phishing attacks posed the biggest risk to users as these helped malicious hackers scoop up about 234,000 valid names and passwords every week.By contrast, keyloggers only yielded about 15,000 valid credentials each week.Cyber-attackers also sought to grab other information that could be useful in attacks, said the researchers.Data about a person's internet address (IP) as well as the device they were using and their physical location were all potentially useful for attackers seeking to defeat security checks.Popular passwords found in data breaches 123456 password 123456789 abc123 password1 111111 qwerty 12345678 1234567 Gathering this data was much harder, found the research, with only 3.8% of people who had credentials leaked also giving away IP addresses and fewer than 0.001% surrendering detailed device information.In a blog, Google said it would use the results of the research to refine the ways it spotted and blocked attempts to take over accounts.In particular it would enhance efforts to use historical data about where users logged in and the devices they used to thwart impersonation attacks.The company has a range of resources for people affected or looking to protect themselves.However, the researchers acknowledged that the "multi-pronged problem" of account hijacking required efforts in lots of different areas.It noted that only 3.1% of people who had an account hijacked subsequently started using improved security measures, such as two-factor authentication, after they regained control of a lost account.Because of this, they said, educating users about better ways to protect accounts should become a "major initiative".
Uber loses court appeal against drivers' rights:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Two Uber drivers take opposing views on how the company should treat them Taxi-hailing app firm Uber has lost an appeal against a ruling that its drivers should be treated as workers rather than self-employed.Last year a tribunal ruled drivers James Farrar and Yaseen Aslam were Uber staff and entitled to holiday pay, paid rest breaks and the minimum wage.Uber appealed, arguing its drivers were self employed and were under no obligation to use its booking app.The firm said it would appeal against this latest ruling, too.Uber which has up to 50,000 drivers using its app in the UK, claims 80% of them would rather be classed as self employed.Uber said there were two further possible stages in the appeal process - the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court.The Employment Tribunal upheld its original decision that any Uber driver who had the Uber app switched on was working for the company under a "worker" contract.Image caption James Farrar is one of the two drivers at the centre of the case It said they were therefore entitled to workers' rights.Uber has faced regulatory and legal setbacks in a host of cities around the world.In London, where it has the bulk of its business, it is fighting to retain its licence to continue operating.'Huge relief' James Farrar, from Hampshire, told the BBC how he was feeling: "Just huge relief.I really hope it will stick this time and that Uber will obey the ruling of the court."I'd like Uber to sit down and work out how as quickly as possible that every driver who is working for Uber get the rights they are entitled to."Image copyright PA How did the Uber case come about?The law firm Leigh Day started the legal action against Uber on behalf of 25 members of the GMB union, which initially included Mr Farrar and Mr Aslam, although the two pursued this latest case with a different union, the IWGB.Leigh Day is still involved in legal action against Uber and represents a total of 68 drivers in a group claim against the company.The company's Nigel Mackay said, in theory, any Uber driver in the UK could benefit from Friday's tribunal ruling, should it stand uncontested: "The judgment directly applies to the original 25 claimants in the claim, and since then another 43 drivers have joined."However, given that all Uber drivers work in essentially the same way, then there is no reason why the same principles wouldn't apply across all drivers in the UK and they would all be free to join the claim and be entitled to compensation."IWGB's general secretary, Dr Jason Moyer-Lee, said: "Today's victory is further proof, as if any more was needed, that the law is clear and these companies are simply choosing to deprive workers of their rights."The GMB union said the ruling, by the Employment Appeal Tribunal (EAT), was a "landmark victory" for workers' rights, especially in the gig economy, a system of casual working which does not commit a business or a worker to set hours or rights.Maria Ludkin, the GMB's legal director, said: "Uber must now face up to its responsibilities and give its workers the rights to which they are entitled."GMB urges the company not to waste everyone's time and money dragging their lost cause to the Supreme Court."Image copyright PA Tom Elvidge, Uber UK's acting general manager, said: "Almost all taxi and private hire drivers have been self-employed for decades, long before our app existed."The main reason why drivers use Uber is because they value the freedom to choose if, when and where they drive and so we intend to appeal."He went on to say that EAT's decision relied on an assertion that drivers were required to take 80% of trips sent to them when logged into the app, but, he said, "as drivers who use Uber know, this has never been the case in the UK".He also said a number of changes had been made to the app over the last year, and that Uber had "invested in things like access to illness and injury cover".
Broadband and landline users to get automatic compensation:::::Image copyright BT Householders who receive poor service from their telecoms provider are to get automatic compensation, the regulator Ofcom has announced.From 2019 they will get 8 a day if a fault is not fixed, paid as a refund through their bill.This is less than the 10 that was proposed when Ofcom began its consultation earlier this year.Providers will also have to pay 5 a day if their broadband or landline is not working on the day it was promised.If an engineer misses an appointment, they will have to give 25 in compensation.Ofcom has estimated as many as 2.6 million people could benefit from the new rules.142m pay-outs The agreement covers consumers who have contracts with BT, Sky, Talk Talk, Virgin Media and Zen Internet - which make up around 90% of telecoms customers in the UK.Plusnet and EE are expected to join the scheme at a later date.How compensation will work Image copyright Getty Images Consumers will have to phone up to complain initially Service not working, and not fixed after two days: 8 compensation a day Missed engineer appointment, or less than 24 hours notice of cancellation: 25 for each appointment Delayed starting date: 5 a day "Waiting too long for your landline or broadband to be fixed is frustrating enough, without having to fight for compensation," said Lindsey Fussell, Ofcom's consumer group director."So providers will have to pay money back automatically, whenever repairs or installations don't happen on time, or an engineer doesn't turn up."People will get the money they deserve, while providers will want to work harder to improve their service."Ofcom said the scheme would not come in to operation until early 2019, because of the complexity of the changes.It said that billing systems and online accounts would need to be altered, and staff would need to be re-trained.Help In total, customers can expect to get 142m in pay-outs every year, according to Ofcom's estimates.At the moment telecoms users can get compensation in theory, but only around 15% of those who complain manage to get a refund.Even then most only get small amounts, said Ofcom.Anyone wanting to obtain compensation under the current arrangements can find help on the Ofcom website.Which?said that those providers who have not already joined the automatic compensation scheme should do so.
Twitter halts 'broken' verified-profile system:::::Image copyright Getty Images Twitter has suspended its verified-profile scheme and described it as "broken", following complaints over the type of accounts being verified.Typically, prominent people, including musicians, journalists and company executives, get a blue icon on their profile after proving their identity.However, some far-right and white-supremacist accounts have now also been verified.Twitter founder Jack Dorsey said the scheme would now be "reconsidered".Image caption Verified profiles display a blue badge next to their name In a statement, the company said: "Verification was meant to authenticate identity and voice, but it is interpreted as an endorsement or an indicator of importance."We recognise that we have created this confusion and need to resolve it."The company said no further "general" accounts would be verified, while it worked on a fix.Twitter has been making a series of changes to address abuse and harassment on the social network.Last week, it published a rewritten version of its rules, which it said would make them easier to understand.
Universities to be warned over misleading adverts:::::Image caption Universities are going to be given tougher guidance on their advertising claims Universities are going to face a crackdown on how they advertise and market courses to attract students.With hundreds of thousands of young people in the process of applying, universities are going to be warned by the advertising watchdog that they need to prove the accuracy of their claims.It is expected that universities will be told not to mislead or exaggerate in language used in adverts for students.They will scrutinise claims such as being in the "top 1%".The University of Reading has already had to take down its claim to be the top 1% of the world's universities, because it could not be objectively substantiated.Next week the Advertising Standards Authority is expected to identify up to six more universities which have breached the advertising code - along with issuing tougher guidelines on what is permissible language in marketing.Image copyright University of Reading Image caption The University of Reading had to stop saying it was in the top 1% in the world It has emerged that two universities have already agreed to clarify advertising.The watchdog says the University of Bedfordshire faced a complaint about claiming to have "gold standard" teaching quality - when the university held a silver award in the new teaching excellence ratings.Liverpool John Moores University was challenged over being more specific about its claim to be "university of the year".It won the title in this year's "Educate North Awards".'Competing for students' Universities are competing for students and their fee income and have been putting increasing efforts into how they appeal to potential applicants, selling marketing information on websites and on open days.There has been a proliferation of league tables and rankings which are used to base claims about "world class" status for universities or individual degree courses.The advertising watchdog has been considering whether university claims are justified by any "objective substantiation" - and without "adequate substantiation", can rule them to be "misleading".If advertisers persistently refuse to accept rulings from the watchdog, they can be referred to trading standards officers, who could impose fines.But the advertising watchdog says advertisers are more likely to comply rather than face "bad publicity".The University of Reading was told in the summer that it could be "materially misleading" to market itself as being in the top 1% of all world universities - a claim made by several other UK universities.The claim had been based on Reading's ranking in a number of international league tables - but without a clear agreement over how many universities there are in the world, such a claim was deemed as unacceptable.The university agreed to remove the claim and the complaint was "informally resolved" without a formal investigation or ruling.But it is understood that the issue was then raised with wider university representative groups - because many universities make such specific claims about their international reputations.
Harry Potter game is Pokemon Go creator's next trick:::::Image copyright Warner Bros Interactive Image caption A logo but no footage has been released for the new game The maker of Pokemon Go has revealed it is working on a Harry Potter-themed follow-up that will also include augmented reality features.Niantic said players would find and fight fantasy beasts in real-world neighbourhoods in the smartphone game, which has yet to get a release date.Pokemon Go reportedly had about 45 million daily players at its peak and generated more than $1.2bn (915m) in sales.One expert said the Harry Potter brand had the potential for similar success.Publisher Warner Bros Interactive owns the video game rights to the Harry Potter series.It has previously developed Lego-branded tie-in titles via its TT Games subsidiary as well partnering with Electronic Arts to create action-adventures that launched alongside the movies.Warner said Niantic's Harry Potter: Wizards Unite was just one of several new games based on JK Rowling's characters that are planned.They will all be released under a new label - Portkey Games - so-named because Portkeys transport wizards from place to place in the books.Image copyright Niantic Image caption Niantic continues to add features and characters to Pokemon Go Claims that Niantic would make a Harry Potter-themed game were first reported in July 2016 but were dismissed as a hoax, not least because the San Francisco-based developer was still rolling out Pokemon Go at the time.The Pokemon title became the first mainstream hit for augmented reality, in which real-world views captured via a camera are mixed together with computer graphics on the screen.Niantic had previously attempted to popularise AR with Ingress, a location-based sci-fi game released in 2012.But it was only after it took on an established brand that it caught the wider public's attention.Image copyright Warner Bros Interactive Image caption Lego-themed Harry Potter titles have already proved to be highly popular on games consoles "I think the Harry Potter game is a huge deal," commented Piers Harding-Rolls from the IHS Markit consultancy."If you look at the different major franchises out there, I don't think there are many that could do Pokemon Go justice as a follow-up."Relatively few details have been provided at this point about the forthcoming game, except that it will involve players learning spells before exploring their neighbourhoods to search for mysterious artefacts and fight "legendary beasts" with the option to team up with others to "take down powerful enemies".Potter fans have been told they will have to wait until next year to discover more.The title is likely to take advantage of enhanced augmented reality features provided by Apple and Google via their ARKit and ARCore developer tools, which were not available when Pokemon Go launched.But Niantic may be mindful that many of Pokemon Go's remaining fans play it with its AR features switched off because it makes the game easier to play and helps save battery life."I expect the Harry Potter augmented reality experiences will be more robust and complex than they were in Pokemon Go, which should make the game more dynamic and the experience more engaging," Mr Harding-Rolls predicted."But I still don't think they will be essential to the experience."
FBI seeks to unlock Texas shooter's iPhone:::::Image copyright KSAT 12 / Reuters Image caption FBI agents joined local law enforcement at the scene Apple has offered to help the FBI unlock the smartphone of the gunman who killed 26 people at a church in Texas last Sunday.Devin Kelley wounded 20 others at the First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs and was later found dead in his vehicle, some miles away.The FBI said his handset had been sent to its central crime lab, in Virginia, as local police could not unlock it.Apple said it had "immediately" offered to help.The company said it worked with law enforcement agencies every day and had trained "thousands" of officers about the best way to handle its devices and how to request information.If Kelley had saved his phone data on Apple's iCloud service, this too may hold information about numbers called, messages sent and pictures it was used to take.Dead man's finger "It actually highlights an issue that you've all heard about before, the advance of the technology and the phones and the encryptions," said FBI special agent Christopher Combs."Law enforcement, whether at the state or local or the federal level, is increasingly not able to get into these phones."However, there has been speculation the FBI may have missed an early chance to get at data on Kelley's phone.Apple iPhones locked with a fingerprint ask for a passcode only after they have not been unlocked for a 48-hour period.And it is therefore possible the phone could have been unlocked by the dead man's finger in the hours after his death, provided it had not run out of battery, or been deliberately switched off or rebooted.
Humans to vet Facebook revenge porn photos:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Revenge porn - where ex-lovers share intimate images without consent - can cause misery for victims Humans rather than algorithms will view the naked images voluntarily sent to Facebook in a scheme being trialled in Australia to combat revenge porn.The BBC understands that members of Facebook's community operations team will look at the images in order to make a "fingerprint" of them to prevent them being uploaded again.Facebook will notify the person once the photo has been "hashed'.It will then be up to the sender to delete the image.The trial, which could be extended to other countries, is seen as a way of of allowing users greater control over their intimate photos - offering a a pre-emptive protection against future misuse of the pictures by disgruntled ex-lovers.'Redouble efforts' Users wanting to take part in the scheme must first complete an online form on the Australian e-safety commissioner's website.Then they need to message themselves their nude photos via Messenger and the e-safety commissioner's office will notify Facebook of their submission.A Facebook community officer can access those photos to "hash" them, and they will then notify the person via the secure email provided via the commissioner's website.Revenge porn is a growing issue in Australia where studies suggest that one in five women aged 18-45 may have been victims.Experts in the field have welcomed the initiative but have warned that it will only tackle the problem on Facebook and its associated sites, WhatsApp and Instagram.Prof Clare McGlynn, from Durham Law School, said that the UK should establish a similar organisation to Australia's e-safety commission."We must redouble efforts to challenge the root causes - challenging those who share images without consent," she said."We must condemn such forms of non-consensual sexual activity in the strongest terms, and work with young people on this."
Vodafone plans UK fibre broadband roll-out:::::Image copyright Getty Images Vodafone has announced plans to provide up to five million UK properties with "full fibre" internet connections.The telecoms firm company is partnering with broadband network specialist CityFibre to achieve the goal by 2025.Vodafone said the initiative would deliver a "superior product at a lower cost" than relying on Openreach's infrastructure, as it does at present.Openreach, which currently supplies broadband across the UK, said it welcomed the move.However, one expert said the BT division would be concerned.Higher demand "Full fibre" broadband refers to the fact that fibre-optic cables run directly to properties, rather than relying on copper cables to connect the buildings to roadside cabinets.This provides a more robust and faster connection, but is more expensive to deploy.Vodafone says customers can expect to receive gigabit speeds - 1,000 megabits per second or higher - when it begins to roll out the service next year.Under the deal, CityFibre will own and operate the new network and Vodafone will get exclusive rights to it for an unspecified period of time.Construction of the first phase of the project is due to begin before July, and will initially aim to connect one million properties, In addition, Vodafone will use the network to support radio base stations it intends to deploy ahead of the launch of a 5G mobile data service."Vodafone has made investment in fibre build-out a massive priority in the last two to three years - particularly in Spain and Italy," commented Mark Newman, chief analyst at the ConnectivityX research firm."The amount of data the mobile networks are carrying is going up by 50% a year - and as you build more and more mobile sites to cope with the demand in traffic... you need more fibre to carry that signal back from the base stations into the network."Privately unhappy Openreach is already pursuing a plan to connect fibre to 10 million UK homes and businesses by the mid-2020s.It said it hoped Vodafone's plan would "complement" its own effort."As we've said consistently - investing in more fibre-to-the-premises technology across the UK will need commitment from the whole industry," said a spokesman.But Mr Newman, said the division was likely to be privately unhappy about the development."Openreach is a pretty good business for BT," he explained."Any operator that chooses to install their own fibre or go to a third party is going to mean one less customer."
TripAdvisor to flag hotels with reports of sexual assault:::::Image copyright Getty Images Travel website TripAdvisor has added tags informing users of hotels where sexual assaults have been reported.The warning badges are designed to identify health, discrimination and safety issues, the company said.The announcement came after the website was accused of deleting several reviews in which users reported being sexually assaulted at hotels in Mexico.Three hotel resorts in the Playa del Carmen region of Mexico were flagged with the new warning tag on Wednesday."These badges will remain on TripAdvisor for up to three months; however, if the issues persist we may extend the duration of the badge," TripAdvisor spokesman Kevin Carter told the New York Times."These badges are intended to be informative, not punitive," he added.Image copyright CBS The decision to create the badge system was made following an investigation by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel newspaper that found the website had repeatedly deleted a 2010 post by a Texas woman alleging she had been raped by a hotel security guard at the Iberostar Paraiso Maya resort.Kristie Love, 35, was reportedly told her 2010 forum post was deleted several times because it violated the company's "family-friendly" policy.The newspaper spoke to other women who were allegedly assaulted at the same hotel and also had their reviews deleted by TripAdvisor.More than 400 million people visit TripAdvisor every month, according to CBS News.Customers who visit flagged pages will now see a small red box at the stop stating: "TripAdvisor has been made aware of recent media reports or events concerning this property which may not be reflected in reviews found on this listing."Accordingly, you may wish to perform additional research for information about this property when making your travel plans."Decisions to add or remove badges will be made by a committee of employees, Mr Carter said.The company has also announced a new policy to explain to users why reviews or forum posts are deleted.If one is removed, TripAdvisor said it will "be more clear about the reasons the review doesn't meet guidelines and what part of it is in violation".The move comes amid mounting allegations of sexual misconduct against prominent men, after dozens of women accused Hollywood movie mogul Harvey Weinstein of sexual assault or harassment.He has denied the charges against him.
Reddit bans 'involuntarily celibate' community:::::Image copyright Reddit Image caption The /r/incels subreddit was banned on Tuesday Social website Reddit has banned a controversial subreddit dedicated to "involuntarily celibate" men, known as incels.The 41,000-strong community was ostensibly a support group for men who wanted to have sex, but found themselves unable to form romantic relationships.Over time, the group became a repository of misogynistic abuse, rape threats and febrile discussion of "Chads" - men apparently not afflicted by incels' sexual insufficiency.The move comes within three weeks of the website banning several other subsections, mostly affiliated with the extreme right, for hosting "violent content".Image copyright Reddit Image caption The Incels subreddit sometimes went 'private', unavailable to the wider Reddit membership From Tuesday, users attempting to access the subreddit - a self-contained community on the Reddit website - were instead faced with a generic message announcing the ban."This community has been banned," the message states."This subreddit was banned due to a violation of our content policy, specifically, our site-wide rules regarding violent content."You might also like: In the past week, threads featuring on the subreddit have ranged from overtly misogynistic, to violent, to self-pitying."A reminder that no female has ever looked at you and thought you were attractive," proclaims one thread, a few lines above another declaring "women are horrible human beings in every aspect of life".In October, one member of the incel group reportedly impersonated a woman to ask another subreddit dedicated to legal advice "how rapists get caught".Skip Twitter post by @FemalesFighting A member of r/incels pretended to be a woman to ask r/legal advice on how to get away with rape.This pit of misogyny needs to be shutdown!pic.twitter.com/b4unbFQNTV Fighting For Females (@FemalesFighting) November 8, 2017 Report Some posts on the forum have glorified Elliot Rodger, a man who killed six people in a 2014 California rampage after publishing a "manifesto" detailing his hatred of women.It is unclear if there was a specific incident which led to the subreddit's closure, but the ban came after some users discussed castrating another user's roommate.Reddit updated its policy on violent content in October.Discussing the changes, a Reddit administrator said existing rules governing violent content were too vague."Going forward, we will take action against any content that encourages, glorifies, incites or calls for violence or physical harm against an individual or a group of people," they wrote on a subreddit dedicated to updating the site's moderators.A Reddit spokesperson told The Guardian: "Communities focused on this content and users who post such content will be banned from the site.As of November 7, r/Incels has been banned for violating this policy."Reddit is the home to some of the most authentic conversations online.We strive to be a welcoming, open platform for all by trusting our users to maintain an environment that cultivates genuine conversation."Free speech Historically, Reddit has tolerated publication of content which is offensive or discriminatory in the name of free speech.But in recent years a number of high-profile subreddits have been banned, though a number of highly controversial communities remain.In February 2017, the r/AltRight subreddit was closed.The community had been a key discussion forum for members of the far right.In November 2016, a subreddit dedicated to discussion of the false Pizzagate conspiracy theory was also prohibited.Earlier this year Reddit shut down r/Physical_Removal for inciting violence, such as promoting the use of physical violence against political opponents.The subreddit gained notoriety in the aftermath of a far-right rally in Charlottesville which saw a counter-protester murdered by a white supremacist.
Code bug freezes $150m of Ethereum crypto-cash:::::Image copyright CasPhotography More than $150m (115m) of a crypto-currency called Ethereum may have been permanently frozen after a code bug was accidentally triggered.The bug was in code written by Parity Technologies to create digital wallets holding virtual coins - called Ether.It let someone hunting for bugs become the joint owner of hundreds of wallets.However, when the unidentified person tried to reverse their mistake they stopped the original owners of the wallets getting access too.Find and fix In a statement, Parity Technologies said all wallets created after 20 July this year were affected by the mistake.It provided a link to a separate page on which Ether holders could check to see if their wallet was among this vulnerable batch.Parity expressed regret over the "great deal of stress and confusion" the incident had caused.It added: "We continue to investigate the situation and are exploring all possible implications and solutions."It is not yet clear whether Parity will be able to rectify the mistake.This is because the unidentified person who triggered the problem used a function that "suicided" code that could have been used to resurrect the wallets.Estimates of exactly how much of Ethereum's coins has been frozen vary widely.Low estimates put the figure at $150m but others suggest it could be as high as $300m.The bug was triggered while an unnamed developer was looking through the Parity code for ways that it could be exploited.Only wallets created after 20 July are affected because they use an updated version of Parity's wallet program issued to fix another bug that led to $30m of Ethereum coins being stolen.Ethereum is a crypto-currency similar to Bitcoin that uses a large network of computers to verify transactions and generate new coins.Currently, one Ether digital coin is worth about $314.
Facebook 'remembers' nude images to combat revenge porn:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Revenge porn has affected up to one in five Australian women, according to one study Facebook is testing a system that allows users to message themselves their nude photos in an effort to combat so-called revenge porn.It will store a "fingerprint" of images to prevent any copies of them being shared by disgruntled ex-lovers.The trial is in Australia, where studies suggest one in five women aged 18-45 may have had image-based abuse.But one expert says there will still be problems outside Facebook and related sites such as WhatsApp and Instagram.Facebook said it looked forward "to getting feedback and learning" from the trial.Revenge porn is a growing issue in Australia, according to e-safety commissioner Julie Inman Grant, who is working with Facebook on the trial."We see many scenarios where maybe photos or videos were taken consensually at one point, but there was not any sort of consent to send the images or videos more broadly," she told ABC News.'Innovative' She sought to reassure potential victims who might be concerned about proactively sending themselves intimate photos."It would be like sending yourself your image in email, but obviously this is a much safer, secure end-to-end way of sending the image without sending it through the ether," she said."They're not storing the image, they're storing the link and using artificial intelligence and other photo-matching technologies."Users wanting to take part in the trial must first file a report with the commissioner, who will in turn share it with Facebook.Prof Clare McGlynn, an expert from Durham Law School, described it as "an innovative experiment"."I welcome Facebook taking steps to tackle this issue, as it has often been very slow to act in the past.However, this approach is only ever going to work for a few people and when we think of the vast number of nudes taken and shared each day, this clearly isn't a solution," she told the BBC.Graham Cluley, a security consultant, said that security would be the priority."Facebook knows that there will be many people concerned about how it handles such sensitive content, and I imagine they have put a good deal of thought into minimising the chances that anything goes wrong."In March, Facebook was embroiled in a scandal when it emerged that a 30,000-strong private members group, Marine United, was routinely sharing images of nude women.The group - made up of US marines - shared photographs of naked and semi-naked female colleagues.In response to the revelations, Facebook introduced a feature that tagged pictures reported to it as revenge porn using photo-matching technology.It used this to prevent the image spreading and closed down the majority of accounts reported to it as hosting such images.

Google promoted Texas gunman fake tweets:::::Google says it is "not happy" that its search results displayed false information about Texas gunman Devin Patrick Kelley, who killed 26 people.The search engine displayed a carousel of posts "popular on Twitter" that contained false stories that Kelley was a Muslim and a left-wing extremist.Google's Danny Sullivan said the tweets were promoted by the site's "ranking algorithm", which would be improved."We want to get this right," he said on Twitter.Google was criticised in October after the Top Stories section of its search results contained fake news about the Las Vegas shooting.Mr Sullivan, who is Google's public liaison for search, said changes to the site's algorithms had prevented the same situation happening with the Texas shooting."We took deserved criticism after our Top Stories section carried misleading information after the Las Vegas shooting," he wrote."Early changes put in place after Las Vegas shootings seemed to help with Texas."Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Texas shooting: How to spot a hoax However, this time it displayed false tweets in its search results suggesting Kelley was a member of a pro-Bernie Sanders group, that he had converted to Islam and that he was a "radical alt-left" activist.Mr Sullivan said the false tweets appeared for only a "short time" and they were displayed below legitimate search results.He promised the feature would be improved over time.Skip Twitter post by @dannysullivan Bottom line: we want to show authoritative information.Much internal talk yesterday on how to improve tweets in search; more will happen.Danny Sullivan (@dannysullivan) November 7, 2017 Report But some people criticised Google for keeping the function on its search results before it was fixed."Just kill the feature until it works," said journalist Peter Bright.

Hackers redirect schools to Islamic State video:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Hackers temporarily took control of school and other websites Some 800 schools across the US have been targeted by hackers and their websites redirected to an Islamic State-sponsored YouTube video.The attack, which lasted a few hours, affected schools in Arizona, Connecticut, Virginia and New Jersey.The hack, which also affected private companies and government websites, is being investigated by the FBI.All the websites are run by SchoolDesk.The Atlanta-based company is advising administrators to change passwords.Rogue file It said in a statement that "it immediately responded" when its technicians had found a small file injected into the root of one of its websites that redirected "to a YouTube video containing an audible Arabic message and a picture of Saddam Hussein"."Although the exact method and point of intrusion is not yet fully known (possibly an SQL injection or through a user account with a weak password), we have added multiple layers of redundant protection to prevent this from happening again," it said.On its website, Bloomfield School District, in New Jersey, said that its internal computer and data systems within the district "were completely unaffected".Mark James, a specialist at security company ESET, said: "In this case, gaining access to change or plant a rogue file that redirects users to areas of your design is about as simple as it gets - small footprint, no potential warning signs and out before anyone notices - but the results are as bad as they get."
Uber to work with Nasa on flying cars:::::Image copyright Uber Image caption Uber plans to test flying cars by 2020 Uber has struck a deal with the US National Aeronautical and Space Administration (Nasa) as part of its plans to roll out flying cars in cities around the world.It would work with the space agency to develop software for managing flying taxi routes, Uber's chief product officer Jeff Holden announced at the Web Summit in Lisbon.Nasa is yet to comment on the deal.Experts questioned whether the plan could ever get off the ground.Uber has been involved with regulatory tussles around the globe over its app-based taxi service, and is hoping to avoid similar rows over its air plans."We are very much embracing the regulatory bodies and starting very early in discussions about this and getting everyone aligned with the vision," said Mr Holden.Uber wants to see widespread use of electric, on-demand air taxis - part-drone, part fixed-wing aircraft - which could be ordered via a smartphone app in the same way as its road-based taxis.Moon shot?It is hoping to get its airborne ride-sharing service off the ground by 2020, when it plans tests in Dallas and Dubai.Previously, Nasa has said that it was working with a variety of companies to develop urban air mobility.The biggest issue is how potentially hundreds of thousands of aircraft could operate alongside existing air traffic control systems.Prof David Dunn, from the University of Birmingham, said there were many hurdles to overcome."Many firms are looking at this and there is a lot of blue sky thinking going on about how we can access the air in ways we haven't done before," he told the BBC."Technologically it is feasible but that is not to say that it is feasible in terms of opening up airspace.There are problems about how such transport will be policed, insured and registered."He compared Uber's plans to air carrier Pan Am, which in the 1960s promised to take paying customers to the Moon within a few years "Uber is associating its brand with the future.This might be more about marketing than a realistic product," he said.Uber does not plan to build aircraft, but rather the software that would manage the network.It said it would work with Pipistrel Aircraft and a variety of other companies who would build vertical take-off and landing aircraft.The company also announced that Los Angeles would be the third city to partner in pilots of the technology.It said it was working with developers Sandstone Properties in the city to build rooftop landing pads on skyscrapers.
Twitter to expand 280-character tweets:::::Image copyright Reuters Twitter plans to increase the number of characters in tweets from 140 to 280 for the majority of users.The new limit will not apply to tweets written in Japanese, Chinese and Korean which can convey more information in a single character.The move follows a trial among a small group of users which started in September in response to criticism that it was not easy enough to tweet.The change is part of Twitter's plan to attract new users and increase growth.Twitter brevity During the test, only 5% of tweets sent were longer than 140 characters and only 2% more than 190, the social media site said in a blog post.But those who did use the longer tweets, got more followers, more engagement and spent more time on the site, it added."During the first few days of the test, many people tweeted the full 280 limit because it was new and novel, but soon after behaviour normalised," wrote Aliza Rosen, Twitter's product manager."We saw when people needed to use more than 140 characters, they tweeted more easily and more often.But importantly, people tweeted below 140 most of the time and the brevity of Twitter remained."According to Twitter, 9% of tweets in English hit the character limits."This reflects the challenge of fitting a thought into a tweet, often resulting in lots of time spent editing and even at times abandoning tweets before sending," Ms Rosen said.Increasing the character limit should not affect people's experience on the site, she added."We - and many of you - were concerned that timelines may fill up with 280-character tweets, and people with the new limit would always use up the whole space.But that didn't happen."When the change was announced, many criticised it, pointing out changes they would rather see, such as a crackdown on hate crime and bots, and the introduction of a chronological timeline and edit function.The site currently has 330 million active users.This compares with 800 million for Instagram and more than 2 billion users for Facebook.
Facebook's fake news experiment backfires:::::Image copyright Facebook Image caption A variety of stories, from some questioning the monarchy to others about the Great British Bake Off, promoted comments questioning their truthfulness A Facebook test that promoted comments containing the word fake to the top of news feeds has been criticised by users.The trial, which Facebook says has now concluded, aimed to prioritise "comments that indicate disbelief".It meant feeds from the BBC, the Economist, the New York Times and the Guardian all began with a comment mentioning the word fake.The test, which was visible only to some users, left many frustrated.The comments appeared on a wide range of stories, from ones that could be fake to ones that were clearly legitimate.The remarks, which would appear at the top of the comments section, came from a variety of people but the one thing that they had in common was the word fake."Clearly Facebook is under enormous pressure to tackle the problem of fake news, but to question the veracity of every single story is preposterous," said Jen Roberts, a freelance PR consultant."Quite the reverse of combating misinformation online, it is compounding the issue by blurring the lines between what is real and what isn't.My Facebook feed has become like some awful Orwellian doublethink experiment."Many on Twitter also expressed annoyance.In a statement, Facebook told the BBC: "We're always working on ways to curb the spread of misinformation on our platform, and sometimes run tests to find new ways to do this.This was a small test which has now concluded."We wanted to see if prioritising comments that indicate disbelief would help.We're going to keep working to find new ways to help our community make more informed decisions about what they read and share."Facebook has been under enormous pressure to deal with the issue of fake news since it was singled out as one of the main distribution points for hoax stories during the US presidential election.In August it promised to step up its efforts to fight fake news by sending more suspected false stories to fact-checkers.It also launched a new feature that published alternative news links beneath suspect articles.
eBay removes 'Hawaiian sand' listings:::::Image copyright Getty Images EBay has removed items listed for sale on its website that claimed to contain small amounts of Hawaiian sand.The sand, from various parts of Hawaii, ranged in price from $3.50 (2.60) to $35, the Hawaii-Tribune Herald said.It is illegal to remove sand, coral, rocks or soil from the shoreline, although sand taken "inadvertently" on clothing or toys is exempt.Before a revision of the US law in 2013, one gallon of sand per day was allowed to be taken."While we haven't been directly contacted by the Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources, we are certainly willing to work with them on the best way to address this issue in the future," Ryan Moore, eBay director of global corporate affairs and communication, told the Tribune."We've removed the active listings on the marketplace and have educated the sellers that listing these products [is] against eBay policy."In August 2017, the Mediterranean island of Sardinia also introduced a law banning the removal of sand."Taking away a little bottle may not seem a big deal.But if all the millions of tourists did it, tonnes and tonnes would disappear every year," said the island's State Forestry Corp.
IBM pitches blockchain for cannabis sale:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Could blockchain help with Canada's legalisation of marijuana?Blockchain technology could provide a secure way to track the legal sale of cannabis in Canada, IBM has said.The British Columbia government has begun a public consultation on the legalisation of marijuana, which could take effect in July.Blockchain is a secure method of recording data using a digital ledger system distributed among hundreds of computers.The technology underlies crypto-currencies such as Bitcoin.Seed to sale IBM said: "Blockchain is an ideal mechanism in which BC can transparently capture the history of cannabis through the entire supply chain, ultimately ensuring consumer safety while exerting regulatory control - from seed to sale."Blockchain is a highly effective trust mechanism which uses a cryptographically-secure shared ledger to irrefutably track complex transactions amongst many known parties."The distributed nature of a blockchain database means it is harder for hackers to attack it and the data is kept secure and private because the cryptographic key that secures it cannot be converted back.Technology company Everledger is already using the technology to verify the history of diamond transactions.
Xbox One X: Microsoft 'not leaving current players behind':::::The world's most powerful console, the Xbox One X, has hit the shelves but it will set you back 450.But is it worth the hype and will it close the gap on PlayStation?"It's about giving customers choice," says Harvey Eagle the boss of Xbox in the UK."The Xbox One X sits at the premium end of our family of devices."Harvey Eagle was speaking to Newsbeat ahead of the release of the new console, which is the most powerful ever made.He says it shouldn't alienate current Xbox owners who won't have to upgrade if they don't want too."It sits comfortably with our current consoles," he says."Everything will work across all of those devices, the idea that nobody will be left behind is really important to us."The Xbox One X offers proper ultra high definition gaming with eight million pixels on the screen and games perform better but it won't have exclusive titles.Games like the newly released Assassin's Creed: Origins will play the same on both the standard Xbox One S and the new One X.However, the visuals are clearer and sharper, colours are more vibrant and loading times are faster on the new machine.To get the full benefit of those features fans will have to fork out 450 and invest in an Ultra HD television too.They can cost anything from 300 to several thousand pounds.Gaming YouTuber Ross 'TommyT999' Thompson tells us that, like its major rival the PlayStation 4 Pro, this release is aimed squarely at the hardcore gamer.He's been using both consoles with a standard HD TV."The hardcore will definitely see slight differences here and there," he says."The average gamer probably not, but then these two consoles are aimed at people who want to adopt the best quality as early as possible."Microsoft is hoping its investment in Ultra HD content, what's known as 4K gaming, will help boost its sales which have lagged behind Sony's PlayStation in recent years.Harvey says: "4K is a technology that we're really convinced by."We believe it brings another layer of immersion when you're playing games."By the end of this year there will be four million people in the UK with a 4K TV at home and we wanted a games console that takes advantage of that."We want to give customers choice."Sony's enhanced PlayStation, the PS4 Pro, was released in 2016 and although not as powerful on paper, it can be more than 100 cheaper.More than 60 million PlayStation 4s have been bought worldwide since 2014 - that's estimated to be nearly double the sales of Microsoft's Xbox One.Microsoft bosses hope that its new machine will help close that gap."Sony have done a great job," says Harvey Eagle."Nintendo have done a great job with the release of their new console the Switch too, but honestly the more people playing games the better for all of us."But I'm focusing on Xbox and the One X. I'm really excited about what that'll mean for gamers."They're going to see games look and play better than they've ever seen before."Tommy T999 tells us: "To the naked eye of the average gamer there's little to choose between the two."The big difference between the two consoles is actually the games available to play."People will be swayed by what games become available for what console."Find us on Instagram at BBCNewsbeat and follow us on Snapchat, search for bbc_newsbeat
WhatsApp: How the supermarket voucher scam works:::::Image copyright Reuters Scammers have used WhatsApp to trick people into handing over personal information by tempting them with bogus supermarket vouchers.The messenger app was used to send fake vouchers to people, purporting to be from trusted chains such as Asda, Tesco and Aldi.The messages claimed to offer hundreds of pounds in savings so long as the user followed a link to an online survey asking for personal details.The scam is a form of phishing, where fraudsters pose as reputable organisations to gain personal details.Action Fraud, the UK's national reporting centre for fraud and cyber crime, suggests anyone who has fallen victim to this scam to report it online or call 0300 123 2040.So far, 33 people have come forward to report falling victim to the scam, although it is unclear how many people have received the message.How does it work?Image caption This message was sent to the WhatsApp number used by the public to contact the BBC The scam works by using a link which appears almost identical to a supermarket chain's legitimate website, but with one small difference.For example, in the screenshot above, the d in Aldi is actually a - a Latin character with a small dot underneath the recognisable letter.In the tweet below, the d in Asda has been replaced with - another character known as a crossed D. Skip Twitter post by @_robp First time I've seen a scam via WhatsApp and with a URL as convincing as this.Look carefully at the d in the link.pic.twitter.com/mBL0bM2pbB Rob Pope (@_robp) November 5, 2017 Report People who clicked the links contained in the WhatsApp messages are sent to a survey.According to Action Fraud, the survey urges victims to hand over their financial information.If, however, a person tries to visit the homepages for Aldi misspelled with the dotted character it sends them to an error page from a website which is not the supermarket's.Image caption Attempting to visit the fake 'Ali' homepage sends the user to an error page for this website Meanwhile, at time of writing, attempting to access the misspelled Asda site brings up a warning in some browsers.Why did I get it?Upon completing the survey, the victim is urged to send the message to 20 other contacts in order to receive a 250 voucher.This helps legitimise the scam, says Action Fraud, as rather than being sent from a random number, the WhatsApp message comes from a trusted contact.However, it is unclear whether users may have been compromised simply by clicking on the link, as some on social media claimed that the message was shared without their contact's consent.A spokesperson for Action Fraud told the BBC, "from what we can see, you would have to put certain details in to be in trouble, but it would depend on the device as all the scams are different, and some can download malware on your device."Action Fraud advises people to avoid unsolicited links in messages, even if they appear to come from a trusted contact.By Tom Gerken, UGC and Social News
Mobile phone tracking data 'could replace census questions':::::Image copyright PA Thousands of people have had their movements tracked by the Office for National Statistics to see if they can find out where they live and work.The ONS is trying to build up a picture of people's daily commute - something it normally asks about in the census.Mobile phones create a record of every location visited by the user if the phone is switched on.Statisticians believe the data, which is anonymised, could one day replace census questions in England and Wales.But it admitted it would need to carry out "extensive evaluation" of "privacy impacts" if it went down that route.'Children's mobiles' The experiment was carried out using data from subscribers to the Vodafone mobile phone network.It was restricted to subscribers aged over 18 and did not include people who use pay-as-you-go phones.It tracked where phones were overnight, to work out where users lived, and where they travelled during the day, which was assumed to be their place of work.It focused on three London boroughs - Lambeth, Southwark and Croydon - and looked at how far people travelled to work during a four week period in March and April last year.It painted a slightly different picture to the 2011 census, with more people appearing not to leave their home borough on their daily commute.Image copyright Reuters Image caption The Office for National Statistics tracked phone users around London Some of this might be down to students, who may have been "mistakenly inferred as commuters as their movement behaviour will be similar", the report said."It's also likely that some parents will take out subscriptions for their children's mobiles," said the report, so in future "children of secondary school age and in higher education might therefore also be included".Final census?The mobile data underestimated some commuter flows, such as the number of people travelling into Lambeth every day.The study may have failed to indentify commuters with "non-standard work patterns, such as night or shift workers; depot workers and those on zero-hours contracts" or those that were ill on holiday, the report said.The ONS is now asking for feedback to decide whether the new system will be rolled out more widely.The government and local authorities use this kind of census household and working patterns data to plan housing developments and transport networks.The census has been carried out every 10 years since 1801, with the exception of 1941, to provide a snapshot of the size of the country's population and details about how people live and work.But the government wants the next census, in 2021, to be the final one to be carried out using the traditional paper-based questionnaire method.It has asked the Office for National Statistics to explore how it can get the information it needs from alternative sources.
Fake WhatsApp app downloaded more than one million times:::::Image copyright AFP Image caption The real WhatsApp messenger has been downloaded more than a billion times from the Play Store A fake version of the WhatsApp messenger app was downloaded more than a million times from the Google Play Store before it was removed.The app, "Update WhatsApp Messenger", appeared to have been developed by the firm behind the real program - WhatsApp Inc.According to users on web forum Reddit, the fake contained ads and could download software to users' devices.It has now been removed from the Play Store.Whoever was behind the app managed to make it look as though its developer was "WhatsApp Inc".They did this by using that exact name, though replacing the space with a special character that looks like a space.The subtle difference would have been practically undetectable to the average user.Users receiving automatic updates via the real WhatsApp would not have been affected.It is far from the first time that Google has had to clean up fake malicious apps on the Play Store.In 2015, the firm had to step in and block one program that disguised itself as a battery monitor and sent premium-rate text messages from people's phones.
Paradise Papers: Apple's secret tax bolthole revealed:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Paradise Papers: Apples secret tax bolthole revealed The world's most profitable firm has a secretive new structure that would enable it to continue avoiding billions in taxes, the Paradise Papers show.They reveal how Apple sidestepped a 2013 crackdown on its controversial Irish tax practices by actively shopping around for a tax haven.It then moved the firm holding most of its untaxed offshore cash, now $252bn, to the Channel Island of Jersey.Apple said the new structure had not lowered its taxes.It said it remained the world's largest taxpayer, paying about $35bn (26bn) in corporation tax over the past three years, that it had followed the law and its changes "did not reduce our tax payments in any country".In a further statement the company stressed that no operations or investments had been moved from Ireland.The Paradise Papers is the name for a huge leak of financial documents that is throwing light on the world of offshore finance.Paradise Papers - Tax secrets of the ultra-rich Up until 2014, the tech company had been exploiting a loophole in tax laws in the US and the Republic of Ireland known as the "double Irish".This allowed Apple to funnel all its sales outside of the Americas - currently about 55% of its revenue - through Irish subsidiaries that were effectively stateless for taxation purposes, and so incurred hardly any tax.Instead of paying Irish corporation tax of 12.5%, or the US rate of 35%, Apple's avoidance structure helped it reduce its tax rate on profits outside of the US to the extent that its foreign tax payments rarely amounted to more than 5% of its foreign profits, and in some years dipped below 2%.The European Commission calculated the rate of tax for one of Apple's Irish companies for one year had been just 0.005%.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Apple CEO Tim Cook in 2013: "We pay all the taxes we owe.Every single dollar" Apple came under pressure in 2013 in the US Senate, when CEO Tim Cook was forced to defend its tax system.Angry that the US was missing out on a huge amount of tax, then-Senator Carl Levin told him: "You shifted that golden goose to Ireland.You shifted it to three companies that do not pay taxes in Ireland.These are the crown jewels of Apple Inc. Folks, it's not right."Mr Cook responded defiantly: "We pay all the taxes we owe, every single dollar.We do not depend on tax gimmicks... We do not stash money on some Caribbean island."Apple's questionnaire After the EU announced in 2013 that it was investigating Apple's Irish arrangement, the Irish government decided that firms incorporated there could no longer be stateless for tax purposes.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Panorama's Richard Bilton tries to speak to Appleby about Apple in Jersey In order to keep its tax rates low, Apple needed to find an offshore financial centre that would serve as the tax residency for its Irish subsidiaries.In March 2014, Apple's legal advisers sent a questionnaire to Appleby, a leading offshore finance law firm and source of much of the Paradise Papers leak.It asked what benefits different offshore jurisdictions - the British Virgin Islands, Bermuda, the Cayman Islands, Mauritius, the Isle of Man, Jersey and Guernsey - could offer Apple.The document asked key questions such as was it possible to "obtain an official assurance of tax exemption" and could it be confirmed that an Irish company might "conduct management activities without being subject to taxation in your jurisdiction".They also asked whether a change of government was likely, what information would be visible to the public and how easy it would be to exit the jurisdiction.Source document: Apple questionnaire (extract) Leaked emails also make it clear that Apple wanted to keep the move secret.One email sent between senior partners at Appleby says: "For those of you who are not aware, Apple [officials] are extremely sensitive concerning publicity.They also expect the work that is being done for them only to be discussed amongst personnel who need to know."Apple chose Jersey, a UK Crown dependency that makes its own tax laws and which has a 0% corporate tax rate for foreign companies.Paradise Papers documents show Apple's two key Irish subsidiaries, Apple Operations International (AOI), believed to hold most of Apple's massive $252bn overseas cash hoard, and Apple Sales International (ASI), were managed from Appleby's office in Jersey from the start of 2015 until early 2016.This would have enabled Apple to continue avoiding billions in tax around the world.Apple's 2017 accounts showed they made $44.7bn outside the US and paid just $1.65bn in taxes to foreign governments, a rate of around 3.7%.That is less than a sixth of the average rate of corporation tax in the world.Apple and Ireland vs the EU In August 2016, after a three-year investigation, the European Commission finds that Ireland gave an illegal tax benefit to Apple.The EC says Apple must repay Ireland taxes for the period within its remit of investigation, 2003-2013, a total of 13bn (11.6bn) plus interest of 1bn.Ireland and Apple launch an appeal.Apple's Tim Cook calls the EC ruling "total political crap", with "no reason for it in fact or in law".Ireland says the EU is encroaching on sovereign taxation.It fears multinationals will go elsewhere.Ireland agrees to collect the 13bn, to be held in a managed escrow account pending the appeal verdict.In October 2017, the EU says it will take Ireland to court as it has not yet collected the money.Ireland says it is complicated and it needs time.Massive GDP spike When the "double-Irish" loophole was shut down, Ireland also created new tax regulations that companies like Apple could take advantage of.One of the companies that Apple moved to Jersey, ASI, had rights to some of Apple Inc's hugely valuable intellectual property.If ASI sold the intellectual property back to an Irish company, the Irish company would be able to offset the enormous cost against any future profits.And since the IP holder, ASI, was registered in Jersey, the profits of the sale would not be taxed.It appears Apple has done just that.There was an extraordinary 26% spike in Ireland's GDP in 2015 which media reports put down to intellectual property assets moving into Ireland.Intangible assets rose a massive 250bn in Ireland that year.Ireland's department of finance denied that the new regulations had been brought in to benefit multinationals.It said Ireland was "not unique in allowing companies to claim capital allowances on intangible assets" and had followed "the international norm".Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Investigative journalist Richard Brooks on Apples questionnaire and the Isle of Mans response to it Apple declined to answer questions about its two subsidiaries moving their tax residency to Jersey.It also declined to comment when asked whether one of those companies had helped create a huge tax write-off by selling intellectual property.Apple said: "When Ireland changed its tax laws in 2015, we complied by changing the residency of our Irish subsidiaries and we informed Ireland, the European Commission and the United States."The changes we made did not reduce our tax payments in any country.In fact, our payments to Ireland increased significantly and over the last three years we've paid $1.5bn in tax there."Find out more about the words and phrases found in the Paradise Papers.Your browser does not support this Lookup Your guide

Broadcom unveils tech sector's largest ever bid for rival:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Broadcom boss Hock Tan and US President Donald Trump Computer chipmaker Broadcom has announced a $103bn (79bn) bid for rival Qualcomm in the largest-ever takeover for the technology sector.Broadcom, which makes chips for products such as smartphones, is offering $70 per share for Qualcomm.Qualcomm had yet to comment on the bid, the latest development in a wave of consolidation sweeping the industry.Broadcom is waiting for regulatory approval to buy Brocade, while Qualcomm is in talks to buy NXP Semiconductors.Meanwhile, Qualcomm is currently engaged in a legal battle over royalty payments with its biggest company Apple.Broadcom said its $103bn offer for Qualcomm stands whether or not the company goes ahead with its $38bn bid for NXP Semiconductors.A combination would ramp up pressure on market leaders Intel and Samsung by creating the world's third largest chipmaker.Hock Tan, president and chief executive of Broadcom, said: "This complementary transaction will position the combined company as a global communications leader with an impressive portfolio of technologies and products."We would not make this offer if we were not confident that our common global customers would embrace the proposed combination."Last week, Broadcom won praise from US President Donald Trump when it announced plans to fully move the company to America.Currently, it is jointly headquartered in Singapore and Silicon Valley.
iPhone users fume over letter 'i' bug:::::Image copyright AFP Image caption The latest model of the iPhone was released this weekend Some iPhone users have been left frustrated after an update to the iOS operating system started inexplicably auto-correcting the letter "i" to a capital "a" and a question mark.The affected version of iOS, 11.1, is available on iPhones and iPads."I have a $1,150 [877] telephone that can't read the letter 'i'," wrote Mike Murphy, a technology reporter for news website Quartz, on Twitter.Apple has described a temporary fix for the problem on its website.The fix involves editing the keyboard settings in iOS so that the right character, either an upper or lower case "i", is used.Apple has said the issue will be fixed in a future software update.Not all iOS 11.1 users have been affected, though there are plenty of comments online from those who say they have experienced the problem.An online discussion forum on Apple's website includes comments from victims of the bug."This is super-annoying," wrote one.The BBC has contacted Apple for comment.

Police investigate 17 child sexting cases a day:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Teenagers have been speaking about the 'dangers' of sexting Police investigations into children sharing sexual images of themselves and others have more than doubled in two years, figures have shown.Forces in England and Wales recorded 6,238 underage "sexting" offences in 2016-17, a rate of 17 a day.Police said they received reports from children as young as 10.Chief Constable Simon Bailey, the National Police Chiefs' Council lead for child protection, said: "There is a worrying upward trend."He added social networks needed to remove indecent images more quickly.The number of cases where under-18s were sharing indecent or prohibited images was up by a third on the 4,681 offences recorded the previous year, and represented a 131% rise on 2014-15, with 2,700 incidents.Mr Bailey, who is head of Norfolk Constabulary, said: "Sharing and possessing these images is against the law.Once an image is shared with others it can cause deep embarrassment and distress."As well as calling for faster action from social media companies, he said schools needed to do more to counteract the influence of pornography.He said: "I am concerned about the impact that exposure to extreme pornography can have on children so we need to consider if a lack of universal relationship and sex education is compounding the problem."Exploitation and coercion Police said the youngest children involved in sexting inquiries were aged 10, while the number of offences investigated was at its peak among 14-year-olds.Girls were more likely to be the victims, but suspects or perpetrators were evenly split between boys and girls.Investigators noted that reports of offences declined substantially in August, suggesting children were more at risk in school term time.The figures cover a period in which the College of Policing introduced new guidance, aimed at assuaging concerns that teenagers might be routinely criminalised by laws on sexting.It said that officers should record all cases of under-18s sharing images of themselves or other children as crimes.However, formal action only needs to be taken where there is exploitation, coercion or wider child protection issues.There were more than 2,000 such cases where police determined that further action was not in the public interest in 2016-17.Mr Bailey said: "Forces are risk-assessing every case to ensure we are not unnecessarily stigmatising children and saddling them with a criminal record."But there will always be a criminal investigation where we see that young people are being coerced, exploited or blackmailed."The NSPCC said the rise in sexting incidents is "extremely worrying"."It is vital that parents and schools talk to children about the dangers of sexting as soon as they are given any technology," the charity said.
NHS offers smartphone GP appointments:::::Image copyright Getty Images A 24-hour service has been launched for NHS patients, offering GP consultations via videolink on smartphones.The pilot scheme will initially cover 3.5 million patients in greater London.Patients will be able to check their symptoms through the mobile app and then have video consultations within two hours of booking.The Royal College of GPs has warned the service may not help patients with complex needs.The new free service has been launched by a group of London GPs and the online healthcare provider Babylon.Patients joining will leave their existing practice, with their records transferred to a group of five central London surgeries.Virtual consultation Dr Mobasher Butt, who is part of the team behind the GP at Hand service, told BBC Radio's Today programme: "It's high time that NHS patients were given the opportunity to benefit from technology to improve access to healthcare."We've benefited from this kind of technology in so many different aspects of our lives, whether that be shopping or banking, and it's really time that we were able to do that in healthcare for NHS patients."Jane Barnacle, director of patients and information at NHS England London, said GP practices were right to carefully test innovative new technologies that could improve free NHS services for their patients while also freeing up staff time.But the Royal College of GPs is concerned the new service might only work for younger healthier commuters and not those with complex health conditions.Concerns Prof Helen Stokes-Lampard, who chairs the RCPG, said: "We are really worried that schemes like this are creating a twin-track approach to NHS general practice and that patients are being 'cherry-picked', which could actually increase the pressures on traditional GPs based in the community."We understand that with increasingly long waiting times to see a GP, an online service is convenient and appealing, but older patients and those living with more complex needs want continuity of care and the security of their local practice where their GPs know them."We notice there is an extensive list of patient conditions such as frailty, pregnancy and mental health conditions that are the essence of general practice and which GPs deal with every day, but which are not eligible for this service."We are also concerned that patients are being given the option of switching back to their local surgery if they are not satisfied with the level of service offered by the app."As well as issues with patient confidentiality and the safety of the patient record, it is hard to see how this could be achieved without adding to the huge burden of red tape that GPs are already grappling with."While this scheme is backed by the NHS and offers a free service to patients, it is undoubtedly luring GPs away from front-line general practice at a time when we are facing a severe workforce crisis and hardworking GPs are struggling to cope with immense workloads."Dr Richard Vautrey from the British Medical Association said: "This approach risks undermining the quality and continuity of care and further fragmenting the service provided to the public."GP at Hand strongly deny that care would be compromised in any way.

Now computers are writing perfectly acceptable pop songs:::::Image copyright Taryn Southern Image caption Taryn Southern is making an entire album co-written by artificial intelligence software "Ugh," my dad used to grunt when I switched on Radio 1 ."This music sounds like it was written by a computer".It's a criticism that's been levelled at synthpop for years.But what if it was true?Taryn Southern, a YouTube star and content creator, has just released a song she wrote with the help of artificial intelligence.Called Break Free, it's a brooding ballad that wouldn't sound out of place on the Hunger Games soundtrack.Southern wrote the lyrics and melody, but the backing track was built by her laptop, after she punched in a number of settings for the song's mood, tempo and instrumentation."My new collaborator is not human," she grins."It's an AI algorithm".As a YouTuber, Southern is used to adapting new technology, and her interest in AI was sparked by an article on The Verge, describing how programmers at Sony had fed the Beatles' back catalogue into a computer and urged it to write a new Lennon-McCartney track.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Could AI eventually write songs in the style of The Beatles?And would you want it to, even if it could?The result may have been hilariously naff, but it prompted the headline: "This AI-written pop song is almost certainly a dire warning for humanity."Southern was less sceptical."I'm a naturally curious person," she says."So I did some research."Last January, she started downloading open-source programmes which promised to write songs from scratch."Most of these algorithms work by ingesting a large amount of data from a certain genre, so the AI can learn the 'rules'," she explains."What chord structures are most common, that sort of thing."Musicians' fears Pulling out her laptop, she fires up one of the programmes.We ask it to write a Reggae song, using Scott Joplin's The Entertainer as inspiration.The result is well, as terrible as the description sounds.But there's a recognisable bounce to the bassline, and a distinct progression from intro to verse to chorus.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The BBC's quick guide to Artificial Intelligence Southern admits it takes a lot of tinkering to get a decent song out of the software."It requires a fair amount of human collaboration.You can't just press a button and create magic."Indeed, she's been collaborating with companies who make the software - including a startup called Amper Music, IBM's Watson, platform and Google's Magenta - helping them improve, and even "hacking" the composing tools herself.Less than a year since she started, Southern has an EP of songs ready for release; and plans to have an album - I Am AI - available next year."There are some awesome new toys coming out that I really wanted to include," she says.Image copyright Taryn Southern Image caption The singer says the speed of the software means she can write a song from scratch in under an hour Earlier this week, Southern performed Break Free live for the first time at the WebSummit in Lisbon, Portugal.It received an enthusiastic welcome from the audience of tech-heads and coders.But what have other musicians made of her experiments with AI?"It's totally split down the middle," she says."Half of them have been very interested in learning about it; while other ones have said, 'Why are we playing around with this stuff.It's going to be take our jobs.'"Unsurprisingly, Southern isn't swayed by that argument.She says AI is "just a tool" like a drum machine or synthesizer.'The message was human' "The reality is that humans adapt.It's the tools that become irrelevant.""It's the heart that makes the music," she insists, directing me to a video on her YouTube channel called Voices In My Head."On that video, the music was created by artificial intelligence.But the message was human - and a deeply personal one at that.""I think people will find a way to embrace it.It's inevitable."But she does foresee legal issues over who owns the songs created by AI."With my song Break Free, I actually gave Amper, who made the AI, some of the back-end royalties.I felt that was appropriate."They composed the song, it's just there was a heavy amount of arrangement afterwards."So these questions are coming up and I'm doing my best to figure it out in a way that is favourable to artists."Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.If you have a story suggestion email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk.
YouTuber Lilly Singh generously gives fans cash for rent, exams and food:::::The world's highest earning female YouTuber has been giving cash to her fans to help with their financial problems.Lilly Singh asked her 4.5 million Twitter followers what challenges they're currently facing and then offered to give them money.She's helped them pay rent, buy college books and even gym membership.Uma, 18, tells Newsbeat she was "just speechless" when Lilly offered to pay so she could take her ill mum out.In 2016, Lilly earned 5.7m making her the third highest paid YouTuber in the world, according to Forbes.The Canadian comedian, who goes by the name Superwoman online, has 12.5 million subscribers.This week, she celebrated reaching 1,000 vlogs by sharing out $1,000 (762) among fans who said they needed it.One fan got in touch saying her mum had recently been arrested and she was looking after her 10-year-old brother, so Lilly offered money for food.Uma, who lives in Malaysia, told us: "I usually bottle things up but I told her how my mum was going through some health issues."I wasn't expecting anything from her, I just wanted to vent out the problem and then suddenly my phone blew up."Lilly said she would love for me to take my mum out for a night to have dinner and fun as her treat."Uma calls Lilly the "perfect idol"."Tell me one celebrity that would do this for their fans."The fact that she took time out of her day just to connect with her fans and to help my mum out, that meant so much."Claudine, from Dallas in the US, also tweeted Lilly about wanting to get a better job and needing money for exams.Claudine says she was "floored" when Lilly responded.She told Newsbeat: "I have spoken with her team and I will receive the money in a couple of weeks when I am ready for the exam.I feel like this is a dream."Find us on Instagram at BBCNewsbeat and follow us on Snapchat, search for bbc_newsbeat

'I've sat in a changing room in my underwear for ages':::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Would having your own personal stylist on demand help you decide what to wear?Dressing angst.We've all had it.Does this outfit make me look fat?Is it inappropriate for work?Is it something someone half may age would wear?Should I just give up and stay in bed forever?It's then we need help and advice from people we trust."I've sat in a changing room in my underwear for ages waiting for my friends to get back to me," says Sophia Matveeva, founder of fashion advice app, Style Counsel."I wanted their advice on the outfit I was thinking of buying.And my friends on WhatsApp were always asking me what they should wear, but we'd often be in different time zones and the answers would come too late."Fashion dilemmas like this gave her the idea for an app to help women crowdsource advice from stylists and sister fashionistas in a safe, troll-free environment."Young women have always cared about what others think about their look, but social media has amplified this", says Ms Matveeva."Your image can reach far more people than ever before - it's like being a celebrity, and this has made us a lot more worried."Image copyright Style Counsel Image caption Style Counsel founder Sophia Matveeva believes fashion is a social activity Style Counsel users wanting advice on an outfit can post a photo and receive "yes" or "no" answers from other users, or more detailed advice from vetted fashion stylists and bloggers "within minutes", she says.So far around 7,000 people have downloaded the app, and more than 90 stylists are on hand to dispense advice.Photos are being uploaded from North America and Australia, as well as the UK, she says.Fashion advice is a growing business, with dozens of apps, such as AskAnna, Mallzee and StyleDotMe, springing up, primarily targeting young women.Image-focused social media platforms such as Instagram and Pinterest have been a key place for fashion enthusiasts to share ideas and opinions for some years.And all this data about people's like and dislikes is gold dust for retailers."The most expensive piece of research retailers pay for is to find out why something didn't sell.Our platform tells them why - that's valuable feedback," says Ms Matveeva.This endless appetite for customer data undoubtedly prompted retail giant Amazon to launch its Echo Look camera.The $200 (150) voice-controlled device - powered by Alexa - can take full-length photos and videos of your outfit and send them to the accompanying smartphone app.Image copyright Amazon Image caption Amazon's Echo Look camera and app will give advice on which outfit suits you best A "style check" function then compares photos and gives its algorithmically-derived opinion of which outfit is better, based on fit, colour, style and current fashion trends.Amazon says its own panel of fashion experts has helped develop this function.But will this rather impersonal form of advice really appeal to social, sharing-obsessed twentysomethings?"Women, more than men, are social creatures - AI will never stop us talking to each other," says Ms Matveeva."We need human-first technology.Girls will always want the approval of the cool girl at school, and on Instagram there are millions of cool girls."Most young people like to search for and buy clothes online via their mobiles these days - no queues, less stress.But getting the right fit is difficult and leads to hundreds of billions of dollars worth of items being returned each year, at great cost to retailers.Image copyright Adriana Tripa Image caption Isabelle Ohnemus says social media helps online shopping to be a social experience "Every brand has its own sizing parameters - there are no international standards," explains Isabelle Ohnemus, chief executive of EyeFitU, a fashion website that finds clothes to fit your figure."This is why returns are so high."We can set up your size profile in a few seconds with 80% accuracy just knowing your gender, height, weight and age," she says.EyeFitU has about 60 retailers on its site - "mostly big international brands", says Ms Ohnemus - and using all the data it has collected, translates these differing national and brand sizings to suit your actual shape.Tech company Metail is also trying to solve the size issue by enabling shoppers to create digital 3D versions of themselves that they can they dress up virtually on retailers' websites.More Technology of Business Image copyright Getty Images "You can create your own body model giving your main measurements - height, weight, bust size, inside leg, neck size, hips and waist," explains Metail chief executive Tom Adeyoola."We can reach 92-96% accuracy just on those measurements."You can then go on to a Metail-friendly fashion website and see what your digital avatar looks like wearing any of the clothes you select.The images are altered by computer to fit your figure.To get to this stage Metail has to have photographed the retailer's range of clothes as worn by a manikin standing on a revolving turntable.The special photo rig, based in Bangalore, can "shoot 200 garments a day", says Mr Adeyoola.When you think that an online fashion retailer like Japan's ZozoTown can have 500,000 items in its range, that's a lot of photos to take.Mr Adeyoola hopes that his firm's technology will help make buying clothes online "a much more interactive and engaging experience" - as it used to be in-store.It will also provide retailers will valuable insights into our personal preferences.So far 7.5 million people have created "e-models" of themselves, he says.Image copyright Amazon Image caption With Amazon's Prime Wardrobe service you can try clothes at home first before you buy Of course, the biggest drawback of online shopping is that you can't touch and feel the clothes before your buy - another reason why returns are such a big issue.This is why Amazon has launched its Prime Wardrobe "try before you buy" service.Prime subscribers can order online but have seven days before deciding which clothes to keep and which to return in the prepaid box.All without paying a penny up front.Global fashion retailer Asos, which has 15.4 million active customers worldwide, recently followed suit in the UK with its own "try before you buy" option."The challenge of not being able to try on items before buying them is an an e-commerce perennial," says Dan Winter, Asos director of corporate communications."So it made sense to explore a try before you buy service here in the UK.With this option, customers don't have to worry about waiting for refunds because they will only be paying for what they choose to keep."But when it comes to making those choices, we get by with a little help from our friends.
How the BBC News website has changed over the past 20 years:::::Twenty years ago this week, when the BBC News website launched, there were fewer than eight million people online in the UK - there are now about 60 million.In 1997, it was the age of Tamagotchis, Minidiscs and PalmPilots.Mobile phones at the time included the Nokia 6110 and the futuristic Motorola StarTAC flip phone.Most people used dial-up internet connections with top speeds of up to 56Kbps.On desktop, screen resolutions were pretty small - but they would get bigger.Below there's a selection of the website's pages from 1997 to 2017, showing how it has evolved to meet the changing needs of users while still offering the latest news, features and analysis.1997 - Rising star BBC News Online launched in November 1997, following several forays on the internet, covering: the Budget in 1995 the Olympics in 1996 the general election in May 1997 the funeral of Diana, Princess of Wales, in September 1997 CNN 's website was already up and running.The Guardian was also among the early internet pioneers.The BBC News website was only 620 pixels wide at its launch - that is slightly more than half the width of the current site.In the first week or so, stories published on the new website included: 1999 - Blue to red In November 1999, the site had its first revamp.The old blue banner and red star was replaced with a red header more in line with the rest of BBC News, and the search function moved to the top of the page.The website's then executive editor, Mike Smartt, explained the changes to users and promised "ambitious plans for audio and video news".2001 - Terror attack The attack on the Twin Towers in New York in September 2001 shocked the world, and large numbers turned to the BBC News website to find out the latest information.Several years before social media, thousands of people emailed the website with their thoughts - including many caught up in the attacks.For the first time, content from users became central to online coverage, with compelling witness accounts and photos published in stories and in a special report on the disaster.2003 - Major overhaul In 2003, the old linear format was dropped in favour of a wider, horizontal layout.The aim was to make the site easier for users to find their way around and see more stories at first glance.2008 - Cleaning up In 2008, the site got even wider, and for the first time video could be played from within story pages.The world map in the navigation was dropped a couple of years later.2010 - Major revamp In 2010, the website got a "fresh, updated design", which also offered "easier ways to share stories with others", according to the then editor, Steve Herrmann.By now, increasing numbers of users were coming to the news website from Facebook and Twitter.The BBC News app was launched in July 2010, giving users quick access to all the latest headlines from across the world while they were on the move.The biggest story of the year was the UK general election, which had its own special report site.2015 - Mobile friendly In 2015, the website became "responsive" - meaning its layout was designed to display well on different devices and screen sizes.By this point, about 65% of users were coming to the news website from mobiles and tablets.NHS tracker 1999 v 2017 The look might change, but that doesn't mean we're not covering the same important issues.Here's the NHS performance tracker from 1999, when the government of the day published a new set of clinical indicators giving death rates in individual hospitals in England for the first time.With the NHS under unprecedented pressure today, we still give users the chance to examine data on how services in their area are doing, using a more detailed, interactive tracker.Slice and easy We managed to squeeze in a further redesign for 2017.News editors can change the number of stories in the full-width, horizontal slices, with the option of "dialling up the volume" during major news events.We can now offer a more visual front page.Dropping the right hand side column and going full-width means video and news stories are integrated on the page..
how, and why does it matter?:::::Image copyright Twitter/@realDonaldTrump After US President Donald Trump's Twitter account was briefly deactivated last week by a Twitter employee, many people started wondering if there would be a similar period of silence this week.After all, Mr Trump is currently in China, known for its "great firewall" that blocks access to many foreign websites, including Twitter.As it happens, the president has kept up his tweeting in China, thanking his hosts for their hospitality, firing a warning at North Korea, and even changing his Twitter header image to one of him, Chinese president Xi Jinping, and the two first ladies, surrounded by dozens of Chinese performers.So what's going on?There's two sides to this - a technical aspect, and a political one.Twitter is blocked on China - but not for the privileged or tech-savvy Thousands of websites and social media platforms are blocked in mainland China.Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and Whatsapp are all blocked or disrupted, as are websites the authorities consider sensitive.(The BBC News website has been blocked in the past, as have the New York Times and the Economist).Many people circumvent China's firewall by using virtual private networks (VPNs), although the government is now cracking down on VPN vendors.But the Chinese authorities aren't beyond making exceptions to the rules.Skip Twitter post 2 by @realDonaldTrump On behalf of @FLOTUS Melania and I, THANK YOU for an unforgettable afternoon and evening at the Forbidden City in Beijing, President Xi and Madame Peng Liyuan.We are looking forward to rejoining you tomorrow morning!https://t.co/ma0F7SHbVU Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 8, 2017 Report Officials briefly contemplated relaxing its censorship laws in a Shanghai Free Trade Zone back in 2013.And the official news agency, Xinhua, uses Twitter to promote its articles - to the consternation of many Chinese social media users who have accused the government of double standards.Ahead of Mr Trump's arrival, China's Vice Foreign Minister Zheng Zeguang assured reporters he would be able to tweet as much as he wants, saying: "We take everything into account on receiving foreign heads of state, so you should have no reservations about Mr President's ability to keep in touch with the outside."It's an approach that's been criticised by rights groups.Sophie Richardson, China director at Human Rights Watch, told Bloomberg: "If President Trump is able to tweet from China it's because he enjoys privileges President Xi systematically denies to people across that country."So how is Mr Trump accessing Twitter?Journalists travelling with Mr Trump have found they can access Twitter on their mobile phones, as long as they are using 3G or 4G roaming networks on a foreign sim card.In practice, foreign officials visiting China are told to follow strict security guidelines, and have sometimes been advised against using their own phones or laptops in the country.So Mr Trump probably isn't just tweeting off his usual mobile phone.Image copyright Reuters Image caption Mr Trump is a prolific tweeter - while Mr Xi is not For obvious reasons, the US hasn't given the full details of their arrangements to ensure Mr Trump can go online securely.But, while en route to Beijing, a White House official did assure reporters that Mr Trump would keep up his tweeting from China, saying "I'm sure we've got the gear aboard this airplane to make it happen."Mr Trump's first three tweets from China were sent from a web browser, rather than a phone.However, his fourth tweet, where he celebrates the one-year anniversary of his election win, was sent from an iPhone, data from Tweetdeck shows.Twitter is a political tool Don't forget that tweeting is also a political act for Mr Trump - he's used it to announce policies, lambast political rivals, and criticise other countries - including China.If Mr Trump had decided to stay off Twitter in China, it could have been perceived as him being silenced, albeit virtually, by Chinese censorship.That could explain why the White House official emphasised to reporters that "the president will tweet whatever he wants [while in China].That's his way of communicating directly with the American people."However, observers have also picked up on the contrast in tone between Mr Trump's tweets in Beijing, and some of his previous posts.Although Mr Trump's Wednesday tweets focused on thanking his hosts for the "beautiful welcome", adding "Melania and I will never forget it!", he has previously used Twitter to criticise China's currency devaluation, and argue that China has not done enough to deter North Korea from its nuclear ambitions.Skip Twitter post 3 by @realDonaldTrump ...they do NOTHING for us with North Korea, just talk.We will no longer allow this to continue.China could easily solve this problem!Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 29, 2017 Report Meanwhile, Chinese state media outlets have enthusiastically picked up on Mr Trump's latest China tweets, and the fact he has changed his header image to one of him with Mr Xi."Mr Trump was full of feeling after visiting the Forbidden Palace - and even changed his Twitter header photo!"TV station iFeng reported on Chinese microblog weibo, with a thumbs up emoji.Of course, there was no mention of the fact that Twitter is not officially accessible in China.
How 'Asian Tiger cubs' are driving online shopping:::::Image copyright Post Office Bank of Singapore Image caption Children at Admiralty High School in Singapore show off their new payment wristbands Asia is driving the massive growth in online shopping, with youngsters in particular leading the charge.But why are they so keen and what are they spending their money on?In Admiralty Primary School, in Singapore's Woodlands neighbourhood, a group of students has just joined the e-commerce world."Now I don't need to think about losing my wallet," says Bosco Wong, a 10-year-old student, sporting a new wristband for making digital purchases while at school.The wearable band, called "Smart Buddy", is sponsored by the Post Office of Singapore Bank, and everyone at Admiralty has just received one.It is all part of Singapore's drive to go cashless, and the country's Education Minister Ong Ye Kung was at his school to launch them.Parents can track and manage their children's purchases online.Asia - its younger generations, in particular - has embraced online shopping and digital payments with remarkable enthusiasm.And given the UN's estimate that there are 720 million people aged 15-24 living there - dwarfing North America's 47 million and Europe's 82 million - it's no wonder Asia is driving the e-commerce explosion.China, which overtook the US in 2015 as the country with highest e-commerce spending, now accounts for 40% of the world's online commerce.Image copyright AFP Image caption Jack Ma founded Alibaba in 1999 Retail giant Alibaba, founded by billionaire Jack Ma, recently reported a 61% rise in quarterly revenues to 55.1bn yuan ($8.3bn; 6.4bn), thanks largely to the popularity of its online shopping platforms, Tmall and Taobao.Monthly active users of its Chinese retail marketplaces grew to 549 million in September, up 20 million from three months ago - that's an astonishing rate of growth.By 2020, 60% of all those aged 18-29 will live in Asia and will have a disposable income of $6tn (4.6tn), says consultancy firm Accenture - that's higher than any preceding generation.But why are Asia's youngsters so keen on buying online and what do they spend their money on?Well, this has clearly been a technology-driven phenomenon, with the smartphone as the key innovation changing consumer behaviour.About two-fifths of younger people in Asia have bought something online via their mobile, says Accenture."I do buy quite a lot of books online," says Theophi Kwek, 22, who recently finished university at Oxford and is now doing national service in Singapore's army.Books from overseas are cheaper than they are in Singapore, he says.He often uses UK sites and says shipping "usually takes a couple of weeks at most".Image copyright Theophi Kwek Image caption Singaporean Theophi Kwek likes buying books online from abroad But Yi Ying Ng, the 27-year-old founder of AllSome, a parcel tracking service, is part of a rising trend to connect other Asian markets to China's engine.The volume of packages from China to Malaysia has gone up from about one million a year in 2012, to about 73 million now, says Ms Ng.She takes goods from the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen, and delivers them to online buyers in Singapore and Malaysia, where she is originally from.She will be expanding next year to Indonesia, then Thailand, she says.When she started her company five years ago, posting a parcel from China cost $15-25 and took 30-50 days.She has found ways to lower this to $5, and shorten the delivery time to three days, she says.But her real innovation is helping small merchants to sell to friends and family through Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat, she says."We're trying to help everyone become a merchant, a decentralised approach," she says.Image copyright Ng Yi Ying Image caption Yi Ying Ng wants to help everyone sell online Research from TMI Strategy suggests that worldwide, 62% of e-commerce users under 30 take their cues in purchases from influential users online, whether friends on social media or specialist bloggers.Ms Ng calls her approach "social commerce".Most of her merchants are between 24-28, she says, and most of their customers are in their early twenties.But while China increasingly sells online to the rest of Asia, younger people in its rising urban middle classes are buying goods and services online from further afield.Qiaoyun Zhang and Xiaochen Xu are parents in their thirties, and live in Beijing's prosperous business and embassy district, Chaoyang.Recently they started using a platform called VIPKid to buy live English lessons from teachers in North America, for their four-year-old daughter, Lu-Ke.More Technology of Business Image copyright Getty Images "My husband and I seldom use English in our daily life," says Ms Zhang, "and maybe our English is not that good.So we don't want to teach our children to speak English."The lessons last 25 minutes and their daughter takes four of them a week on an iPad."North American teachers, they are very patient compared with Chinese teachers," Ms Zhang says.Companies wanting to sell to these younger Asian audiences like Mrs Zhang should realise brand loyalty doesn't any more exist, says Michael Talbot, co-founder of 3radical, a brand engagement firm working in East Asia.His firm provided the technology behind Singapore's Smart Buddy."These young people, they're not disloyal, they're just using tools in a very competitive landscape.It's fundamentally different from having one high street with a Chinese, an Indian, and a couple of pubs," he says.Loyalty schemes accordingly tend not to work in China, Vietnam and Thailand, but games tied into a brand and incorporating an element of luck have cultural appeal there, says Mr Talbot.So how will the likes of 10-year-old Bosco Wong be shopping in future?Using his voice to authenticate a purchase perhaps?Tapping the side of his augmented reality glasses?Whatever the technological innovations, these Asian Tiger cubs are likely to be in the vanguard as e-commerce continues to sweep across the world.
I lost my job over a Facebook post - was that fair?:::::When Rachel Burns posted a photo of a singalong at work on her Facebook page, she had no idea that her actions would end her career.The BBC's Laurence Grissell has been following her story for the past year."I absolutely loved my job.It's my vocation, I love caring for people," Rachel says.For 21 years, until December 2015, Rachel worked at Park Hall, a residential care home for elderly people and vulnerable adults in Reigate, southern England.She'd started there as care assistant, and worked her way up.She'd been the manager for the last eight years."There were always activities going on.I wanted the clients to have a decent quality of life."One of the activities that Rachel organised for the residents at Park Hall was a regular music night, every Friday."We'd put flowers on the tables," Rachel says."The residents would all get dressed up and we'd have a different supper every week."As a keen amateur singer, Rachel would perform at the music nights, everything from Roberta Flack and Nina Simone to Boney M. "The staff would get up dancing with the residents.You'd see smiles on their faces - it really was such a lovely thing to see."Image caption The Reverend David Walford, Rachel Burns and singer Roy Matthews performing at Park Hall, Christmas 2014 (Photo: Rachel Burns) One Friday Rachel returned home after music night and decided to share some of the special moments from the evening online."I was quite elated at how the night had gone," Rachel says."I posted the picture thinking that it would just be seen by a few people, mainly staff, on Facebook."But two months later Rachel got a phone call summoning her to head office."As soon as I got there, when I saw their faces, I knew I was in big trouble."Rachel had done four things wrong.She'd posted the photo on Facebook, she'd identified a Park Hall resident in the photo - a man with Down's syndrome who, eager to be photographed, had jumped into the shot beside her - she had also posted a video of the music night, and she was Facebook friends with a relative of one of the residents.Should I really have had my career of 21 years taken away for one mistake?Rachel Burns, Former care home manager These were all breaches of Surrey County Council policy.Two days later Rachel was suspended from her job.From the word go, Rachel held her hands up and admitted all the council's allegations but nonetheless wanted to appeal against their decision."I know I shouldn't have put that picture up there, but should I really have had my career of 21 years taken away for one mistake?I wanted justice because I didn't believe what they had done to me was fair."Find out more Rachel lost her appeal and was given just two days to decide whether she would accept demotion - with a significant pay cut - or face dismissal.She asked for extra time to consider her options, but the council refused.Instead, Rachel, who by now had been signed off with stress and anxiety, received a telephone call demanding that she come to a decision immediately."I said, 'I'm off work sick, my doctor doesn't feel I can make such a life-changing decision at the moment.'"But Rachel was told if she didn't accept the demotion she would be dismissed from her 45,000 a year job, with immediate effect."I got a letter the next day which said, 'I'm sorry you have decided to accept dismissal.'And that was it."Claire Pooley's brother is the Park Hall resident in the photo that Rachel posted on Facebook.Claire says her brother loves to be the centre of attention and loves to share photographs of himself with the rest of his family.The Friday music nights were the highlight of his week."He loves singing and dancing," Claire says, "Rachel and the guys allowed him to just blossom on a Friday evening."The moment we walked in the door we knew Park Hall was a special place," Claire's husband Graham continues."The atmosphere, the culture and the behaviour - people were happy there and had a lot of stimulation."The couple say that the Park Hall staff always encouraged Claire's brother to get up and sing at the music nights.None of us had a problem with it - gross misconduct or not Claire Pooley, Relative of Park Hall resident "He would practise and get ready for it - although he sang the same three songs every week," Graham says."We loved watching him - it brought him alive, it was wonderful."Neither Claire nor Graham feel that Rachel should have been fired for posting the photo of Claire's brother."None of us had a problem with it - gross misconduct or not," Claire says."After 21 years is it appropriate to sack the manageress who's created a culture and environment at this special home in the way that they have?"asks Graham."The answer is no, it's not."It's autumn 2016 and Rachel has decided to take Surrey County Council to an employment tribunal for unfair dismissal."They have to understand that this is my life that we're talking about here," she says."I want my career back."A preliminary hearing date is set for early November.But she can't afford any formal legal representation and so is planning to face the council's barristers with only the help of her close friend, the Reverend David Walford, a retired healthcare chaplain who's never done anything like this before and admits he's out of his comfort zone."I'm very happy to stand up in front of people," David says."What I'm not sure of is facing people who have had a lifetime's career in legal work."David was at Park Hall on the evening that the photo was taken.Like Rachel, he's a singer and would perform at the Friday night music shows."I've seen a lot of care homes in my time as a parish clergyman and as a hospital chaplain.I knew the difference between what I'd usually see and Park Hall.Care with love, not care out of duty - that's what Rachel was giving.The thought that Rachel was being taken out of that actually brought me to tears."Care with love, not care out of duty - that's what Rachel was giving Rev David Walford, Retired healthcare chaplain To make matters worse, Rachel's husband Gary is very unwell."He's had the brain tumour for four years," Rachel says."He was very healthy, but he walks with a stick now."Not only is Gary unable to work, but without a reference Rachel can't find a new job.She and Gary are racking up huge debts living off their credit cards, but she hopes her money worries will be sorted out once the case is resolved, with any luck out of court.Two weeks before the date of the preliminary hearing Rachel is doing an unpaid gig at a local pub.She's on stage singing Stuck In The Middle With You by Stealers Wheel and urging the punters to get up on the dance floor."It's just so much stress, it's crazy," Rachel says later, "which is why nights like this are brilliant, just to let off some steam."Image caption Throughout the trial, Rachel kept performing The day of the preliminary hearing in Croydon arrives.Rachel, who always believed the case would be settled out of court, says she never thought in a million years it would come to this.She's nervous."I've got to stand up against one of Surrey's senior solicitors to defend myself when I made one mistake in a 21-year career.They have crucified me."The judge sets a date for a full hearing, but it's seven months away, at the start of June.Then, out of the blue, towards the end of December, Rachel receives a settlement offer from the council.For a couple of days, she considers accepting the 7,500, before having a change of heart."It was a joke, an absolute joke," Rachel says."And it's not even about money now, it's about showing them for what they are."With the case dragging on, Rachel is really feeling the strain.She is anxious and depressed.So much is at stake - by now, she and Gary are in dire straits.Their debts are mounting, and they're seven months in arrears with the rent on the house in Reigate that they share with their border collie, Bramble.Image caption Rachel's husband Gary and their dog, Bramble "We are scraping pennies, literally pennies," she says."It's never-ending, it never goes away."All I did was put up a picture of a client enjoying their life in the care home that I loved working in," she says, beginning to cry.By June 2017 the couple are at breaking point.They have no money in the bank and no savings to fall back on.Rachel is fearful that they're going to lose everything, including the roof over their heads."It just goes to show that when you think you have everything it can be snatched away from you just like that, for one mistake," she says.I've had to watch my wife slowly falling apart, because of what they've done to her Gary Burns, Husband The trial is taking its toll on David, too.He's exhausted."This case has just become monstrous," he says.Two days before the tribunal is due to start Rachel decides that she's packing it in, she can't go on.Her husband Gary pleads with her for almost three hours not to walk away now.This isn't the first time Rachel's doubted the wisdom of continuing with the case."This case has destroyed her," Gary explains."She has no confidence any more, she doesn't sleep any more, we argue much more now.It's been disastrous."I've had to watch my wife slowly falling apart, because of what they've done to her."Finally, in early June, in a rundown corner of West Croydon, Rachel's employment tribunal gets under way.She has given evidence and a number of witnesses have spoken and been questioned.But two days into the proceedings the judge has to adjourn the hearing when Rachel becomes very distressed."It just got too much," she says."I thought, 'You've broken me to the point where I don't have the self-esteem at the moment to go back into management.'And it's such a shame.I said I was sorry, I told the judges the absolute truth."The case finally concludes but without any decision.Rachel will have to wait another seven weeks for an answer.Image caption The Rev David Walford agreed to help Rachel Burns with her defence It's the beginning of August 2017, nearly 20 months since Rachel was first suspended from her job, and she has some exciting news."I won!Oh, my God, I won!"The court has upheld her claim of unfair dismissal.The judge decides that Surrey County Council's decision to demote Rachel was within the band of reasonable responses, given that she'd admitted the allegations against her.But she concludes that the timescale the council gave Rachel to decide whether she would accept redeployment or face dismissal - just two working days - wasn't long enough.This procedural aspect, she says, was a fundamental flaw."Justice has prevailed!"Rachel says."It's amazing that if you believe in something and you know your worth you just keep going.You keep going, and going and going."But Rachel will have to return to the employment tribunal on 13 November for a remedy hearing at which the court will decide how much she should be given in compensation.She has no idea how much that's likely to be but fears that the sum will be reduced because she admitted the allegations against her.She and Gary now have debts to the tune of about 50,000 and are 14 months in arrears with their rent, and although Rachel now has a reference from Surrey County Council, it states that she was fired for serious misconduct, so the prospect of her finding work is still uncertain."As a manager myself I wouldn't look very favourably on that candidate," she says.Despite the win, going back to work will be a struggle.Before losing her job two years ago, Rachel had been signed off with stress, and she still suffers from anxiety and depression.Meanwhile the job she loved has gone forever.Park Hall closed its doors on 30 June as part of Surrey County Council's plans to shut down all six care homes it owned and ran.The residents were rehomed."I really loved Park Hall," Rachel says."It was like a family to me more than going to work."Image caption Rachel with her husband Gary More from The Untold Text by Sarah McDermott, photographs by Phil Coomes Join the conversation -

Spreading the word: How to promote your online business:::::Image copyright Gemma Day Image caption Nosh Detox founder Geeta Sidhu-Robb used bloggers to help promote her brand Online businesses now have a wealth of digital tools and techniques at their disposal to help them get noticed in the global marketplace.Geeta Sidhu-Robb, founder of juice and health food delivery service, Nosh Detox, was using social media to promote her business long before it became fashionable to do so.Ten years ago, in fact.On a tight budget and needing to convince a sceptical public, she tapped in to the power and reach of bloggers to promote her diet and wellbeing products."Juice fasts didn't really exist in the UK at the time," recalls the former corporate lawyer and single mum of three."In fact some people actually thought a detox could kill you.""We couldn't afford PR [public relations] agencies or expensive advertising campaigns, so we'd talk to pretty much anyone with an online presence and persuade them to take photos, film us on YouTube and write about us," she says.The bloggers would include a link to her website on their pages - occasionally in return for some Nosh Detox freebies Ms Sidhu-Robb admits.This helped push the business to the top of organic - not paid-for - search rankings.A 2m turnover and Hollywood A-list clientele followed, along with significant followings in Russia and Australia.It shows how, on social media, a little can go a very long way when it comes brand promotion.Image copyright EyeFitU Image caption Isabelle Ohnemus is a big believer in finding the right social media "influencer" for your brand Now social media marketing is a business in its own right.Convenient and low cost, with a potentially vast audience reach, the platforms have overtaken all other media for small businesses, says research firm BIA Kelsey.Former investment banker Isabelle Ohnemus has extensively used "influencers" to promote her Zurich-based fashion company EyeFitU, which is an online platform aimed at remedying some of the sizing inconsistencies across fashion brands.Usually young, fashion-conscious females with a prominent online presence act as "brand ambassadors" for EyeFitU, promoting the company to their followers on Instagram, Snapchat or Facebook.Big brands will sometimes pay in excess of $30,000 (23,000) to such influencers for a single post, but smaller companies with more modest budgets can still get in on the action."There is a trend for going with smaller-scale bloggers rather than those with million-plus followers," says Ms Ohnemus,."Having those kinds of numbers doesn't necessarily mean a higher number of conversions."In other words, it's the quality of the following not the size that matters.People who trust an influencer's opinion are more likely to buy the brand's goods, she says.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Reality TV star Marnie Simpson fell foul of the Advertising Standards Authority Of course, there are rules governing this sort of social media influencer marketing, so you have to be careful.Geordie Shore TV star Marnie Simpson recently got into trouble for uploading images of products from two firms she had business relationships with, without identifying them as adverts A spokeswoman for the UK's Advertising Standards Authority tells the BBC: "Our current codes state that if an advertiser gives payment to a social media influencer - this can be in the form of a monetary payment or a freebie - and there is control over the contents of the ad, the social media post would be considered an ad; thus the influencer must clearly indicate somewhere on the post that this is an advertisement."Know your customer One of the main advantages of an online business compared to a traditional bricks-and-mortar shop is the amount of data you can gather about your customers.You can find out which search words people use to find your business, for example, which images they respond to the most, and which website content they share on other platforms.This all helps to refine and target your marketing efforts.Free monitoring tools, like BuzzSumo and Metrixapp, not to mention Google Analytics, are all powerful helpers for the small business.Image copyright Gourmet Meat Club Image caption Gourmet Meat Club found that images of cooked food were more popular than raw ingredients Vikas Shah, visiting professor of entrepreneurship at the MIT Sloan School of Management, says: "You can easily start by using many free SEO [search engine optimisation] tools on platforms like Google and Twitter, and because this activity is very much results driven, you will see a fairly robust relationship between spend and return on investment."Gourmet Meat Club, an online provider of free range British meat, is one of the 54% of websites globally using Google Analytics to delve into customer quirks.Recent insights reveal that Android mobile users visit more web pages than those on an Apple phone, and images of cooked food generate more views in a digital ad campaign than images of raw ingredients.Furthermore, the technology tracks the most popular food searches online, giving Gourmet Meat Club the opportunity to create content based on the very latest trends.More Technology of Business Image copyright Getty Images "It's crucial to act fast," says Stuart Cordingley, the firm's managing director, "jumping onto popular searches as soon as they emerge to get ahead of the competition and be present where the public is discussing its new favourite food topics."This is the best way for the brand to get "ample exposure", he says.Data is now "central to the marketing mix".This up-to-the-minute content is sent to journalists and shared on the firm's own Facebook and Twitter pages.Social media marketing expert Andy Barr says it is an example of how online businesses are increasingly morphing into social media communities, creating content that positions them as authorities on particular topics.But he also advises supplementing this approach with social media advertising."As a general rule of thumb, it's worth spending between 7-12% of your total monthly revenue or income on social media promotion for the best results," he says.
Explainer: What is Russia's new VPN law all about?:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption EXPLAINED: What is a VPN service?A Russian law regulating the use of technologies enabling users to search the internet anonymously came into force on 1 November.Many are worried the law will make it harder for Russians to bypass internet censorship.Signed by President Vladimir Putin in July, the law imposes restrictions on proxy avoidance tools.These tools include virtual private networks (VPNs) and anonymous proxy servers (anonymisers).VPN providers will be obliged to closely cooperate with Russian media watchdog Roskomnadzor and comply with its requests.What's a VPN?A VPN is a private network created over a public network.Despite popular belief, VPNs cannot make online connections completely anonymous, because some VPN providers can keep users' logs.However, they can still increase a user's privacy and security by hiding their IP address.In a corporate work setting, VPNs allow employees to securely access an intranet from outside the office.Both VPNs and anonymisers allow a user to appear as if they were connecting to the internet from another location.What exactly is banned?Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Under the new law, VPNs can be used only to access websites not banned by Russia Despite widespread speculation, the law does not directly ban the operation of VPNs and anonymisers.However, it does restrict access to banned websites with the help of these tools.VPN providers will get access to Roskomnadzor's blacklist of banned websites and will be entitled to provide the use of their servers "within the legal framework", the banki.ru banking portal reports.Leonid Levin, the head of the Russian State Duma's information policy committee, has previously said the law is meant to block access only to "unlawful content" and is not intended to impose restrictions on law-abiding citizens, according to business daily RBC.Will it work?Roskomnadzor has been developing measures to identify suspect websites, as well as ways to block them.However, in practice this is very difficult, and it may have unwanted consequences.For instance, the watchdog has a single register of banned domain names.In June, one of Google.ru's web pages contained a redirect to a blocked online gambling domain, so due to the ban, the search engine was blocked for several hours.Image copyright Tor Project Image caption The Tor Project is free software and an accompanying network that lets people visit websites anonymously According to IT experts, the law provides exemption for corporate VPNs.However, it remains unclear how exactly Roskomnadzor will distinguish between corporate and public VPNs.At present, it is impossible to differentiate them, says Leonid Yevdokimov, an expert at the Tor Project - a US-based team that creates software to let people visit websites anonymously and access otherwise hidden parts of the net.What will happen?Some Russian social-media users have been agonising over whether the watchdog will now be able to restrict internet access from home if they search for a banned website.IT experts are unanimous that it will not.It is up to search engine operators such as Google and Yandex to "shield" users from such banned websites, and if they fail to do so, they can be held responsible, banki.ru says.Most lay internet users would not notice any changes once the law came into force, the communications director at media holding Rambler&Co, Matvei Alexeyev, told the BBC.He sees it as a step towards greater transparency of VPN servers.
The all-female groups discussing harassment:::::Image copyright Getty Images A series of allegations against prominent men has begun to surface on social media - in all-female groups on WhatsApp, shared Google Docs, and Facebook pages - in the wake of allegations of sexual assault and rape against Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein.Leaks about British politicians have reached political reporters, but there are further allegations about sexual harassment being circulated online, and they go well beyond politics into the worlds of media, fashion and film.The BBC has seen a list thought to have been compiled by staff and researchers at Westminster, detailing a range of mostly unproven allegations about 40 Conservative MPs and ministers.In other industries, a number of all-female WhatsApp groups have been created, in some cases to warn women about potential harassment.One with the title "Pervy Men of Journalism" includes dozens of mainly UK-based female journalists.You might also be interested in: In addition, Buzzfeed reported on a Google Docs spreadsheet which is now circulating widely.It contains the names of around 70 male journalists - mostly based in the United States - who are accused of a large variety of potential sexual offences or inappropriate behaviours.The groups and documents, along with Facebook pages devoted to exposing sexual harassment allegations, have resulted in several cases of men losing jobs or freelance gigs.WhatsApp groups have been formed by female journalists at a number of companies, including the BBC.Of course, many of these groups are simply digital versions of office chat, and pre-date the Harvey Weinstein allegations.Weinstein has denied all allegations of non-consensual sex made against him.The key difference between offline conversations is the viral nature of some of the documents and chats and their persistence online.For instance, the original spreadsheet about US journalists was deleted, but before very long another version appeared and was widely shared.Some of the groups have been created specifically to talk about harassment, and in addition to politics and media, BBC Trending has learned of similar groups made up of women working in the film and fashion industries.Clearly many more will have sprung up in a variety of companies and fields since the Twitter hashtag campaign #metoo.American model Cameron Russell published messages she received about harassment on her Instagram page with the hashtag #MyJobShouldNotIncludeAbuse.Many of the writers who sent their stories said it was often photographers, bookers, agents and clients who were involved in harassment of models.Cameron Russell says stories like the ones being shared with her are not new.In a post she wrote, "This was not an expose because nothing in these stories should be a revelation for those working in our industry.Instead it was the beginning of a power shift."The phenomenon also isn't limited to the US and the UK.In India, female law student Raya Sarkar posted a list on Facebook of alleged sexual predators in academia.She encouraged other women to come forward anonymously and add to the list, and said the evidence for the allegations came in the form of emails, screenshots, WhatsApp messages and phone recordings.Sarkar says as a result of publishing the list she has been subjected to rape threats and death threats.Writing on her Facebook page she says: "The list will stay for students to be wary."Do you have a story for BBC Trending?Email us.More from Trending: Can a Facebook friend request be 'harassment'?Image copyright Getty Images A filmmaker touched off a debate in Pakistan revolving around one question - can a Facebook friend request ever be considered harassment?...READ MORE You can follow BBC Trending on Twitter @BBCtrending, and find us on Facebook.All our stories are at bbc.com/trending.
Can a Facebook friend request be 'harassment'?:::::Image copyright Getty Images A filmmaker touched off a debate in Pakistan revolving around one question - can a Facebook friend request ever be considered harassment?It began with a visit to the hospital by the sister of Oscar-award winning Pakistani filmmaker Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy.After the treatment, the sister received a friend request from her doctor.That prompted an angry Twitter outburst by the filmmaker - and a social media storm about the definition of harassment: Image copyright Sharmeen Obaid / Twitter Image copyright Sharmeen Obaid / Twitter Image copyright Sharmeen Obaid / Twitter Obaid-Chinoy's description of the Facebook request as "harassment" triggered an angry response from many Pakistanis claiming she had overreacted.Others supported her, claiming the often abusive reaction she received revealed the misogyny of her critics.One of Obaid-Chinoy's most vocal detractors was journalist Ali Moeen Nawazish, who wrote on his own Facebook page that comparing a social media request to harassment was "ridiculous."He added "Whats next, asking for a pen is harassment Looking at someone for three seconds will be harassment???"In his post, he also said that the claim "is actually taking away from real victims of harassment."You might also be interested in: The journalist concluded by criticising Obaid-Chinoy for "Pakistan shaming."Nawazish later claimed that the doctor had been fired as a result of the tweets, however reports indicate that he has been suspended from Aga Khan University Hospital in Karachi while an internal investigation takes place.Obaid-Chinoy, who won acclaim for her documentaries on "honour killings" and acid attack victims, has faced similar accusations in the past.She's been accused of being a "traitor" to Pakistan in relation to her work which exposes violent and misogynistic cultural traditions prevalent in certain parts of Pakistani society.Her tweet storm renewed those criticisms and she was repeatedly accused of having harmed the country's international image.Some suggested she exemplified the phrase "wrong women in the wrong family" and called her an elitist.She, however, subsequently clarified she was referring to the fact that "women in my family are strong" and had not meant to "suggest a sense of privilege or power."But that didn't stop many Pakistanis on Twitter from attacking the filmmaker.Some posted photographs of her with other men - apparently suggesting these images made her a hypocrite for complaining about alleged harassment.Facebook pages were created encouraging people to send Obaid-Chinoy friend requests.Image copyright Saith Abdullah / Twitter Many others, including both men and women, questioned whether a friend request amounted to harassment.Image copyright Hamza Ali Abbasi / Twitter But Obaid-Chinoy did find some support in newspaper columns and on social media.Her defenders included Pakistani writer Bina Shah, who told the BBC she wasn't surprised by "the kind of abuse and vitriol" directed at the filmmaker."Any time you try to fight against (the patriarchy) you get an immediate backlash," Shah said.In a subsequent statement Obaid-Chinoy wrote that "The conversation has unfortunately steered far from the safety of women, unchecked unethical practises & harassment."She revealed that the doctor in question had conducted a "very private examination" of her sister before going online and "leaving comments on photographs & trying to add her as a Facebook friend."She clarified she regularly receives "unsolicited friendship requests from strangers" but that she considered this episode a "serious breach of patient-doctor privilege."The Pakistan Medical and Dental Council referred the BBC to their ethical guidelines, which don't specifically mention social media but do state that a "professional position must never be used to pursue a relationship of an emotional or sexual nature with a patient, the patient's spouse, or a near relative of a patient."The doctor at the centre of the controversy has not been named publicly.He has, however, reportedly received a job offer from another hospital in Karachi.Image copyright Hashmanis Hospital / Facebook Blog by Secunder Kermani More from Trending: 'Lack of compromise' brought Civil War Image copyright Drew Angerer/Getty Images President Trump's chief of staff, General John Kelly, claims an inability to compromise caused the American Civil War.The social media reaction came quick...READ MORE You can follow BBC Trending on Twitter @BBCtrending, and find us on Facebook.All our stories are at bbc.com/trending.
