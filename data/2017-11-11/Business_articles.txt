Japan’s top two lavatory-makers are at last making inroads overseas:::::WHEN staff at the Louvre in Paris head to the bathroom, the toilet lid opens as they approach, a warm seat heats their derrires , and, once done, their nether regions are washed and dried precisely.Selling the equipment is a coup for Toto, Japans biggest producer of shower toilets.Toto and its rival Lixil carve up the Japanese market for fancy, multi-function loos between them.At home they have market shares of 60% and 30% respectively, according to Nomura Securities, a brokerage.Yet they have struggled to win foreign bottoms over to luxuries enjoyed in Japan for many decades.Upgrade your inbox Receive our Daily Dispatch and Editors' Picks newsletters.Today 26% of Totos and 30% of Lixils revenues come from abroad (much of it from products other than shower toilets).The Japanese market is profitable, but their loos are already ubiquitous there (including in public facilities, from Tokyos metro system to remote hiking trails); the majority of domestic sales come from the renovation of private homes and hotels.And whereas Japans population is declining, in other countries sanitaryware is a rapidly growing market as people get richer, says Daisuke Fukushima of Nomura Securities.But it is not an easy sell abroad.In Japan, shower toilets appeal because of their heated seats in dwellings that are usually kept cold, and due to a Japanese obsession with hygiene and a horror of inconveniencing others (some models play music to hide noises).Other cultures are less stringent.And the toilets are expensive; Totos Neorest model ranges in price from 270,000-540,000 ($2,365-$4,730), before tax.Toto and Lixil differ in their approaches to these challenges.Toto is expanding under its own name, opening showrooms and getting its loos into hotels and buildings where lots of people will see them.People have to experience it to want to buy it, says Madoka Kitamura, its president, who wants to create Toto fans.In contrast, Lixil, formed in 2011 by a merger of five Japanese companies, is buying foreign competitors.In 2013 it acquired American Standard and a year later Grohe, a German bathroom-fittings giant.It sells a high-tech toilet under the Grohe brand.Lixils strategy is sensible.It does not have quite the same brand recognition as Toto.Kinya Seto, its president, who took over last year, readily admits that Toto currently betters it abroad as well as at home.He is trying to make the company a little less Japanese, whereas Toto is more culturally conservative (a motto, take pride in your work and strive to do your best, is recited by every worker in every factory every day to aid team-building).Mixing Japanese technology and Grohes European design could give an edge.Lixil is also casting its net wider in terms of products.Toto is putting more emphasis on those that are not available abroadmeaning high-tech lavatories.In some countries, such as India, Lixil is selling (and donating) basic, cheap kitplastic pans to use with pit latrinesbetting that in several years people will get richer and upgrade.No market can match the potential of China, yet many mainlanders opt for products from lower down the price range.So for near-term profits, the two companies are looking to America and Europe.There they encounter obstacles such as strict regulations (on water use, say), an absence of sockets in bathrooms and the lack of a wet culture beyond southern Europe.But Totos positioning of its toilets in America as better for the environment is going down well.And Lixil launched a new Grohe-branded shower toilet worldwide last year which is selling particularly well in Germany.It is designed to look good from the side (Japanese toilets are usually in a separate tiny room, so are seen only from above) and is made from ceramic (in Japan plastic seats are the norm).Aficionados will be glad that other features, such as a remote-control panel with multiple buttons and anatomical diagrams, remain the same.Correction (November 10th 2017): The original version of this article suggested that Lixil was smaller than Toto; Lixil is bigger in terms of revenues overall.This has been corrected.
Trouble for the AT&T-Time Warner deal:::::THE titans of media in America have decided this is an opportune moment to join together in mega-mergers, the better to take on the giants of Silicon Valley.The problem for them is that the Department of Justice (DoJ), and President Donald Trump himself, are less keen.On November 8th reports surfaced that the DoJ is preparing to block a proposed $109bn acquisition by AT&T of Time Warner, owner of CNN, HBO and the Warner Brothers film studioa deal that was announced a year ago and which had been expected to win approval by the end of 2017.The DoJ have reportedly told AT&T executives that to get the merger through they would have to sell off assets: either Time Warners Turner Broadcasting division, including CNN, which Mr Trump has repeatedly attacked as fake news, or DirecTV, the wireless giants satellite-TV business.Randall Stephenson, AT&Ts chief executive, said on November 8th he would not sell CNN to secure the deal.Upgrade your inbox Receive our Daily Dispatch and Editors' Picks newsletters.Time Warners share price fell by 6.5% in one day, to nearly $20 below the agreed acquisition price of $107.50 per share.A possible court battle looms, at a time when other industry players are eyeing consolidation.It was also reported this week that Disney has had talks with 21st Century Fox about buying much of the group; although the discussions ended inconclusively, Rupert Murdoch and his sons, James and Lachlan, who together oversee Fox, may be open to the idea of selling.The travails of AT&T and Time Warner could give clues to the fate of other possible media deals.Some suggest politics is at work: that Mr Trump intervened with the DoJ to scuttle a deal that he criticised during his election campaign as a symbol of unfair concentration of media power.But if Mr Trump is not directly involved, what else is going on?The acquisition does not involve conventional antitrust concerns, in that it is a vertical integration of distribution (wireless, broadband and satellite-TV) and content (TV networks, HBO and films).In the past the DoJ has been more concerned with horizontal mergers that create market dominance in one industry.Yet there is legitimate reason for scrutiny.AT&Ts commanding presence in distribution, especially in wirelessit has but one like-sized rival, Verizonraises the potential for abuse as it sells content.It is true that regulators could seek a promise from AT&T that it not favour its own networks, such as HBO, and that it not discriminate against rival companies networks as it sets carriage terms.Similar assurances were extracted from Comcast when it bought NBC Universal in 2011, a vertical merger that went through.But it is difficult to enforce such behavioural conditions.Nor would a forced sale of assets necessarily solve competition issues.Selling DirecTV would not dent the carriers strength in wireless.Selling the Turner networks would still leave AT&T with the firms most valuable content brand, HBO.Either sale might be so onerous to execute, however, that it would probably stop the merger.Whatever the DoJ decides, the logic of mergers remains.Netflix delivers content to 109m customers; Amazon is doing the same for tens of millions of Prime customers.To compete in the future TV market, media executives believe that they need to achieve scale in both distribution and content.They may have persuaded Wall Street of their case but not, it seems, the right people in Washington, DC.
Publishers are wary of Facebook and Google but must work with them:::::IN RECENT months Google and Facebook have made changes that may escape the notice of most of their billions of users, but not of news organisations.Facebook began displaying the logos of publishers in some of its posts, so readers can identify the news source.And Google for the first time gave publishers the ability to control how many times the search engines users can visit news sites free of charge.Both will directly help papers to sell subscriptions.To critics of the social-media giants, that might look like wolves offering to help the sheep while still feasting on the herd.The business of both Facebook and Alphabet, parent of Google and YouTube, is to occupy peoples time and attention with their free services and content, and to sell ads against those eyeballs.For them, quality journalism is just another hook.Upgrade your inbox Receive our Daily Dispatch and Editors' Picks newsletters.Facebook calls its News Feed offering its most important product, but in recent years it has tweaked the feed in ways that de-emphasise actual news, instead prioritising updates from friends and family over those from publishers.The associated ad revenues for many publishers have been either nominal, in the case of Facebooks fast-loading instant articles, or as yet mostly non-existent, in the case of videos they make for the social network.News sites have found they have no choice but to work with the two tech giants, however: Facebook, with its 2bn users, and Google, which directs 10bn clicks a month to publishers, are where their readers are.So there is no confusion about where the power lies.That is unlikely to change much in future, although publishers are fighting back a bit.In America a consortium of nearly 2,000 news organisations, the News Media Alliance, is asking Congress for an antitrust exemption to allow publishers to negotiate collectively with the two firms.David Chavern, the consortiums president, lists some of the demands: more ad revenue; the sharing of data about their audiences on the tech platforms; better branding for publishers, as the use of logos is very limited (people simply say, I read that on Facebook, says Mr Chavern); and support for subscriptions.That the tech giants are making concessions on some of these points may be because they sense that the political mood is turning against them in America and in Europe, or because of genuine concern for the media ecosystem.Recently Google News Lab, formed in 2015, helped fund Report for America, which will put an initial 18 reporters in small-town newsrooms across the country, with more to come in future years.Facebook started a Journalism Project in January to help develop news products in collaboration with newsrooms.Several newspaper executives say Googles dealings with them seemed more sincere than Facebooks.But both firms changes to click-through policies are significant.Googles old policy for users directed to make their first visit to a newspaper website was called first click free, but it actually gave users three free clicks on a newspapers site every day.As more publishers put up paywalls online, they lobbied Google to limit free access.Google prefers an entirely free, open webthe better for searching and for ad placementsbut in the end it relented.Were pleased that the conversation has moved on from this ideological position that all content should be free, says an executive at the Wall Street Journal , which charges readers for digital access.Earlier this year the Journal opted out of first click free and experienced a 50% decline in traffic from Google.It also saw a quadrupling of conversions to subscription among those who came to the site and hit the paywall.To the Journal , both data points confirmed the sheer power of tech platforms over publishers.As for Facebook, users today get all instant articles free of charge.It has signed up ten publishers (including The Economist ) for a trial that gives some users of Facebooks mobile app access to ten free instant articles per month but then sends them to a publishers paywall.Even so, many readers are not likely to encounter one.Media executives at firms that rely more on selling ads than subscriptions are more enthusiastic about Facebook and Google.We see them as a friend, says Paul Zwillenberg, chief executive of Britains Daily Mail and General Trust, owner of the Daily Mail .Mail Online has doubled daily visitors and engagement in part by making videos for Facebook and YouTube.That does not mean giving up on direct internet traffic (on which Mail Online can sell ads without sharing revenue with Facebook or Google).About 35% of Mail Onlines traffic in America still comes directly to the news sites homepage, or front door, according to SimilarWeb, an analytics firm, which is slightly higher than the rate for the homepages of the biggest American papers.But selling digital ads on their own websites is a challenge for most news organisations, in part because of the competition from the duopoly.Facebook and Alphabet will take the majority of all digital-ad revenue globally this year, and, by some measures, have recently taken 80-90% of the growth in such revenue.Their data on users browsing activities give them a huge advantage in micro-targeting users.Wherever journalism turns, Facebook and Google loom large.Their recent moves, although welcome to many publishers, are unlikely to alter the trajectory of the relationship.Correction (November 10th 2017): Facebooks Journalism Project aims to help develop news products in collaboration with newsrooms, not newspapers as the original article stated.
Regulators begin to tackle the craze for initial coin offerings:::::IM GONNA make a $hit t$n of money on August 2nd on the Stox.com ICO.Written in July on Instagram, these words made Floyd Mayweather, a boxer, the first big celebrity to endorse an initial coin offering, a form of crowdfunding that issues cryptographic coins, or tokens.Stox, an online prediction market, went on to raise more than $30m, some of which seems to have gone directly into Mr Mayweathers pocket.Other VIPs, including Paris Hilton, a socialite, followed suit and endorsed ICOs.But this source of easy cash may now be drying up: on November 1st Americas Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) warned that such promotions may be unlawful, if celebrities fail to disclose what they receive in return.The endorsements and the SECs attempt to rein them in are the latest episodes of token mania.Virtually unknown a year ago, ICOs are now more celebrated than initial public offerings (IPOs), the conventional way of floating a firm.Over the past 12 months $3.3bn has been raised in more than 200 ICOs, according to Coinschedule, a data providercompared with only about $70m in the same period a year ago.This surge is one reason for the boom in bitcoin, a crypto-currency, which was worth around $7,500 on November 2nd.As Benjamin Lawsky, a former securities regulator in New York, put it recently: Regulators have never seen a new financial product explode with the speed and velocity [of ICOs].Upgrade your inbox Receive our Daily Dispatch and Editors' Picks newsletters.Unsurprisingly, supervisors have stepped in.China and South Korea, where ICOs had become part of the local gambling culture, have already outlawed them.Many regulators in Western countries have by now made clear that they consider at least some of the coins (or tokens) that are distributed in an ICO to be securities, which need to be regulated as such, with all that this entails in disclosure and other requirements.Leading the pack, the SEC said in a report on the DAO, an ill-fated early ICO, that offerings of this kind need to be registered (or apply for an exemption).But big regulatory problems remain unsolved.The most pressing open question is what a token really represents, says Peter van Valkenburgh of Coin Centre, a think-tank.Technically, the answer is straightforward, at least for those familiar with crypto-currencies.Tokens are mostly entries on Ethereum, a blockchain, or distributed ledger, copies of which live on many connected computers around the worldmuch like the one that underlies bitcoin.The Ethereum ledger, however, not only keeps track of a currency, called ether, but hosts what are known as smart contracts, programs that encode business rules.Investors send ether to an ICOs smart contract, which generates tokens that can be traded.The ICOs issuer can keep the ether, and use the funds to develop its project.Legally, things are more complicated, says Kevin Werbach of Wharton, a business school at the University of Pennsylvania.The SEC, for instance, argues that the technology is irrelevant: when tokens are used to raise funds, they are securities.By contrast, champions of ICOs hold that, although they are initially used to raise funds, they also often have a function in the projects they finance and hence should be treated differently.In Filecoin, an online market for digital storage that raised a record $257m, the tokens will be used to pay or get paid for space on disk drives.Tokens of affection Most issuers will have a hard time convincing the SEC and other regulators that theirs is a utility token.For many existing firms, such as Kik, a messaging app, which raised nearly $100m, raising funds seems the priority.For other issuers the problem is that the tokens they are selling are for projects that exist only on paper, and so have no other function than to bring in money.And most investors currently buy tokens not for their utility, but because they are betting that their value will rocket.To avoid the heaviest regulation, issuers are keeping the lawyers busy.One increasingly popular legal construct in America is called SAFT (Simple Agreement for Future Tokens)in effect, options to buy tokens, rather than tokens themselves, thus dodging the problem posed by projects that do not yet use the tokens.As raising money gets harder, marketing becomes more important.One result is the pre-sale, in which early investors often get a big discount to help boost demand for the ICO.A second big open question is where tokens will fit into the regulatory landscape.Being pieces of code, they can take on the form of any financial product.They collapse all asset classes into one, says Lex Sokolin of Autonomous Research, a consultancy.This will cause legal friction, particularly in America, where different asset classes are regulated by different agencies.Other jurisdictions are easier to navigate.Many crypto firms are based in Zug, Switzerland, where they can save taxes and tokens are less likely to be considered securities.In January a distributed-ledger technology framework will go into effect in Gibraltar (although it does not specifically address ICOs).A big unknown is China which, despite its ICO ban, is clearly interested in all things crypto, as long as it can control them.And third, there is the question of how the organisations financed by ICOs will be governed.Finding robust solutions is vital: many of these entities see themselves as a new type of firm.The idea is that because founders, employees and users all hold tokens, their incentives are aligned: all have an interest in expanding their network, which will drive up the tokens value.These organisations will be decentralised, meaning that no single group will be in charge, and they will be managed, at least partially, by smart contracts to keep them on track.Making all this work will be hard, as shown by the case of Tezos, which raised $232m to finance the development of another blockchain.Its version will come with a sophisticated governance mechanism to avoid the problems that beset bitcoin, which in August split in two when developers and firms that cryptographically mint (mine) the currency disagreed on the way forward.(A further fork was just called off.)Holders of Tezos tokens will get a vote commensurate with their holdings or be able to delegate it to someone else.Ironically, though, Tezos is the first substantial token-financed organisation that has run into serious governance problems.The founders opted for a complex legal structure, which involves a Swiss foundation that controls the proceeds of the ICO.They are now embroiled in a public quarrel with the head of this foundation over how it should be run.Moreover, the founders and others involved are being sued by an ICO contributor for alleged breaches of securities law, which Tezos denies.Tezoss travails, as well as the general token mania, have pushed some issuers to rethink.Blockstack, whose ICO will start on November 13th, will do without a pre-sale, instead giving users a discount.It has turned itself into a public-benefit corporation, obliged to pursue the public good as well as profit.The firm, which has also said it wont raise more than $110m, has a lofty ambition: to develop software and services to bring the internet, now dominated by a few tech giants, back to its decentralised roots.If Blockstack runs into trouble, too, the very concept of distributed organisations may be at risk.Correction (November 10th, 2017): A previous version of this piece said that Blockstack was expected to beat Filecoins fundraising record of $257m.The company has said it would not raise more than $110m.This has been amended.
A German hardware giant tries to become an ultra-secure tech platform:::::BOSCH is everywhere.It has 440 subsidiaries and employs 400,000 people in 60 countries.Its technology opens Londons Tower Bridge and closes packets of crisps and biscuits in factories from India to Mexico.Analysts call it a car-parts maker: it is the worlds largest, making everything from fuel-injection pumps to windscreen wipers.Consumers know it for white goods and power tools synonymous with Made in Germany solidity.The company itself prefers to be called a supplier of technology and services, or the IoT [internet-of-things] company.On a hill overlooking Stuttgart, robotic lawnmowers whizz around its headquarters and a window displays dishwashers and blenders.Inside are signs of a company in transition: posters call on staff to rip off ties, celebrate error-culture and just do it opposite a quote from Robert Bosch, the founder: Whatever is made in my name must be both first-class and faultless.Upgrade your inbox Receive our Daily Dispatch and Editors' Picks newsletters.The 130-year-old giants attempts to become more like a tech company reflect a world where value comes increasingly from software, services and data, not things.When software and hardware meet, as they do in the field of autonomous cars or the IoTs world of internet-connected objects, manufacturers risk becoming mere commodity suppliers.Part of Boschs answer is to position itself as a trusted custodian of data.Orwells 1984 is kindergarten compared to the IoT-world.When it comes, and people re-evaluate privacy, Bosch will be prepared, says Peter Schnaebele, its head of smart homes.Soft power as well as hard Bosch is 92%-owned by a foundation, freeing it to invest in long-term innovation.In 2016 it spent nearly a tenth of its revenue of 73bn ($85bn) on R&D.Recently it opened a glitzy research campus in Renningen.It also has a 420m venture fund and a startup incubator.In a converted warehouse in Ludwigsburg, north of Stuttgart, six teams of former employees work to turn more radical ideas into businesses.Volkmar Denner, its CEO, says that he still sees Boschs future as a product company, but one that is heavily involved in software and middleware and that provides services on top.It has invested in software; built a platform (on which it runs IoT services and apps and allows other firms to do the same), called Bosch IoT suite; and last year launched its own cloud and data centre.That is unusual; two other industrial giants, General Electric and Siemens, use Amazons cloud to run their platforms.Bosch says it is seeking greater speed, flexibility and data security.It plans to open several more centres next year.Boschs mantra is to increase the value of hardware with a 3S strategy: sensors, software and services.Over half of its electrical-product classes are web-enabled; by 2020 all should be.Among its more telling bets is a 1bn investment in a semiconductor plant in Dresden for chips and sensors, to act as the eyes and ears of the IoT.The long-term prize will be to use the data to teach things to thinkby, for example, training the lawnmowers to respond to unexpected objects.The company last year started an artificial-intelligence (AI) centre, with 100 employees in Bangalore, Palo Alto and Renningen.Because machines will be only as smart as the data they are fed, Boschwhich already hosts over 100,000 terabytes annually (1 terabyte fills 1,428 CD-Roms)is gathering as much as it can.It crunches data from some British Gas customers to anticipate energy-maintenance needs, for example; data also pour in from factory floors and farmers fields filled with sensors.Today we sell products and practically dont have to care for them again becausebeing German-madetheyll last, says Christoph Peylo, Boschs head of AI.But in future products may need updating every two weeks, so perhaps well charge by volume of data, not hardware.Coup, an electric-scooter sharing scheme in Berlin and Paris (pictured), has no Bosch hardware at all.The company just provides the platform and buys the scooters in from Taiwan.It is Boschs first direct-to-consumer business in mobility.This arealoosely, anything that involves getting people from point A to point Bis crucial to Bosch, generating over half its revenue.The firm invests 400m per year in electro-mobility, or developing parts for electric cars, bikes, charging stations and so on.Some 3,000 developers work on driver-assistance systems.It holds nearly 1,000 patents for automated driving and by 2019 expects to make 2bn from driver assistance (double what it earned in 2016).Sharing economy Whether it is cars or the IoT, partnerships have become an efficient way to innovate.It was not always in the companys culture to share with outsiders, says Lothar Baum, a data scientist at the firm.Indeed, Bosch is still seen by many as too conservative, cautious and cost-sensitive.But it is making connections with all sorts of other companies; from a map-building partnership with Apollo, a Chinese platform owned by Baidu, to working with Tesla on autonomous cars, to a deal with Amazon to use Alexaits voice-controlled computerto steer Bosch smart-home systems.Especially in the pre-competitive stage, sharing makes sense, says Mr Baum.The big unknown is what will happen in the competitive stage.The race among leading IoT platforms is wide open.Eric Lamarre of McKinsey, a consultancy, divides the field into the horizontal tech platforms, such as Amazon; the more vertical manufacturers, such as Bosch and GE; and startup platforms.This is when questions around data become critical.Bosch thinks that customers will soon value data more than they do today.At the launch of the Bosch IoT Cloud Mr Denner noted that many companies and consumers say data-security concerns stop them using cloud technologies and connectivity products, offering its own cloud as an answer.The firm hopes that manufacturing nous will still count for something, too.Even in a super-connected world you dont want to be surrounded by shoddy devices which are cheaply built, says Mr Peylo.Last month Boschs smart security camera won the German Design Award; its white goods are selling like hot cakes in Asia.The company will continue to make non-shoddy products and to put its sensors into factories, homes and cars.It will almost certainly remain a big part of the T in IoT.The question is whether it can become far more than that.
3G Capital, magicians of the consumer industry, need to learn a new act:::::OCCASIONALLY a business idea emerges that is so simple you cannot believe it works.Consider the five founders of 3G Capital, an investment firm.Warren Buffett co-invests with them and calls them among the best businessmen in the world.They use debt to buy consumer-product firms, then they revamp their brands and slash costs.In total, since 1997, they have launched $470bn of deals, through 3G Capital or earlier entities (for simplicity this article lumps these all together and calls them 3G).That makes 3G the second most acquisitive organisation in modern history.It sells every Budweiser slurped, Whopper burger munched and bottle of Heinz ketchup squirted on the planet.Yet despite its superb long-term record, 3G is losing steam.In the past two years its total portfolio has lagged slightly behind the S&P 500 index, Schumpeter estimates.Its two biggest firms, AB InBev, a beer giant, and Kraft Heinz, a food company, have returned 6% and 16% respectively, well behind the S&P 500 (29%) and a basket of 20 big rivals (24%).On November 1st shares in Kraft fell after poor results.Once, 3G seemed to be reinventing the consumer industry.Now a better description is that it brilliantly took advantage of a window of opportunity that is closing.Upgrade your inbox Receive our Daily Dispatch and Editors' Picks newsletters.By their own description 3Gs founders started out, in Brazil, as mere finance guys.The first big deal was the acquisition of Brahma, a local beer firm, in 1989.In the booze industry they bought Interbrew in 2004, Anheuser-Busch, maker of Budweiser, in 2008, and SAB Miller in 2016.The resulting beer colossus, AB InBev, is Europes third most valuable company.In the food business, 3G took control of Heinz in 2013 in partnership with Mr Buffett.Heinz then bought Kraft in 2015, and the combined firm tried and failed to buy Unilever in February.3G also controls Burger King, which it has merged with Tim Hortons, a Canadian fast-food chain where hypothermic Torontonians huddle in winter.3G is expert at zero-based budgeting, a technique that involves scrutinising consumer firms bloated costs.But its magic rests on two simple insights formed decades ago.First, it noted that although the cost of debt financing was low, the yield on consumer firms shares was quite high, meaning a juicy spread.Second, conventional managers underestimated how resilient consumer-product firms sales are thanks to strong brands and oligopolistic market shares.So costs could be cut (including marketing) without prompting a fall in the top line.The takeover of Anheuser-Busch, worth $62bn, shows these principles in action.The deal was mostly financed by debt with an annual post-tax cost of 3%.The firm being bought yielded 6% (its annual cashflow after capital spending, as a share of its market capitalisation plus net borrowings).Cost cuts eventually lifted that return to 8%.Normally such high leverage is reckless, because profits are volatile.But Anheuser was different.It had a 48% market share in America, with famous brands that people would keep chugging come hell or high water.After the 2007-08 financial crisis, share prices and interest rates fell, pushing the gap between the cost of debt and consumer firms yields wider still.3G pursued big deals around the world, eventually paying $123bn in 2016 for London-listed SAB Miller.Those two original insights are getting tired, though.First, the gap between the cost of debt and the yield of consumer firms has narrowed as their market values have risen.The median yield for a basket of 20 big consumer firms has fallen from 7% in 2010 to 4% now, making deals less profitable.Some firms are pricier than they would otherwise be because their share prices reflect speculation that 3G might make a bid.Mondelez and others have all been rumoured targets in a Wall Street game of whos next?.The cost of debt may start to rise as monetary policy normalises.The second intuitionthat consumer firms sales are near-indestructibleis no longer safe.Many customers are opting for niche brands; craft ales instead of Bud Light, or organic take-home meals instead of Krafts classic Macaroni and Cheese.In the last quarter, both AB InBev and Kraft Heinz reported stagnant volumes globally and shrinking sales in America.In the medium term e-commerce could reduce the power of big brands.Instead of having a privileged spot on Walmarts finite shelf space, established consumer companies must now slug it out with smaller brands on Amazon.Such shifts will not threaten 3Gs current firms.Cost savings are still going to help their bottom lines.Profits at AB InBev and Kraft Heinz would have to fall by two-thirds or more before they struggled to make interest payments.And their combined debt pile, though huge (equivalent to the fourth-largest of any non-financial firm in the world), is well-organised, with repayments spread out over years.Even so, a decade of mediocrity beckons.The numbers up One option is a final flurry of deals.The possibility cannot be ruled outwhich is why consumer-product firms must stay on their toes.But as well as being expensive, cross-border deals and job cuts have become more politically sensitive (Kraft Heinz has cut 10,000 jobs since 2013).3Gs bid for Unilever caused a stink in Britain and the Netherlands.Trustbusters would block another big beer deal.Perhaps reflecting this, 3G is trying a new approach, of expanding firms through investment and innovation.Here, AB InBev is in a reasonable position, given its exposure to fast-growing emerging economies and its experience of turning niche beer brands into big sellers.Energising Kraft is a taller order, since creativity is not in its DNA and 69% of its sales are in America.3Gs pivot will be a struggle.But what a run it has had.It took advantage of a time when rates were low, stockmarkets were cheap, protectionist instincts subdued, anger over job losses muted and digital competition still nascent.Its adventures have not necessarily made the world a fairer place, but as a piece of intelligent, opportunistic investing they deserve three cheers.
The Paradise Papers shed new light on offshore finance:::::THIS week was uncomfortable for a host of well-heeled figures.In the frame were U2s Bono, Americas commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, and Britains Queen Elizabeth, as well as some of the worlds most valuable companies, including Apple and Nike.All these, and many more, feature in the Paradise Papers, a trove of more than 13m documents, many of them stolen from Appleby, a leading offshore law firm.The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) and its 95 press partners, including the BBC and the New York Times , began publishing stories based on the papers on November 5th.Dozens appeared this week, with more to follow after The Economist went to press.The ICIJs last big splash, the Panama Papers in April 2016, shed light on some of the darkest corners of offshore finance.In contrast, many of the activities highlighted by this leak are legal.But they would be widely seen as flouting the spirit of national tax laws by exploiting the gaps that open up between them when finance straddles borders.Among the most enlightening documents are those concerning the tax gymnastics employed by Apple and Nike to shift profits to havens.For Nike, moving the rights to its swoosh design and other trademarks to Bermuda helped cut its worldwide tax rate to between 10% and 20%, down from over 30% ten years ago.Upgrade your inbox Receive our Daily Dispatch and Editors' Picks newsletters.By contrast, an investment in a Cayman-registered fund by the queens private estatemade much of by the BBCappears to have carried no tax advantages.If investing through offshore funds is, in itself, wrong, then millions of Britons are guilty, too.Thousands of private-equity and hedge funds are registered in tax havens.This is often to avoid an extra layer of taxation in the funds country of domicile, not to dodge tax owed in the investors home country.Most if not all large pension schemesthe BBCs includedinvest some of their money in such offshore vehicles.The global impact of the Paradise Papers is unlikely to be as spectacular as that of their Panamanian predecessor.That felled the leaders of Pakistan and Iceland, and sparked many criminal investigations into tax evasion and money-laundering, including 66 in Britain alone.But already there have been calls for official inquiries and investigations, including into the business links of Mr Ross, who was revealed to have had an indirect relationship with Russian figures with Kremlin ties, through an oil-transport firm.(He says he was unaware of these.)Several national tax agencies, including Indias and Spains, have launched probes.European Union finance ministers called this week for a blacklist of tax havens to be drawn up by next month.The revelations about multinationals creative tax-planning will add to pressure to fix the patchwork of rules and treaties governing cross-border business taxation.The OECD, a think-tank, has led attempts to close the loopholes, which it estimates cost up to $240bn a year in lost tax revenue.But getting lots of countries to agree on a fix is like herding catsespecially when America and the EU are at odds over American tech giants tax arrangements.More broadly, the leak will fuel a debate raging since the global financial crisis, over the pros and cons of offshore finance for the world economy.Detractorsamong them Angus Deaton, a Nobel prize-winning economistsay tax havens serve no useful purpose, merely allowing a financial elite to dodge regulations and financial obligations that apply to everyone else.Defenders say they oil cross-border investment by, for instance, offering individuals from different countries tax-neutral venues in which to make pooled investments; and offer a legitimate financial refuge for citizens of countries in turmoil.This defence elicits little public sympathy.But it is true that small offshore centres have got little credit for clean-ups over the past decade.On some measures of tax and corporate transparency and combating money-laundering, Jersey, the Cayman Islands and some other havens score better than many rich countries.Plenty of dubious or downright nefarious things happen offshore.But it would be a pity if the Paradise Papers were to reinforce the clich that the culprits are palm-fringed islands, when it is the much larger, onshore financial centres, such as London, New York and Miami, that offer the most attractive combination of respectability and secrecymaking them magnets of unparalleled power for the worlds tainted money.
America’s Republicans take aim at mortgage subsidies:::::IN THE 1980s Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan were both proud of their efforts to expand home ownership.In Britain, Thatcher presided over a fire sale of state-owned homes to tenants.In America, Reagan deregulated financial markets and expanded mortgage lending.At the time both countries provided generous mortgage-related tax breaks, making it easier to flog homes to the masses.Upgrade your inbox Receive our Daily Dispatch and Editors' Picks newsletters.Britains 1980s housing boom turned to bust; the mortgage subsidies that helped to fuel it were abolished.America still subsidises mortgages to the tune of $64bn a year, by allowing homeowners to deduct interest costs from their tax liabilities.But a tax plan unveiled by Republicans on November 2nd proposes to limit the subsidy.Twelve European Union countries also include some form of mortgage-interest deduction (MID) in their tax code.The average European subsidy, however, is around a tenth of Americasabout 0.05% of GDP.The Netherlands is much the most generous, at 2% of GDP.Evidence that MID schemes boost home ownership is scant.Recent research covering rich countries suggests it has no effect.Moreover, subsidising mortgages might actually hurt economies by helping inflate housing bubbles.The European Commission blames Swedens generous MID scheme for encouraging a household-debt binge and inflating house prices.All but three EU countries have either reformed or repealed their MID schemes since the 2007-08 financial crisis.Ireland, Spain and Greece, for example, withdrew subsidies after suffering property busts.But withdrawing MID cannot on its own prevent property-market bubbles.According to The Economist s round-up of global house prices, Australia, New Zealand and Canada all have overvalued housing markets despite the absence of mortgage subsidies (see table).Interest deductibility might be more defensible if its benefits were more evenly spread.In the Netherlands and elsewhere in Europe, the biggest benefits accrue to the richest householders, although many European countries tend to combine MID schemes with other generous housing welfare.In America 70% of the subsidy is claimed by the top 20% of earners.The country spends more on housing subsidies for 7m households earning over $200,000 a year than it does on the 55m making less than $50,000.Regardless of its redistributive effects, Americas MID is a blunt tool, notes Edward Glaeser, an economist at Harvard.The Republican plan hopes to save the Treasury $100bn over ten years by limiting the subsidy to the first $500,000 of any outstanding mortgage and to first homes.Yet the change would affect just 3% of outstanding mortgages, according to CoreLogic, a data firm.Changes to how ordinary people file tax returns may reduce the number who claim MID and further focus its benefits on top-rate taxpayers.With interest rates near historic lows, this might seem an opportune time to end MID altogether.If that were to happen, some estimates suggest house prices might fall by 10-15%.But they would stabilise as the pace of house-building slowed.When the Netherlands adjusted its mortgage subsidy in 2012, house prices fell by 10%, but they are now climbing again at a decent clip.Prices in Britain are partly buoyed by the private rented sector where landlords have been able to deduct interest expenses from their rental income.The government began phasing out that deduction in April.That will have a big effect on the market.Reagan reckoned that home ownership brought stability and rootedness.That may be so, but it also brings rigid labour markets.Yet few politicians are willing to praise the merits of renting.Thatchers and Reagans housing reforms were thought to be driven by a fear of a slow creep of socialism.They would look enviously at Russia today.Home ownership rates in Britain and America have fallen in recent years; Russias has increased by 30 percentage points in two decades.
ING, a Dutch bank, finds a winning digital strategy:::::GERMANYS third-biggest retail bank has no branches.It is also Dutch.And it is highly profitable.ING-DiBa, an online bank owned by ING, the Netherlands biggest lender, looks after 133bn ($154bn) of deposits for over 8m customers.In a fragmented marketmost Germans entrust their savings to small, local banksthat means a share of around 6%.ING-DiBas lack of branches keeps costs down, allowing it to resist charging for current accounts and offer savers a tad more than rivals, despite a recent cut; and it has won a name for good service in a country not renowned for it.While other banks struggle after years of ultra-low interest rates, ING-DiBa thrives.Its return on equity exceeds 20%.ING as a whole is in fair shape, too.On November 2nd it reported net third-quarter earnings of 1.4bn, slightly more than a year earlier.The groups return on equity was a healthy 11%, nearly two percentage points up.Since 2014 the number of primary customers (with an active current account and another product) has climbed by 25%, to 10.5m.By 2020 ING aims to have 14m.They are especially valuable because they want further services and because frequent transactions yield reams of data.Upgrade your inbox Receive our Daily Dispatch and Editors' Picks newsletters.Banks prattle a lot about digital strategy.At ING, the talk is far more convincing than in most.Last year Ralph Hamers, the chief executive, unveiled a plan costing 800m to bring the whole bank onto one digital platform and to save 900m a year by 2021.It is closing 600 Belgian branches; 7,000 jobs will go.Roel Louwhoff, who is overseeing the digital transformation, explains that ING aims to build componentsprocesses and productsthat can be used across the group, so that costs can be saved and customers better served.Examples include the way new customers are taken on, and security procedures.The bank has borrowed from other industries, for instance by studying how carmakers use common parts in several models.In INGs honeycomb of a headquarters in Amsterdam is an Obeya room (Japanese for big room: Toyota was a pioneer of the idea) in which plans are co-ordinated and updated.(It is closed to visiting journalists.)One fruit will be Model Bank, the standardisation of processes in European online banks (except in Germany), based on those already followed in Spain and Portugal.A 180-strong team in Madrid is developing Model Bank, which ING will deploy next year in the Czech Republic before moving on to Austria, France and Italy.It helps that ING has for years been on the digital trail abroad: it bought 49% of DiBa in 1998 and has owned all of it since 2003.Yet the early start was almost INGs undoing.Before the financial crisis, says Koos Timmermans, the chief financial officer, it managed the balance-sheets as well as the operations of the foreign online banks and the conventional business separately.The online banks attracted plenty of deposits but lacked assets; they bought lots of bonds, many backed by American mortgages.The domestic bank had ample loans but relied on wholesale funding.When the crisis struck, this dual exposure to capital markets proved calamitous.The Dutch government bailed ING out to the tune of 10bn in 2008 and later took over the American mortgage securities (on which it eventually made a profit).As a condition of state aid, the European Commission obliged ING to sell its insurance arm and its online bank in America.Other businesses, including online banks in Britain and Canada, were also offloaded.ING finished repaying the aid in 2014.Dividends restarted the next year.Dutch treat Nevertheless, says Mr Timmermans, branchless banking was a smash hit.ING has learnt its lesson, he adds.Now the balance-sheets are more in sync.At the foreign online banks, savings still outstrip loans (mostly mortgages).Trying to lend more where people are more inclined to save may not pay.But todays ING is wary of bonds.Never, ever, will we collect savings and invest in the bond market, Mr Timmermans says, except for liquidity needs.Instead, ING smooths imbalances internallyfor example, by putting $5bn of loan assets generated in America onto its German balance-sheet.There are gaps.ING hopes to lift the share of revenues from fees and commissions from 15% to 20% in the next four years, reducing its dependence on interest income.Stefan Nedialkov of Citigroup notes that European banks averaged a 24% share last yearbut also that ING is picking up the pace.In the first nine months of 2017 fees rose by 12% year on year.The online banks are pushing into more sophisticated products than current and savings accounts and mortgages.ING is happy to find allies.In September it formed a partnership in Germany with Scalable Capital, a robo-adviser.Last year, with Kabbage, an American financial-technology company in which it has a stake, it started offering online loans, available within minutes, to small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in Spain.It has recently started doing the same in France and Italy.In October the bank launched a 300m fund to invest in fintechs.This shift is a test for branchless banking.The jury is still out on whether we will accomplish the same on the SME side as in basic retail banking, says Mr Timmermans, though he believes young entrepreneurs will be keen.ING has not yet cracked the nut of avoiding bad credits.But, he adds, it makes no sense to open branches just for SMEs.With ever fewer people visiting banks, the online model must move on.How far and how fast?ING will be among the first to find out.
Activist shareholders take on the London Stock Exchange:::::ACTIVIST hedge funds like Elliott Management, Cevian Capital or The Childrens Investment Fund (TCI) are famed for pushing for change at the companies they buy into.A favoured tactic is to install a new chief executive at a floundering firm.So it is odd to find a fund lobbying for an existing boss to stay on, as TCI has done in a spat with the London Stock Exchange (LSE).In over eight years at the LSE, Xavier Rolet has transformed it from a share-trading venue to a clearing and data-services powerhouse, through acquisitions such as Russell, an index-maker, and a majority stake in LCH, a clearing-house.His hope of merging with the LSEs big German rival, Deutsche Brse, fell through, largely because of Britains vote to leave the EU.But Mr Rolet remains widely respected.So eyebrows were raised when the LSEs announcement on October 19th that Mr Rolet would leave in 2018 gave no reason.Upgrade your inbox Receive our Daily Dispatch and Editors' Picks newsletters.In a fiery letter penned on November 3rd, TCIs founder, Sir Chris Hohn, said it was clear to [TCI] that Mr Rolet had been forcedto leave against his wishes.Sir Chris called not only for Mr Rolet to stay but for the LSEs chairman, Donald Brydon, to go, having given no satisfactory answer about Mr Rolets departure.In a second letter on November 7th, Sir Chris called for the waiving of a confidentiality agreement that he says the LSE signed with Mr Rolet, preventing him from speaking out.The LSE has largely kept mum, merely noting the receipt of the first letter and insisting it had followed a proper process to lay the ground for an orderly succession.It had no comment on the second letter.At least one other big shareholder, Egerton Capital, a London-based fund, agrees with TCIs position.Jeff Blumberg, the chief executive, says it is mystified by Mr Rolets departure and would vote for his reappointment.TCI thinks most shareholders want to keep Mr Rolet, and has threatened to call an extraordinary general meeting to depose Mr Brydon.Whether or not the meeting occurs, Sir Chris has already exposed an internal struggle at one of Britains most esteemed financial institutions.And placing the status quo at the heart of an activist campaign may not be as strange as it seems.TCI contends the issue is at heart one of poor corporate governanceprecisely the target activists usually aim at.Lobbying for stability at a successful firm is consistent with demanding change at an unsuccessful one.
Venezuela seeks the restructuring of its massive foreign debts:::::INVESTORS have long seen a default on Venezuelan sovereign debt as a question of when, not if.Its bonds have been priced at levels implying imminent bankruptcy, but somehow the cash-strapped oil exporter has stayed afloat.Until now.On November 2nd Nicols Maduro, the countrys authoritarian president, announced that he would order a refinancing and restructuring of foreign debt worth about $105bn.The prices of government bonds fell by up to half.Markets braced themselves for one of historys most complex sovereign-debt renegotiations.Mr Maduros brief statement was cryptic as to the concrete steps he will take.He invited everyone involved in foreign debt to talks in Caracas, the capital, on November 13th.Many creditors want a neutral venue.Moreover, Mr Maduro appears to have pre-emptively dashed any hope of a voluntary agreement by naming his vice-president, Tareck El Aissami, as head of his debt-restructuring committee.Americas Treasury department has designated Mr El Assami a drug kingpin, meaning that Americans cannot deal with him.Upgrade your inbox Receive our Daily Dispatch and Editors' Picks newsletters.Sanctions also prevent American entities from buying any new debt issued by the Republic of Venezuela with maturities longer than 30 days, or 90 days for the debt of PDVSA, the state oil companya problem if, say, a restructuring involved an exchange of defaulted bonds for new ones.In theory, President Donald Trump could adjust the rules but still prevent any new money from flowing to Mr Maduro.For now, however, no proposed changes to the American sanctions have been aired.If Venezuela runs out of cash without reaching an agreement, it could simply stop paying its debts.But that would be risky, because PDVSA holds valuable property abroad, including Citgo, a refiner in America, and a fleet of oil tankers.After a default, creditors might be able to seize those assets.That would severely disrupt PDVSAs operations and wreak further havoc on the Venezuelan economy, which has shrunk by over a third since 2013.So Mr Maduros plan is a mysteryif he has one at all.On the day he announced the refinancing, he also said that PDVSA would make the final $1.2bn payment on a maturing bond.The money has yet to reach creditors, but most of it is reported to have left PDVSAs accounts.American sanctions have scared off banks, creating logistical hurdles that can delay transfers.Another payment a week earlier was held up for days but eventually completed.If Venezuela were indeed about to renege on its debts, an extra $1.2bn would surely come in handy.One interpretation of Mr Maduros perplexing approach is that he may hope to continue servicing PDVSAs debts but welsh on those contracted by the state.It is PDVSA that holds the vulnerable assets abroad.And more of its bonds than the Republics lack collective-action clauses.That makes it impossible to force holdout creditors into a deal agreed to by a majority of bondholders.However, foreign courts are likely to frown on any effort by Mr Maduro to pick and choose which lenders to snub.Separately, Crystallex, a Canadian mining firm, has filed a lawsuit in America claiming that PDVSA is an alter ego of the Republic.If it succeeds, government-bond holders could press claims against PDVSA.Another theory, advanced by Rafael Guzmn, an opposition congressman, is that Mr Maduro may have wanted a sell-off of the countrys bonds.Venezuela or its foreign patrons, mainly Russia and China, could then buy them up cheaply so Venezuela could retire its debt at lower cost, or leave it in the hands of sympathetic allies.An even more conspiratorial explanation has been mooted by Javier Ruz of Caracas Chronicles, an opposition-friendly blog.The government had spooked markets by using 30-day grace periods to delay interest payments, lowering bond prices.Mr Ruz wondered whether the government had tipped insiders off that it would actually cough up the final $1.2bn, as a last stop on the Venezuelan-debt gravy train before payments ceased.Besides exploiting contractual grace periods, Venezuela has yet to miss a payment.And its bonds still mostly trade at 20-30 cents on the dollara big discount, but far above the single-digit prices to which defaulted debt often sinks.In part, those prices reflect Venezuelas long-run fundamentals.It has the worlds largest proven oil reserves.A government that pursued sensible economic policies could probably service the debts within a few years.But the relatively high prices may also suggest that some investors think Mr Maduro is bluffing.Venezuelas biggest payments of 2017 are now behind it, and the oil price has recently risen.Moreover, Vladimir Putin, Russias president, appears to be sticking by his Venezuelan friends.Russian-controlled entities have already provided the country with at least $17bn of financing.And Russian officials recently agreed to restructure a $3bn loan.If Mr Putin sees a commercial advantage to Russia in propping up his oil-rich anti-American ally at a cost of a few billion dollars, picking up Venezuelan debt on the cheap may yet turn out to be a bargain.
Equity valuations are high. But other options look even worse:::::EVERY investor would like to find the perfect measurement tool to tell them when to get into, and out of, the stockmarket.The cyclically adjusted price-earnings ratio (CAPE), as calculated by Robert Shiller of Yale University, averages profits over ten years and is used by many as an important valuation indicator.Currently it shows that American shares have hitherto been more highly valued only in 1929 and the late 1990s, periods that were followed by big crashes.Upgrade your inbox Receive our Daily Dispatch and Editors' Picks newsletters.That seems ominous.But as a paper by Dylan Grice and Gregor Obrecht of Calibrium, a Zurich-based private-investment office, makes clear, it is far from conclusive.The CAPE is not much use as a short-term indicator; it has been well above its long-term average for several years now, as it was in the late 1990s.The main argument for the CAPE is a long-term one.If you divide all past CAPE values into quintiles, the annual returns earned over the subsequent decade by investing in equities when the CAPE was in its most-expensive quintile were more than eight percentage points below the returns earned when the CAPE was in its cheapest quintile (see chart).However, the case is less cut-and-dried than those numbers seem.First, Messrs Grice and Obrecht point out that this approach is subject to hindsight bias.The long-term valuation range may be clear now; past investors did not know the range when they were actually buying shares.If the data are adjusted to reflect the historical data available to investors at the time, then the outperformance gap falls by more than a percentage point.A more serious problem relates to the quantity of the data.Mr Shiller has 146 years of numbers for earnings; that breaks down into only 14 completely independent ten-year periods.It is pretty difficult to create a robust statistical case from such a paucity of numbers.The authors calculate that, based on current valuations, the best forecast for ten-year real annual returns from American equities is 2.6%, well below the historical average.But the range of returns can only be estimated with reasonable confidence to be between -3.4% and +8.7%; something that is likely to seem too broad to be of much use to professional investors.These criticisms are fair.So why, nevertheless, does it still seem likely that a high CAPE portends lower future returns?Future equity returns can come from only two sourcesgrowth in profits, or the markets placing a higher valuation on those profits.For example, a high CAPE might be justified when profits are unusually low, by the hope that earnings will recover.However, profits are high, relative to GDP, at the moment.Perhaps this is the result of a shift in power in favour of capital, at the expense of labour; perhaps it is the result of the greater concentration of some industries, which has given certain businesses monopoly-like margins.It is possible that this shift is permanent, and that profits will not fall back as they have in previous cycles.But it seems the height of optimism to believe that profits will grow faster than GDP, ie, that the overall share of capital will rise even further.GDP growth is itself largely driven either by an increasing number of workers or by a rise in their productivity.Since the size of the workforce is rising more slowly (and is set to fall in some countries), and recent productivity growth has been disappointing, it is hard to be more optimistic on this score.So rapid growth in either GDP or profits looks difficult to achieve.Turning to valuation, some believe that the CAPE has trended higher in recent decades because of better accounting standards and corporate governance.Earning high returns in an era of sluggish profits growth would require valuations to rise even further, reaching dotcom-era levels.Even a partial reversion to the mean (the long-term CAPE average is 16.8 compared with about 30 today) would be very bad news.Here, too, there is a natural limit on returns.However, the authors point out that investors are not looking at equities in isolation; they are choosing between asset classes including cash (yielding virtually nothing) and government bonds.Government-bond yields are very low in historical terms; in other words, valuations are very high.A comparison of the expected returns from equities and bonds shows equities should perform much better, even given the high level of the CAPE.That insight chimes with the views of many fund managers.They are nervous about equity valuations but they find government bonds deeply unattractive.So they are stuck with the stockmarket as the least dirty shirt on offer.
Calypso St. Barth’s skirts on paying bills amid major cash crunch:::::A chain of swanky fashion boutiques that counts Gwyneth Paltrow and Cameron Diaz as clients is having trouble keeping the lights on literally.Calypso St. Barth whose tropical-themed togs include $95 T-shirts and $165 swimsuits has been skimping on paying its clothing suppliers, employees and even its overdue electricity bills as it grapples with a cash crunch, sources told The Post.Over the past month, boutiques in New York, Connecticut, Seattle, Dallas, Denver, and Florida have quietly shuttered, insiders said.With them, scores of sales people have been laid off without being paid for their final weeks of service, sources said.The money spigot is getting closed by Solera Capital, a New York-based private-equity shop whose principals include Diana Taylor, the girlfriend of billionaire Michael Bloomberg.In August, Calypso told its sales staff that even the music thats piped into its stores, computers and phone lines was getting shut off, according to internal e-mails obtained by The Post.Some employees said they showed up to work in recent weeks, only to head back home because the lights wouldnt switch on.As our inventory dwindles, we reassure our customers that we arent closing because thats what weve been told to say, one fed-up employee griped in an email last month to management and workers that went nationwide.But now that our phones dont ring and the UPS no longer delivers packages and were selling a schizophrenic mash-up of spring, summer and fall to try to keep our rack full, those words feel hollow and rather delusional.When The Post called Solera Capital on Friday for comment, the person who answered the phone said Im sorry I cant help you, and hung up.A subsequent message was not returned.Imagine that you have no phones, no new product, youre getting eviction notices and you are trying to stay positive because you love your store, said one former sales associate in the New York area.We are all trying to get answers and many of us cant pay our rent and bills, said the former worker, who lost her job in October and has not gotten her last paycheck.At one time, the 40-year-old brand had as many as 35 stores.There were 22 listed on its website Friday, but many of them have closed in recent weeks, including those in Greenwich and Westport, Conn.; Dallas; Palm Beach and Naples, Fla.; and Tribeca in the Big Apple, sources said.Even Calypsos posh boutique at Madison Avenue and 72nd Street, one of its last remaining locations, has no telephone service.When The Post visited the Madison store earlier this week, a saleswoman who refused to give her name testily insisted that it wasnt closing and that anyone who has said otherwise is garbage.Last week, Calypsos creditors filed a Chapter 7 petition to force Calypso into liquidation.Some were startled to learn this week that the company doesnt even own its intellectual property, according to the creditors lawyer, Kenneth Rosen, of Lowenstein Sandler.Ive received calls from investment bankers and companies that buy brands inquiring about Calypsos intellectual property, Rosen told The Post, adding that both Calypso and Solera have lawyered up now.
‘Costco for millennials’ inks deal with Telaflora:::::Want a bouquet with those rolls of toilet paper?Boxed.com, the online retailer thats billed as the Costco for millennials, just inked a deal with Telaflora to provide flower delivery services from some 11,000 florists, which will begin this weekend.The 4-year-old discounter has been quietly adding products like fresh food, wine and hotel booking services and now flowers with an eye towards launching a premium membership program, founder and chief executive Chieh Huang told The Post.Big Apple-based Boxed models itself on the warehouse clubs like Costco, BJs and Sams Club minus the membership fees.That could be changing, at least for those willing to pay for the prospect of deeper discounts.Likely customers for this service would be Boxed corporate customers, but Huang believes a fee will appeal to consumers as well, especially if it includes free shipping.We have been launching more services with the ultimate goal of wrapping them as a premium tier, Huang said, adding that we are still studying it.Flower orders will arrive separately from Boxeds bulk items.
Millennials really love Christmas music:::::Think Christmas music isnt cool?Dont tell that to millennials.Music aficionados aged between 18 to 34 now account for a whopping 36 percent of holiday music fans a chunk thats more than 40 percent larger than the corresponding pool of Christmas-jingling baby boomers, according to a study by Nielsen.Boomers & Beyond, which is how Nielsen describes the 55-plus crowd, make up only 25 percent of the holiday fan base.That even trails the 31 percent who are Gen Xers aged 35 to 54.The emergence of millennials as the generation most enamored with Christmas jingles is all the more remarkable given that eight of the top 10 holiday songs played on the radio during Christmas season last year were released between 1944 (Bing Crosbys White Christmas) and 1970 (Jose Felicianos Feliz Navidad).The lists only two modern artists were Mariah Carey (1994s All I Want for Christmas) and Trans-Siberian Orchestra (1995s Christmas Eve Sarajevo).This debunks a myth even for me, David Bakula, Nielsens senior VP of Industry Insights, told The Post.I thought that, because so much of Christmas music is rooted in classics from the 50s and 60s, boomers would be the biggest fans.Jon Miller, Nielsens VP of Audience Insights, described ratings spikes driven by holiday radio programming as a ramp that keeps rising from Thanksgiving through Christmas Day.Multiyear studies show adult-contemporary stations that flip to holiday music usually see about a 90 percent ratings increase during workday hours, which rises to nearly 130 percent in the evening.Then, on Christmas Eve, the ratings shoot up nearly 600 percent, Miller said.He expects the appetite to get even bigger now that millennials have emerged as the genres biggest fans.Im seeing more appetite for holiday songs every year, he added.To satisfy the need not only of millennials but all Americans to hear Christmas classics, more than 500 US radio stations flip their formats every year to holiday music.The switch generally occurs between Thanksgiving and the New Year although Beasley Media Group offers an endless loop of holiday audio through Bostons Magic 106.7 and an online side channel.The station, which first tried the holiday format in 2005, has advertisers well-trained.They start locking up [ad] inventory way in advance, because they know our audience will double or triple in November and December, said Justin Chase, Beasleys executive VP of programming.While Magic 106.7 metaphorically owns Boston for holiday music just as iHeartRadios WLTW rules New York City the Christmas format can accommodate more than one station per market.WLTW put Christmas music into heavy rotation after 9/11, sensing listeners would appreciate a feel-good format.It gradually stepped up its yuletide spins so that, in 2005, it became the first New York station to go all-holiday on the Saturday before Thanksgiving.Three Christmases later, according to Arbitron ratings, WLTWs seasonal fare had captured a third of the areas radio listeners.
Bikram Yoga files for bankruptcy after sex harassment lawsuits:::::Bikram Yoga has collapsed in the heat from a slew of sex-harassment suits, that is.see also Post-sex scandal, Bikram yoga gets a makeover When the founders of Bikram Yoga NYC opened the first...The Calif.-based yoga chain famous for its hot yoga studios that crank the thermostat above 100 degrees before class filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy this week, blaming more than $16 million in sexual-misconduct judgements against its frisky founder.Bikram Choudhury, a 73-year-old, charismatic entrepreneur who has minted millions on the book and lecture circuit, has been inundated with lurid allegations of sleazy behavior around women including his own top executives.Miki JaffaBodden, Bikram Yogas former head of legal, is owed $8 million, according to court papers.Petra Starke, a former Obama White House lawyer who became the chief executive of the Bikram Yoga College of India in 2013, is owed $5.1 million.In Boddens 2013 lawsuit, she alleged Choudhury created a hyper-sexualized, offensive and degrading environment for women and pressured her to cover up his conduct.Starke, meanwhile, was hired by Choudhury to navigate the avalanche of sexual harassment and sexual assault lawsuits tiled against him, according to her lawsuit.Starke left after he stopped paying her when she uncovered even more acts of apparent sexual misconduct by Choudhury during a business trip.According to the suit, Choudhury forced a 23-year-old instructor to perform oral sex on him during a limousine ride to Atlantic City.Choudhury has repeatedly denied the accusations.In a 2016 interview in India with HBOs Real Sports, Choudhury called his accusers trash, and said that he would never need to resort to sexual assault because he has the most beautiful, famous, rich women in the world lined up to sleep with him every day.He added that there were four separate instances of women taking their own lives because he would not have sex with them.Why would I have to harass women?Choudhury said.People spend $1 million for one drop of my sperm.According to the filing, Bikram Yogas liabilities are worth up to $50 million, and it has assets of up to $1 million.In May, a Los Angeles judge signed off on an arrest warrant for Choudhury, who fled the country in 2016 after Boddens claim was revealed.Boddens lawyer told The Wall Street Journal that Choudhury is currently in Mexico.However, former lawyer of Choudhurys told the paper that the guru is out of the country, but is unsure of where he is.With Reuters
Waldorf Astoria slashing its hotel rooms by more than 1,000:::::The Waldorf Astoria said it will slash its number of hotel rooms by more than 1,000 in an overhaul that carves out most of its landmark building for condos.Confirming an exclusive report in The Post, the Waldorfs owner, the Chinese insurance giant Anbang, said Friday it has tapped Aecom Tishman to begin a massive renovation of the historic hotel that will begin in the coming weeks.When the three-year revamp is done, Anbang said the Waldorf will have just 350 hotel rooms, down from the 1,413 it was operating when the building got shuttered this spring.Meanwhile, the vast majority of the buildings remaining square footage minus ballrooms, restaurants and lobby areas will be used to build 350 residential condos, Anbang said.The final hotel-room tally is at the low end of recent estimates and much smaller than the number former Waldorf owner Hilton had expected, sources close to Hilton said.The hotel-room count has been a major bone of contention between Anbang and Hilton, which has a 100-year management agreement to operate the hotel, sources tell The Post.Hilton is concerned that downsizing the Waldorfs flagship on Park Avenue, will weaken the chain of nearly 30 Waldorf-branded properties that Hilton operates worldwide, according to sources.We look forward to working closely with Aecom Tishman to carry out one of the most extensive restoration and renovation projects in New York City, said Brandon Dong, managing director of the Waldorf Astoria New York project of Anbang, in a statement.The hotel closed six months ago to prepare for the renovation.In the past few months Anbang has secured permits, worked on its design plans and preserved some of the propertys most famous items, including the Cole Porter piano, the Worlds Fair clock tower, the Kennedy rocking chair and the MacArthur Desk, Anbang said.
China’s ‘Black Friday’ brings in $1.5B in sales in the first three minutes:::::SHANGHAI Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba said sales topped $1.51 billion in just over three minutes from the opening of Singles Day, an annual online discount sales gala that has become the worlds biggest shopping spree.Once a celebration for Chinas lonely hearts, Singles Day has become a 24-hour extravaganza that outsells Black Friday and Cyber Monday U.S. sales combined, and acts as a barometer for Chinas consumers.After a star-studded event in Shanghai late on Friday counted down to the sales midnight start, Alibaba said gross merchandise volume (GMV) topped 10 billion yuan ($1.51 billion) in a little over three minutes, and had almost doubled, to 19.1 billion yuan ($2.88 billion), in under six minutes beating the entire days sales in 2012.Alibaba alone saw $17.7 billion of goods sold on its platform at last years Singles Day.The event gets shoppers around China scouting for bargains and loading up their online shopping carts, while delivery men and robots are braced for an estimated 1.5 billion parcels expected over the next six days.This is a big event for China, for the Chinese economy, co-founder and Alibaba vice chairman Joseph Tsai said ahead of the sales bonanza.On Singles Day, shopping is a sport, its entertainment.Tsai said rising disposable incomes of Chinas over 300 million middle-class consumers was helping drive the firms online sales and would continue.This powerful group is propelling the consumption of China, he said.Analysts and investors will closely watch the headline sales number, which is likely to top last years total.Spending rose by nearly a third at 2016s sale the eighth iteration of the event but that was slower than the 60 percent increase logged in 2015.At Alibabas Friday night gala, co-founder and chairman Jack Ma hosted guests including actress Nicole Kidman, singer Pharrell Williams and Chinese musicians and film stars such as Zhang Ziyi and Fan Bingbing.
This untapped entrepreneurial community is not where you’d expect:::::As the sun sets on a suburban office park, 16 entrepreneurs gather nervously near a conference room stage.For the last 12 weeks, they have been preparing for this evening.Now theyll finally get their chance to stand in front of top business leaders and investors to pitch their new companies.A young woman named Kim has founded a nonprofit designed to support recent female graduates of the foster care system.Andrew is pitching a service that connects event planners to non-traditional event spaces.Marquell is launching a new clothing brand.Scenes like this play out every day in the tech world, but these entrepreneurs are unlike the characters depicted on HBOs Silicon Valley in one key respect: Theyre all veterans.Marquell and Andrew are Marines, while Kim served in the Army.The organization sponsoring the evenings event, a national nonprofit named Bunker Labs, helps discharged soldiers like these found and grow businesses of their own.But while Bunker Labs is making remarkable progress, many more veterans hunger for opportunities to hang their own shingle.It may seem surprising veterans as the great untapped market for entrepreneurs.Many Americans associate entrepreneurship with young dorm-room disruptors, not former soldiers.But the latter are well-equipped to found and lead great businesses.In fact, veterans start an incredible variety of businesses, from low-tech to high-tech, like Signafire Technologies, a data fusion company founded by Marc Alacqua, an Army veteran.Think about it: Both basic and advanced military training equips soldiers to think on their feet, handle adversity, and operate cutting edge-technology in the most trying of circumstances.Many veterans are also confident and seasoned.Theyve tested their skills in life-or-death situations and lived to tell about it.I know that veterans can thrive in the world of free enterprise because Ive seen it in my own family.My grandfather Henry Libby sacrificed his hearing operating a mortar on the Italian front in the Second World War.Upon his return, he went to school, worked, and then founded Libby Laboratories, a custom manufacturer of cosmetics that has thrived for decades, innovating new techniques and creating dozens of jobs.We need more people like my grandfather.Outside of a few prominent innovation hives, entrepreneurship is on the wane in America, with 30 percent fewer businesses founded over the past decade compared with previous decades.Start-ups are particularly rare in the cities and towns that provide a disproportionate share of the nations military recruits.Veteran-founded businesses could help reverse that trend benefitting not merely these communities but veterans themselves.As the country singer Charlie Daniels reminds the Twitterverse every morning, an average of 22 veterans take their lives each day.Former soldiers are particularly apt to experience homelessness; many struggle to find gainful employment.But many dont want to claim spots on someone elses payroll.They want to build something of their own.We should make it our mission to ensure that they have that opportunity.Today, a number of hurdles prevent many vets from making the most of their skills and savvy.These would-be entrepreneurs often lack ties to the financial and small business communities that provide the start-up capital required to launch new companies.Military men and women are often dismissed by funders because they talk with a unique cadence, use distinct jargon, and prepare PowerPoint presentations quite different from your typical young techie.These obstacles arent insurmountable.As someone who makes his living growing companies across a variety of sectors, Ive seen many businesses succeed because of (rather than despite) their founders military background.The key is to focus additional resources on efforts to give veterans the best chance of striking out successfully on their own.Imploring and incentivizing big businesses to hire veterans is a worthy cause indeed (and, in fact, a business called Hirepurpose founded by Marine veteran Zach Iscol is helping veterans connect with such jobs!).But so is helping veterans embark on an entrepreneurial adventure of their own.My grandfather helped defend American freedom, losing his hearing in the process.But his patriotic contributions didnt end there.Together with many other veteran-owned businesses, Libby Laboratories fueled the post-War economic boom, putting millions of Americans to work.Todays veterans are hungry to reprise that role.We often talk about how best to take care of those who have served but we too rarely follow through.Our former soldiers are as capable of founding companies as they are of leading platoons.Lets get them started.Oliver Libby is the co-founder and managing director of venture firm Hatzimemos/Libby and co-founder and chair of the board of social enterprise accelerator The Resolution Project.
Twitter CEO says Trump’s account shouldn’t have gone dark:::::Twitter boss Jack Dorsey said it never should have been possible for an employee to deactivate the account of President Donald Trump earlier this month.The presidents account on Nov. 2 went dark for 11 minutes, during which his profile could not be searched and all of his tweets had disappeared.At the time, Twitter said that the account was inadvertently deactivated due to human error by a Twitter employee.But it was later discovered that a rogue employee had taken it down on his or her last day of work.At a Thursday conference sponsored by Dealbook, Dorsey said Twitter should have been able to prevent the prank.We started looking into the controls we have in place, what we can improve and where we have weaknesses, where we have gaps, Dorsey said in an interview.Second, particular policies around what agents have control over and what they dont.Twitter has been making headlines for all the wrong reasons in the past few months, most recently having to freeze its verification process after verifying the account of Jason Kessler, who organized the neo-Nazi rally in Charlottesville, NC.Verification was meant to authenticate identity & voice but it is interpreted as an endorsement or an indicator of importance, Twitter said after the incident.We recognize that we have created this confusion and need to resolve it.
Equifax says it hasn’t lost any big clients since data breach:::::Washington is coming down hard on Equifax, but the companys big corporate clients are giving it a pass.The embattled credit bureau said Friday it hasnt lost any significant business customers since it announced in September that hackers had breached its systems and made off with the sensitive data of 143 million customers.The number was later bumped to 145.5 million.Equifax largely does business with banks and other financial institutions not with the people they collect information on.We didnt lose any contracts, interim CEO Paulino do Rego Barros Jr. said on a conference call.While no major customers have cut ties with the credit bureau, some have delayed new contracts until Equifax proves that theyve done enough to shore up their cybersecurity a situation that will likely dent sales and earnings for the next few quarters, Barros said.Meanwhile, executives wont be receiving any bonuses for 2017 because of the cybersecurity incident, Barros said.Last year, the company spent more than $83 million on incentive compensation.The comments came the day after the company announced that fallout from the hacking, including legal fees and providing free credit monitoring services, cost it $87.5 million for the quarter, denting its profits.Equifax also spent as much as $75 million on IT upgrades, and investment in cybersecurity could hit next quarters earnings, too, said John Gamble, the companys financial chief.Even that might not be enough to stop future hacks, the company warned.We cannot assure that all potential causes of the incident have been identified and remediated and will not occur again, Equifax admitted in a regulatory filing Thursday.The report sent shares down sharply in early Friday trading, but they about flat, to $108.37, by early afternoon.In the short-term, management will have to convince skeptical customers and new business prospects that its cybersecurity defenses are ironclad to convert contract deferrals into actual earnings and cash flow, David Togut, analyst at Evercore ISI, said in a research note.That probably wont happen until the end of next year, or early 2019, he added.Separately this week, Barros and his predecessor, Richard Smith, were hauled before the fifth Capitol Hill hearing on the hacking disaster.If we are going to do anything meaningful we must have the political will to hold these companies accountable, US Sen. Bill Nelson (D-Fla.) said during the hearing.Equifax is currently facing investigations from multiple federal agencies and 50 state attorneys general, as well as hundreds of class-action lawsuits, according to its Thursday regulatory filing.One of the federal probes is into whether four executives knew about the breach when they sold nearly $2 million in stock a potential crime.Last week, Equifax cleared itself after conducting an internal investigation.Government prosecutors are still investigating.The call on Friday gave few new details about the breach, and demurred when asked if there was an uptick in fraud stemming from the breach.We dont have any direct evidence [of fraud], Barros said.But we cant speak to others with other evidence.
JC Penney shares surge on surprisingly strong sales:::::JC Penney reported an increase in third-quarter same-store sales that was twice what analysts expected, sending its shares up 15 percent in premarket trading on Friday.The retailer said comparable sales rose 1.7 percent, compared with the 0.6 percent to 0.8 percent it had forecast last month.Analysts on average had expected comparable sales to increase 0.7 percent, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.JC Penney last month also slashed its full-year forecast as it sold stagnant apparel inventory at heavy discounts amid an overhaul of its womens section.We took aggressive actions to clear slow-moving inventory, primarily allowing for an improved apparel assortment heading into the holiday season, Chief Executive Marvin Ellison said in an earnings release.US department stores have worked hard this year to rein in inventory to match declining foot traffic and boost weak margins as shoppers increasingly turn to off-price and online retailers.Rivals Macys, Kohls and Nordstrom reported results on Thursday and said they were entering the most important shopping season of the year in tight inventory positions.J.C. Penneys net loss widened to $128 million, or 41 cents per share, in the quarter, ended Oct. 28, from $67 million, or 22 cents per share, a year earlier, partly because of heavy discounting to clear slow-moving inventory.Excluding items, the company lost 33 cents per share, less than the 40 to 45-cent loss it had estimated.Analysts expected a 43-cent loss.Net sales fell about 2 percent to $2.81 billion but beat the average analyst estimate of $2.77 billion.
Plans for new ‘Star Wars’ trilogy prop up sagging Disney shares:::::The force of Star Wars lifted Walt Disney shares in pre-market trading Friday as the promise of a new film trilogy overshadowed disappointing quarterly results and struggles at the media companys television business.The storied movie studio and theme park operator is scrambling to keep viewers who are abandoning its current top money maker, cable networks.The power of its characters and brands is the reason many investors stick with the company despite its challenges.Disney shares rose after chief executive Bob Iger said Disney had struck a deal with Rian Johnson, director of upcoming film Star Wars: The Last Jedi, to create a new trilogy in the blockbuster science fiction series.A live-action Star Wars TV series also is being developed for a streaming service that Disney is launching to capture online audiences, Iger said.Disney shares rose in pre-market trades to $105, up 2.2 percent from their Thursday closing price, after the Star Wars announcements, reversing an initial falloff after Disneys results raised concerns about cable subscriptions.see also Disney announces yet another Star Wars trilogy A long time ago, in a completely different galaxy far,...Subscribers and advertising revenue both fell at ESPN, the sports powerhouse that is seen as a proxy for Disneys ability to fight the rapid migration of audiences to online viewing.Affiliate revenue rose and overall results at ESPN were comparable to the prior year for the quarter that ended in September, Disney said.Total revenue from Disneys cable business, the largest unit, which includes ESPN and the Disney Channel, fell marginally to $3.95 billion in the fourth quarter, missing the $4.06 billion consensus of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.To address challenges in its TV networks business, Disney is developing family-friendly streaming services that it will sell directly to consumers to compete with Netflix and other rivals.Building those businesses tops the companys agenda for the next year, Iger told analysts on a conference call.We believe creating a direct-to-consumer relationship is vital to the future of our media businesses, and its our highest priority this year, he said.New Disney releases will go to the companys own service rather than Netflix, starting in 2019, and Iger on Thursday said the new service would be priced substantially below Netflix, a reflection of having less content.Disneys sports-focused service will launch in early 2018 and will be called ESPN Plus, Iger said.Investors remain concerned about Disneys cable business and were buoyed by the potential of the Star Wars franchise and the pricing of the streaming service, Tigress Financial Partners analyst Ivan Feinseth said.The Last Jedi, hitting theaters in December, could ring up $2 billion in global box office sales, he said.Disney shares have had a difficult year, falling roughly 1 percent, while the S&P 500 has risen 15 percent.Disney also held talks in recent weeks about buying some of Twenty-First Century Foxs film and TV businesses, according to media reports, which could bring Disney more content to compete with Netflix and others.Disney did not comment on the Fox talks on the call with investors.A two-day closing of Disneys Florida resorts amid a hurricane and the cancellation of an animated movie were among one-time items that reduced operating income by about $275 million, or about 11 cents per share, the company said.Disneys movie business generated revenue of $1.4 billion in the quarter, down about 21 percent and missing analysts average estimate of $1.61 billion.Broadcast revenue of $1.51 billion missed Wall Streets target of $1.69 million, and Disneys theme parks posted revenue of $4.67 billion, just missing expectations of $4.70 billion.Disneys total revenue fell to $12.78 billion in the quarter ended Sept. 30 from $13.14 billion a year earlier.Net income attributable to the company declined to $1.75 billion from $1.77 billion.Excluding items, it earned $1.07 per share.Analysts on average had expected an adjusted profit of $1.13 per share and revenue to rise to $13.23 billion.
Hedge fund mulls throwing Weinstein Co. a $35M lifeline:::::The Weinstein Co. may soon be turning the page to Chapter 11.Sources close to the embattled Hollywood studio co-founded by Harvey Weinstein said Thursday that a deep-pocketed hedge fund will decide early next week whether to throw it a lifeline or possibly let it file for bankruptcy.In addition to a $35 million bridge loan that would save the Weinstein Co. from going under, Fortress Investment Group is considering extending a debtor-in-possession loan in a prospective bankruptcy scenario, a source close to the situation said.Deadline.com reported Wednesday that Fortress, an investment firm, was on the 1-yard line about providing a loan that would keep Weinstein Co. afloat through the rest of the year.Other sources, however, called that characterization overly optimistic, with one asserting to The Post that a deal wasnt even yet within field-goal range.On Wednesday, the Weinstein Co.s exclusive talks to sell part or all of its business to Colony Capital, the fund controlled by billionaire Trump backer Thomas Barrack, ended without a deal.Sources note the Weinstein Co. was in bad financial shape well before last month, when co-founder Harvey Weinstein was accused of sexual harassment and worse by dozens of women.Those accusations played a big role in the breakdown of talks with Colony.Although Harvey Weinstein has been booted from the company, his 23 percent stake in the studio could deliver substantial profits should it be sold.No one is interested in salvaging a company which would benefit Harvey, Barrack said on Bloomberg TV.Aside from bad publicity, any pre-bankruptcy buyer of the Weinstein Co. could face contingent liabilities from lawsuits filed by alleged victims of Weinstein during his 12-year reign.But the same buyer could avoid all or most of those liabilities, sources said, by waiting until the Weinstein Co. seeks bankruptcy protection.
The ‘Trump slump’ predictions that never came to be:::::It was the Trump slump that never was.Critics sobbed that the sky would fall following the Nov. 8, 2016, presidential election, predicting that the stock market would tank, ObamaCare enrollment would plummet and international tourism to the Big Apple would shrivel.The first two predictions have proven false, and now the number of foreign tourists traveling to New York City is projected to jump 3.6 percent this year.In February, doomsday prophets from NYC & Co., the citys privately run tourism agency, said international tourism would plummet by 300,000 visitors this year due to President Trumps travel ban and related rhetoric.The Europeans start coming to New York around Easter and continue through summer, NYC & Co. CEO Fred Dixon claimed in February.Thats when youll see the rhetoric out of Washington really having an impact on travel.But the Big Apple remains the top destination of any hot spot in North and South America with foreign tourism expected to spike from 12.65 million visitors in 2016 to 13.1 million in 2017, according to a report issued Tuesday by market-research firm Euromonitor International.NYC & Co. declined to comment.Meanwhile, major hedge fund Bridgewater Associates, Citigroup and Goldman Sachs predicted Wall Street doom if Trump reached the White House.If Donald Trump were to win, that outcome would have been unexpected and thereby may cause a jump in the equity-risk premium, Citigroup analyst Tobias Levkovich said.see also Stock rally under Trump is the biggest since FDR The Trump stock market rally has legs.A year after... A year later, the Dow Jones industrial average has rocketed nearly 25 percent from 18,329 in October 2016 to 23,461 as of Thursday.The S&P 500 has surged roughly 21 percent.Hand-wringers also feared that ObamaCare enrollment would tank following Trumps pledges to repeal and replace the program and his administration cutting program marketing.But the first four days of ObamaCare open enrollment on Nov. 1-4 saw 601,462 Americans sign up on federal exchanges, according to figures released Thursday by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.The center could not provide a direct comparison to the four-day window in 2016, but the 600,000 figure is on pace to top the 1 million sign-ups in the first 12 enrollment days last year.
AT&T is preparing for an epic legal battle over Time Warner merger:::::Get ready for an epic battle between AT&T and the Department of Justice that could land in a courtroom and drag into next year.The DOJ is pushing AT&T and Time Warner to sell big chunks of their business, possibly including CNN, in order to clear their $85 billion mega-merger, according to reports, and AT&T is digging in its heels.Speaking at a Thursday conference, AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson denied reports that he has considered selling CNN, which has long been a target for President Trump.Selling the cable news network, whose political coverage Trump has long complained is biased against him, makes no sense, Stephenson said, signaling that he was girding for a court battle.We have been working very diligently on a litigation strategy, the telecom bigwig added at the conference, organized by Dealbook.Media reports have suggested that the DOJs recent threats against AT&T are politically motivated, noting Trump openly pledged to block the merger when it was announced last year, just weeks before he was elected president.But politics aside, the DOJ has a winnable case against AT&T if it sues to stop the deal, a former top DOJ official, requesting anonymity, told The Post.Hillary would have likely killed this deal and its likely that William Baer, President Barack Obamas antitrust chief at the DOJ from 2013 to 2016, would have blocked it too, said the source, who is not working on the merger.It has been decades since the DOJ sued to stop a vertical merger like AT&T/Time Warner, where two companies that operate in different spaces combine.However, if a vertical combination is anti-competitive, it can be blocked.In this deal, a key concern is that AT&T, which owns DirecTV, might withhold programming from Time Warners CNN, HBO, TNT and TBS channels from cable rivals including Charter Communications, the source said.In a courtroom, the DOJ would have to show that DirectTV would make more in added subscribers by withholding content than it would lose in lost revenue from programmers, the source added.Stephenson was asked Thursday if he thought there was a Trump factor in the decision to challenge his merger.I have no way of even answering the question to the positive or negative, he said.Some at the DOJ regret having cleared Comcasts 2011 purchase of NBCUniversal with so-called behavorial remedies that depend on companies living up to promises.In that case, Comcast agreed to provide programming to any internet provider on the condition that the provider secured programming from two other networks.Since that time, no internet provider has succeeded in launching its own cable-like network, leading some to believe the consent decree was a failure, the former DOJ official said.Stephenson contended Thursday that combining AT&T and Time Warner would help his company succeed against Amazon, Google, Facebook and Netflix: We hope for a shot at competing with them.Throwing out Amazon and Google seems like a bad defense, the former DOJ official said, noting that Staples failed to win approval for a merger with Office Depot last year, despite arguing that competition with Amazon eased antitrust concerns.
Billionaire ally of ex-Uber CEO busted on rape charge:::::A billionaire ally of ex-Uber CEO Travis Kalanick was arrested at a posh London hotel this past May after being accused of rape, according to a police report obtained by The Post.The explosive report says that an unidentified woman walked up to the front office counter at a London police station on the afternoon of May 27 and alleged she had been assaulted by Shervin Pishevar, a tech tycoon who also co-founded the Hyperloop One high-speed train promoted by Elon Musk.Investigators flocked to the crime scene a penthouse suite at Londons exclusive Ned Hotel, according to the report and collected numerous samples of testing of clothing, bed linen, blood soiled items, [a] damaged telephone [as well as] drug paraphernalia.Pishevar who just two months later in August kicked up controversy for defending Kalanick in a high-profile board spat with Ubers biggest investor was taken into custody within hours of the complaint, the report said.Pishevar cooperated with authorities, surrendering clothing and other evidence, and his lawyers were contacted immediately, according to the police report, some of whose details were reported earlier Thursday by Forbes.Pishevar was never charged with a crime, and a source with knowledge of the situation told The Post that the investigation was closed earlier this week.Reps for Pishevar didnt respond to The Posts requests for comment.The arrest was first reported in June by the Sun, the London newspaper thats owned by News Corp., which also publishes The Post.The Sun said at the time it was barred from identifying the suspect in the arrest by the High Court in London.The unnamed billionaire, the paper reported at the time, forked out 100,000 on lawyers to keep the Sun from publishing his name.On Monday, Pishevar filed a defamation lawsuit in which he denied paying any money to settle a claim for sexual assault in London.In the lawsuit, Pishevar accused Definers Public Affairs, a Republican-led opposition research firm, of running a malicious smear campaign designed to incite false, defamatory, and highly damaging chatter and gossip about [him] amongst reporters and strategically targeted individuals in [his] personal and professional networks, such as investors in Uber.In addition to his tech investments which also include Airbnb and Slack Pishevar has been a vocal advocate for the California independence movement, tweeting last November that if Donald Trump won the presidency, he would be funding a legitimate campaign for California to become its own nation.Pishevar accused Definers of spreading a rumor that he is an agent of the Russian government and a friend of Vladimir Putin.In a statement to The Post, Definers denied all of Pishevars allegations.Mr. Pishevars accusations against Definers are completely false, said Tim Miller, a partner at the firm.His claims are delusional, we have never engaged in any of the actions he outlined in this complaint, and Definers has never done any work with regards to Mr. Pishevar.Its not the first time a higher-up at Hyperloop One has made headlines for the wrong reasons.Last July, Pishevars brother Afshin, then the head of legal, had a restraining order placed against him for putting a hangmans noose on an employees desk after a disagreement.
Kiwi, kidney beans and Kindles: Amazon to sell at Whole Foods:::::NEW YORK You may see more of Amazon inside Whole Foods soon: The online retailer, which has been already been selling its voice-activated Echos at Whole Foods, will start to sell Kindles, Fire tablets and other Amazon devices at its grocery stores.The move gives Amazon, which bought Whole Foods this summer, another place where shoppers can touch or try out its gadgets during the holiday shopping season.Amazon has been expanding its brick-and-mortar presence: It recently opened shops inside some Kohls department stores and it has opened a dozen brick-and-mortar bookstores.The Seattle-based company says that Whole Foods stores in Chicago; Denver; Rochester Hills, Michigan; Davie, Florida; and Pasadena, California, will open Amazon pop-up stores next week.About 100 other stores will also have the devices available for sale.
Target insists lead-laced fidget spinners found in toy aisle aren’t intended for kids:::::Target is hawking fidget spinners that contain dangerous amounts of lead, according to a consumer advocacy group.The three-pronged toys designed to relieve stress and improve focus quickly became one of the years most ubiquitous gadgets and a lucrative product for manufacturers and retailers.But after testing several models, US Public Interest Research Group Education Fund (PIRG) is accusing Target of selling two models that contain extremely high levels of lead.Due to its harmful effects on child development, federal laws limit the amount of lead in childrens products to 100 ppm of total lead content.PIRG found 33,000 parts per million (ppm) of lead in the center circle and 22,000 ppm in the arm of one model called Fidget Wild Premium Spinner Brass.The group also found 1,300 ppm in the center circle and 520 ppm in the arm of a model called Fidget Wild Premium Spinner Metal.Bulls-i-Toy, based in Iowa, supplies Target with the fidget spinners.Target argues that the products do not have to follow the 100 ppm limit because they are not toys intended for children.The two fidget spinners cited in your letter are clearly marked on the package appropriate for customers 14 and older, and are not marketed to children, a Target official wrote in an email shared with Business Insider.As a result, the fidget spinners identified are not regulated as toys or childrens products and are not required to meet childrens product standards.PIRG disputed the designation and claimed its representatives found the toxic fidget spinners in toy aisles at Target stores.Saying fidget spinners arent toys defies common sense, as millions of parents whose kids play with spinners can tell you, said Kara Cook-Schultz, toxic director at PIRG.The CPSC, Target and Bulls i Toy need to acknowledge the obvious that all fidget spinners are toys.The consumer group has called on Target to stop selling the gadgets and recall the models it has sold.
Dow plunges more than 200 points on tax overhaul jitters:::::Stocks tumbled more than 250 points before recovering some ground at sessions end after a Republican senator revealed details of tax plan that would push back cuts for corporate America by at least a year.US Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.)on Thursday revealed that plans to slash the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent were getting pushed back to the start of 2019.President Trump has so far pushed an immediate cut to taxes, and the Houses plan has no delay.However, the Senate plan, which is expected to be unveiled as soon as Thursday, puts that policy in danger.There is continuing confusion over the possibility of tax cuts being meaningful and passing this year, James Abate, chief investment officer at Centre Asset Management, told Reuters.At the end of the day some version will get passed but it will be watered down.There is too much resistance from special interest groups and budget hawks and there is a fear that the tax cuts will be in name only.The Dow Jones industrial average fell as much as 253 points, or about 1 percent, in mid-afternoon trading.The index ended the day 101 points lower at 23,461.94.Other indexes followed suit.The S&P 500, a broader measure of US companies, ended the day 0.3 percent lower to 2,585.64.The Nasdaq fell the most of the major averages, 0.6 percent, to 6,750.05.Investors should also keep in mind that geopolitical tensions and political risk in the background, have the ability spark risk aversion.Before markets leveled off, the dip threatened to be the biggest since Aug. 17, the day that rumors swirled that the White Houses top tax adviser, Gary Cohn, was going to resign over Trumps equivocating remarks about white supremacists in Charlottesville, Va. Investors were dumping stock for ephemeral and sentimental reasons around the tax reform debate, Scott Clemons, chief investment strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman.Tax reform is very, very difficult and it doesnt take place overnight, Clemons said.Investors were also concerned about the potential fallout from Democrat wins in regional US elections this week a signal for next years mid-term Congressional elections for Trump.With concerns rising over possible delays in the US tax reforms, equity bears could make an unwelcome appearance, consequently exposing global stocks to downside risks, Lukman Otunuga, research analyst at FXTM, told Reuters The selloff comes as economists have expressed doubt about the strength of the economy and how long the stock rally could last.The president is facing an uphill battle to jumpstart a moderate but stagnant economy solely on the basis of tax reform, Lindsey Piegza, chief economist at Stifel, told The Post earlier this week.Were not saying it cant be done, but it will have to be a solid piece of legislation in its final form, one that has not been watered down by political gaming during the next phases of negotiation, Piegza added.
Sean Parker on Facebook: We created a monster:::::Sean Parker, who played a pivotal role in turning Facebook into a money-minting juggernaut, admits that he is now something of a conscientious objector to the social networking giant.Facebook literally changes your relationship with society, with each other, Parker told Axios in a Wednesday interview.God only knows what its doing to our childrens brains.The 38-year-old tech tycoon whose hardball exploits as Facebooks first president were depicted in Aaron Sorkins 2010 Hollywood flick The Social Network said Facebook is designed to exploit a vulnerability in human psychology to get its users addicted.The inventors, creators its me, its Mark [Zuckerberg], its Kevin Systrom on Instagram, its all of these people understood this consciously, he said.And we did it anyway.Parker, who is now founder and chair of the Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy, explained that Facebook uses likes and shares to create a social-validation feedback loop that keeps users coming back.We need to sort of give you a little dopamine hit every once in a while, because someone liked or commented on a photo or a post or whatever, Parker said.And thats going to get you to contribute more content, and thats going to get you more likes and comments.Parker said he never anticipated the consequences of what would happen when Facebook grew to have 2 billion monthly users.In its first few years, Parker said, people would tell him they didnt use social media, and he would assure them that they would join the fold sooner or later.The thought process that went into building these applications, Facebook being the first of them, was all about: How do we consume as much of your time and conscious attention as possible?he said.
Time Inc.’s online ads fail to offset print decline:::::Magazine publisher Time Incs revenue fell short of analysts forecasts for the third quarter, as an uptick in online advertising failed to offset a decline in print ads.The New York-based publisher of Time, Sports Illustrated and People magazines said on Thursday its total advertising revenue fell 11.5 percent to $369 million in the quarter ended Sept. 30, led by a 17.7 percent decline in print advertising revenue.Digital advertising revenue rose 2.3 percent to $132 million.The results come weeks after Time said it was looking to sell assets that represented about $488 million in revenue for the 12 months ended June 30 amid a prolonged decline in its mainstay print business.The assets include Time Inc UK and a majority stake in the Essence magazine.Times third-quarter revenue slipped 9.5 percent to $679 million, missing analysts estimates of $693.5 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Net income attributable to Time Inc was $13 million or 14 cents per share, compared to a net loss of $112 million or $1.13 per share a year ago.Excluding one-time items, Time earned 36 cents per share.Analysts on average had expected 29 cents.
Etienne Schneider: The space industry is now 2% of Luxembourg’s GDP:::::One of Europe's smallest countries now holds claim to being a giant in the space industry.Luxembourg, with a population less than the state of Vermont, now generates nearly 2 percent of its annual gross domestic product from the space industry, according to Deputy Prime Minister Etienne Schneider.The country's economy checked in just shy of $61 billion in 2016, according to the CIA World Factbook."We have grown from nothing to the most dynamic in Europe," Schneider told an audience Saturday, in a speech at the New Worlds conference in Austin, Texas.He added that the country's space program was first launched just over 30 years ago.Schneider, who also serves as Luxembourg's economic minister, told the conference that he is often questioned about why Luxembourg is so "keen on exploiting space resources."He replied by saying the same "liberal, extremely business friendly climate" that pushed the country's financial sector boom is now being reapplied to attracting space companies."I have more than 70 space companies in the pipeline," Schneider told CNBC after the speech.Luxembourg's "space resources initiative" is the country's plan to make the most out of a quickly growing global industry, the minister said."It's a series of measures to position Luxembourg as the European heart of exploration and use of space resources."He highlighted U.S. companies Deep Space Industries and Planetary Resources, as well as Japanese ispace as three key, rising players in Luxembourg.With a per capita GDP of $103,000, Schneider says the space industry has "strong public support."Space mining is Luxembourg's present focus, but it is not the country's first.In 1985, Luxembourg launched a public-private partnership with satellite builder SES.While Schneider said he believes the satellite business has not plateaued, he does not anticipate the space industry growing beyond the 2 percent GDP mark any time soon."It could be 5 percent, but that may be 10 or 15 years," Schneider said."Right now we have dozens of companies that are here but have yet to make money.We have startup incubators and investment funds are being established."The key then, to Schneider, is his nation's legal framework of ownership.The United States and Luxembourg are the only two countries in the world to have passed laws giving corporations ownership of materials mined in space, but only after they've been extracted."Allowing companies to have ownership of future materials gives venture capital firms incentive to come here and buy into these opportunities," Schneider added.
A political shock throws Lebanon’s economy back into crisis:::::"We don't know how things will escalate," said Rida Shayto, an associate director at the pharmaceutical manufacturer Algorithm, which does half its sales to the Gulf.The developments have stunned the Mediterranean country, which once looked to Saudi Arabia as a pillar to its own stability.The kingdom brokered the Taif agreement in 1989 that ushered in peace for Lebanon after 15 years of civil war.The kingdom has plowed decades of investment into Lebanon, opened markets to trade and allowed generations of talented and ambitious Lebanese to work in its oil-based economy.The concern now is that the kingdom and other Gulf nations will throw out Lebanese workers, as they did with Qatar this summer in a rage over that country's perceived closeness to Iran.Some 220,000 Lebanese work in Saudi Arabia and send back close to $2 billion in remittances each year, according to Mounir Rached, a senior economic adviser to the Finance Ministry.Lebanese are hoping Saudi Arabia will be too wary of the negative impact on its own economy from such a mass expulsion.Many Lebanese hold managerial positions, including in the kingdom's all-important oil sector, and it would take time to refill the posts.An expulsion would also undermine decades of Saudi efforts to cultivate ties with Lebanese Sunnis."I think those who are invested in Lebanon are not going to come and destroy everything that they did in terms of relationships and associations and credibility," said Kamel Wazni, an economist and sometimes adviser to Hariri's government.But the kingdom and its powerful Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman, who has made his name by dramatic or reckless, as his critics put it moves, can't be seen as doing nothing, said Randa Slim, a Lebanese analyst at the Washington-based Middle East Institute."They have locked themselves into an escalatory path without giving themselves an exit," she said.The kingdom could expel Lebanese Shiites and Christians, she said.Shiites are Hezbollah's constituency and some Christian parties have allied with it.They number 10,000 to 20,000 in Saudi Arabia, according to Rached, the Finance Ministry adviser.As it is, the biggest threat now is a retreat to the political paralysis that has crimped growth since 2011.Lebanon, once a beacon of free market growth and joie de vivre living, was paralyzed for years over how to respond to the catastrophic civil war consuming its neighbor and trade partner, Syria.Hariri's Future Movement, the largest party in Parliament, wanted Lebanon out of Syrian affairs, while Hezbollah was sending its militias there to fight on behalf of President Bashar Assad.The political log-jam resulted in Lebanon not having a president for more than two years and no economic vision to attract investment.Meanwhile, refugees poured into the country more than one million of them, equivalent to a quarter of Lebanon's population depressing wages in service and labor sectors.Hariri became premier under a deal that broke the deadlock and allowed the election of a Hezbollah-friendly president.The political breakthrough also brought an end to the stagnation in economic policy.The country passed its first budget since 2005, raising taxes and public salaries and opening up two oil and gas blocks off its coastline for drilling in a bid to bring in some sorely-needed investment.That project and a $21 billion investment plan to improve the country's woefully inadequate infrastructure are now on ice."The council of ministers will not be able to take a decision in the current conditions," said Nassib Ghobril, the chief economist at Lebanon's Byblos Bank, of the gas and oil bills.The government also needs to find revenues to service a public debt that has reached more than $75 billion 140 percent of the gross domestic product, a debt-to-GDP ratio that is among the highest in the world.A key factor for stability has been the strength of its currency, the pound, pegged at 1,500 pounds to the dollar since the 1990s.For now, at least, experts believe that seems safe.The Central Bank holds $43.5 billion in foreign currency reserves, enough to sustain the peg for one to two decades at the current pace of currency conversions.There has been a flurry of transactions from pound to dollar among Lebanese accounts, bankers have told The Associated Press.But as long as the dollars stay circulating in Lebanon's already largely dollarized economy, the peg will remain stable."I don't have any concern about the stability of the exchange rate," said Ghobril.
Likely FDA approval for postpartum depression drug pushes Sage Therapeutics stock up 40%:::::Shares of Cambridge, Mass.-based biopharmaceutical company Sage Therapeutics are popping after the company announced positive results in trials for a drug that may someday be available to treat those with postpartum depression.The company is up more than 40 percent to $96.75 this week following two Phase 3 trials evaluating brexanolone.The drug, formerly known as SAGE-547, achieved a significant reduction in depression symptoms after only 60 hours, a rapid reduction in treatment time compared to the options currently available to those suffering from the condition."We are on the cusp of a major discovery," CEO Jeff Jonas said Friday on CNBC's Power Lunch.Analysts from Canaccord Genuity said the probability of FDA approval following the trials increased to about 80 percent.Postpartum depression occurs in nearly 15 percent of births, according to the National Institute of Mental Health.It can include feelings of sadness and anxiety that can limit the ability of those suffering from the condition to take care of themselves or their families.Current treatment for the condition includes counseling and medication, including anti-depressants.Anti-depressants can take weeks to be effective.Brexanolone is administered intravenously.The company is also working on an oral treatment called SAGE-217.The analysts at Canaccord upped their price target for the company to $140.
Louis C.K. on sex misconduct accusations: 'These stories are true':::::On Friday, FX announced it was ending its association with C.K.The network canceled its deal with his production company, Pig Newton, and removed him as executive producer on four shows - Better Things, Baskets, One Mississippi and The Cops.He also will also no longer receive compensation for those shows.The distribution company behind C.K.'s latest film "I Love You, Daddy," set for release next week, pulled the plug on the project Friday morning.In addition, Netflix opted out of an upcoming comedy special featuring the comedian, and HBO dropped C.K.from its "Night of Too Many Stars" special.His full statement is below (Note contents of his statement contains graphic language): I want to address the stories told to the New York Times by five women named Abby, Rebecca, Dana, Julia who felt able to name themselves and one who did not.These stories are true.At the time, I said to myself that what I did was okay because I never showed a woman my dick without asking first, which is also true.But what I learned later in life, too late, is that when you have power over another person, asking them to look at your dick isn't a question.It's a predicament for them.The power I had over these women is that they admired me.And I wielded that power irresponsibly.I have been remorseful of my actions.And I've tried to learn from them.And run from them.Now I'm aware of the extent of the impact of my actions.I learned yesterday the extent to which I left these women who admired me feeling badly about themselves and cautious around other men who would never have put them in that position.I also took advantage of the fact that I was widely admired in my and their community, which disabled them from sharing their story and brought hardship to them when they tried because people who look up to me didn't want to hear it.I didn't think that I was doing any of that because my position allowed me not to think about it.There is nothing about this that I forgive myself for.And I have to reconcile it with who I am.Which is nothing compared to the task I left them with.I wish I had reacted to their admiration of me by being a good example to them as a man and given them some guidance as a comedian, including because I admired their work.The hardest regret to live with is what you've done to hurt someone else.And I can hardly wrap my head around the scope of hurt I brought on them.I'd be remiss to exclude the hurt that I've brought on people who I work with and have worked with who's professional and personal lives have been impacted by all of this, including projects currently in production: the cast and crew of Better Things, Baskets, The Cops, One Mississippi, and I Love You Daddy.I deeply regret that this has brought negative attention to my manager Dave Becky who only tried to mediate a situation that I caused.I've brought anguish and hardship to the people at FX who have given me so much The Orchard who took a chance on my movie.and every other entity that has bet on me through the years.I've brought pain to my family, my friends, my children and their mother.I have spent my long and lucky career talking and saying anything I want.I will now step back and take a long time to listen.Thank you for reading.
GE limps into investor day with shareholders demanding answers on dividend and turnaround plan:::::Not that long ago, General Electric was seen as the very model of corporate success, the American capitalist system in action under a sprawling umbrella of synergized interests.No more.As the company limps into its investor day presentation Monday, it has gone from a paradigm of success to a morass of excess.Where GE once was held as a beacon of how a multinational conglomerate is supposed to function, it now faces an uncertain future and a bevy of questions from investors and analysts.The crisis is not quite existential, but conditions are critical.Company executives must convince their constituency that there is a viable path forward."That will be up to GE," said Eric Ause, who covers GE for Fitch Ratings."How they do it will be up to GE's management team.They've got a new CEO and a new CFO, and they've been making some changes to the board.That will all play into their long-term decisions, what the mix of their business should be and how they get there."Investors have shown little confidence that even with the management shake-up, GE has a clear direction forward.The company has pledged to trim the parts of the operation that don't work, like GE Capital and the industrial solutions business, and focus on the future with core industrial businesses and GE Digital.The market, though, has been hard to please.GE shares have tumbled 37 percent in 2017 and are less than half where they stood when Jeffrey Immelt took over as CEO in September 2001.Immelt left the company in October, leaving behind a bevy of questions that likely will be addressed at Monday's event.The shares traded higher by more than 2 percent on Friday as it appeared the company had already begun taking some of the hard steps it will unveil Monday by reportedly cutting staff in its GE Digital division.
Pop-up shops still popular with retailers for the holidays:::::Pop-up shops are still popular among retailers, especially around the holidays.There is a "burst" of pop-ups expected to round out the year, an annual holiday survey from commercial real estate firm CBRE found.The holiday season offers companies a sliver of time to test new features, experiment where there is heavier foot traffic, or bring their online operations offline as companies such as Warby Parker, Bonobos and Allbirds have done.More importantly, "landlords have an appetite for pop-ups that they didn't have in the past," Melina Cordero, head of CBRE Americas' retail research division, told CNBC."Given customers are increasingly bored with the copy-paste mall model, [pop-ups] can be a pretty effective traffic driver."It's true more mall owners are opening up to the idea of putting pop-up spaces even permanent ones within their properties.Simon Property Group is opening "The Edit," which will rotate retailers throughout the year on short-term contracts.Washington Prime Group, another U.S. mall landlord, is finalizing plans to launch a pop-up marketplace called "Tangible" in its malls."A lot of times landlords themselves are actually investing in these projects," Cordero said."I think this is at the forefront of the holidays."Toys R Us has its holiday pop-up near Times Square this year.Yankee Candle is opening its first pop-up store in New York's SoHo neighborhood, through Jan. 3.Sharper Image, once a staple retailer in American malls, is also opening a temporary shop in New York for the holiday season.And these are just a few examples.Amazon is also bringing holiday pop-ups to some Whole Foods locations.CBRE's 2017 holiday survey found other trends this season to be: more shopping completed on mobile devices, off-price players winning with their discounts, and more warehouse space needed on a short-term basis to fulfill a surge in online orders.As a retailer, "you really need to be as efficient as possible," Cordero said.And around the holidays, no one company can risk not following consumer trends.In a separate holiday sentiment survey, real estate investment firm Jones Lang LaSalle is predicting a 6 percent increase in spending this season after speaking with more than 2,000 consumers."As we head into the holiday season, consumer confidence is the highest it's been in nearly 17 years," Greg Maloney, CEO of JLL Retail, said in a statement."We expect that holiday spending will mirror overall retail sales trends ... due to favorable economic conditions and the strength of the labor market."Nearly 40 percent of consumers surveyed will shop at more than six stores throughout the holidays, JLL found.And roughly two-thirds of shoppers indicated they will shop at superstores this year, while 44 percent said they plan to make purchases online.
Uber suffers another setback in the UK as a judge rules that drivers require workers' rights:::::Uber lost an appeal at a U.K. employment tribunal Friday when a judge ruled that its drivers should be classified as formal workers and not self-employed.The tribunal found that two drivers, Yaseen Aslam and James Farrar, were working for Uber and consequently entitled to a minimum wage and holiday pay, among other rights.Uber has long argued that its drivers are self-employed rather than workers employed directly by the firm.The tribunal's decision is not only a challenge for Uber's business in Britain, but for the so-called "gig economy" as a whole."For Uber's estimated 40,000 drivers in the U.K., this is another positive sign that their true employment status is that of a 'worker' and, as such, they should be entitled to worker rights," Alan Price, employment law director at Peninsula, said in a note Friday."The decision is also a further indication to 'gig economy' employers and companies with similar business models that they may need to reassess their treatment of their staff to ensure they are giving the correct rights."Another firm operating in the gig economy, online takeaway service Deliveroo, was faced with a legal challenge of its own from delivery drivers earlier this month.Deliveroo's riders are seeking to gain employment rights including the minimum wage.Uber has said it plans to appeal the ruling, either through Britain's Court of Appeal or through the Supreme Court, the nation's highest court for civil matters.In a statement, Tom Elvidge, acting general manager at Uber U.K., said: "Almost all taxi and private hire drivers have been self-employed for decades, long before our app existed.The main reason why drivers use Uber is because they value the freedom to choose if, when and where they drive and so we intend to appeal."The tribunal relies on the assertion that drivers are required to take 80 percent of trips sent to them when logged into the app.As drivers who use Uber know, this has never been the case in the U.K. "Over the last year we have made a number of changes to our app to give drivers even more control.We've also invested in things like access to illness and injury cover and we'll keep introducing changes to make driving with Uber even better."
News Corp. earnings Q1 2018:::::News Corp. blew past earnings expectations Thursday, as the company presses ahead with efforts to turn its print news publications, such as The Wall Street Journal, into digital-first operations.Here's how the company did compared to what Wall Street expected: EPS: 7 cents vs. 1 cent expected, according to Thomson Reuters Revenue: $2.06 billion vs. $1.97 billion expected, according to Thomson Reuters News Corp. shares initially jumped more than 2 percent in after-hours trading Thursday, before falling flat.In the year-ago quarter, News Corp. posted earnings per share a penny on $1.96 billion in revenue.News Corp. is the publishing arm of Rupert Murdoch's global media empire.Properties include financial publisher Dow Jones, book publisher HarperCollins and the New York Post.Through Dow Jones, New Corp. owns The Wall Street Journal, MarketWatch and Barron's.As the media landscape becomes increasingly digital, News Corp. has struggled to keep up advertising, circulation and subscription revenue in its news and information business, which includes its flagship property, The Wall Street Journal.In response, News Corp. has sought to shift the focus of its news publications away from print.The Wall Street Journal, for example, is in the midst of a major restructuring to become a digital-first operation.But as News Corp. has sought to make digital inroads, it has butted heads with the likes of Google, which plays a key role in whether or not content is visible through its search engine.News Corp. CEO Robert Thomson said Google's recent decision to end its "first click free" policy, in which news outlets had to offer three free articles daily in exchange for visibility in search engine results, would help support premium content behind paywalls at outlets like the Wall Street Journal.News Corp. has had some success in its digital push.Digital operations represented 27 percent of the information and news division's quarterly revenue, compared to 24 percent the year prior.The Wall Street Journal's total subscribers across its print and digital editions increased to 2.2 million, a 13.3-percent increase over the year prior.Digital subscribers at The Journal increased to 1,318,000, up from 967,000 in the year prior.Overall, revenue at the news and information division rose 2 percent to $1.2 billion compared to the year prior.Advertising revenue, however, remained a point of weakness.Print advertising revenue was flat, while digital advertising revenue saw only a modest increase.
Disney to price streaming service 'substantially below' Netflix, shares take another leg higher:::::The stock initially fell more than 3 percent in extended trade after the company reported year-over-year declines for most of its businesses.Media networks, the company's biggest segment, saw that figure decline 12 percent year over year.The company said it saw lower advertising revenue at Freeform, ESPN as well as its company-owned television stations.But longtime CEO Bob Iger reassured investors during the earnings call, saying he believes Disney will be able to tackle current headwinds in the media landscape.Here's what each segment reported in operating income compared to StreetAccount consensus estimates: Media networks: $1.48 billion, vs. $1.58 billion Parks and resorts: $746 million, vs. $735.1 million Studio: $218 million, vs. $364.4 million Consumer and interactive: $373 million, vs. $470.4 million The stock initially fell about 3 percent in after-hours trade, but later reversed to trade 1 percent higher.Longtime CEO Bob Iger said in a statement that Disney "will continue to invest for the future and take the smart risks required to deliver shareholder value."Earlier this week, CNBC reported that Disney approached 21st Century Fox about acquiring some of its entertainment assets, which would leave the latter with a news and sports-focused business.When asked about the talks in a Thursday earnings call, Disney said it wouldn't take questions on press speculation.Fox was similarly tight-lipped on the subject.In a Wednesday earnings call, Executive Chairman Lachlan Murdoch maintained that Fox has the necessary scale to grow and compete in a media landscape that's becoming increasingly digital.That is a challenge for both Disney and Fox as tech-savvy competitors like Netflix continue to post eye-popping revenue growth.On Thursday, Disney reported a 3 percent year-over-year decline in revenue.Here's how the company did compared with what Wall Street expected: EPS: $1.07 vs. $1.12 expected according to Thomson Reuters Revenue: $12.78 billion vs. $13.23 billion expected according to Thomson Reuters In the year-ago quarter, Disney reported adjusted earnings of $1.10 a share on $13.14 billion in revenue.The company has lately suffered a bruising media battle that ended with Disney backtracking on its decision to bar the Los Angeles Times from its movie screenings amid backlash from the news organizations and notable Hollywood figures.Disney had yanked the newspaper's access after it published a two-part investigation that detailed Disney's financial dealings with the city of Anaheim.Shares of Disney have edged about 0.7 percent lower, year to date.This is breaking news.Please check back for updates.CNBC's David Faber contributed reporting.
Former J.Crew CEO Drexler: Things have been 'miserable' in retail:::::"Things have been miserable in retail," Mickey Drexler, the former CEO and current chairman of J.Crew, said Thursday at the New York Times' DealBook conference."The last two or three years have not been fun whatsoever."Drexlerstepped down after 14 years with apparel company J.Crew, telling The Wall Street Journal at one point he didn't realize how quickly technology could impact his industry."Things were moving in this direction, but I don't think anyone was prepared," Drexler said Thursday about shopping moving online.Drexler was famed for his turnaround of Gap in the 1990s.When he arrived at J.Crew in 2003, he worked hard to do the same by introducing the idea of providing designer quality clothing for the masses.That strategy succeeded for a while.Recently, J.Crew is struggling to find its footing in a sea of apparel brands, each striving to win shoppers' dollars.Meantime, there are new entrants flooding the market, and many of them non-traditional e-commerce players.Companies like Stitch Fix, Rent the Runway and Untuckit run the majority of their operations online."Fast fashion has had huge growth," Drexler said about players, like Zara, in apparel retailing.He also called out up-and-coming brands Allbirds and Outdoor Voices for their recent successes.Notably, Drexler is chairman of Outdoor Voices, an athletic apparel company based in Austin, Texas.When asked about Wal-Mart's recent acquisition of men's clothing company Bonobos, Drexler said: "I don't understand it.[Wal-Mart] should have bought J.Crew."At one point, Drexler said his management team at J.Crew approached Amazon about a partnership, saying he has "enormous respect" for the internet giant.But those discussions never resulted in a concrete deal.In turn, Amazon is seen quietly creating its own private-label apparel brands, tackling the industry head-on."It's not to say that everybody is dying," Drexler said, adding that he doesn't think clothes are "that important" to retail anymore."Long term, we'll see who wins and loses."According to Drexler, monitoring changing consumer behavior is the most important thing an apparel retailer or mall owner can do."You can't just blame technology," he said.
Loeb's Third Point reportedly takes stake in major US mall owner:::::Another U.S. mall landlord could be facing activist pressure.Dan Loeb's hedge fund, Third Point, has reportedly built a position in retail real estate investment trust Macerich, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg.Macerich shares jumped more than 12 percent Thursday afternoon on the news.Representatives from Third Point and Macerich didn't immediately respond to CNBC's requests for comment.Third Point now owns nearly 5 percent of the California-based REIT and could push for a potential sale, among other changes, sources told Bloomberg.Macerich was last targeted by activist investors in 2015, when Jonathan Litt's Land & Buildings Investment Management and Orange Capital built a position in the company.At the time, Macerich had just rejected a near $17 billion takeover bid from REIT rival Simon Property Group.Macerich currently owns 54 million square feet of real estate, consisting primarily of interests in 48 regional shopping centers, according to its website.In 2017, the retail real estate industry has increasingly faced pressure from outsiders, as news of retail bankruptcies and store closures threatens the future health of their properties.More shoppers are ringing up purchases online, forcing mall owners to think outside the box when renovating vacated spaces."Despite recent, well-documented, bankruptcies of certain traditional retailers, few of which have come as much of a surprise, Macerich achieved solid re-leasing spreads and tenant sales growth," Chief Executive Arthur Coppola said when the company reported earnings last month.Just earlier this week, it was reported that another U.S. mall landlord, General Growth Properties, could be taken private by Brookfield Property Partners.GGP shares surged on the news.In regard to Loeb's investment strategy , Third Point materials describe its philosophy as "event-driven, value-oriented," with an "emphasis on special situation equities."The firm "seeks to identify situations where we anticipate a catalyst will unlock value."Third Point had $18 billion of assets under management as of late June.According to Bloomberg, it's still unclear if there have been talks between the activist investor and Macerich.Even with Thursday's gains, Macerich's stock has lost a little more than 10 percent in 2017.CNBC's Tae Kim contributed to this report.
Few Remington rifles have been fixed three years after settlement:::::Photo courtesy of Heather Ogg."There was no question in my mind.I mean, his dad would never do anything to harm him intentionally," Ogg said.Only afterward, while planning the boy's funeral, did the family begin learning about alleged issues surrounding Remington rifles and about the class-action settlement.As owners of one of the oldest models in question, the settlement would have entitled them to a product voucher worth only $10 plus the gun safety DVD.But Ogg says the mere possibility of a problem would have raised a red flag with the boy's father."I know for a fact he would not have taken that gun hunting.He would not have used that gun unless it had been fixed because he was so 'gun safety.'If there was a problem with the gun, he would not have taken it out there risking someone's life," she said.Spreading the word With the class action settlement on hold, Remington critics are trying to alert the public about what they see as a life or death situation.Richard Barber of Montana, whose own son was killed in a hunting accident in 2000, has launched a Facebook page featuring some of the Remington internal documents he uncovered in his long search for answers.Nonetheless, he says he feels a sense of "impending doom" as hunting season begins, knowing that other families are likely to suffer the same fate."As sure as the sun is going to come up tomorrow, people are going to be maimed or killed this year," he said.Barber initially worked as a paid consultant to the plaintiffs' attorneys in the class-action case but says he resigned after it became clear that neither side was interested in getting the truth out.He eventually became an outspoken critic of the settlement, which he calls a "sham," although he is not involved in the appeal.Barber blames the legal system for the settlement being in limbo."The courts seem to be satisfied if money changes hands," he said, rather than finding the truth and punishing the guilty.Barber also blames plaintiffs' attorneys, who stand to collect $12.5 million in fees once the settlement is finalized."The people who are thumping their chest about this settlement had a vested financial interest in this case," he said.One of those attorneys, Lanier, is urging hunters to pay heed regardless of the settlement."This is a safety hazard still, and all hunters should be aware," he said."I would not use a Remington 700 without having it retrofitted."
DOJ announces distribution of more than $770 million to Bernie Madoff victims:::::DOJ announces distribution of more than $770 million to Bernie Madoff victims 5:28 PM ET Thu, 9 Nov 2017 | 00:54 Bernie Madoff's victims will start to see some monetary relief soon.The Department of Justice announced Thursday that an initial distribution had begun to more than 24,000 victims of Madoff's Ponzi scheme, called the largest Ponzi scheme in history."We have recovered billions of dollars from third parties not Mr. Madoff and are now returning that money to tens of thousands of victims," Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein said in a statement.Rosenstein called the distribution the largest restoration of property ever.The initial distribution includes $772.5 million, only a fraction of the more than $4 billion in assets that were recovered for the victims in total, according to a press release issued today.Madoff used his position as the chairman of Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities to swindle billions of dollars from tens of thousands of people over the course of more than four decades between the early 1970s and his 2008 arrest.On March 12, 2009, Madoff pled guilty to 11 federal felonies and was sentenced to 150 years in prison.He was also ordered to forfeit $170,799,000,000.Of the $4 billion that will be distributed to victims of the scheme, more than half came from the estate of Jeffry Picower, a Madoff investor who reportedly profited more than Madoff from the Ponzi scheme and was later sued by Madoff investors.Another $1.7 billion was collected as part of an agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, according to the Justice Department's release.The bank was fined under the Bank Secrecy Act, which requires banks to notify law enforcement of suspicious activity.
Mnuchin says Donald Trump will see tax increase under tax plan:::::Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Thursday said President Donald Trump will see a tax increase under the proposed Republican tax plan."He will have a tax increase," Mnuchin said."For people who make over $1 million in the high tax states, there will be a tax increase."Mnuchin was speaking at The Economic Club of New York ahead of the unveiling of the Senate GOP tax plan expected later Thursday.Initial analyses of the tax plan suggest that Trump will see his federal tax rate decline if the Republican tax proposal is passed.His total tax rate, however, including state and local taxes, could increase, just as Mnuchin said.Trump, like others making $1 million a year in taxable income, will benefit from a reduced federal tax rate, according to an analysis by the Joint Committee on Taxation.That analysis showed that the average millionaire will go from a tax rate of 32.5 percent to 29.9 percent.The numbers could change as the House is revising the bill in committee.Despite the likely decrease in his federal tax rate, taxpayers such as Trump who live in high-tax states and localities will be hit hardest by the House GOP's proposed end to state and local deductions for itemized filers.The state and local tax deduction, or SALT deduction, is effectively a subsidy from the federal government to state and local governments.It's generally used by higher-income taxpayers and is disproportionately used by taxpayers in states with high state and local taxes.In Washington, D.C., the average SALT deduction in 2014 was $15,500, according to the Tax Policy Center.For his part, Trump said Tuesday that he called his personal accountant to check how he would be affected, according to The Washington Post.According to the Post, the president told senators Tuesday that he would be a "big loser" under the plan.
Amazon to bring pop-up shops to Whole Foods stores for the holidays:::::Amazon to bring pop-up shops to Whole Foods stores for the holidays 1:16 PM ET Thu, 9 Nov 2017 | 00:49 Whole Foods stores are about to get cozier with Amazon.A handful of Amazon-branded pop-up stores will be rolling out at select Whole Foods locations for the holidays.The Amazon-staffed centers will launch in mid-November, at stores in Illinois, Michigan, Florida, California and Colorado, according to Whole Foods.There, shoppers will be able to try Amazon devices before they buy them, also learning about Amazon services and Prime memberships.The grocery chain announced Thursday that currently more than 100 Whole Foods stores carry Amazon devices, such as the Echo, Echo Dot, Fire TV, Kindle e-readers and Fire tablets.Gearing up for the holiday season, Whole Foods is also rolling out Black Friday deals on Amazon's merchandise, starting the week leading up to Thanksgiving.Those deals include $20 off the Echo Dot, $20 off the new Amazon Echo, $30 off the new Echo Plus and $30 off Fire HD 8 tablet.Amazon completed its acquisition of Whole Foods in August, immediately slashing prices on a variety of products across the grocer's stores.Thursday's announcement validates that the internet giant will continue to leverage Whole Foods' stores to its advantage.Amazon has promised "more to come," as the company begins to integrate its Prime program into the Whole Foods ecosystem.Eventually, Prime members will receive "special savings and in-store benefits," Amazon said in August.Whole Foods stores have also been outfitted with Amazon lockers, where customers can pick up online orders, and Whole Foods stores can process Amazon returns.

How Deutsche Bank’s high-stakes gamble went wrong:::::It was the Friday before Christmas and Edson Mitchell, boss of Deutsche Bank's London-based investment bank, was rushing home to see his family in Maine.By 5pm he was on the home stretch: his private plane had left Portland.By 5.15pm it was within sight of his destination, Rangeley airport.A minute later, in a swirl of cloud and snow, the aircraft slammed into nearby Beaver Mountain, killing Mitchell and the plane's pilot.That was 17 years ago.What was a personal tragedy for Mitchell's family, friends and colleagues would also mark a moment of upheaval for the bank he had transformed.To some fatalistic observers, the crash and its accompanying heartache presaged the troubles that Deutsche Bank itself has suffered in recent times.Mitchell had been a brilliant trader and an inspirational manager who, in five years, helped remodel a sleepy German lender into a Wall Street dynamo.As a fast-living chain-smoker who would bet on anything from golf to gold, he also embodied Deutsche's big-stakes gamble on global markets.In the world of roulette-wheel investment banking, Deutsche was the highest roller of all.And for a long while the punts paid off.More from the Financial Times: Deutsche Bank: more pain than gain under Jain Deutsche Bank gets all clear from German watchdog over triple probes Anshu Jain's ascent was easier than time at top in Deutsche Bank But for the past few years, despite emerging as an apparent winner from the 2008 financial crisis, Germany's biggest bank has appeared locked in a downward spiral.Last autumn, the stock market's alarm about the bank's finances was so severe that investors and even government officials discussed the possibility of a bailout.A recent note on the bank from analysts at Autonomous Research was titled "Beyond Repair"."It's obvious something has to be changed," says one of the bank's biggest shareholders."They [Deutsche's management] don't understand the sense of urgency."Chief executive John Cryan a bluff Brit who is the antithesis of Edson Mitchell is resolute."I will carry on at least until my contract ends [in 2020]," he told the Financial Times."At the moment the job is getting more fun every day.The heavy lifting is almost over."Yet existential questions remain.What should Deutsche's future role be?Will the leading financier of Europe's biggest economy retreat to its more modest roots?Is Cryan part of the solution or part of the problem?Deutsche Bank's journey from a low-profit group focused on German clients and owned by German shareholders, to the epitome of global capitalism in the heady days before the financial crisis is an extreme version of a path followed by many banks around the world.Its fate will hold lessons for lenders, governments and regulators as the banking industry continues its post-crisis evolution.Back in 1995, Deutsche was a staid domestic lender led by Hilmar Kopper, a Prussian farmer's son.Wall Street names such as JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch were expanding aggressively, thanks to booming markets, the rapid growth of financial derivatives and the advent of electronic trading.A wave of deregulation led them to Europe en masse.Deutsche was being left behind and Kopper was losing patience with the bank's conservative ways.He felt humiliated in late 1994 when the German government picked Goldman Sachs, not Deutsche, to lead the global process of selling Deutsche Telekom Europe's biggest-ever privatisation.By the following summer he had hired Mitchell a brash but brilliant banker from Merrill Lynch to begin the process of turning Deutsche from prosaic corporate lender into one of Wall Street's own.For years, the strategy worked like a dream.Deutsche steadily sold off a DM24bn portfolio of corporate shareholdings, relics of its postwar role as a pillar of West Germany's reconstruction effort.The proceeds were used to supercharge its investment bank: first, by integrating Morgan Grenfell, a tired London merchant bank acquired in 1989; then by hiring from rivals such as Merrill Lynch; and finally, by purchasing the troubled US group Bankers Trust in 1999.Josef Ackermann, an ex-Credit Suisse banker, oversaw Deutsche's investment bank before becoming head of the whole group in 2002 and leading it for the next decade.He remains proud of his achievements: "We seized the growth opportunities and within a few years built a top-three global investment bank."At its peak in the middle of 2007, Deutsche claimed the title of the world's biggest bank, amassing total assets of close to 2tn.Many of the world's finance houses had been growing at unprecedented rates, but Deutsche's expansion was faster and more furious.By June that year it was increasing staff numbers at an annualised rate of 20 per cent and assets by nearly 50 per cent.Net profit was up by an annualised 60 per cent.Deutsche's investment bank had all its chips on the table.The financial crisis that took hold in the second half of 2007 and accelerated through 2008 left no global bank untouched.It was an undeniably painful period for Deutsche, with a 5.7bn pre-tax loss in 2008.But compared with some rivals, the German lender was able to shrug off the crisis.Ackermann's statesmanlike leadership helped, as did the foresight of trader Greg Lippmann, who bet so successfully against subprime mortgages that he became the protagonist of the Michael Lewis book The Big Short, inspiring the Ryan Gosling character, Jared Venett, in the hit movie of the same name.Other executives sold subprime exposures to rivals and bought insurance against default.And the US government's rescue of AIG, one of those insurance providers, was worth an estimated $4bn to Deutsche.But chutzpah, judgment and luck can only take you so far.What has puzzled many who admired the bank's handling of 2008 was just how badly the past few years have panned out.As peers have prospered, Deutsche's fortunes have cratered.Its shares have halved over the past five years, just as those of some US rivals have doubled in value.Eric Ben-Artzi, an ambitious young mathematician who moved to the bank from Goldman Sachs in 2010, has an inkling why."When I joined Deutsche," he recalls, "I thought I was joining a winner, backed by a German notion of disciplined organisation."That impression didn't last."Within months I was disillusioned," he says.He ended up as a whistleblower, informing regulators about the way Deutsche valued and risk-assessed a vast portfolio of arcane derivative securities $130bn of so-called leveraged super-senior swaps."They were doing some interesting academic stuff in terms of risk modelling," Ben-Artzi recalls."But it was like a faade.The methodology that was actually implemented came out of thin air."In 2015 the affair landed Deutsche with a $55m fine for false accounting."I blew the whistle because I gradually came to realise that this bank was only semi-legal," says Ben-Artzi, who now works for a fintech start-up in Israel."It was partly fear and partly a moral conscience.This was [one of] the biggest banks in the world and I didn't want to be part of it."What the Financial Times has discovered through dozens of interviews with current and former Deutsche Bank employees, investors and rivals, is that Ben-Artzi's revelations reflect a broader truth about deep-rooted problems within the bank's systems and corporate culture: issues that can be traced back to the aggressive beginnings of Deutsche's investment banking expansion, first under Edson Mitchell and then through the era of Ackermann and his successor Anshu Jain.At college in 1970s Maine, Mitchell made a name for himself as a short but effective basketball player.When he opted for a career in banking, he took his competitive approach to sports into the trading room, and rose steadily through the ranks at Merrill Lynch.By 1995 Deutsche Bank had poached him to lead the buildout of the group's still lacklustre trading operations in London.At the time, Deutsche's investment bank was an amalgamation of a half-decent bonds business, plus a hotchpotch of operations inherited from Morgan Grenfell, the seed for Deutsche's investment banking push sown by Kopper's predecessor, Alfred Herrhausen.In 1998, under pressure from Mitchell, Deutsche launched another bold move."We had an off-site outside Rome that year," remembers one senior manager."And the message from Edson and his allies was clear: 'If you don't get stronger in the US, we will leave [the firm].'"Within months, Deutsche had snapped up Bankers Trust, fresh from a corporate fraud scandal in which senior executives at the US group had shifted dormant customer money into the bank's own coffers.Older hands on the board were concerned about the drift from Germany and the influence of unhealthy Anglo-American ways but Deutsche's globalising investment bankers prevailed.Many who worked with Mitchell praised his technical abilities and ambition."Mitchell was talented and aggressive," says one former board member.Most of all, he enthused people.When he left Merrill for Deutsche, 50 colleagues followed.Rajeev Misra, who used to run Deutsche's credit, commodities and emerging markets units and now heads SoftBank's $100bn Vision Fund, was one of his disciples."Five minutes with Edson and you'd walk out passionate about building a global bank.He had such optimism the glass was always half full."But Mitchell's appetite for risk was prodigious."He had Wild West attitudes," remembers one senior executive from that era."[We] really had to manage him closely.If Edson had lived and become CEO maybe Deutsche would have blown up in more dramatic fashion in the crisis."Mitchell was only at Deutsche Bank for five short years but he left a long-term legacy.Deutsche's investment bank became aggressive, Anglo-American, bonus-hungry and so bent on growth that regulatory relations were pushed to the limit and integrity was sacrificed.As at other banks at the time, some executives' personal behaviour became increasingly excessive, if not out of control.There was Mitchell's own unconventional lifestyle a live-in mistress at his lavish London villa, the family back home in Maine.Other managers engaged in petty corruption for personal gain, two bankers familiar with the period told the FT, including owning companies such as a limousine operator, to which they outsourced Deutsche service contracts.Sexism was rife a busload of escort girls were once invited to a Christmas party and serviced male staff in a VIP suite.Cocaine habits were commonplace.After Mitchell's death, his protg Anshu Jain, a fiercely bright pioneer of derivatives trading, was elevated to run the markets business, then the investment bank and, eventually, the whole of Deutsche.Born into the ancient Jain religion, the banker a vegetarian and a refined family man looked like a sharp contrast to his former boss.What united them was a fascination with the complexities of finance and a reverence for the sums of money it allowed banks and bankers to earn.At his peak, Jain was among the best-paid financiers in the world, earning up to $30m a year, according to colleagues.As Deutsche sought to lure staff from rivals, it became known for its generous pay deals, with top traders routinely earning $10m-$20m.Many who joined Deutsche Bank in the 1980s, 1990s and early 2000s speak of it as an "inspirational" place to work.Creativity was encouraged, results were rewarded and ambition and risk appetite seemed limitless.But there was a downside."Deutsche always hired mercenaries into the investment bank," recalls one former senior executive."They didn't care about ethics."Internal competition for the same client business was encouraged on a "may the best man win" basis that could lead to toxic dynamics."It was a mishmash of cultures," recalls one former executive.Behind that lay the bank's rapid growth, the acquisition of two brokerage firms besmirched by ethical scandal and the mass import of teams of bankers from various rivals.Bosses in Frankfurt were so blinded by the success of the unit that they invested in little else.But they also failed to control it with an effective compliance function or responsive information systems.The result was great success in the boom years and deep problems ever since.It has given the current chief executive a mammoth turnround task.John Cryan is the third non-German investment banker in a row to take Deutsche's helm.But the dry-witted northerner who took over in July 2015 is as different from his predecessors as you can imagine.He is plain-speaking, cultured (with a passion for classical music) and geeky (he talks knowledgeably about Deutsche's computer code and, says a friend, once helped builders rewire his London home).Where the old Deutsche Bank stood for big bets on the markets and big bonuses to match, Cryan has stripped back high-risk business and slashed bonuses.Soon after his appointment, he said: "I have no idea why I was offered a contract with a bonus in it because I promise you I will not work any harder or any less hard in any year, in any day because someone is going to pay me more or less."Last year, Deutsche took the unprecedented decision to axe virtually all bonuses due to poor results.(There were "retention payments" for 5,522 "mission-critical people".)"It was probably one of the most difficult decisions we took," says one board member.The lender's previous bonus culture was hardly unique among peers.But its mismatch with performance was acute.Over the 1995-2016 period, shareholders earned a net 17bn from owning Deutsche, once dividends, share buybacks and increased stock market value are offset by capital increases.That is dwarfed by the 71bn paid in bonuses over the same time period.One top investment banker from Deutsche's mid-1990s build-up phase, confronted with that statistic, appears uncharacteristically humbled."Would the bank have been better off without hiring any of us?"he asks with a look to the middle distance.For some staff, Cryan's abstemious rhetoric rings hollow his wife is a member of the billionaire Dupont dynasty.His core integrity, though, is hard to doubt.Former colleagues remember that during his work as an adviser to ABN Amro in 2007, the then UBS deals banker informally told Royal Bank of Scotland, ABN's ultimate acquirer, that it should think twice about pursuing the 72bn acquisition.It was a deal that ended up destroying the now largely state-owned RBS."He's very honourable," says a friend and former colleague."He's certainly not afraid to tell someone to abandon a plan even if it loses him business."Cryan's attempts at reform sometimes verge on the sanctimonious.His refusal to meet Deutsche's new leading shareholder controversial Chinese conglomerate HNA caused some friction with Paul Achleitner, the bank's supervisory board chairman.But Achleitner, who ousted Jain to make way for Cryan, is unfazed."John has the intellect, the dry sense of humour and the ability to call a spade a spade," says the chairman."That's extremely healthy.He's brought people down to earth from too much hype.Are bankers demotivated by that?They need to wake up and smell the coffee.He's genuine and that's a huge attribute in today's world."Cryan has begun to change Deutsche's substance as well as its style.Cutting costs has become one of the biggest priorities, echoing his work at UBS when as finance director up to 2011 he oversaw a near-40 per cent reduction in overheads.Deutsche's bloated cost base accumulated with little thought in the boom years is still stubbornly high today.At the last count, it absorbed more than 80 per cent of revenues, double the tally of some banks.Breakneck growth in the boom years left the group with what several insiders have called "spaghetti infrastructure".At its peak, the bank used 6,300 risk models and 108 trading systems.Cryan is convinced the scope for savings is bigger than at UBS."Here the cost-cutting is more straightforward because it's an avoidance of duplication," he says."We employ 97,000 people.Most big peers have more like half that number."
There were more than 26,000 new blockchain projects last year – only 8% are still active:::::Just 8% of open-source blockchain projects are still active 6:29 PM ET Thu, 9 Nov 2017 | 00:35 It is one of the fastest growing technologies around, but the majority of blockchain projects are abandoned within months, according to researchers.More than 26,000 open-source blockchain projects were created on the software collaboration platform GitHub in 2016, research by auditing giant Deloitte has revealed.But despite the overwhelming amount of interest in the technology, just 8 percent of these projects remain actively maintained."The stark reality of open-source projects is that most are abandoned or do not achieve meaningful scale," Deloitte researchers said."Unfortunately, blockchain is not immune to this reality."They added: "Note that about 90 percent of projects developed on GitHub become idle, and the average life span of a project is about one year, with the highest mortality rate occurring within the first six months."Blockchain is a form of distributed ledger technology that allows vast amounts of data to be stored across a network of computers rather than in one localized server.A number of large firms have expressed increasing interest in the technology as of late, particularly among those in the financial services.In October, IBM developed a new blockchain-based payment platform to speed up cross-border payments.A number of international banks collaborated on the project, including BBVA, Bank Danamon and National Australia Bank.Later that month, Hong Kong and Singapore's central banks agreed to work together on a cross-border trade finance network based on blockchain technology.
Macy's CEO: 'We are where we need to be' heading into the holidays:::::Macy's delivered a mixed bag of results on Thursday, but the department store chain reaffirmed its full-year outlook as it heads into the all-important holiday shopping season."When you think about the amount of sales and profit in the fourth quarter ...I think we are where we need to be," Chief Executive Jeff Gennette told CNBC."The fourth quarter is where we really shine."Though its same-store sales continue to fall, the Ohio-based department store chain is trying to turn things around, with efforts focused on expanding Macy's off-price nameplate Macy's Backstage and revamping the retailer's loyalty program.The refreshed loyalty program, Star Rewards, launched Oct. 2.Macy's is hoping the offering will draw more shoppers through its doors.Thus far, feedback on Star Rewards is "overwhelmingly positive," Gennette said."Shoppers love free shipping and no exclusions on Star Rewards ... [and] we believe that will build in the fourth quarter."Macy's store traffic was "softer" in August, Gennette said, but improved by October, "which is good, walking into the fourth quarter."A warmer-than-usual fall has hurt a slew of retailers this season, including Kohl's, with shoppers ringing up fewer coat purchases."When I think about the fourth quarter, we need [the] right products at the right values, and convenience for shoppers," Gennette said."We are better this year than last year, particularly with fulfillment."The holiday season, for Macy's, really kicks off with its annual Thanksgiving Day parade.The retailer could use a strong finish to the year.Macy's shares are down more than 50 percent in 2017.
Alibaba's Singles Day lures more global brands:::::For Alibaba, the future is retail.And a lot of it.This Saturday, the Chinese e-commerce giant will hold its annual Singles Day event, which last year grossed a whopping $17.8 billion in sales, up from $14.3 billion in 2015.To put those sales figures into perspective, Singles Day has surpassed the transaction volume for America's Black Friday and Cyber Monday events combined, according to Fung Global Retail & Technology.The day also far outpaces Amazon's Prime Day, which is the most equivalent 24-hour, online shopping experience in the U.S. Held every Nov. 11, Alibaba's Singles Day started as a day for those individuals not in romantic relationships to celebrate themselves by shopping online.The 24-hour phenomenon has quickly become the world's largest shopping day of the year.In 2017, Singles Day is expected to break more records, as more than 60,000 global brands are set to participate.Names like Lululemon, Adidas, Bose, Gap, Mac Cosmetics, Nike, Procter & Gamble, Macy's and Zara all have a presence on Alibaba's Tmall platform, which continues to grow.Tmall is essentially Alibaba's online version of a shopping mall.Alibaba is also in the midst of constructing its first physical mall, right next to its corporate headquarters in eastern China.This year, apparel is the most sought-after Singles Day category, followed by household supplies and footwear, according to a survey by Fung Global.And just like shoppers get a jump-start on some Black Friday bargains in the U.S., roughly two-thirds of Fung Global's survey respondents indicate they will start shopping for Singles Day prior to Nov. 11."The extension of the Singles' Day event is similar to what has been happening in the US, where the influence of one-day shopping holidays is diminishing as retailers adopt a season-long approach to marketing and promotions," FGRT Managing Director Deborah Weinswig wrote.Although, Weinswig added: "While Western shopping holidays such as Prime Day and Black Friday tend to focus on discounts, Alibaba takes an entertainment-centric approach to its 11.11 festival marketing and promotions in order to engage Chinese consumers."Alibaba, founded by Jack Ma, has benefited in large part due to China's growing internet population and its underdeveloped brick-and-mortar retail composition.Many of the stores in rural areas throughout the country, for example, aren't big-name brands, but mom-and-pop shops.And Alibaba wants to change that.On Singles Day this year, Alibaba will incorporate physical retailers into the event especially in the days leading up to Nov. 11.The e-commerce giant has collaborated with roughly 50 shopping malls in China to set up pop-up shops, which will span 12 cities.Estee Lauder's makeup brand Mac, for example, has partnered with Alibaba to open a temporary storefront where customers can experience an augmented reality lipstick trial.There, Mac will also be promoting its deals for Singles Day, encouraging shoppers to visit Tmall.com on Saturday.In total, Alibaba's 2017 Singles Day is promising 15 million product listings from more than 140,000 different brands.Also leading up to Saturday, Alibaba held a "See Now, Buy Now" fashion show on Halloween, where audience members could shop models' looks immediately from Tmall and other Alibaba-affiliated platforms."The value and reach of a customer-engaging fashion show like 'See Now, Buy Now' is far greater for brands than just placing their products at a traditional brick-and-mortar store," Alibaba chief marketing officer Chris Tung said about the event.During the show, Adidas used 3-D technology to flash images onto models, while watch manufacturer Tag Hauer outfitted dancers in glow-in-the-dark costumes.Gap was another global participant, making its second appearance at "See Now, Buy Now."On Friday night, Alibaba will hold its famous countdown celebration, which will feature singer Pharrell Williams.Last year's gala drew celebrity attendees such as Kobe Bryant and David Beckham.
European politicians ‘need to be courageous’ to catch up with China on tech, investor says:::::Politicians in Europe need to make courageous steps on policy and regulation to push the continent's tech industry closer to that of China's, a venture capitalist said Thursday.Klaus Hommels, founder and CEO of Lakestar, said that China's tech giants have benefited from a regulatory environment in a way that Europe's have not."I think we need to be a little bit more courageous," Hommels told CNBC at the Web Summit conference in Lisbon, Portugal.Hommels highlighted that China has implemented a number of policies to enhance innovation.For instance, one policy known as the Made in China 2025 plan seeks to boost the country's high-tech industries.Another, called the Robotics Industry Development Plan, is a five-year program that focuses in on the robotics and artificial intelligence (AI) sector.The investor said that the economic behemoth has managed to take its tech companies to a point where they could compete with "everybody else.""Some call it protectionism, others call it active industry policy," he said."This is something we could easily do but we need to be courageous on the political side and that is not always the currency that politicians play with."China is host to a number of internet giants.Alibaba, Tencent and Baidu have all made significant headway both in China and, increasingly, around the world.Tencent, for instance, bought a 10 percent stake in U.S. social media firm Snap on Wednesday, a move that boosted shareholder confidence in Snap after disappointment over earnings.
Sage Therapeutics shares soar after postpartum depression drug meets main goal:::::Sage Therapeutics said Thursday its drug to treat moderate and severe postpartum depression met the main goal in two late-stage studies.The stock soared as much as 50 percent in premarket on Thursday.The drug, brexanolone, achieved lower rates of depression in patients compared with a placebo in both trials.Postpartum depression is a common complication of childbirth that affects about 10 to 20 percent of women giving birth in the United States, the company said.CNBC's Berkeley Lovelace Jr. contributed to this report.
Kohl's earnings miss estimates, sending the retailer's shares lower:::::Kohl's on Thursday posted a lower-than-expected quarterly profit, hampered by higher costs and several devastating hurricanes.The middle of the latest quarter was "soft" due to abnormal weather conditions, Kohl's said.Merchandising expenses also increased.Kohl's shares were falling around 1 percent Thursday afternoon on the news.Net income dropped to $117 million, or 70 cents per share, in the fiscal third quarter, compared with $146 million, or 83 cents a share, one year ago.Analysts were expecting Kohl's to earn 72 cents per share, adjusted, according to a Thomson Reuters survey.Kohl's quarterly sales were $4.33 billion, slightly higher than a year ago and outpacing analysts' estimate of $4.30 billion.While the Wisconsin-based chain saw "strong results" during the back-to-school shopping season, helped by sales of kids clothing, footwear and active wear, September sales were "weak."But Kohl's is hopeful still ahead of the holidays."Both apparel and footwear categories in active were strong, and this was driven by large increases in both Nike and Adidas as well as continued strong performance from Under Armour," Chief Executive Kevin Mansell said on a call with analysts and investors."We continue to gain market share in active, we expect a very strong holiday performance in both active apparel and footwear categories," he added.On Thursday, Kohl's raised its earnings outlook for fiscal 2017 after reporting a surprise increase in same-store sales."We are pleased to report an increase in comp sales for the quarter as the traffic momentum we saw in the first half of the year continued," Chief Executive Kevin Mansell said in a statement."The quarter closed with strong sales in the second half of October."Kohl's quarterly same-store sales climbed 0.1 percent, while analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters were expecting a decline of 0.7 percent.This marks Kohl's first increase in the closely watched sales comps in seven quarters."While a comparable sales rise of 0.1% may be meager, the fact that it brings to an end an extended period of decline is significant," GlobalData Retail Managing Director Neil Saunders wrote in a note to clients."This new-found sales stability comes largely from Kohl's efforts to increase customer traffic at its stores, something it has achieved by improving the mix of products," Saunders added."The decision to focus on health and wellness, for example, has paid dividends, with brands like Under Armour proving to be a popular addition among both existing and new customers."Looking to the full year, Kohl's projected adjusted earnings to range from $3.60 and $3.80 a share versus a prior expected range of $3.50 to $3.80.The retailer has been looking for ways to lure shoppers back to its locations, having recently landed a deal with internet giant Amazon to sell some of its tech gadgets and accept Amazon returns in a handful of stores.On Thursday, Mansell said about the Amazon partnership: "The objective from our perspective is very simple and very straightforward.We believe both of these tests have the potential to drive incremental traffic to our stores, which as you know is our number one priority."As of Wednesday's market close, Kohl's stock has lost a little more than 17 percent in 2017.
Snapchat is reportedly getting a completely new look next month:::::Snapchat's biggest design shakeup since its launch is scheduled to take place in December, according to a report by Business Insider.The redesign would make the popular social media app "easier to use," according to Evan Spiegel, the CEO of parent company Snap Inc.Although Spiegel didn't indicate a timeline for when the new look would kick in, employees were reportedly notified that the overhaul would debut on December 4.Spiegel hinted that Snapchat could take on a more Facebook-like feed system, although a source told Business Insider that the new design would "still open to the camera."Wall Street has been unimpressed with Snapchat's parent company this week, after the firm reported worse-than-expected third-quarter results on Tuesday.Read the full report on Business Insider.Disclosure: CNBC parent NBCUniversal is an investor in Snap.
There are a bunch of signs that China's banks will grow even stronger:::::Things aren't so bad for the Chinese banks right now: The frequently maligned companies have seen their shares soaring and their businesses improving.But things may actually get even better.That is, several financial metrics are now pointing to the prospects of higher banking profits following a nationwide clampdown on swelling debt and investors are paying attention.Shares of the country's big four banks have rallied for most of this year on anticipated improvements in their debt holdings and margins.The largest bank, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, was the top performer after its Hong Kong-listed shares surged by more than 30 percent in the first 10 months of the year.The other three major banks, China Construction Bank, Agricultural Bank of China and Bank of China, also fared well with jumps of between 9 percent and 18 percent.Yet, their shares are still trading at a discount compared to many of their peers in the U.S., Europe and Japan, analysts said, adding that brighter prospects ahead mean Chinese banks could still trend higher making them an attractive investment.
Commerzbank swings to net profit in third quarter despite weak markets:::::Commerzbank swung to a net profit in the third quarter despite weak markets as the German lender focuses on a major overhaul.The 472 million euro ($547.7 million) net profit at Germany's second-largest lender after Deutsche Bank was broadly in line with analysts' expectations for a profit of 477 million euros, according to a Reuters poll of banks and brokerages.The profit, which compares with a loss of 637 million euros in the second quarter and 288 million euros a year ago, comes as the bank goes through a major restructuring to increase profitability.It is reducing its staff to 36,000 by 2020 from 43,000 at the end of 2015.
Wal-Mart holds holiday hours steady, with heavy focus online:::::Wal-Mart isn't making any big changes to its Black Friday store hours this year, as some other retailers have, and you won't need a wristband to snag the biggest deals.In line with last year, the big-box retailer's website on turkey day will kick off its online Black Friday sale at 12:01 a.m.ET.That's hours before its in-store doorbuster deals begin at 6 p.m. Thanksgiving evening.Wal-Mart stores will remain open all day Friday.Select deals will also go live on Walmart.com this Thursday.Those deals, available until Nov. 12, include an Acer Aspire ES Laptop for $449, a Sky Rider Falcon 2 Pro Drone for $29.97, and a Kingsford 32-inch charcoal grill for $99.This marks the third year Wal-Mart has offered a majority of its Black Friday promotions online, as consumers are increasingly dividing their budgets between stores and the web.Last year's Adobe Digital Index Report showed consumers spent $91.7 billion online in the U.S. alone, an 11 percent jump from the year before.This year, Adobe is projecting that number to surpass $100 billion.And for the 2017 holidays, consumers are expected for the first time to spend more of their budgets online than in stores, according to an annual survey by Deloitte.Internet sites and mass merchants remain shoppers' favored destinations, but e-retailers are widening their lead over other formats, Deloitte found."What [shoppers] buy will be largely determined by the digital interactions occurring now," said Rod Sides, leader of Deloitte's U.S. retail, wholesale and distribution team.Retailers including Wal-Mart, J.C. Penney, Kohl's, Target and Sears are, in turn, beefing up their online offerings ahead of the holidays.New this year, Wal-Mart will no longer be handing out wristbands in advance of Black Friday for coveted items like TVs and iPads.In 2014, Wal-Mart called its holiday strategy the "New Black Friday," where it hoped to trim back the number of shoppers standing in line for "nothing."But that method was short-lived."We feel good about inventory" this year, Wal-Mart's chief merchandising officer, Steve Bratspies, said on a call with the media."We don't think we need wristbands this year."Some of Wal-Mart's top Black Friday deals in 2017 include a Hatchimals Golden Lynx Egg for $49.88, a Frozen Sleigh 12-Volt Ride-On for $198, a Samsung 65-inch Class Curved 4K Smart TV for $998, the Google Home Mini for $29 which also comes with a $25 shopping coupon and the PlayStation 4 1TB Console for $199.Bratspies said Wal-Mart has stocked enough kids pajamas this holiday season to reach from Miami to Seattle.Best Buy, a close competitor to Wal-Mart in the electronics department, is set to open its doors on Thanksgiving at 5 p.m., as it did last year.
Chinese companies agree to develop LNG in Alaska as Trump visits:::::The agreement will involve investment of up to $43 billion, create up to 12,000 U.S. jobs during construction, reduce the trade deficit between the United States and Asia by $10 billion a year, and give China clean energy, it said.There were no other details.AGDC is building a gas treatment plant, an 800-mile (1,287 km) pipeline to south central Alaska for in-state use, and a liquefaction plant in Nikiski to produce up to 20 million tons of LNG per year for export.China, the world's third-largest gas buyer, is importing more LNG as the government tries to wean the country off dirty coal as part of its push to clear the skies, while the United States wants to sell more of its excess gas abroad.
ConocoPhillips CEO says oil producers need to gear up for volatility:::::ConocoPhillipps CEO: We can sustain production with oil below $40 7:54 PM ET Wed, 8 Nov 2017 | 03:18 A Saudi shake-up could keep oil markets volatile and one of the world's largest energy companies said it is getting ready.Ryan Lance, CEO of Houston, Texas-based ConocoPhillips, said his company is readying itself to make profits even if oil prices dip to $40."We can sustain our production, pay our dividend, below $40 a barrel," he said."That's part of the transformation that we've been through."The company sold more than $16 billion in low-margin assets last year, Lance said, in a bid to make the company more resilient.An analysis conducted this summer suggested that U.S. shale producers have an averagebreakeven price of about $50 for West Texas Intermediate.Lance, who is also the chairman of the American Petroleum Insitute, made his remarks on CNBC's "Power Lunch" Wednesday afternoon.Oil prices have fallen for much of the last decade, though in recent weeks they have been headed upward.Brent crude, the international benchmark, hit its highest level since mid-2015 at over $64 a barrel earlier in the week and has risen more than 14 percent in the past month.Investors have had their attention on the Middle East this week as ongoing tensions between Saudi Arabia and its neighbors reacheda fever pitch, sending oil on its recent tear higher.Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman bin Abdulaziz said Tuesday that Iran was guilty of "direct military aggression" after Tehran-backed Houthi rebels based in Yemen reportedly fired a missile aimed at Riyadh.The kingdom intercepted the missile.Earlier in the week, a prominent member of the Saudi royal family was arrested in connection with a sprawling crackdown on influential royalty and bureaucrats that some analysts said was an effort to consolidate the crown prince's domestic powers.Analysts have said that the events in Saudi Arabia could lead to a strong decline in oil prices in the longterm even as they push them up in the short run.Dennis Gartman, an influential commodities analyst who edits the Garman Letter, said Tuesday that in the short run the events in Saudi Arabia could lead to a run up in West Texas Intermediate prices by $1 or $2, though it will ultimately lead to a decline.Prices could rise as high as $70 a barrel, according to Roberto Friedlander, head of energy trading at Seaport Global Securities though Friedlander said they will later drop to $50.Shares of ConocoPhillips were up slightly Wednesday at $53.52.The company is up more than 17 percent over the past three months.
21st Century Fox Q1 earnings 2018:::::21st Century Fox reported quarterly revenue that slightly beat expectations, while earnings remained in line with analyst projections, amid heightened scrutiny by regulators and some investors over sexual harassment scandals at its flagship network Fox News.Here's how the company did compared with what Wall Street expected, according to Thomson Reuters estimates: Earnings per share of 49 cents vs 49 cents expected Revenue of $7 billion vs. $6.81 billion expected In the year-ago quarter, 21st Century Fox posted earnings of 51 cents per share on $6.5 billion in revenue.The company's shares were slightly up in after-hours trading.21st Century Fox saw revenue from cable programming, which includes Fox News and FX, increase about 10 percent compared with the same period in the year prior.Revenue from the company's film business increased about 3 percent.CNBC reported Monday that 21st Century Fox has held talks to sell most of its assets to Walt Disney Co.The two companies operate in several of the same industries.Disney is interested in Fox's movie studio, TV production and international assets such as Star and Sky, as well as entertainment networks such as FX and National Geographic.The talks were held in the last few weeks, but the two companies are not actively negotiating at the moment.While they could sit down again to explore a possible deal, the deal remains far from certain."We have a longstanding policy of not commenting on corporate activity or transactions," Lachlan Murdoch, executive co-chairman of 21st Century Fox, said in a conference call.By selling most of its assets to Disney, 21st Century Fox would narrow its business to a core group of properties around news and sports, in an effort to compete better in a market disrupted by digital content offered by Facebook, Google, Amazon and Netflix.A deal would allow 21st Century Fox to focus on properties such as Fox News, at a time when the lucrative cable news division is under fire over sexual harassment and discrimination scandals.Fox News would not be included in a deal with Disney.The scandals at Fox News have placed its parent company under growing scrutiny by regulators and some investors.The company's $15 billion bid to acquire European broadcaster Sky, for example, has been called into question as new revelations have emerged about how 21st Century Fox dealt with sexual harassment allegations at Fox News.21st Century Fox, controlled by Rupert Murdoch and his sons, currently owns a 39 percent stake in Sky and is seeking to buy the rest of the network.Under the parameters of the possible deal discussed with Disney, however, 21st Century Fox would sell its stake in Sky.Tom Watson, deputy leader of Britain's Labour Party, has urged the country's competition watchdog to block the Sky deal over the sexual harassment scandals at Fox News.The watchdog is already examining whether or not Fox adheres to broadcasting standards."We are confident we are going to get the deal done in the first half of next year," Lachlan Murdoch said during Wednesday's conference call.According to The New York Times, 21st Century Fox renewed Fox News personality Bill O'Reilly's contract shortly after he reached a $32 million sexual harassment settlement with a network analyst.The company acknowledges it was aware of the woman's complaints, according to the Times.21st Century Fox ousted O'Reilly in April after the Times first revealed he had reached settlements totaling $13 million with five women who accused him of sexual harassment.O'Reilly's ouster came nearly a year after Fox News head Roger Ailes was forced to resign because of sexual harassment allegations.Ailes, who died in May, denied any wrongdoing.O'Reilly also denies the allegations against him.Fox News reportedly faces a federal investigation over whether the network failed to inform shareholders about financial settlements of sexual harassment allegations against Ailes.21st Century Fox said in August it has incurred $50 million in costs related to sexual harassment and discrimination settlements.
Men at Work Wonder if They Overstepped With Women, Too:::::In response, some men are forming all-male text groups at companies or in their industries to brainstorm on harassment issues.Some said they planned to be a lot more careful in interacting with women because they felt that the line between friendliness and sexual harassment was too easy to cross.Others are struggling to reconcile how these behaviors could happen even among men who believe in equal rights.Joel Milton, 30, an entrepreneur in Denver with Baker Technologies, a platform for cannabis dispensaries, said he had recently decided to be more careful about corporate offsites after seeing the swell of #MeToo claims.When I hear someone on my team is having a pool party, now Ill say, Hey, maybe no managers should be there, Mr. Milton said, relaying the type of information likely to be covered in many companies employment manuals.He added that harassment was not something he had thought much about before, but that he was considering his own behavior more.Like, did I ever do anything?he said.Many companies have long mandated anti-harassment training to educate men and women about the issue.But in a report last year, the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission found that much of that training was ineffective and that workplace harassment was widely underreported.Jonathan Segal, a lawyer who was on the commissions harassment task force, said he was now fielding odd questions from men about how to behave at work.At a fund-raiser last month in Palm Beach, Fla., some men asked him if it was permissible to hug a woman and where the boundaries should be drawn.Mr. Segal said he had explained to the men that the context mattered and that pretending there was a gray zone between collegial friendliness and sexual assault was absurd.For instance, he told them, hugging an old friend is very different from going up behind a co-worker while she was at a desk typing.Photo If someone cant understand that, then maybe they just shouldnt be hugging, he said.Mr. Segal, who runs anti-harassment training, is now expanding part of the program called Safe Mentoring, which teaches men how to mentor younger women without harassing them.At a recent session, a male supervisor talked about having an extra ticket to a sporting event and feeling he could invite only a male colleague; Mr. Segal went over how to invite a female colleague without sexually harassing her.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The answer to harassment cannot be avoiding women, he said.Still, some workers said they were starting to follow the Pence rule, which was formerly known as the Billy Graham rule, after the evangelical preacher, but is now named for Vice President Mike Pence.Mr. Pence has said he does not eat alone with women who are not his wife or attend an event without her if alcohol will be served.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.A conservative writer, Sean Davis, wrote that a lot of men in media should have effectively been heeding the Pence rule all along.He said he had always followed it and that coastal, liberal America was finally waking up to how useful avoiding private meetings with women could be.The former White House adviser Sebastian Gorka also made this argument.What were seeing now is men are backing away from the role that we try to encourage them to play, which is actively mentoring and sponsoring women in the workplace, said Al Harris, who has been running workplace equality programs and writing on the topic from Chicago with his partner, Andie Kramer, for many years.Theres apprehension on the part of men that theyre going to be falsely accused of sexual harassment.Not everyone is practicing avoidance.Some men said the best route is to ask female co-workers directly if they feel harassed.Pat Lencioni, the founder of the Table Group in Lafayette, Calif., which does executive coaching for companies around issues like diversity, said he was doing just that and had asked the women at his office if they worried about harassment.I came into the office and said, Hey, guys, Ive got a question for you: This sexual harassment stuff, all these things, do you guys ever worry its going to happen here?Mr. Lencioni, 52, recalled.And they were like: No, because we know you.We know who you are.He said he thought this approach could be adopted more broadly.Other men said they had not talked about workplace harassment with anyone because they already knew what they needed to know.This is a liberal town, said Philip Rontell, a real estate agent in Walnut Creek, Calif., who added that he supported the #MeToo campaign.We all already know this stuff.When men do want to talk about workplace harassment, some said, they dont know where to go.I just dont know where those conversations are allowed to be had, said Ryan Ellis, 33, a sales manager for an e-commerce company in Santa Monica, Calif. Austin Gilbert, a recruiter in San Francisco for the company Gametime, said his industry had also had to deal with men talking in online chat rooms at work, which he said could bury and hide toxic comments.His company has closed several high school in-group type of exclusionary work chats over the years, but he worries about more.Advertisement Continue reading the main story We have a policy of telling employees that were free to review all electronic communications, Mr. Gilbert, 31, said.But thats typically not anyones job responsibility in a small company.With women empowered to call out inappropriate behavior, some companies predict that boozy after-work events for the holidays could be combustible this year.While many companies used to have the parties on Thursday or Friday evenings, some are moving them to late Monday or Tuesday afternoons, said Sarah Freedman, the vice president of operations for 23 Layers, an event planner in New York whose clients include Google and West Elm.Open bars are being replaced with game zones.One client recently asked for an extremely watered-down John Daly to be the partys signature drink, which Ms. Freeman found strange but probably wise.After-work events are the front line when it comes to harassment, and companies want more safety precautions now, she said.
Trans-Pacific Trade Partners Are Moving On, Without the U.S.:::::Other countries are slowly but surely making progress on their own sweeping trade deals, without any participation from the United States.China is negotiating a potential deal with 16 Asia-Pacific countries, including Japan, India and South Korea.The European Union and Japan hope to strike separate trade pacts with a group of South American countries, Brazil and Argentina among them.From tough talk on China (they took our jobs) to casting doubt on the decades-old North American Free Trade Agreement (the worst trade deal ever made), Mr. Trump has threatened to lob a grenade at an increasingly integrated global economic system.His administration has questioned years of efforts to lower global trade barriers, arguing that they hurt American workers and led to big trade deficits.It also means dealing with nations one-on-one, rejecting the regional and global pacts his predecessors pursued.But other factors are pushing the rest of the world to fill the void left by the United States.Chinas rise as a regional and economic power is driving other nations either to join with it or to join together to counter it.Fast development in places like Southeast Asia means potential new markets for all kinds of products.The absence of the United States means potential opportunities for others.At some point, the administration may begin to see that this was a strategic mistake and that dropping out of trade is not in the interest of American workers, said Rufus Yerxa, president of the National Foreign Trade Council, a lobbying group that represents companies like Walmart, Ford and Microsoft.Weve got to compete and be a winner in global markets and the danger is, the strategy is divisive, he added.More worrying for some is the possibility that the Trump administration is ceding its position as global leader to China, a rising economic and political influence in the region.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The U.S. has lost its leadership role, said Jayant Menon, an economist at the Asian Development Bank.And China is quickly replacing it.Under the new Trans-Pacific trade deal, members would enjoy tariff-free trade with one another.That would allow companies in the member countries to have faster and better access to other markets than their American rivals.But there are still challenges ahead of the group, and not all the prospective member states meeting in Danang, Vietnam, were in complete accord over the finer details of a new deal.We are pleased that progress is being made towards a possible agreement, but there is still some work to be done, Franois-Philippe Champagne, Canadas minister of international trade, said in a statement.He added that Canada would sign a deal only once its interests had been addressed.Photo Even without the United States, the deal would be the largest trade agreement in history.It is intended to increase protections for intellectual property in some countries, while opening more markets to free trade in agricultural products and digital services around the region.It also has provisions on improving working conditions, although there is debate about the likely results.In a statement posted online, the Australian government said that the agreement in principle demonstrated the 11 countries commitment to open markets, to combat protectionism and to advance regional economic integration.The 11 countries working toward the new agreement are Japan, Australia, Canada, Mexico, Singapore, Malaysia, Vietnam, Chile, Peru, New Zealand and Brunei.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Mr. Trump has expressed support for the nations regional allies even as he rejects or criticizes trade deals with them.He reiterated American support for cooperation on security during his stops in Japan and South Korea.In China, he went out of his way to woo President Xi Jinping, going so far as to suggest that the trade deficit with the United States was the fault of past American administrations rather than of China itself.Advertisement Continue reading the main story I dont blame China, Mr. Trump said in a tweet on Friday morning shortly before leaving for Vietnam.The U.S. has been the driving force, not just behind the global economic order, but also pursuing higher standards on free trade and securing provisions that go way above the World Trade Organization obligations, said Stephen Olson, a former United States trade negotiator who worked on Nafta.If the U.S. abdicates that role, it puts us in uncharted territory, he added.In the absence of American leadership, Japan has driven the new round of talks.Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has spoken of the countries working on an agreement as Oceans Eleven, after the movie.Japans long-term hope is that the United States will eventually return to the fold.We will just go ahead and make it and we will welcome the United States back if they decide to do so, said Ichiro Fujisaki, a former Japanese ambassador to Washington.Completing a deal now, he said, makes the possibility of the U.S. coming back more likely.The new agreement has been crafted with the hope that the United States will one day participate.Some of the provisions among them ones that the United States lobbied for could ultimately be suspended, including some on copyright protection.Given the intensity with which Mr. Trump excoriated the original deal, it seems unlikely that this administration will come back to the table.It will be difficult for the administration to backtrack, said Wendy Cutler, a former United States trade negotiator who worked on the Trans-Pacific deal and is now managing director of the Washington office of the Asia Society Policy Institute.But other countries like Korea, the Philippines and Thailand are expected to join once the deal is ratified, said Ms. Cutler.Advertisement

globalization.Speaking last week, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull of Australia said the deal promised greater transparency and a stronger rule of law, in a world which is dangerously short of both, referring to the siren songs of populists, advocating protectionism.The T.P.P.creates rules of the road to match the new economic world we are living in, Mr. Turnbull said.Notably, the Trans-Pacific pact includes Mexico and Canada, which are at loggerheads with the Trump administration over Nafta.Mr. Trump has raised the prospect of the demise of that agreement, citing the movement of industrial jobs from the United States to those countries.There is a genuine risk that the U.S. is going to further disengage from regional economic interaction, said Christopher Nelson, editor of the Nelson

Plugging Into the Gig Economy, From Home With a Headset:::::While critics of the arrangement cite rising insecurity, some of Liveops star agents like Emmett Jones in Chicago, who knows of his rivals primarily as numbers on a leader board say the opportunity has been transformative.The earnest gratitude of the agents assembled here, not far from the Raleigh-Durham Airport, affirmed that.To them, Liveops is a sustaining force, a way to earn a living while being present at home.A few had driven hours to attend.Many brought friends and family members who were considering joining Liveops Nation, too.There were icebreakers (Liveops Nation Bingo).Gift-card raffles ($150?the chief executive quipped.Who approved these things?).Free enchiladas.Everyone was invited to schmooze.Advertisement Continue reading the main story John, I heard your story about how you got to us is pretty great, said the master of ceremonies, an impossibly sunny woman named Tara.Would you mind telling all these people?When the mic came to John, a former insurance claims adjuster with a gray beard and several earrings, there was a sense of imminent revelation.I was working in another glass box over near here for six years, he began.I reached the point where it was either jump off the roof or walk out the front door.The other agents laughed knowingly.He continued: My commute now is I walk down the hall, close the bedroom door behind me.More laughter.Then Johns voice softened: This is good, this is good.I get paid for when Im working, instead of souring when you get paid for 40 hours and work some more.So, Im here.Awesome, Tara said, applause drowning her out.I feel like Johns story mimics a lot of what we hear from people.According to Greg Hanover, a longtime Liveops official who became chief executive this summer, the companys goal is to make agents feel as if theyre part of a movement, not just earning a wage.Where we want to be with this is what Mary Kay has done, multilevel marketing companies, Mr. Hanover said, referring to the cosmetics distributor and its independent sales force.The direction we need to head in for the community within Liveops Nation is that the agents are so happy, so satisfied with the purpose and meaning there, that theyre telling their story.Photo Its an ambition that feels almost radical compared with Uber, whose best-known exercise in worker outreach is a video of its former chief executive berating a driver.It was heartening to discover that on-demand work could be both financially viable and emotionally fulfilling.Advertisement Continue reading the main story That is, until I began to speak with Mr. Jones and some of his Liveops competitors.The more you talk with them, the more you detect a kind of Darwinian struggle behind the facade of community and self-actualization.You start to wonder: Is there really such a thing as a righteous gig-economy job, even if the company is as apparently well intentioned as Liveops?Or is there something about the nature of gig work thats inescapably dehumanizing?Just the Right Tone Mr. Jones, who lives in Chicago, was the top rated Liveops agent for an insurer called TruStage for much of this year.An AT&T technician for decades, he decided that he needed to be at home not long after his wife was diagnosed with vertigo in 2008.I cant work and be worried about how shes doing, he said.A few years later, when his daughter told him of a friend who worked with Liveops, he was eager to sign up but refused to send in his required voice test until it was close to perfect.I must have did the voice test four or five times, he said.I wanted to make sure I gave the right tone that they were looking for.As a Liveops agent, Mr. Jones sells life policies to callers, often those who have just seen a television commercial for TruStage insurance.He estimates that he works roughly 40 hours each week, beginning around 8 most mornings, and that he makes about $20 an hour.He is such a valued worker that TruStage invited him to its headquarters earlier this year for a two-day visit by an elite group of agents, in which executives pumped them for insights about how to increase sales.Roughly two decades ago, Liveops and its competitors typically connected callers to psychic hotlines, and in some cases less reputable services.Such businesses had frequent spikes in call volume, making it helpful to have an on-demand work force that could be abruptly ramped up.The only thing people were interested in was the abandonment rate that is, the number of people who would hang up in frustration from being kept on hold said Kim Houlne, the chief executive of a Liveops rival called Working Solutions, which she founded in 1996.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The call center industry took a hit during the 2001 recession, when cost consciousness unleashed a wave of outsourcing to India.But within 10 years, many companies decided that the practice, known as offshoring, had been oversold.The savings on wages were often wiped out by lost business from enraged customers, who preferred to communicate with native English speakers.People dont feel comfortable, Ms. Houlne said, alluding to the overseas agents.By the early part of this decade, quality was in fashion.The enormous amounts of data that companies like Liveops and Working Solutions collect allowed them to connect callers to the best possible agent with remarkable precision, while allowing big clients to avoid the overhead of a physical call center and full-time workers.Today, in addition to sales calls, Liveops agents handle calls from people trying to file insurance claims, those in need of roadside assistance, even those with medical or financial issues relating to prescription drugs.The agents must obtain a certification before they can handle such calls, which sometimes takes weeks of online coursework.Liveops goes to great lengths to attend to their needs, addressing technical-support issues, even answering agents emails to the chief executive within 24 hours.Mr. Jones, like many of his fellow agents, thinks of himself as helping others in need.He said that many families will gather around a table after a loved one has died to discuss the burial.If the deceased relative had no insurance, he said, A lot of times that table is going to clear.If, on the other hand, he had even $2,000 in life insurance the minimum that TruStage sells the family members are more inclined to say, He did what he could, let me see what I could do to help out.You end up with $5,000 to $6,000.You can do a decent burial rather than none at all.Still, there is undeniably a brass-tacks quality to the work.Shortly after we hung up, I turned my attention to an assignment due that afternoon, only to receive more calls from Mr. Joness number.When I finally answered, he apologized for interrupting me, then came to the point.I have a question for you, he said.Do you have life insurance?Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Where the Price Point Is Like Uber, Liveops expends considerable effort calculating demand for its agents.For example, if an auto insurance company is running a commercial on ESPN, Liveops will ask the companys media buyer that is, the intermediary that placed the ad to predict how many calls such an ad is likely to generate.Liveops will adjust that prediction, using its own data showing how many calls similar ads have produced from similar audiences during a comparable time of year.And like Uber, the Liveops focuses on utilization in the Liveops case, the percentage of working agents actually on a call.Depending on the client, Liveops strives for rates of 65 percent to 75 percent.Lower than that and the agents, who make money only when theyre on a call, will complain that theyre not busy enough.Significantly higher and the system is vulnerable to a sudden increase in demand that could tie up the phone lines and keep callers waiting.Liveops asks agents to schedule themselves in half-hour blocks, known as commits, for the upcoming week.If the company expects demand to be higher than the number of commits, it sends agents a message urging them to sign up.(Uber does something similar, except without formal scheduling.)Sometimes it will even offer financial incentives, like a bump in the rate earned for each minute theyre on a call, or a raffle-type scheme in which people accumulate tickets for the giveaway of an iPad or a cruise.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Again like Uber, Liveops relentlessly tests the effectiveness of these tools.Referring to financial incentives, Jon Brown, the Liveops senior director of client services, said, Weve zeroed in on exactly what we need for an agent to go from 10 to 15 commits, from 15 commits to 20 commits.We know where the price point is, what drives behavior.And then there are the performance metrics.Liveops agents are rated according to what are called key performance indicators, which, depending on the customer, can include the number of sales they make, their success at upselling customers, and whether a caller would recommend the service based on their interaction.Liveops makes clear that its agents ability to earn more money is closely tied to performance.Youve heard the term meritocracy?said a Liveops official named Aimee Matolka at the North Carolina event.When a call comes in, it routes in to that best agent.Yes, our router is that smart.You guys want to be that agent, I know you do.Otherwise you wouldnt be here.It allows the agents to track their rankings obsessively through internal leader boards.(Liveops officials say that while the pressures of the job can preoccupy agents, it is up to them how much time to invest.)I lost the No.1 spot, now Im No.2, Mr. Jones said in early August, acknowledging that he checks his ranking frequently.I thought about researching to find out who it is you always want to know whos the competition but I said leave it.He added: Im a competitive person.We just toggle back and forth.If they see me jump back in, they work harder.They want that spot back.This Is My Phone Call My flight to Bangor, Me., was due after 9 p.m., and apparently sensing my unease with the North Country, the firefighter seated next to me asked if I had to far to drive when we landed.About three hours north, I confessed.Watch out for moose, he said.I assured him Id driven around deer before.He stopped me short: If you hit a deer, youll kill them, he said.If you hit a moose, theyll kill you.I found Troy Carter, the agent who had recently surpassed Emmett Jones, at his home in Fort Fairfield the next day, wearing jeans, a button-down short-sleeve shirt, and a New England Patriots hat.There were no shoes on his feet, only white socks.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Like Mr. Jones, Mr. Carter said Liveops had been a blessing, allowing him to earn a living in a part of Maine so remote that my cellphone carrier welcomed me to Canada shortly after I pulled into his driveway.When I told Mr. Carter that I had been in touch with his top competitor, he quickly pulled up the latest monthly rankings of Liveops agents selling TruStage insurance.He pointed out that while Mr. Jones, whom he recognized only by his identification number, 141806, had more sales 87 to his 82 he had far fewer paid sales, charged at the time of purchase rather than by invoice.The real thing is the paid application rate they want it around 95 percent, Mr. Carter said.He has 87 sales, but only 65 percent paid, compared to my 94 percent.This, he explained, was why he enjoyed the right to call himself the top agent for the month.Mr. Carter is what you might call a serial entrepreneur.He once started an art supply website that folded within a few months, and a penny auction site called Bid Tree that foundered for lack of a marketing budget.He sees Liveops, on which he spends 40 to 50 hours per week, as of a piece with these entrepreneurial efforts.In fact, it is something of a family business.His wife, Lori, handles incoming calls while hes busy with customers.Im a housewife/secretary/receptionist, she said.Even Mr. Carters 9-year-old son, Logan, plays a role.At nighttime, he says the last part of his prayer based on how many sales I did today, Mr. Carter said.If it was a lot of sales, hell pray, Dear Lord, help my dad get the same amount of sales tomorrow.Though Liveops agents work from a script, Mr. Carter, like Mr. Jones, adds his own flourishes.Before asking a callers gender, as he is required to do, he will say, Now I already know the answer to this question, but please confirm if youre male or female.Upon receiving the answer, he will pause momentarily before saying, I told you I already knew the answer, and break into a laugh.He might make this identical joke, with identical timing, dozens of times in a workday.Its like a comedian has a little pause before a joke, he told me.It relaxes them right off.Even with these touches, results can vary widely.Two days earlier, Mr. Carter had made seven sales, only a few shy of his record.The day I turned up, he managed only one.He said some callers had the impression they could receive $25,000 of insurance for $9.95 per month the commercial mentions both figures and begged off when Mr. Carter told them that their premiums would be substantially higher.Photo Mr. Carter has done research on how to comport himself, including watching an instructional YouTube video by the former stockbroker who was the subject of the movie The Wolf of Wall Street.He believes the key is to come off as the alpha presence.The one that asks the most questions is the one in control, he said.If they ask me questions How are you doing?Ill come back, The question is how are you doing?This is my phone call, as much as I can make it.Advertisement Continue reading the main story But on this day he repeatedly ran up against the limits of his powers.Even those who remained interested after 10 or 15 minutes of painstaking back-and-forth often demurred when Mr. Carter asked them for payment information.This one guy was outside in a wheelchair, Mr. Carter said of a caller who couldnt produce his credit card.He didnt want to go in and get it.I said, Im fine waiting, but I cant push him.These setbacks only seem to make Mr. Carter focus more.At one point, he made a swiping motion between his face and his headset with his index finger and middle finger.They recommend that you keep the microphone two fingers away, he said.Im always doing that checking that its two fingers.Ill do that for the rest of my life.It seemed, all in all, like a grueling way to make the slightly more than $30,000 that Mr. Carter estimates he takes in before taxes.The good thing is he can take hours off, Lori told me.But then he can lose his spot.Its always a fight for the top.I was reminded of the Alec Baldwin monologue from the movie Glengarry Glen Ross, except that the prize for having the most sales wouldnt be a Cadillac, it would be a set of steak knives, because the Liveops analytics team had calculated that agents would give nearly as much effort for a prize worth a small fraction of the cost.Of course, unlike the salesmen in that movie, the Liveops agents cant really be fired the third prize because they werent employees to begin with.A while later, Mr. Carter described a recent initiative in which agents were promised a bonus if 95 percent of their collective sales were paid up front.I knew it wasnt going to work as soon as they said it, he told me, because a handful of agents with low paid rates could ruin everyone elses chances.They did do a pullover sweatshirt for the top two, he added, brightening.I was second, so thats coming.
After 20 Years of Financial Turmoil, a Columnist’s Last Shot:::::Its too bad that the mortgage crisis six years later didnt result in heightened accountability.Heres another sign of progress: Believe it or not, corporate directors are more active in their oversight than they used to be.Egregious board practices and chummy appointments are less common.From the Archives Read some of the notable articles, columns and investigations from Gretchen Morgenson over the last two decades.Nell Minow is a corporate governance expert and vice chairwoman at ValueEdge Advisors, a firm that guides institutional shareholders on reducing risk in their portfolios.She has been rattling cages in the governance field since the mid-1980s and says shes seen a definite improvement in boardroom makeup and practices.When I started in this field, O. J. Simpson was on five boards, including the audit committee of Infinity Broadcasting, she recalled in an interview.And at another company, the C.E.O.s father was on the compensation committee.Weve come a long way.Thats not to say that problems arising from sleepy and clubby boards have been eradicated.Exhibit A is executive compensation, Ms. Minow said.The first C.E.O.pay package I ever complained about was $11 million.The very fact that that has gone completely berserk shows that boards are still a long way from where they should be.A case in point: Thomas M. Rutledge, the head of Charter Communications, who received $98 million in 2016, according to Equilar, a compensation analytics company.Yes, hes an outlier, but the average chief executive compensation at 200 large public companies last year was almost $20 million, Equilar said.Something else that hasnt changed over the decades is analyst and investor reliance on companies creative earnings calculations.These figures, which do not conform to generally accepted accounting practices, typically exclude costs that companies incur in their operations.Such costs include stock awards given to executives and employees and merger expenses.Excluding them makes a companys results look more dazzling than they otherwise would.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Inventive earnings calculations, while more prevalent today, were very popular in the lead-up to the dot-com crash.Back then, analysts valued companies based on imaginative, nonfinancial metrics like the number of page views a retail website received or the percentage of engaged shoppers visiting a site.That didnt end well, even for many companies that had exhibited highly engaged shoppers and millions of views.Advertisement Continue reading the main story I find it ironic that GAAP is much better than it has been for a long time, but analysts have more disdain for it, Mr. Ciesielski said, referring to generally accepted accounting principles.They blindly accept the methodology that management gives them.Folks prefer darkness, I guess.To be sure, embracing managements preferred financial figures isnt as perilous when stock prices are rocketing.Bull markets cover a multitude of sins, after all.But as the dot-com episode showed, genuine earnings growth the kind companies can take to the bank becomes a crucial underpinning when share prices turn down.Thats not true with financial metrics that can only be characterized as earnings before the bad stuff.Photo My search for truths on Wall Street and elsewhere over the years has sometimes raised hackles.Thats to the good.It wasnt my job to be part of a companys spin machine.But responses from my subjects could get a little kooky.A favorite example occurred in the early 2000s, and it involved a major Wall Street firm.I had written about an arbitration case that an investor client had brought against the firm.The firm prevailed in the matter, and the general counsel convened a dinner to celebrate.In a phone conversation, the firms general counsel told me that the menu for the dinner had featured a photograph of me, placed inside a red circle with a slash though it.The general counsel told me how he had scoured the web for just the right picture.The menu garnered lots of laughs from the attendees, he added.I never did find out what that celebration cost the firms shareholders.Incidents like that, however, were relatively rare.And they were far outweighed by the appreciation that readers expressed.You must continue your work of skewering people and customs in our capitalist society that abuse the process, a reader in Jackson, Miss., wrote in 2001.Others expressed thanks for my being a good and consistent questioner, for writing for the financially illiterate, for pushing to make the rules for investing fair and firm.And I loved receiving a Christmas card from a reader in Maryland a couple of years ago that simply said: Thank you for telling truth!Advertisement Continue reading the main story Believe me, it has been my privilege.
Trump to Asia: Unite on North Korea, but Go It Alone on Trade:::::From Tokyo to Beijing, Mr. Trump has played the dealmaker with foreign leaders, flattering them personally even as his administration pushes hard-edge views on economic issues.But the contradictions also reflect a more fundamental disarray in the presidencys policy toward Asia.It seems caught between the geopolitical realism of Mr. Trumps diplomats and the economic nationalism of his political aides.These competing impulses have left allies and adversaries alike confused about Americas motives and staying power.Over time, several experts said, the balancing act will be impossible to maintain.Already with China, Mr. Trump has had to soft-pedal his ambitious trade agenda in an uphill effort to persuade President Xi Jinping to do more to press the neighboring North Korean government.With the smaller nations of Southeast Asia, Mr. Trump may feel less pressure to compromise.His comments in Vietnam lacked the solicitous tone he had used in China and Japan, veering into the defiant populism he used on the campaign trail.Yet his go-it-alone message could drive these countries further into the orbit of China, which has moved at this meeting of Pacific leaders to fill the vacuum left by the United States.Photo The region is looking for a robust American presence, not just on security but on trade, said John Delury, an associate professor of Chinese studies at Yonsei University in Seoul, the South Korean capital.For Trump to come with an America First agenda leaves Asian leaders in the lurch.Jeffrey A. Bader, a former China adviser to President Barack Obama, said Mr. Trumps words would make Asian leaders feel that the U.S. is less of a factor in the region.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Theyre always looking for hedges against local bullies, like China, he added, and the U.S. is much less of a hedge.Indeed, Mr. Trump was the odd man out at this meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.The other 20 leaders formally endorsed the idea of a liberal trade regime, arbitrated by the World Trade Organization, and condemned moves to erect new barriers.We recognize the work of the W.T.O.in ensuring international trade is rules based, free, open, fair, transparent, predictable and inclusive, the members wrote in their joint statement released on Saturday, using language that American negotiators had reportedly resisted.On Friday, Mr. Trump railed against the W.T.O., accusing it of treating the United States unfairly.Rather than uphold principles of free trade, he said, it contributed to a systematic exploitation of Americans, in which jobs, factories and industries were stripped out of the United States.While Mr. Trump vowed never to sign a regional trade deal like the Trans-Pacific Partnership, from which he withdrew the United States early in his presidency, the remaining 11 members of that deal agreed on Saturday to press on with it, creating a broader free-trade area across Asia that will pointedly exclude the United States.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.As the Pacific leaders gathered here on Saturday, much of the attention focused on whether Mr. Trump would meet with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia.The White House steered clear of a formal meeting, though the two men conferred briefly.The United States and Russia later issued a joint statement on Syria that reaffirmed previous commitments to defeat the Islamic State and to untangle conflicts between their respective forces on the Syrian battlefield.Until Saturday evening, when Mr. Trump unloaded to reporters on Air Force One about Mr. Putin and the investigations into Russian election meddling, this trip had been a surprisingly disciplined exercise for the president.Still, for Mr. Trump, this trip has been a surprisingly disciplined exercise.Mr. Trump joined the other leaders in wearing matching electric-blue, traditional Vietnamese shirts at dinner on Friday evening, adhering to a peculiar tradition of this summit meeting.Photo With a jam-packed schedule, he has tweeted sparingly and has kept generally on message.The White House has cut down on unscripted moments, limiting media access and acquiescing to the Chinese reluctance to allow questions after his joint statements with Mr. Xi.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Trumps encounters with leaders have been harmonious even leaders, like President Moon Jae-in of South Korea, with whom he has differences.That is in keeping with Mr. Trumps pattern throughout his presidency, though it was perhaps never as striking as in Beijing, where he lavished praise on Mr. Xi, only to criticize Chinas trade practices a day later in Vietnam.There is some value in treating counterparties with respect, in trying to build relationships with them, despite the distasteful nature if it, said Mr. Bader, the former Obama official.But if Mr. Trumps stops in Northeast Asia were aimed at building a coalition against North Korea, his swing through Southeast Asia seemed calculated to remind people that he has little use for the post-World War II concept of the United States as global leader.At moments, his speech in Vietnam had the tub-thumping atmosphere of one he may have given in Pennsylvania or Wisconsin.When a member of the audience broke into applause after he accused countries of not opening their markets to American goods, a sardonic Mr. Trump exclaimed: Funny.They must have been one of the beneficiaries.Administration officials framed the speech as a chance for Mr. Trump to promote a free and open Indo-Pacific, which the White House has embraced as its answer to Mr. Obamas Asia pivot.But the president put little meat on the bones, emphasizing the sovereignty and independence of nations over common interests or universal rights.Human rights are, in essence, an international agreement, said John Sifton, the director of Asia advocacy for Human Rights Watch.When he talks about trade in those terms, it suggests that he doesnt hold the multilateral legal system in very high regard and thats frightening.Human rights groups, Mr. Sifton said, were focusing their energies on lobbying Canada and Japan rather than the United States.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Chinese leaders do not dwell on human rights either, to say the least.But Mr. Xi came to Vietnam primed to take over some of the ground usually commanded by the American president.During his speech, which came right after Mr. Trumps, he declared, Opening up will bring progress, and those who close down will inevitably lag behind.In the absence of an alternative sales pitch from the United States, experts said, China will inevitably make further gains.China has made significant inroads in cultivating Southeast Asia, said Tang Siew Mun, head of the Asean studies center at the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore.This isnt an entirely bad proposition for the region, but Chinas success is disastrous for the U.S., as Chinese advances are at the U.S.s expense.At the end of the day, Mr. Tang said, America First may devolve into the U.S. being home alone.
Russia Warns of Crackdown on U.S. Media, Including CNN:::::Tensions in the international media sphere are rising at a time when ties between the Russian authorities and the Trump campaign are the subject of an investigation by the special counsel Robert S. Mueller III.During the 2016 presidential campaign, RT frequently portrayed the United States as a nation in disarray, often in sensational YouTube videos that racked up millions of views.The RT network was cited in an intelligence dossier about potential foreign intrusions in the election.Photo On Friday, President Trump and Mr. Putin both attended the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Danang, Vietnam.The men did not hold formal talks, but they shook hands and exchanged greetings before posing for a photograph at the forums gala dinner.It remained unclear on Friday whether Russias talk of a crackdown posed an imminent threat to the operations of American news outlets there, or was saber rattling.Some Russian officials see CNNs international network as a useful vehicle to reach foreign audiences.The American authorities have not publicly acknowledged a request that RT register as a foreign agent.But in a defiant statement on Thursday, RTs editor in chief, Margarita Simonyan, denounced the Justice Department and said her network would register to avoid a freezing of its bank accounts and disclosure of personal information about employees.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.The demand is discriminative; it contradicts both the democracy and freedom of speech principles, Ms. Simonyan wrote on RTs website.It deprives us of fair competition with other international channels, which are not registered as foreign agents.Ms. Simonyan said she planned to sue the Justice Department over the matter.During the presidential race, RTs American cable network attracted about eight million viewers a week, and it assigned reporters to cover the major party conventions and campaign rallies.Among its on-air personalities were American TV veterans like Larry King and Ed Schultz.RT had particular influence on YouTube, where its 2.2 million subscribers rivaled the totals for major American news outlets.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The Russian minister of communications, Nikolai Nikoforov, said this week that the treatment of RT in the United States was the result of an undeserved animosity toward Russian interests.It is yet another manifestation of the general anti-Russian hysteria in the United States, Mr. Nikoforov told journalists, rather than of a constructive legal dialogue.The Justice Department and CNN declined to comment.Amanda Bennett, the director of Voice of America, said in a statement: The Voice of America is an independent news source required by law to be accurate, objective and comprehensive.We will not speculate on any steps foreign governments might take with regard to our journalistic work.
How Could a Tax Change Affect You? This Is What the Senate and House Propose:::::Exemptions, Credits, Standard Deductions Whats in place now: If youre single, the current standard deduction is $6,350.Add in exemptions and youre up to $10,400.Married without children?Thats $12,700 for the deduction and $20,700 with exemptions.If youre married with two kids, the deduction-plus-exemptions figure goes up to $28,700.There is also a $1,000 tax credit per child.What the House proposed: The House bill calls for simplification: If youre single with no children, your standard deduction would be $12,000.If youre married, it would be $24,000 no matter how many kids you have.The child tax credit, however, would rise to $1,600 per child.There is also an additional $300 credit for each parent and nonchild dependent, though that would expire after 2022.What the Senate proposed: The same $12,000/$24,000 standard deductions as the House.Single parents would see their deductions go to $18,000 from $9,300.The child tax credit would rise to $1,650.State and Local Tax Deductions, and Mortgage Interest Whats in place now: You can generally deduct the amount you pay for state and local tax income taxes, including property taxes, on your federal income tax return.You can also deduct the interest you pay each year on mortgage debt up to $1 million, a cap that can cover multiple homes.Plus, you can generally deduct up to $100,000 in interest you pay on a home-equity loan or line of credit.What the House proposed: No more state and local tax deductions, though you could continue to deduct up to $10,000 each year in property tax.For people buying in the future (which the bill defines as Nov. 2, 2017, or later), mortgage interest deductions would be allowed only on loans up to $500,000.Moreover, only debt from primary residences would count toward that limit, and you could not include any interest from home equity loans or lines of credit that you took out on that new home.What the Senate proposed: No more state and local tax deductions and no exception for property taxes, either.The mortgage interest deduction, however, would survive in its current form.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Medical Expenses Whats in place now: For the moment, you can deduct out-of-pocket medical expenses that exceed 10 percent of your adjusted gross income (but not the expenses that amount to the first 10 percent).This is particularly useful for elderly people and others with lower incomes who need regular assistance and care.What the House proposed: The House wants to do away with the deduction in 2018.What the Senate proposed: The Senate would keep the deduction.Student Loan Interest Whats in place now: Currently, people with incomes below certain thresholds can deduct up to $2,500 of student loan interest each year.What the House proposed: The House wants to do away with the student loan interest deduction.What the Senate proposed: The Senate would keep things as they are now.Estate Taxes Whats in place now: In general, you pay taxes on inherited property at a 40 percent rate, but current rules waive that tax for estates up to $5,490,000.What the House proposed: The House seeks to nearly double that exemption and repeal it altogether after 2024 a year later than the House first proposed.What the Senate proposed: The Senate wishes to double the exemption but has not proposed any full repeal.Pass-Through Businesses Whats in place now: People who own small businesses of various sorts generally pay income taxes based on the normal rate for individual taxes.Often, they are involved in or run partnerships, sole proprietorships, limited liability companies and S corporations.What the House proposed: The House bill would create a new 25 percent tax rate for what it refers to as pass-through businesses, for a portion of the business net income that passes through to the owners.The proposed rules around this are complicated; see Section 1004 of the House bill summary for more information.What the Senate proposed: The Senates offering would not leave quite as much money in taxpayers pockets as the House bill would, as it gives taxpayers the opportunity to deduct 17.4 percent of domestic qualified business income from a partnership, S corporation or sole proprietorship.See page 17 of the Senate bill summary for more detail.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Adoption Credits Whats in place now: In 2017, when an employer pays for up to $13,570 in qualified adoption expenses for an employee, the employee pays no taxes on that assistance.Theres also a separate adoption credit, which generally provides taxpayers with a credit of up to $13,570 per eligible child.Under the current rules, the credit phases out for taxpayers with adjusted gross income between $203,540 and $243,540.What the House proposed: The bill had proposed getting rid of the adoption credit altogether, but on Thursday afternoon, the Republican leadership changed its mind and left it intact.What the Senate proposed: The Senate would also leave it intact.Selling Your Home Whats in place now: Currently, a married couple filing their taxes jointly can exclude up to $500,000 in capital gains on the sale of a home, as long as theyve used it as a primary residence for two of the past five years.What the House proposed: Taxpayers would need to have lived in the home for five out of the previous eight years and the tax break could be used only once every five years, down from once every two years.The tax break would begin to phase out for taxpayers whose adjusted gross income exceeded $250,000 (or $500,000 for joint filers).What the Senate proposed: The Senate proposes an identical formula as it relates to years in residence and frequency of use.But it allows people who fail to meet the five-year requirement because of a change in employment, health trouble or unforeseen circumstances to exclude a fraction of the $250,000 or $500,000 equal to the fraction of the five-year period that they were in residence.Coverdells and 529 Plans Whats in place now: Your money grows tax-free (you can put in $2,000 per year with certain income limits), and then you can withdraw it tax-free to pay for private school from kindergarten through 12th grade (in addition to college).Potential changes to this maneuver were last considered in 2012.What the House proposed: The House wants to neuter Coverdells but let people pull up to $10,000 out of 529 plans tax-free to use for private school.(You could still use that same 529 plan to save for college the same way you always have.)Wealthy families can gain a potential tax break of up to $30,000 or so.What the Senate proposed: The Senate did not propose any changes.Losses for Fires and Floods Whats in place now: If youre a victim of a house fire, flood, burglary or similar event, you can deduct those losses.Advertisement Continue reading the main story What the House proposed: The House did away with these so-called casualty deductions.That means you would be out of luck, unless legislators passed a one-time bill offering relief for victims of particular weather or other events that affected a lot of people.What the Senate proposed: Starting in 2018, you could only claim a deduction if the loss happened during an event that the president later officially declared to be a disaster.Alimony Whats in place now: Alimony is a deductible expense for people paying it, and those who receive it must pay income taxes.What the House proposed: Divorce would become a bit more burdensome for the ex-spouse who pays alimony because it would no longer be a deductible expense.But the party receiving the payments would no longer need to pay tax on the income received.The change would take effect for divorce and separation agreements (and any changes to current agreements) executed after 2017.What the Senate proposed: The Senate bill would make no changes to alimony rules.Moving Expenses Whats in place now: As it stands, taxpayers can deduct moving expenses even if they do not itemize their tax returns as long as the new workplace is at least 50 miles farther from the old home than the old job location was from the old home.(If you had no workplace, the new job must be at least 50 miles from your old home.)What the House proposed: Relocating for a new job?Moving costs would no longer be a deductible expense in 2018.What the Senate proposed: The Senates bill is similar to the Houses, though it allows some exceptions for members of the military.Tax Preparation Whats in place now: You can usually deduct the amount your tax preparation specialist billed you or any similar tax-related expenses, like software you purchase and the fee you pay to file your forms electronically.What the House proposed: Taxpayers would no longer be able to take this deduction.Since the bill aims to reduce the number of taxpayers who itemize (and all the complexity that goes with that), in theory fewer people should require professional tax help (with the exception of wealthier people, who can afford to lose this break).Advertisement Continue reading the main story What the Senate proposed: The Senates proposal is similar to that of the House.Electric Cars Whats in place now: Buyers of qualifying plug-in electric vehicles, like the Chevrolet Bolt or Volt and Teslas cars, can sometimes get a tax credit for up to $7,500.What the House proposed: The House would do away with the credit.What the Senate proposed: The Senate proposed no change.Riding a Bicycle to Work Whats in place now: You can exclude up to $20 each month from your income for expenses related to regular bicycle commuting, as long as you are not receiving other pretax commuting benefits from your employer.What the House proposed: The House bill did not propose any changes.What the Senate proposed: The Senate would take away this tax break.Reduced and Waived Tuition Whats in place now: Employees of educational institutions who receive reduced tuition or a waiver for themselves, spouses or dependents are generally not taxed on that income.This is particularly helpful for certain graduate students; their tuition is waived as part of arrangements in which they teach or perform research at their university.What the House proposed: The House bill would treat reduced or waived tuition as income.What the Senate proposed: The Senate would keep things as they are now.Employer-Paid Tuition At the moment, when employers pay your tuition for continuing education, the amount they pay is not taxable income for you as long as it meets certain conditions and amounts to no more than $5,250 per year.What the House proposed: The House would make these tuition payments count as taxable income starting in 2018.What the Senate proposed: The Senate would keep things as they are now.
Are Honey Nut Cheerios Healthy? We Look Inside the Box:::::I had a bowl of Honey Nut Cheerios recently.Itd been awhile.Regular Cheerios are more my thing.But sometimes I finish my box faster than my kids do and find myself straying to their side of the cupboard.Honey Nut is Americas best-selling breakfast cereal, and by a comfortable margin.Roughly 151 million boxes and other containers of various sizes were sold over the past year, well ahead of the second best-selling breakfast cereal, Frosted Flakes, according to IRI, a Chicago based market research firm.I had no idea.The only thing I could think about when I ate it again for the first time in years was how incredibly sweet it is.I looked at the back of the box and could see why.Three of the top six ingredients are sweeteners: sugar, brown sugar and honey.Previously, I assumed Honey Nut Cheerios was a slightly sweeter Cheerios, but you learn things when you finally get around to reading the back of the box.It actually has about nine times as much sugar as plain Cheerios, per serving.An Environmental Working Group analysis of a number of popular cereals a report that linked sugary cereals to the nations childhood obesity epidemic put Honey Nut Cheerioss sugar content second only to Fruity Pebbles.The same group found that one cup of the cereal had more sugar than three Chips Ahoy!cookies.Advertisement Continue reading the main story I asked General Mills about this, over a period of several days.They did not come to the phone, but responded with a series of communiqus.
Hasbro Said to Make Bid for Toy Rival Mattel:::::Photo Hasbro has made a bid to acquire its chief rival Mattel, according to people briefed on the discussions, a move that would further consolidate the worlds toy industry.Hasbro made the takeover approach in recent months, these people said, as Mattel has struggled to revive some of its faded brands.It was unclear whether Hasbro had offered any terms for a deal or whether any further discussions had taken place, said the people, who insisted on anonymity because the talks were private.The toy world, like the broader retail industry, has been upended by the surge of e-commerce and the intensifying battle to grab the attention of children, who are spending more time playing on tablets and smartphones.It is not the first time the two toy giants have been involved in a potential takeover.More than two decades ago, Mattel sought to take over Hasbro, but Hasbro rejected that hostile bid, saying the merger would never pass antitrust hurdles.Regulatory issues could also be a factor in any future combination of the two companies, which are the industrys dominant toymakers.Advertisement Continue reading the main story For much of this year, there has been talk across the toy industry about a possible tie-up between the two companies.Mattels stock has fallen 52 percent over the past year, and its market value is now about $5 billion.
Uber Hit With New Blow in London as Panel Says Drivers Aren’t Self-Employed:::::You can hide behind technology, but the laws are there, and they need to be obeyed and respected, Mr. Aslam, 36, said in an interview after the tribunal issued its decision.The impact of this ruling could affect thousands of drivers, and not just drivers but millions of workers across the U.K.It just means we cant be exploited, he added.The acting chief of Ubers British operations, Tom Elvidge, said the company would appeal the decision, either to the Court of Appeal or to Britains Supreme Court.The employment case here is one of several challenges that Uber faces.Although the company has expanded at a breakneck pace and grown into a behemoth valued at $70 billion, it has had to grapple with allegations that it does not do enough to vet its drivers, revelations that it used software to evade the gaze of the authorities and other issues.Complaints about an aggressive workplace culture forced Travis Kalanick, a founder of the company, to resign as chief executive this year.He was succeeded by the former chief executive of Expedia, Dara Khosrowshahi, who has displayed a more conciliatory style.As part of his softer approach, Mr. Khosrowshahi went on a charm offensive last month in an effort to win over the London transport authorities.Uber is appealing the London ban, which declared the company not fit and proper to operate in the city.Uber was allowed to continue operating in the city until a final ruling was made in the case.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Mr. Khosrowshahis shift in tone comes at a crucial time.Uber is aiming for an initial public offering in 2019, and working on securing a multibillion-dollar investment from the Japanese conglomerate SoftBank.As part of its push to win over customers and drivers concerned about Ubers reputation, the company has introduced new measures and services, including allowing users to add tips to fares.Uber has also promoted its efforts, particularly in Britain, to provide drivers with benefits like access to insurance and pensions.Essentially, it has been outrunning employment law and legislators, said Andr Spicer, a professor at City Universitys Cass Business School in London.Its having to become more like a normal company, rather than one that was able to evade existing legal frameworks.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Ubers operations in London are crucial to its global expansion.The company started operating in the city in 2012, and now offers its services in dozens of cities nationwide.About 40,000 people drive for Uber in the British capital, and the company says that three million customers have used the app in London at least once in the past three months.Ubers arrival in London has, however, set off a clash with the citys famous black cabs.Drivers in the centuries-old taxi system must pass an exacting test known as the Knowledge, which requires the memorization of around 25,000 streets and 100,000 landmarks.A ride in a black cab is typically far more expensive than using Uber, which cabbies complain is too lightly regulated.Opponents of Uber argue that it is able to undercut rivals on price largely because of its employment practices, which mean it can avoid paying some of the costs and contributions required by permanent employees.But the companys business model is facing challenges across Europe.The regions highest court is expected to rule by years end in a case involving whether Uber should be regulated as a taxi service, which would make it subject to rigorous safety and employment rules, or as a digital platform that simply connects independent drivers and passengers.Labor experts say that laws in most countries have failed to keep pace with advances in technology and the rise of the gig economy.In Britain, for example, the main piece of legislation that regulates how workers are treated was passed in 1996.The legislation is old, said Susannah Kintish, a partner at the law firm Mishcon de Reya who specializes in employment law.It came out when the Spice Girls had their first hit.Its just way out of date.
California Looks at Republican Tax Measures and Sees Payback:::::The bills would phase out the ability to deduct personal casualty losses from wildfires and earthquakes a constant threat in vast parts of the state but keep the deduction for damage from hurricanes and floods like those in Florida and Texas this year.I would like to think that this isnt directly aimed at California, but its hard not to think that Congress has their sights set on the Golden State, said State Senator Mike McGuire, a Democrat whose district includes areas ravaged by the recent wildfires in the north.No matter if its an earthquake, a wildfire or a hurricane, families should be able to deduct the damage.California is overwhelmingly Democratic.Hillary Clinton outpolled Mr. Trump by nearly four million votes here, and Democrats control both houses of the Legislature.Party leaders have been at the forefront of denouncing Mr. Trumps policies on issues from the environment to health care.There has long been concern here that the states confrontational stance toward the Trump administration could invite retribution from Washington.Gov.Jerry Brown, a Democrat, said in an interview that the rush by Republicans to pass a bill made it impossible to judge how much the legislation could hurt the state.I cant penetrate the inner motivations of the Republican leadership, Mr. Brown said.But I will say there is something very odd about their rushing this very gigantic tax proposal through Congress without serious transparency or debate.They are doing so primarily, it seems, to reward their corporate donors.I dont like this way to govern in a democracy, he said.Representative Darrell Issa, whose San Diego County district is among the most vulnerable Republican seats in the state, said he would oppose the bill.Advertisement Continue reading the main story I cannot endorse changes that may make the tremendous burden felt by California taxpayers even worse, he said.Tax reform should lower taxes for all taxpayers regardless of where they live.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.But so far, Mr. Issas opposition appears singular within the states Republican delegation, at least among those who will offer comment.Representative Kevin McCarthy, the majority leader, who represents a Central Valley district, strongly backed the effort.He said other parts of the bill such as increasing the standard deduction and eliminating the alternative minimum tax would help California taxpayers who were, he said, saddled with high state taxes.State Senator Jeff Stone, a Republican, also endorsed the effort, saying it would bring welcome relief to California taxpayers.The Democrats keep raising taxes in California, he said.Its about time the federal government stops letting them off the hook by giving them cover with an overly complicated federal tax system.On the Democratic side, Anthony Rendon, the Assembly speaker, called the bill anti-California, and said he was surprised that so few California Republicans had spoken against it, especially in contrast to Republicans in other states, like New York, that would also be hurt.Its to a large extent political suicide for a lot of these folks, he said, and they dont seem to care.Like everything in the tax measure, affordable-housing credits are a moving target.The House version eliminated a lot of things, and the Senate version restored some of them.But as Republican legislators shape a bill that delivers a big cut in corporate taxes while remaining within deficit limits that allow a party-line vote, the houses have consistently looked at reducing credits and deductions whose ripple effects would be minimal in most of the country but profound for taxpayers who live, generally, in Democratic states.For instance, both the House and Senate bills either reduce or repeal the deduction for state income, sales and property taxes.Californias top personal income-tax rate is the nations highest.The House bill lowered the limit on the mortgage-interest deduction for new home purchases from $1 million in debt to $500,000.That move would affect fewer than 3 percent of mortgage holders nationally, and there are only four metropolitan areas in the United States where more than half of the homes are priced above $500,000.All four are in California.(The Senate bill keeps the limit at $1 million.)Advertisement Continue reading the main story Also, no state benefits more from itemized deductions, which the bills limit, and in many cases discourage, by increasing the standard deduction.Economic models suggest that the bulk of the millions of families that would face tax increases under the legislation itemize their deductions.More than a third of Californians itemize their deductions, according to data compiled by the Pew Charitable Trusts; the average benefit from those deductions was nearly $37,000 in 2015.California is not the only state whose voters would lose deductions from the tax bill.According to an analysis by the Tax Foundation, an independent think tank, six states California, New York, New Jersey, Illinois, Texas and Pennsylvania claim more than half of the total amount deducted for state and local taxes.
LinkedIn Faces Setback in China as It Runs Afoul of New Rules:::::Photo SHANGHAI LinkedIn is often held up as a model of how a foreign internet company can do business in China.Increasingly, it also serves as an example of how difficult that task can be.This week, the jobs-and-professional-networking service blocked individuals from advertising jobs on its site in China, after it ran afoul of new government regulations requiring it to verify the individuals identities, according to a person familiar with the situation.LinkedIn said in a statement that companies could still post job listings but that it did not know when it would again allow individuals to do the same.In August, Chinas government increased scrutiny on internet job postings in response to a rash of online hiring scams, mostly for pyramid schemes.New regulations call for companies to have verification of the identities of those posting job listings.Beijing has been following up its new regulation with audits, according to the person, who asked not to be named because the person was not authorized to speak publicly.Advertisement Continue reading the main story LinkedIn is a rare foreign internet company in a country that blocks Facebook, YouTube, Google and other online mainstays in the rest of the world.It persists in China by closely adhering to local rules.It censors content that the Chinese authorities consider sensitive or objectionable, limits the ability of members to create or join online groups and has given partial ownership of its Chinese operation to local investors.
Alibaba’s Singles Day Sales Hit New Record of $25.3 Billion:::::Singles Day the frenzied annual celebration of consumption and commerce that is Chinas much larger version of Black Friday began as a protest of sorts against Valentines Day, propelled by college students in the 1990s.The events date, written numerically as 11/11, was associated with unattached singles, known as bare sticks.This years shopping festival entered new territory, blazing past $1 billion within two minutes of the holiday, starting at midnight on Saturday.By the end of the day, sales had hit a new record of $25.3 billion, more than 40 percent higher than sales on Singles Day 2016.Photo Photo Singles Day is now inextricably linked with Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce leviathan that in recent years has turned the holiday into an online and occasionally brick-and-mortar mercantile extravaganza.It routinely eclipses Amazons yearly Prime Day promotional event.Advertisement Continue reading the main story In July, Prime Day generated an estimated $1 billion in revenue during its 30-hour sale window, resulting in what Amazon called its biggest day ever.Photo Photo The event has evolved into a cultural phenomenon.On Friday night, Alibaba hosted a lavish gala in Shanghai, directed by one of the producers behind the 2016 Academy Awards.Celebrities such as Nicole Kidman, Pharrell Williams and Maria Sharapova helped count down the moments before the 60,000 participating global brands released their Singles Day deals to shoppers.Photo Photo One offer, from the Chongqing-based online alcohol brand Jiang Xiao Bai, allowed 33 fast-moving customers to make a single payment of 11,111 yuan, or $1,673, for a lifetime supply of a grain liquor known as baijiu.Singles Day, which is largely powered through Alibabas Tmall marketplace, was a test of the companys logistics network.The company promised delivery within an hour for certain products and, in advance of the shopping festival, converted nearly 100,000 stores across China into smart stores capable of processing payment using facial recognition and other advanced technologies.
A Shadow Delegation Stalks the Official U.S. Team at Climate Talks:::::Yet seven in 10 Americans believe global warming is occurring, according to a Yale University survey, and more than 60 percent say they are at least somewhat worried about its effects.Theres a debate in the United States between the denialists who pooh-pooh any thought about climate change and the catastrophic dangers it portends, and those who agree with the scientific academies of every country in the world that were facing an existential threat and we have to do something about it, Governor Brown said Saturday.He and Mr. Bloomberg announced that the states, cities and businesses that had pledged to abide by the Paris accord were on track to meet the Obama administration pledge to cut emissions at least 26 percent below 2005 levels by 2025.Former Vice President Al Gore, a longtime champion of strong action on climate change, said Mr. Trump represented a minority view on the subject.President Trump does not speak for the country as a whole on the climate issue, Mr. Gore said.Of course hes our president, of course he has the authority that any president has.But on this issue he is very much out of sync with the country as a whole.According to a new report from Americas Pledge, a group led by Mr. Bloomberg and Mr. Brown, if the institutions working to meet the Obama targets were a separate country, they would be the third-largest economy in the world after the United States and China.Even as the Trump administration plans to roll back federal climate change policies like the Clean Power Plan, the study found, falling clean technology prices, the low price of natural gas and local carbon-cutting efforts have already cut domestic greenhouse gas emissions by 11.5 percent between 2005 and 2015.The official American negotiating team for now is laying low.Career State Department officials are managing the technical negotiations, speaking up on issues like demanding more transparency from developing countries on their progress cutting emissions.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The Trump administrations true debut will come Monday when a team from the White House hosts a forum promoting fossil fuels and nuclear energy.Speakers will include executives from Peabody Energy, a coal company; NuScale Power, a nuclear engineering firm; and Tellurian, a liquefied natural gas exporter.Christiana Figueres, a former United Nations climate envoy who spent her morning with the shadow American delegation, said the Trump administration was sending the wrong message to a conference aimed at decarbonizing the global economy.Coal is to be thanked for all of its hard work and it now deserves to be retired.It is of retirement age and needs to be put in the retirement home, Ms. Figueres said.Jim Lakely, a spokesman for the Heartland Institute, said he hoped United Nations climate delegates would also hear his groups message.Carbon dioxide is not a pollutant and it is not the driver of global warming, he said.So there is no moral case for restricting the use of fossil fuels, especially because that is vital to raising the quality and length of life of the worlds poorest people.Diplomats from other countries said they were glad to see governors, mayors and other Americans still committed to the Paris agreement making their presence felt.But they also said they werent sure which voice of American policy they should believe.Unfortunately theres no connect between those processes, said Dr. Ian Fry, lead negotiator for Tuvalu, a South Pacific island threatened by rising seas.Its just two worlds, unfortunately.
The Wing, a Chic Women’s Club, Is Going Wide:::::Ms. Gevinson, also featured in No Mans Land, was initially reluctant to join the Wing.I work from home, and thats how I can almost justify my rent, she said.Then she went to visit the first club, which opened in the Flatiron district in October 2016: awash in millennial pink, with softly lit desks for working, a beauty room for primping, a snack bar with coffees and organic granola, plenty of art, a lactation room and a large library of color-organized books written by and about women.The look of it is out of my dreams, Ms. Gevinson said.Its crazy that that place exists in real life.I joined right away.Photo Over the course of 18 months, the club raised more than $10 million from investors, most recently from a group led by Tony Florence, a general partner at the venture capital firm NEA.He also backs Goop, the luxury shopping site Moda Operandi and Casper, the mattress company.As a man, he has been allowed to visit the Wing only when members are not present.My ability to understand the market opportunity and the need for this kind of business extends beyond man or woman, Mr. Florence said of his involvement.Its a very attractive financial model.What remains to be seen is what kind of business the bigger Wing might be: a locus of a mediacentric feminist movement, like Ms. in the 1970s, or a mass-scaled temple of exclusivity, like Soho House, if Soho House wrapped itself in a marketing banner of she-power.In the Pink Ms. Gelman, a former political press representative who worked on the 2013 campaign of the New York City

they began hearing from their members that along with previously planned offerings like lessons in flower arrangement, breakfasts themed to signs of the zodiac and panels on news topics, they were interested in programming and events that focused on womens rights and politics.And so the founders scheduled events like Workshop on Anxiety & Depression in a Post-Trump World, A Night of Interfaith Sisterhood for Jews and Muslims and A Conversation With Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, all of which were well attended.They organized buses to take members to and from the Womens March in Washington, where the pink hats fortuitously coordinated with the de Rege-Koyfman color scheme.Photo A few months after the Wing opened, Girls included a plotline featuring a women-only club in New York.In Ms. Dunhams telling, the club was called Wemun (Women Entrepreneurs Meet Up Now) and one of the women running a meeting there said, Whether its how to rock a romper at a work event or who you should be voting for, a Wemun woman is the person to ask.This episode was sent to critics and writers before it aired.After The Cut published an article, Did Lena Dunham Shade the Wing on Girls?Ms. Dunham told the reporter that any resemblance to the Wing or Ms. Gelman was accidental and she trimmed the scene.To two entrepreneurs trying to make a business out of supporting womens careers, though, the joke seemed to have landed with a thud.Ms. Gelman stopped following Ms. Dunham on Instagram for months, until this week.(Friends fight, friends make up, life is long, Ms. Gelman said.)They took less personally a plotline this season on Younger, in which the main characters badly want membership to The Nest, a women-only club.Photo Its like a Sex and the City of today, Ms. Kassan said of Younger,

I Won the Lottery and I Need Help. No, Really!:::::Advertisement Wealth I Won the Lottery and I Need Help.No, Really!Image Valerie Williams, of Springfield, Mass., left, buying lottery tickets at the Pride Station & Store, in Chicopee, Mass., where the winning ticket for the $758.7 million Powerball drawing was sold in August.Credit Steven Senne/Associated Press Winning the lottery can be a bolt of amazing luck.But whether the luck lasts depends on whether lottery winners fritter away their unexpected largess or manage to achieve financial security.When Alcario and Carmen Castellano won $141 million in California more than a decade ago, they were fortunate enough to have a financial professional in the family to advise them.And one thing they learned early was to say no, said Mr. Castellano, now 83.People were constantly calling their San Jose home after they won in 2001, and many even knocked on their door, trying to persuade them to lend or give money.Mr. Castellano said that not long ago, an acquaintance asked for a personal loan.Thats not our goal, he quickly told the person.We dont do that.Within months of winning, the couple had to buy a more secluded house because they did not feel safe.He said, joking, that it was also because the Jaguar I gave my wife would have looked out of place in our old neighborhood.The couple did spend on some indulgences, like new cars, but quickly set their spending priority, which was giving to Latino community organizations.Winners can display joyful exuberance at first, but then they often must deal with unanticipated stress.The psychologist Stephen Goldbart coined a phrase sudden wealth syndrome to describe symptoms, which include feeling isolated from friends, guilt over good fortune and extreme fear of losing newly gained money.Prize winners face adjustments when their financial status shifts radically.Extravagant spending, bad investments and other perils facing lottery winners are common enough that most state lotteries take pains to advise winners to seek out professional accounting and financial advice.Nobody teaches you what to do with a large amount of money, said John Hagerty, a spokesman for the Virginia Lottery.We give those who win $100,000 and up a video and a packet of information to help them prepare for their new financial lives.Michelle and Robert Sutherland of Oregon, who won $7 million in the states lottery last June, had lost a large portion of their retirement savings in the 2008 economic meltdown, then lost more money later when they opened a restaurant.The local economy stalled and they had to close the business.The couple took their lottery winnings in a lump sum and turned to a financial adviser they knew.They bought a nice, comfortable house but not a mansion outside Springfield, Ore., said Ms. Sutherland, 54.To have that title in your hands is an amazing feeling.She said that they had been able to spend some money on their family, and to set up substantial college funds for their three grandchildren.It is very easy to fall into buying everyone the things they want, she said, but we want to keep it the way its been.Image Top, Alcario and Carmen Castellano started a foundation after winning $141 million in California in the lottery.Credit Jim Wilson/The New York Times Winners say there is no plan that works for everyone.There is no one way when you win, said Amanda Spiller, 32, who claimed a $1 million Virginia Lottery prize in September 2015.Her 7-year-old daughter wanted to buy a helicopter and a yacht, Ms. Spiller said with a laugh, but I put my foot down.Ms. Spiller, who is self-employed, relied on a local accountant for advice and took a lump sum, which was about $688,000 before taxes.She paid off some student loans, invested in a mutual fund and began to nurture some of her passions.One is her website Stop Eating Like a Jerk , which features videos on topics like how to make better food choices.I definitely have a better quality of life now, she said.Id never been on an airplane so Ive done a lot of traveling and taken my daughter places she was never able to go.And she has not given up on the idea of winning again, she added.Im still playing the lottery every week.I won $2,000 last year, and Im sure Im going to win again so I invest about $30 every week.Major prize winners like the Castellanos distribute some of their good fortune through foundations.The couple had volunteered in local Latino organizations before their win, and 16 years ago they set up the Castellano Family Foundation .For several years, Ms. Castellano, 78, who had worked as an administrative secretary for more than three decades at nearby San Jose City College, read and evaluated every application for funding.I was making a list of organizations as soon as Al told me we had won, she said.By that December, I wrote the first foundation check.The couple learned more about philanthropy by attending conferences, consulting with major donors and hiring a consultant.Their foundation focuses on arts and education groups, as well as on leadership and diversity issues.Its not to say that we dont have fun, she said.We had a grand celebration on our 50th wedding anniversary.When we won, we had the means to help others, but it hasnt changed us.We still have the same friends, she continued.The foundation has helped us to develop our spending ideas, and develop an intuition about how to handle people that we dont know.Michael Moriarty, 56, a semiretired bartender from the Bronx, said he was using his windfall to build my little kingdom.He won $7 million this year from a New York scratch-off ticket, and he bought property in the Florida Keys for his family he has three daughters and to rent.I love Florida because its a laid-back way of life, and I wanted something that could be an investment and also used by the family, he said.And I think its a good investment to own property.He gave $100,000 to his local Boys & Girls Club, where his brother is president, and treated his daughters to gifts, noting that they have gotten their fill of wants, not needs.He still routinely puts flowers on his mothers grave and bought himself a new Jeep, a new Harley-Davidson and a modestly priced boat as well as two fishing reels.People say you dont have to worry about money, he said.Well, thats all I worry about now.Order Reprints | Todays

Vietnam, in a Bind, Tries to Chart a Path Between U.S. and China:::::Xi Jinpings ambitions are dangerous for the whole world, General Cuong said.China uses its money to buy off many leaders, but none of the countries that are its close allies, like North Korea, Pakistan or Cambodia, have done well.Countries that are close to America have done much better.We must ask: Why is this?As with other Southeast Asian nations acutely aware that they are positioned in Chinas backyard, Vietnam is worried about American inattention.In the name of halting Communism, the United States once sent troops to Indochina and propped up dictators elsewhere in Asia.But the American-devised security landscape also created a stable environment in which regional economies expanded.Photo Now, Mr. Trumps decision to take the United States out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade pact, which would have given 11 other economies an alternative to a Chinese-led economic order, has left the Vietnamese feeling vulnerable.As Vietnamese, we are always trying to find a way to balance Chinas power, said Nguyen Ngoc Anh, a professor at the Foreign Trade University in Hanoi.For us, TPP isnt just an economic issue.Its also about geopolitics and social issues.Ms. Anh noted that local liberals had cheered the trade pact because it would have forced Vietnam to adhere to international labor and government accountability standards that Hanoi might otherwise not meet.With the 11 other members of the pact agreeing to proceed without the United States, Washingtons withdrawal not to mention Mr. Trumps America First speech at the APEC meeting on Friday leaves some nations wondering if their best option may be Chinese-backed trade pacts and financing deals that have fewer guarantees for workers and less official transparency.Advertisement Continue reading the main story We are both Communist countries, but people like me in Vietnam dont want to develop the same way that China has, said Ms. Anh, who studied economics in Soviet-era Czechoslovakia.We want to follow the Western-oriented way.While the United States is the largest market for Vietnamese exports, Vietnams biggest trading partner is China.Yet Vietnam runs a significant trade deficit with its populous neighbor, and Vietnamese economists worry that China doesnt play fairly.China is one of the few countries in the world that doesnt observe international law in many areas, said Le Dang Doanh, an influential economist who has advised members of the Vietnamese Politburo on trade.The Vietnamese watched in alarm last year when Beijing reacted to an international tribunals dismissal of Chinas expansive claims over the South China Sea by ignoring and even mocking the judgment.Vietnam and four other governments have claims of their own on the resource-rich waterway that conflict with Chinas.Photo It is hard to overstate the level of Vietnamese antipathy toward China.In a country where public protest is rare and risky, some of the few large-scale demonstrations in Vietnam in recent years have been against the Chinese.But this national aversion puts Vietnams leadership in a bind.It cannot ignore Chinas growing economic magnetism.For many members of APEC, China now ranks as their No.1 trading partner.In return for investment and project financing roads, railways, dams, airports and colossal government buildings leaders of regional economies are increasingly doing Beijings bidding.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Cambodia and Laos have

ordered construction halted on a disputed sandbar in the South China Sea, a move widely regarded as intended to placate Beijing.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Since taking office last year, Mr. Duterte has deemed the era of American military and economic pre-eminence over, and has called China his countrys best and faithful friend.He has been rewarded with billions of dollars in infrastructure investment from Beijing.The U.S. has been playing catch-up to Chinas charm offensive since the turn of the new century, said Tang Siew Mun, who heads the Southeast Asia center at the Iseas-Yusof Ishak Institute, a think tank in Singapore.Vietnam, more than any other country, has grown practiced at divining when not to challenge the two Pacific powers both of which it fought within the last half-century.Photo In the 1970s and 1980s, China seized spits of land in the South China Sea that Vietnam had controlled or that were unoccupied but claimed by Hanoi.Yet perhaps sensing an American reluctance to confront China in the South China Sea, Vietnam has declined to take China to international court, as the Philippines did, even as the Chinese have turned disputed reefs and sandbars into militarized islands.Chinese pressure continues, despite the United States supplying the Vietnamese Coast Guard with a cutter and new patrol boats.This year, a Spanish company with prospecting rights from Vietnam suspended drilling in an oil block off the coast of Vietnam.Beijing claims part of the waters as its own.In 2014, the Chinese parked a state-owned oil rig off Danang, where Mr. Trump attended the APEC summit meeting on Friday, in a forceful incursion into what Hanoi considers its territorial waters.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Living next to China, which has ambitions to become the most powerful country in the world, is not easy, said Vo Van Tao, a popular political blogger.To lower the heat, Vietnam needs to withdraw from areas that belong to Vietnam.Grand strategy is beyond the worldview of Vietnamese like Do Van Duc.In 1979, he was stationed on the border with China, as part of an antiaircraft artillery unit, when hundreds of thousands of Peoples Liberation Army soldiers from China flooded south.The Vietnamese, while outmanned, put up an unexpectedly robust defense.Within a month, the Chinese, professing that they had taught the Vietnamese a lesson for interfering in regional geopolitics, withdrew.During the war with China, Mr. Duc was only 17 years old, but he came to understand one thing then that today, as a security guard living in Hanoi, he said he still clings to.We cannot trust the Chinese, he said.They are our ancient enemy, and that will not change.
To Dodge Jerry Jones, Other Owners Speed Up Roger Goodell’s Contract:::::People familiar with the contract negotiations, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they involve internal league matters, said the package was 80 percent to 90 percent completed, with only a handful of minor details yet to be finished.As a nonvoting member of the compensation committee, Jones, though, continued to lobby the committee working on the pay package.Last week, The New York Times reported that he told the six owners on the committee that he had hired the lawyer David Boies and was prepared to take legal action against them and the league if they did not change Goodells deal.Jones has insisted that Goodells deal needs to be restructured to account for the poor way he has navigated the league through recent turmoil, and that more of his pay should be performance-based bonuses.After Jones threatened to sue the members of the committee which includes the owners of the Chiefs, the Falcons, the Giants, the Patriots, the Steelers and the Texans he was removed as a nonvoting member.Photo Jones was fully aware of, and in agreement with, the committees efforts to restructure the contract, according to people familiar with the committees work.On Aug. 9, Goodell traveled from his summer home in Maine to New York to meet with the compensation committee at Patroon, a restaurant a few blocks from the leagues headquarters in Midtown Manhattan.The mood was comfortable.Two of the owners, Robert K. Kraft of the New England Patriots and Arthur Blank of the Atlanta Falcons, joked about how, when they walked to the restaurant together, fans had stopped them to say they were surprised that they were together after their teams faced off in the Super Bowl in February.In a private room, the owners discussed the structure of Goodells new deal and some of the finer points the commissioner wanted added.Jones was not in New York, but was listening on a speaker phone.We got to a good place that night, one person involved in the dinner said.Jerry was on board with all of it.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Two days later, everything changed when Goodell suspended the Cowboys star running back, Ezekiel Elliott, for six games based on an accusation of domestic violence by his former girlfriend.In addition to railing against the decision and questioning the way the commissioner and his staff handled the investigation, Jones began to lobby the compensation committee and other owners to pause and alter Goodells new pay deal.Advertisement Continue reading the main story On his radio show on Friday, Jones denied that his effort to block the contract extension had anything to do with Elliott, saying it was all about Goodells performance lately.In October, when all 32 owners met in New York, Blank, the chairman of the committee, briefed them on the structure of the deal.There was little opposition.But several weeks ago, Jones held a conference call with more than a dozen owners not on the compensation committee to discuss Goodells extension.When that failed to turn the tide against the extension, Jones spoke on a conference call last week with the compensation committee and threatened to take legal action.Stunned, the committee took the extraordinary step of removing Jones from the committee, and lawyers have since handled communication between the committee and Jones.Joness threat now appears to have galvanized the committee and Goodell to conclude the last few items in the new contract.Goodell is currently paid around $30 million a year, including a set of rolling bonuses that in effect make most of his compensation guaranteed.In his new package, Goodell would receive roughly the same amount, but only if certain performance targets were met.After the owners voted unanimously in May to extend Goodells contract for five more years, the compensation committee created a new structure in which 88 percent of the commissioners compensation would be based on an array of metrics tied to the leagues financial performance.Many of those metrics would be overseen by other owners on other committees, broadening the number of people who would decide how much the commissioner would make.Goodell, who has sought to defuse the controversy over players protesting racism by kneeling during the national anthem, has devoted more time in recent days to working out the final details so this controversy, too, might subside.
Venezuelan Debt Crisis Widens, With Power Company in Default:::::Photo Venezuela showed new signs of a financial unraveling on Friday, as the state electricity company was declared in default.The announcement of the countrys first bond default came three days before the government was to begin talks with investors to refinance and restructure more than half of its $120 billion in debt.This is the first drizzle in a huge thunderstorm, said Jose L. Valera, an international energy lawyer in the Houston office of the Mayer Brown law firm.The whole country of Venezuela is bankrupt.The electricity company, Corpoelec, based in Caracas, was unable to make a $28 million payment on a $650 million bond.The bond was originally issued by Electricidad de Caracas before it was nationalized as a Corpoelec subsidiary a decade ago.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The default was announced in a notice by Wilmington Trust after bondholders complained that they had not received payment on a coupon that was due on Oct. 10 but had a grace period that ended on Thursday.
Review: Two Contrasting Views of Silicon Valley’s Influence:::::One does not have to be sympathetic to a more benign view of the technology industry to appreciate Ms. Berlins deeply researched and dramatic narrative of Silicon Valleys early years in Troublemakers.To tell this story, she selects seven lesser-known but influential figures to follow closely throughout that period.These include the first woman to take a technology company public, the first chairman of Apple, and a man who played critical roles in government to create the internet and in industry to commercialize it through the personal computer.Their names will most likely be unfamiliar, but their meticulously told stories permit the reader to gain a nuanced understanding of the emergence of the broader technology ecosystem that has enabled Silicon Valley to thrive.Nuance is not a word that comes to mind in reading Mr. Cohens attack on Silicon Valleys powers that be.The first two chapters are devoted to key figures in the history of Stanfords administration and computer science department, emphasizing both the universitys willingness to trade off academic rigor for financial gain and its institutional sympathy for eugenics in the early 1900s and, more recently, extreme libertarianism.These underlying themes, in Mr. Cohens view, underpin the Stanford model of integrating the hacker and the entrepreneur.This model is reflected in staking William Hewlett and David Packard in the 1930s, establishing the Stanford Industrial Park in the 1950s and obtaining a $336 million payout from Google stock in return for granting the exclusive PageRank license.It is this unholy alliance between hacker and entrepreneur values that Mr. Cohen rails against for the balance of the book.Although he pauses for a handful of pages to speak about Microsoft If the Know-It-Alls values represent a merger of a hackers radical individualism and an entrepreneurs greed, then only one man can be considered their forefather: Bill Gates he believes that the negative ramifications only fully flourished with the widespread adoption of the World Wide Web starting in the late 1990s.And so beginning with Marc Andreessen, who developed the first commercialized web browser, Netscape Navigator, The Know-It-Alls proceeds to attack the character of just about every boldfaced name among tech billionaires.All are found guilty of either always promoting the insidious tech dogma that places no constraints on their ability to disrupt the status quo for their own financial gain or as in the case of the once idealistic founders of Google and Facebook having along the way been seduced by the power and money offered by venture capitalists.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The history that underpins that overarching thesis feels both selective and less than rigorous.Niels Reimers, the founder of Stanfords Office of Technology Licensing and one of the seven key industry figures profiled in detail in Troublemakers, is not even mentioned in The-Know-It-Alls.Given the complex negotiations required to secure university approval, this seems like a significant oversight for a book whose thesis hinges in part on Stanfords supposed unthinking commercialism.And statements like computer science was still something of an obscure discipline in the late 1980s just dont hold up to scrutiny.By 1990, there were almost 800 computer science degree programs offered at colleges and universities, enrolling tens of thousands of students.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Although Mr. Cohen has identified legitimately disturbing aspects of the tech culture, he becomes repetitive, and his tone is unnecessarily conspiratorial.He also ignores when the facts contradict his assertions.Mr. Cohen complains about the PayPal mafia, former employees who provided each other with cash, counsel and contacts.Mr. Cohen finds something jarring about a group of self-styled survival of the fittest free marketeers committing to a strategy of collective risk and mutual support.When the Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales is profiled as a contrast to the libertarian fanaticism and raw commercialism of the Know-It-Alls, his inability to raise funding is used to reinforce this point: Wales and his partners had no rich friends to lean on in tough times.The narrative makes clear, however, that his problem was a flawed business model, not his lack of access to the PayPal mafia or other venture investors.Similarly, Mr. Cohen does not directly confront the irony that the story of Wikipedias ultimate success was made possible only by its free-riding on Googles powerful but in his view morally suspect search engine.The tech industry has earned a takedown book that documents its self-interested justifications for any number of policies that are clearly not in the public interest.Its track record on matters including cybersecurity, gender equality and privacy is shameful.The brief profiles of The Know-It Alls, sprinkled with gratuitous ad hominem observations (for example, Mr. Cohen writes that PayPal is responsible for releasing into the wild a self-satisfied Peter Thiel, a one-man wrecking crew who has been sowing chaos through American society up to this very day), do not get the job done.Given the profound impact on our lives of the technology industry and the apparent flaws in its current culture, both books leave the reader wondering where to go from here.The Know-It-Alls suggests that Europe provides a model relying on extensive regulation but, given the absence of any European tech giants of note, this seems like throwing the baby out with the bath water.Although the compelling history in Troublemakers provides a number of tantalizing clues as to where things got off track, this is not the focus of the book.Ms. Berlin does not whitewash the aspects of even the valleys early years that foreshadow the more profound cultural issues to emerge in the industrys middle age, writing, It takes a certain kind of audacity to think you can launch a company, much less invent an industry and audacity often veers into arrogance.But she doesnt go out of her way to explore their implications, either.When the founding of Fairchild Semiconductor is discussed, William Shockley is mentioned in passing, but Ms. Berlin notes that he had not yet fully descended into the paranoia and eugenic fervor that would later mar his reputation.In fact, his paranoia and abusiveness at least were already well known and, given that these qualities have been recurring contemporary industry themes, would have been worth examining.Similarly, when its noted that a key to the venture capitalist Don Valentines success was his willingness to overlook deviant behavior, some discussion of the downside of letting the hacker culture run wild might have made sense.Silicon Valleys history is still being written.Both of these books are important reminders that whether or not it is ultimately a story with a happy ending will be a function of our collective willingness to closely examine the sectors origins to better understand not only the sources of innovation but how the most destructive aspects of the culture were allowed to fester for so long.
For Student Borrowers, Time to Start Repaying Loans:::::If you have not received any sort of notice by now, it is best to contact your loan servicer, said Diane Cheng, associate research director at the Institute for College Access and Success, a nonprofit organization.It is up to you to keep your servicer apprised of your whereabouts, she said.Even if you have not received an official notice, you are still responsible for repaying the loan.If you dont know who your servicer is, you can check the National Student Loan Data System to find out which company handles the loans you borrowed from the federal government.(You probably already have a Federal Student Aid ID, but if not, you will need to create one to log on and check your loans.)Loans from banks or other private lenders, rather than the federal government, are not tracked in the federal database.You may be able to find them by checking your credit report.Or you can contact the financial aid office at your alma mater, said Persis Yu, director of the Student Loan Borrower Assistance Project at the National Consumer Law Center.Unless you tell your servicer otherwise, you will be enrolled in a standard 10-year repayment plan.If you are worried that you cannot afford the payments, the federal government has programs offering more affordable monthly payments.Details are available from the Department of Education and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.The Department of Educations tool for estimating repayment can help you compare what your payments would be under the different options.Users should contact their loan servicer directly, however, to confirm eligibility for the various options, Ms. Cheng said.Recently, questions have been raised about the federal governments Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, which is intended to allow people working in teaching, nonprofit, social services or other government jobs to have their loans canceled after 10 years.Some borrowers, particularly those who joined the program soon after it was enacted a decade ago, are finding that loans they thought would be forgiven might not be, because of complex requirements.But the program remains an option for current borrowers, as long as they have the correct type of jobs, loans and payment plans to qualify.Certainly there are reasons to be cautious, said Adam Minsky, a lawyer specializing in student loans, but the program is still very much in existence.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Ms. Cheng advises borrowers to submit a certification form, provided by the Department of Education, to document that they are employed at a qualified job and that their payments are being properly credited, so that they remain on track to have their debt forgiven.Here are some questions and answers about repaying student loans: Are grace periods the same for all loans?One type of federal loan, known as a Perkins loan, has a nine-month grace period.And some loans, like federal PLUS loans made to parents, have no grace period.Repayment typically starts as soon as funds are distributed.Grace periods for private loans may vary, but six-month grace periods are typical, said Martha Holler, a spokeswoman for the private student loan lender Sallie Mae.The companys website offers suggestions for organizing your loan documents to help ensure that you keep up with payments.One recommendation: Create a spreadsheet listing your loans and contact information for your servicers.What if I have a complaint about my student loan servicer?You can file a complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau or the Department of Education.Are there any discounts available for my loan payments?Typically, you can knock a quarter of a percentage point 0.25 percent off your monthly payment, for both federal and private loans, if you agree to have the money automatically debited from your bank account.
Court Blocks Berkshire Museum’s Sale of Rockwell Works and Other Art:::::The injunction will expire on Dec. 11, but the court added that the attorney generals office may move to extend it.Sothebys had described the Berkshire Museum works as a superb collection that was among the highlights of its American Art sale on Monday.In addition to Shuffletons Barbershop, which Sothebys said Rockwell created for the cover of The Saturday Evening Post in 1950, the auction was to include Rockwells Blacksmiths Boy Heel and Toe (Shaftsbury Blacksmith Shop), which was estimated to have a price of $7 million to $10 million.Among other museum works to be offered on Monday were The White Dress by Thomas Wilmer Dewing, Hunter in Winter Wood by George Henry Durrie and Connecticut River Valley, Claremont, New Hampshire by Albert Bierstadt.Last summer, the financially strapped museum announced the planned sale of 40 works, including Impressionist and modern art, contemporary art, 19th-century European paintings, American art and Chinese art.The museum said the proceeds were needed to build its endowment, renovate its building and expand programming to create a heightened emphasis on science and history.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Officials from the museum and from Sothebys said they were disappointed by the decision.Elizabeth McGraw, the president of the museums board of trustees called the court decision a setback for the institution and its neighbors.The auction that held the promise of addressing our museums serious financial difficulties will have to proceed without our works, and our plans for the future will be delayed, she said in a written statement.Until that process resolves, we will continue to do what we do every day: bring our passion for art, science and discovery to our community.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.The auction house confirmed that Mondays auction would go forward with the rest of more than 70 works that have been slated for sale.We have never doubted that the board of trustees acted in good faith and was well within their legal rights, Sothebys said in a statement, and we remain confident that they will prevail in their plans to ensure a bright future for the Berkshire Museum in support of the community of Pittsfield and western Massachusetts.Michael B. Keating, a lawyer for the Rockwell family and others seeking to stop the sale, said his clients fully supported the decision that blocked the auction of the museum items and the irreparable harm that would occur if these paintings were to be sold.Museum organizations have condemned the museums deaccessioning plan, saying it violated guidelines against the sale of art to subsidize operating and other expenses instead of using such proceeds to enhance or maintain a collection.Rockwells sons and a group of museum members sued separately to stop the sale.But Judge John A. Agostini of Berkshire Superior Court found that they lacked legal standing.Judge Agostini also denied a request by the attorney general to block the sale.The states lawyers told the appeals court on Friday that the museum was looking to sell nearly all of its valuable art.Doing so would violate a number of trusts, they said, including what they described as a promise to Rockwell that his works would remain in the permanent collection and another pledge that some of the works slated for auction would never leave Pittsfield.This sale is unprecedented in terms of the number, value and prominence of the works being proposed, the centrality of these works to the museums collection, and the process the museum employed to select and dispose of the deaccessioned items, the attorney generals office said in its filing on Friday.The lower court had described the attorney generals office as a reluctant warrior, whose objections had not included specific details on how it would review the planned sale.It noted that a delay would have considerable financial consequences for the museum.It did not find that the museum had violated any of the charitable trusts through which it had come into possession of the art.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The attorney generals office countered in its filing on Friday that while the museum could sell the works in the future, any items disposed of at auction would be very difficult to get back.It said the museum had not abided by its most pressing mission to preserve its charitable purpose and that whatever the financial hurdles, its relationship to other museums and with donors would be damaged by the sale.
No Excuses, People: Get the New Shingles Vaccine:::::This really looks to be a breakthrough in vaccinating older adults, agreed Dr. Jeffrey Cohen, a physician and researcher at the National Institutes of Health.Whats causing the enthusiasm: Shingrix, which the pharmaceutical firm GlaxoSmithKline intends to begin shipping this month.Large international trials have shown that the vaccine prevents more than 90 percent of shingles cases, even at older ages.The currently available shingles vaccine, called Zostavax, only prevents about half of shingles cases in those over age 60 and has demonstrated far less effectiveness among elderly patients.Yet those are the people most at risk for this blistering disease, with its often intense pain, its threat to vision and the associated nerve pain that sometimes last months, even years, after the initial rash fades.Almost all older Americans harbor the varicella zoster virus that causes shingles; they acquired it with childhood chickenpox, whether they knew they had the disease or not.The virus stays dormant until, for unknown reasons, it erupts decades later.The risk rises sharply after age 50.Shingles is hardly a minor menace.A million cases occur in the United States each and every year, Dr. Schaffner said.If youre fortunate enough to reach your 80th birthday, you stand a one-in-three to one-in-two chance of shingles.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Preventing the great majority of these cases along with the risk of lingering and debilitating nerve pain, called postherpetic neuralgia would represent a major advance in public health.So while the old vaccine will remain on the market, the C.D.C.committee voted to make Shingrix the preferred vaccine and recommended it for all adults over age 50 a group younger by a decade than those earlier encouraged to get Zostavax.The committee also recommended Shingrix for adults whove previously gotten Zostavax, since a smaller study in people over age 65 demonstrated effectiveness and safety in those already vaccinated.The Food and Drug Administration approved Shingrix last month.Once the C.D.C.s director endorses the committees recommendations, and the agency publishes them, insurers including Medicare and Medicaid will start covering the vaccine.By early 2018, it should be broadly available to consumers in the U.S., said Dr. Thomas Breuer, chief medical officer of GSK Vaccines.(Canada has also approved Shingrix; it awaits approval in Australia, Japan and Europe.)What makes the new vaccine so promising, especially for older adults?* It provides better protection against shingles from the start.Though Zostavax, introduced in 2006, can reduce shingles cases by about half (and postherpetic neuralgia by two-thirds), that overall rate conceals big differences by age.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.That vaccines effectiveness drops from 64 percent for people in their 60s to 38 percent among those over age 70, and falls still lower for people in their 80s.But the new vaccine protects nearly as well in older groups as in the middle-aged.Shingrix racked up a 97 percent effectiveness rate in adults over age 50 and, in a separate study of people over age 70, prevented 90 percent of shingles in those 70 to well past age 80.In groups such as the elderly, who often dont maintain vigorous responses to vaccines, this represents extremely strong disease protection, said Dr. Kathleen Dooling, an epidemiologist at the C.D.C.Advertisement Continue reading the main story * Shingrixs protection appears to last longer.Among seniors, the effectiveness of Zostavax wanes with disappointing speed.After 11 years, the protection was close to zero, Dr. Harpaz said.Regulators dont yet have 11 years of data on Shingrix, but in some samples, it remained effective for six years or longer, according to GSK.That should great reduce the incidence of postherpetic neuralgia, too, assuming the 42 million people in their 50s start getting vaccinated.* The new vaccine may protect people with compromised immune systems.A substantial number of older Americans have suppressed immunity because theyre undergoing chemotherapy or transplants, have H.I.V.or take steroids.For them, the previous vaccine was off-limits because it was made with a weakened live virus.Yet immune suppression itself leaves the people vulnerable to shingles.Shingrix, a recombinant vaccine made from a glycoprotein and a combination of immunity boosters called adjuvants, doesnt pose the same danger.The C.D.C.committee held off on recommending Shingrix for the immunocompromised, because GSK is still running trials with these patients.But since the F.D.A.did not declare Shingrix contraindicated for them when approving it, they can get the vaccine once its available.Public health advocates do foresee a couple of potential problems.First, Shingrix requires two doses, administered at least two months apart.Prodding the older population to get a single shot has proved tough: barely 31 percent of those over age 60 have been vaccinated against shingles.How much harder will it be to persuade people to get two Shingrix injections?Further, it tends to be a bit of an ouch-y vaccine, Dr. Schaffner cautioned.In studies, most older recipients said theyd experienced pain, redness or swelling in their upper arms for a day or two after the shot, and 8.5 percent of those over age 70 deemed those symptoms uncomfortable enough to interfere with normal activities.About half of those over age 70 reported more systemic side effects like fatigue, fever or aching joints, lasting one to two days.Physicians and pharmacists should prepare people for such reactions, Dr. Schaffner said.Advertisement Continue reading the main story If people anticipate it, theyll cope with it better.Theyll take a couple of Tylenol and not worry that something is seriously wrong.They may feel pocketbook pain, too.Zostavax is the most expensive adult vaccine, and at $140 for each dose (plus the cost of administering the injection), Shingrix will be pricier still.The 50- to 65-year-old cohort, many of whom have coverage under employee health plans, may not find that much of a barrier.At older ages, cost matters more.Medicare will cover Shingrix under Part D (like its predecessor), not under Part B like the flu vaccine.That complicates reimbursement for those seeking vaccination in doctors offices, so Medicare patients will probably find it simpler to head for a pharmacy.But not all Medicare recipients have Part D, and those that do could face co-payments.Still, its no contest: The hazards of shingles and its complications dwarf any problems yet reported with Shingrix.Compared to shingles, a little arm pain for a day or so is a small price to pay, Dr. Schaffner said.If you know people whove had this illness, youll be first in line for this vaccine.
Egon Schiele Is Still Too Racy for Some, Nearly 100 Years After His Death:::::VIENNA Its been nearly a century since the Austrian painter Egon Schiele died, but his art charged with erotic energy and usually showing more than a little skin still ruffles feathers.A series of advertisements showing Schieles graphically contorted bodies (with explicitly rendered private parts) didnt make it past the critical eyes of those selling advertising space in Britain and Germany nor the anti-nudity restrictions on Facebook.The artworks had to be covered up.Both Schiele and his mentor, the painter Gustav Klimt, died in 1918, the same year World War I and the Austro-Hungarian empire ended.In 2018, museums in Vienna will mount a yearlong series of exhibitions and events to mark the centennial: Stairway to Klimt begins at Viennas Kunsthistorisches Museum on Feb. 13; Egon Schiele, Expression and Lyricism opens at the Leopold Museum on Feb. 23.Viennas Tourist Board has also been working on a campaign celebrating these and other big-draw exhibitions, and Viennese modernism in general.But the campaign ran into an unusual glitch the offices originally planned posters, featuring large Schiele nudes, turned out to be too racy.Advertisement Continue reading the main story According to a Vienna Tourist Board spokeswoman, Helena Hartlauer, Transport for London rejected the original images, citing trepidation about depicting genitals in public space.
Cyberattack Casts a Long Shadow on Equifax’s Earnings:::::Photo Equifax has suffered a new intrusion into its profitability.Costs relating to the consumer credit reporting agencys major cyberattack helped knock earnings down 27 percent in the third quarter from a year earlier.Revenue also took a big hit.And the likely biggest expenses including a long list of unquantified legal exposures are yet to rain down.The Atlanta-based company, led by an interim chief executive, Paulino Barros, reported $87.5 million of pretax expenses in the period related to the hack, which allowed attackers to extract information on as many as 145.5 million consumers.Some of the expenses are one-offs, and others wont be.The company expects up to $75 million in additional expenses this quarter.That may be only the tip of the iceberg.Equifax is one of a handful of credit-scoring companies that collect peoples data on a huge scale and sell it to lenders, making it almost systemically important.That arguably means the bar for protecting its data is higher than for other corporations.It now faces 240 class-action lawsuits in North America, and investigations by a whos who of watchdogs, including the Securities and Exchange Commission, Britains Financial Conduct Authority and the attorneys general of all 50 states.Equifax says it cannot yet estimate damages and fines, but there are likely to be some of both.Although overall revenue was up in the third quarter, sales in its biggest division, which handles American consumer credit reports, fell 3 percent.That was a sharp turnaround from 7 percent growth in the first half, considering that the breach was made public only on Sept. 7.To give that result, the units revenue in the last three weeks of the quarter would have had to slump by about a third from what was expected, according to Breakingviews calculations.Executives expect overall revenue to decline by 3 to 4 percent in the fourth quarter as customers defer more orders.Investors have lopped off about a quarter of Equifaxs market capitalization since the breach.Thats consistent with a sustained drop in profit on the scale of the third quarter, but it doesnt allow for an extended slide in revenue or big legal outlays.The investors may be too sanguine.
Senate Plan Could Increase Taxes on Some Middle-Class Workers:::::Both the House and Senate bills would cut the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent and provide business tax benefits, such as the ability to immediately expense purchases of equipment.The Times analysis, using the open-source software TaxBrain, found that roughly one-quarter of families in the middle class would see their taxes increase in 2018, by about $1,000 on average.By 2026, the share seeing an increase would rise slightly, to about one-third, and the average increase would rise to about $1,600.For the majority of middle-class families that receive a tax cut, the average savings would be about $1,300 in 2018 and $1,700 in 2026. Who Will See Tax Cuts From Senate Plan?Under the Senate bill, four out of five high earners would receive tax cuts in 2018. cut no change increase Under $30,000 $30,000-$50,000 $50,000-$75,000 $75,000-$100,000 $100,000-$200,000 $200,000-$500,000 More than $500,000 36% 61 57 27 15 73 9 17 78 21 64 36 67 33 82 18 - 3 cut no change increase Under $30,000 $30,000-$50,000 $50,000-$75,000

from the Senate plan in 2018.But for many in the middle class, the savings would be relatively small.The table below shows the average savings, by income, for those who would receive a tax cut.The Times analysis defines the middle class broadly as those earning between two-thirds and twice the median household income, or about $50,000 to $160,000 per year for a family of three.To focus on families, the analysis excluded individual filers and households headed by people 65 or older and is adjusted for the size of each household.Under the House bill, The Times has found, about half of middle-class families would pay more in taxes in 2026.The analysis did not seek to calculate how workers might benefit from a steep cut in the corporate tax rate, which both the Senate and House bills would reduce to 20 percent from a top rate of 35 percent today, or project how the bills might increase economic growth and, with it, Americans wages.On Friday, the independent Tax Foundation released an analysis of the plans growth effects.It projected that the Senate bill would increase gross domestic product by 3.7 percent over the next decade and raise wages by 2.9 percent across the economy.For taxpayers earning more than $1 million a year, the Senate bill offers a more limited upside and downside than the House bill.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The Senate bill is less likely than the House bill to yield tax increases for high-income Americans, in part because it cuts the top marginal personal tax rate, while the House bill creates a so-called bubble rate that would actually raise taxes on many high-salaried workers.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.The Senate measure would also produce a smaller average tax windfall for high earners than the House version, in part by offering less generous benefits for owners of businesses known as pass-throughs, which are not organized as corporations.Under the Senate plan, Americans are especially likely to face a tax increase if they have a smaller family, have mostly wage income instead of investment income, or claim some of the many deductions that the bill repeals, like those for state and local taxes and employee business expenses, said Lily Batchelder, a professor and tax specialist at New York University Law School, who worked on economic policy in the Obama administration.They are increasing taxes on many in the middle class, while concentrating their tax cuts on the wealthy.The Senate bill appears much better for the very wealthy than it is for the somewhat wealthy.About half of families earning between two and three times the median income or about $160,000 to $240,000 for a family of three would pay more in 2018 than under existing law.But among the richest families, those earning more than about $500,000 for a family of three, nearly 90 percent would get a tax cut.The findings come with an important caveat: The Senate bill, as written, appears unable to muster the 60 votes needed to avoid a Democratic filibuster, meaning Republicans will need to amend it to comply with the budget reconciliation rules and allow permit passage by a simple majority.Those changes could likely include putting expiration dates on some of the bills major provisions, which could make the final version of the bill look less favorable to the middle class, particularly in later years.The Timess figures are based on an analysis of Census Bureau data using a tax model from the Open Source Policy Center, a Washington research organization affiliated with the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute.Because the analysis is based on publicly available data, not actual tax records, it may not capture all the intricacies of Americans household finances.The Senate bill differs sharply from the House version in its approach to cutting taxes on businesses.But when it comes to taxes on individuals and families, the bills are more similar than different.Both would double the standard deduction while eliminating a raft of deductions and credits.Both would make the child tax credit more generous.Both would restructure federal income tax brackets to impose lower marginal tax rates at most income levels, although the Senate approach, unlike the House version, doesnt eliminate two brackets entirely.The Senate bill includes features that would make its plan more favorable to the middle class.It preserves some popular tax deductions and credits that the House bill initially would have eliminated, and it makes the child tax credit somewhat more generous and widely available.On the other hand, the Senate bill, unlike the House version, would eliminate the deduction for property taxes, which could lead to higher federal taxes for homeowners in areas with high property tax rates or expensive housing markets.Aparna Mathur, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute, said senators could improve the bill with further changes, such as expanding the earned-income tax credit and extending the benefits of the child tax credit to more low-income taxpayers.We clearly need to do more to help the lowest-income families, she said.At the same time, we can engage in more base broadening for the highest-income households, perhaps by eliminating and not just capping the mortgage-interest deduction.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The Times analysis found that roughly one-fifth of the Senate bills cuts in 2018 would go to families and individuals earning $1 million or more, and close to half would go to people earning at least $200,000.Between 10 million and 15 million taxpayers earning less than $100,000 a year would pay more than under existing law.Families earning more than $1 million a year would see their after-tax income rise by about 1.7 percent in 2018 compared with what they would make under current law, nearly triple the gains enjoyed by those earning less than $200,000.Over all, the Senate bill would cut individual income taxes by about $30 billion in 2018, and by $900 billion over the next decade, according to Congresss nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation.And most people in all income groups would see a tax cut, although the cuts would be modest for most lower earners.
Gilbert Rogin, 87, Magazine Editor and Writer of Droll Fiction, Dies:::::Gilbert Leslie Rogin was born on Nov. 14, 1929, in Brooklyn.His father, Robert, was a lawyer.His mother, the former Lillian Ruderman, had been an actress who, under the name Billie Rudell, made several Broadway appearances in the 1920s.Mr. Rogin grew up in Manhattan and graduated from Columbia College.In 1951 he began a brief stint at The New Yorker as an office gofer; his assignment on his second day on the job was to bring a suit of clothes to a funeral home for Harold Ross to be laid out in.Mr. Ross, the magazines founding editor, had just died.In 1955, after two years in the Army, Mr. Rogin joined Sports Illustrated, which Time Inc. had begun the year before.His job was to clip articles from newspapers and the wire services for filing in the magazines library, but he began writing almost immediately, and soon was a reporter.Photo He became known for elegant phrasing and carefully observed profiles of figures like the boxer Floyd Patterson and the basketball star Bill Russell.In 2014, when the magazine commemorated its 60th anniversary by republishing 60 of its best articles, one by Mr. Rogin was among them: 12 Days Before the Mast, his account of participating in a sailing race from California to Hawaii aboard a 55-foot yawl.Not a sailing fan, he found the experience underwhelming.It was a numbing, embittering and largely useless 12 days, he wrote.There was no plot, no suspense.Our progress was as lacking in memorable incident as the passage of an hour hand across the face of a clock.We proved only that a curving, erratic line is not the shortest distance between two points.When not on assignment for Sports Illustrated, Mr. Rogin began writing short fiction.The New Yorker published its first Rogin story, Ernest Observes, in 1963, and they came regularly after that, right up through The Hard Parts in November 1978.More appeared in other magazines.A story collection, The Fencing Master, came out in 1965, and in 1971 Mr. Rogin published his first novel, What Happens Next?The poet L. E. Sissman, reviewing that book in The New York Times, called it a novel of the first importance.Advertisement Continue reading the main story A second novel, Preparations for the Ascent, thematically related to the first, came in 1980.In 2010 the two novels were reissued by Verse Chorus Press as a single volume.Jay Jennings, in the introduction to that republication, wrote of the similarities that run through much of Mr. Rogins funny, understated fiction.The protagonist, Mr. Jennings wrote, no matter the name, is a (presumably autobiographical) middle-aged, Jewish, Manhattanite male, a magazine writer of eclectic intellectual interests and eccentric habits.As to why Mr. Rogins fiction, whose admirers included John Updike, had been largely forgotten, Mr. Jennings speculated that oversaturation might have played a part.He was writing at the very apex of the market for protagonists who were middle-aged, Jewish, Manhattanite male intellectuals/writers and musers, Mr. Jennings wrote.The ur-text in this genre is Saul Bellows Herzog (1964), with cohorts Mailer, Malamud and others doing variations on the theme.It also certainly did not help that Mr. Rogin abruptly abandoned fiction.The story that drew the discouraging New Yorker rejection back in 1980, My Masterpieces, did eventually see the light of print, in 2010, when The Lowbrow Reader published it.(It appears in the anthology The Lowbrow Reader Reader as well.)The magazine also arranged for a Mr. Rogin to do a reading at an event at the Housing Works Bookstore in SoHo.Photo Gil was accustomed to the upper echelon of publishing The New Yorker and whatnot and here he was, publishing his lost masterpiece in some idiots comedy zine, Jay Ruttenberg, editor of The Lowbrow Reader, who joined with Mr. Jennings in getting Mr. Rogins novels republished, said in an email.But he was genuinely appreciative of our efforts and visibly delighted by the attention.Mr. Rogins shift away from fiction coincided with his rise to the top editing spot at Sports Illustrated, where his eccentric style alienated some writers Dan Jenkins was one but was embraced by others.Hed make his changes with a touch so light that you could only nod appreciatively, Jerry Kirshenbaum, a writer and editor at the magazine for 30 years, wrote in an email.You didnt feel like your fingers were being chopped off the way it was with some other editors.With Gil, it was like having a manicure.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Yet there could also be bellowing and red-penciled rage, and savvy staff members learned that Mr. Rogin was a man of sometimes strange routines that were not to be disrupted.Between 2 and 3, everybody had to be silent while he took his nap, Mr. Lidz said in an interview.Breakfast was always Bumble Bee tuna eaten from the can.He would often edit in the bathroom adjacent to his office.When he traveled, his assistant had to be sure not only that the hotel had a pool but that it was suitable for Mr. Rogin to swim his daily laps in no kidney shapes allowed.An oft-told tale: Once, on the road, Mr. Rogin turned up for his swim to find that the hotel pool was being drained; he frantically swam his miles worth of laps anyway, racing the declining water level.Mr. Rogin married Ruth Copes in 1963.That marriage ended in divorce.He is survived by his wife, with whom he had a relationship of more than 30 years; they married in 2010.His oddities aside, Mr. Rogin was adept and versatile enough that, in 1984, Time moved him despite his reluctance to Discover, its struggling science magazine, which he helped stabilize.In 1986 it won a National Magazine Award for general excellence.In 1987 Mr. Rogin became corporate editor, the No.3 editing position in the Time Inc. empire.In that capacity, he helped Quincy Jones found Vibe magazine in 1993.And his volatile impatience seemed to grow.He felt that the guilty should be shot, Jason McManus, who as editor in chief was his boss, said on the occasion of Mr. Rogins retirement in 1993.I often made him unhappy by my reluctance to take summary action on some perceived outrage; on the other hand, if I instantly had taken Gils advice, hardly any of our present managing editors would still be employed, nor would I.
‘It’s a Black Thing’: Offensive Quip Becomes a Rallying Cry in Brazil:::::Globo is viscerally opposed to racism in all of its forms, the company said in a statement, adding that Mr. Waack had made comments that everything indicates were of a racist nature.The video was leaked by a former video editor for Globo, who said he was appalled by the remarks at the time but was afraid he could lose his job if he released the video to the public.The video editor, Diego Rocha Pereira, who no longer works for the network, said he had heard the comments as he sat in the networks control room.I rewound the video to be sure, I couldnt believe he would have said that, he told the Jovem Pan radio station.I was so disgusted, I recorded it on my cellphone.Mr. Waack has not publicly responded.In its statement, Globo said, Waack affirms he doesnt remember what he said, given that the audio is not clear, but he offers sincere apologies to those who feel they have been offended.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.On social media, the remark has been turned into a campaign, shining a light on the accomplishments of famous black Brazilians like the 19th-century novelist and poet Machado de Assis, as well as global leaders, including Nelson Mandela, and sports stars and artists.Many people have written on Twitter about their own struggles in a country with a long history of slavery and racism.One person wrote: #ItsABlackThing my mother, a black, single woman, raising 7 children without the help of a white man (my father).Brazil was the last country in the Americas to abolish slavery, in 1888.Over three centuries, some four million Africans were brought here and forced to work in fields, mines and private homes.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Today, just over 50 percent of Brazilians identify as black or biracial, and many Brazilians say there is a racial harmony here that does not exist in the United States.But others say the figures point to a different reality Brazil is a country where the life expectancy of black men is considerably lower than for their white counterparts, and where people of African descent earn 36 percent less than nonblack Brazilians.In recent years, Globo and other television networks have used their powerful positions to combat racism with more prominent roles for black Brazilians on soap operas and reality TV shows.When Brazils first black weather broadcaster on a prime-time news broadcast Maria Jlia Coutinho, known widely by her nickname, Maju was subjected to verbal abuse, her colleagues at Globo promoted the #WeAreAllMaju campaign.In the case of Mr. Waack, a veteran journalist who gained the respect of his colleagues over the years with his coverage of the fall of the Berlin Wall and numerous conflicts in the Middle East, Globo said it was in talks with him about what would happen next.

You Love ‘The Simpsons’? Then Let’s Talk About Apu:::::The piece touched a nerve with audiences, but it was the one-minute section about Apu that people most remembered.Why not make a full-length documentary about his issues with the Kwik-E-Mart owner, Mr. Kondabolu thought, which could serve as a jumping-off point to talk about all the other things the comic had been stewing about?Working with the director Michael Melamedoff, the film crew began production in April 2016, greenlit by truTV as part of its shift to comedy programming.To tackle the project, he enlisted some high-powered help.In one sequence, the actor Aziz Ansari (Master of None) describes being in a car with his dad when a man drives up and asks them where the nearest Quik-E-Mart is.Dr. Vivek Murthy, the 19th surgeon general of the United States, talks about enduring the taunts of an Apu-imitating bully in the seventh grade.And Maulik Pancholy (30 Rock) recounts how much he hated going into 7-Eleven stores as a kid, lest his friends see an Indian store clerk and start doing the Apu thing.In the film, Mr. Kondabolu places Apu within the broader history of Hollywoods depiction of Indians, including Peter Sellerss brownface rendition of an idiot in the 1968 Blake Edwards film The Party and the Indians feasting on chilled monkey brains in Steven Spielbergs Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom.He also reached out to a whos-who of South Asian actors to talk about their experiences in Hollywood, in the vein of Philip Kan Gotandas 1987 play Yankee Dawg You Die and Mr. Ansaris 2015 Master of None episode Indians on TV.Among the anecdotes: Sakina Jaffrey (House of Cards) cornering the market on weeping, ethnic moms of potential rapists and murderers, and Mr. Penn being asked to play a character named Taj Mahal, which he credits with his subsequent starring roles in the Harold and Kumar movies.For the record, Mr. Penn said in an interview, I had a great time doing it.The narrative spine of the film, however, chronicles Mr. Kondabolus attempts to trace the characters origin story and secure an interview with Mr. Azaria, the voice of Apu since the characters creation in 1990.In a 2007 interview, Mr. Azaria, who declined to comment for this article, conceded that his rendering of an Indian accent is not tremendously accurate.Mr. Kondabolu agrees.In the film, he describes Mr. Azarias rendition as a white guy doing an impression of a white guy making fun of my father.Onscreen, Dana Gould, a writer and executive producer on The Simpsons, tries to explain what makes Apu humorous.Barney, the town wino, is funny because hes a drunkard, he explains; Smithers, Mr. Burnss sycophantic assistant, is funny because hes closeted.(Since that interview, Smithers has come out.)Apu?Hes funny because he sounds like an Indian, or at least Mr. Azarias version of one.There are accents that by their nature, to white Americans, I can only speak from experience, sound funny, Mr. Gould says in the film.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.This isnt just a blind spot that the writers had, Mr. Melamedoff said.This was a blind spot we all had, on a national level.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The unintended result: a generation of Indian actors being asked to channel Apu in countless auditions.Here you are, youve gone to theater and film school, youre pursuing this dream, and youre being told, do it just like Apu from The Simpsons, Mr. Penn said in an interview.Still unclear is who originally pushed for Apus broad accent.Was Mr. Azaria asked by producers how offensive can you make it, as he claimed in that earlier interview?Or did he come up with the accent unprompted, as the Simpsons writer Mike Reiss said in a 2016 podcast?Mr. Kondabolu pressed Mr. Azaria for an interview.The two exchanged emails, had one phone conversation (untaped) and even discussed the possibility of conducting the interview on neutral ground (on the podcast WTF With Marc Maron, say, or on NPRs Fresh Air, with Terry Gross).Hari was sort of like, whats the purpose if I cant get Hank, said Utkarsh Ambudkar (Pitch Perfect), who, as Apus Indian-American nephew on a 2016 episode of the series, blasted Apu to his animated face as a sellout and a stereotype.And I was like, are you kidding me?Mr. Ambudkar said.You got all these brown people to come together and talk about something.We could have been talking about model trains!But some 15-year-old kid is going to be like, look at all these powerful, talented, visible brown people in one place.I can do this, too.
No Room for America Left in Those Jeans:::::The news came as a shock.Just two months ago, Mr. Williams, who also runs a marketing company that represents heritage brands like Red Wing and Levis, wrote a paean about his visit to the White Oak plant.Photo What he saw there, he said in an interview, was denim done the right way not mass-produced on modern looms (although the plant has plenty of those too), but painstakingly made on clanking 1940s American Draper X3 shuttle looms that churn out denim featuring a tighter weave, more interesting textures and of course, the de rigueur selvage stitching on the inside seam that jeans lovers proudly reveal by rolling their cuffs.Personality comes at a cost apparently to the company, for starters.A company spokeswoman cited the usual factors changing market demands and foreign competition as reasons it plans to close the plant, even though it was once the worlds largest, and long supplied the denim for Levis iconic 501 jeans.Personality, it must be said, also comes at a cost to consumers.A pair of Tellasons John Graham Mellor jeans, for instance, featuring White Oak denim and oozing with street cred (John Mellor is the real name of the Clashs Joe Strummer, in case you need to be told), sells for $230.For much of the past decade, thats a cost that the cool kids apparently were happy to bear, which accounts for the explosion of retro-inflected denim brands (Tellason, Raleigh Denim, Taylor Stitch and Buck Mason, to name just a few) that used White Oak denim as a pillar of their branding.Its not 2006 anymore, however.Hipsterism is dead (or is it just ubiquitous?), the economy is iffy, and the cheap, disposable ethos of fast fashion has made its mark.That makes it tough when youre in the slow fashion business.Too many consumers simultaneously complain about imported products, job loss and low wages, and then buy their jeans at Costco, with the same brand name as the bacon, toilet paper and dish soap in their cart, said Tony Patella, a founder of Tellason, based in San Francisco, in a reference to Costcos Kirkland brand.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story The Open Thread Fashion Newsletter A look from across The New York Times at the forces that shape the dress codes we share, with Vanessa Friedman as your personal shopper.Sent weekly.Even before Cone Mills made its announcement, however, some premium indie brands that once prominently displayed the Made in the U.S.A. label were starting to embrace a new globalism.The New York brands Unis New York and Outlier now produce much of their clothing in Portugal.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Italian quality at Chinese prices, explained Brad Bennett, who runs the mens wear site Well Spent.And founders of Tellason, Buck Mason and Taylor Stitch all said in interviews that they planned to look to Japan for their denim, once their Cone supply runs out.This is hardly surprising.America may have invented bluejeans, but Japan turned them into a religion.Ultra-premium Japanese brands like Iron Heart and the Flat Head have reverse-engineered the all-American Brando-biker-rebel aesthetic to such a convincing degree that they might as well be sewn in Milwaukee, alongside the Harley-Davidson plant.Even clothiers that seemed eager to wave the flag are suddenly sounding like globalists.As much as the Trump administration is touting America First, we believe we live in a global world, and provenance is becoming less important, said Michael Maher, a founder of Taylor Stitch, which is based in San Francisco.So much for the days when tattooed Brooklyn web designers and rifle-toting Montana ranchers seemingly stood arm in arm, united by their common love of Filson bags, Red Wing boots and White Oak denim.While virtually everyone says they want to keep jobs in the United States, Made in the USA has also become politicized, since the Trump administration attempted to seize the Buy American impulse for itself.Maybe jeans enthusiasts simply have other stuff on their plates to think about.Considering just how bad the news has been lately, the Cone Mills closing is easy to feel unfazed by or, at least, to lose in the fray, said Mr. Bennett of Well Spent.Thats not to say its not still a colossal bummer.But compared to mass deportations, senseless spree killings and environmental decimation, its small potatoes.
Kendrick Lamar and Rihanna Wear Her Jewelry:::::Martine Ali Age 31 Hometown Chicago Now Lives In a minimal one-bedroom apartment in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, where the lights are seldom on but a record always is.Claim to Fame Ms. Ali has a namesake line of unisex jewelry that evokes early 2000s hip-hop with its street-wear-inspired use of hardware staples like chains, dog tags and safety pins.The line is carried by influential stores including Opening Ceremony and Kith, and the rapper Kendrick Lamar is a fan and has worn her bracelet, necklace and wallet chain on tour this year, as well as in several videos, including Humble and Element.That was definitely the moment I saw a pretty literal spike in business and industry love, Ms. Ali said.Kendrick made my designs recognizable.And just this month Rihanna wore Ms. Alis bracelets and earring in her Lemon video with N.E.R.D, which the designer long considered a dream.Big Break In 2010, while interning at DKNY, Ms. Ali would wear her homemade pieces around the office.One day, her jewelry got noticed by Jane Chung, then the designer, who commissioned her to create pieces for the coming collection.The day before the show, Donna Karan herself saw the pieces and asked if Ms. Ali could adapt them as handbag adornments.After that it changed from a hobby to a skill and an asset, Ms. Ali said.Photo Latest Project Ms. Ali created a jewelry collection for the Australian-American designer Matthew Adams Dolans spring 2018 fashion show that will be available at Opening Ceremony for the holidays under her name.The collection, featuring delicate pieces rendered in gold and pearl, is a departure from her usual aesthetic (like if I were a painter going from oil to watercolor, she said) and feels decidedly more feminine.Next Project She is collaborating with Assembly New York, a Lower East Side boutique, on a range of leather-and-silver accessories.They do these really cool vinyl bags and other pieces that were going to mess with, she said.I dont plan a lot, you know?Shes the Boss In a retail world increasingly dominated by mega-brands and luxury conglomerates, Ms. Ali cherishes her freedom as a smaller, self-run brand with uninhibited creative control.She believes that selling to customers directly from her website, and communicating with them through Instagram, sets her apart.I cant tell you how valuable that is these days to be seen as a person and not Amazon, she said.
When a Gossipy Office Clique Includes Your Boss:::::It all feels like being in middle school, and morale is suffering.People who work hard dont want to feel theyll be penalized if they dont hang out with a certain group.ANONYMOUS Workplace cliques are common, but its definitely not a smart move for bosses to participate in them let alone allow group scuttlebutt to guide their decisions.If thats actually happening, its even more troubling for management to discourage attempts to raise concerns.Theres nothing inappropriate or disloyal about drawing attention to behavior thats potentially bad for the organization.Photo I dont understand your hesitation to at least have a discussion with responsible people in the human resources department.Theres certainly enough here to do so.But as always, how you frame the matter is crucial.Hurt feelings about getting left out of the lunch bunch or karaoke night are not the companys problem.Tangible examples of decisions that are having a negative impact and could have been avoided if the bosss views werent skewed by a small pack of cronies are very much the companys problem.Human resources, and management generally, should want to know if employee X has been given responsibility Y even though employee Z is an objectively better choice.I dont think the top boss is the person to start with, but the suggestion that you should avoid bringing such concerns to the head of the organization sounds fishy.That person should want this resolved, too.Just make sure you focus on what it all means for the enterprise, not on who likes whom or, unfortunately, youre the one who will end up sounding like a middle schooler.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Office Neighbor Drives Me Nuts The guy next to me in the office cracks pistachios all day.Its so annoying, I feel as if Im sitting next to a chipmunk.Others have told him its disgusting to see the shells all over his desk, but to no avail.Any suggestions for getting him to eat his snacks at home, or more quietly, or not at all?Oh, and also: Some of my co-workers (male and female) clip their fingernails at work!Just the sound of this makes me nauseous.How does one handle such unsanitary behavior?MILWAUKEE, WIS. To work in an office is to spend a good chunk of your waking hours surrounded by people you never set out to spend time with.So I feel your irritation, but unfortunately theres no magic technique to change another persons habits.You, or someone, must talk to the pistachio fan.But berating him, or telling him hes disgusting, is not likely to be persuasive.He might think its an over-the-top joke that hell dismiss, or hell be insulted and ignore you.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Explain that you understand he enjoys his snack, but you hope that he will understand that the sound really distracts you.Assure him that there is nothing personal in this.And perhaps suggest a compromise: Could he try a quieter snack, or maybe limit his nut intake to certain times of day?Be polite and respectful, but firm.The alternative is to get over it which is what Id suggest on the fingernail-clipping issue.I cant believe that this happening office-wide, around the clock.So if you approach someones desk, and find a clipper incident in progress, come back later.If someone in earshot starts clipping, take a coffee break.In both cases: Consider how you would want to be approached if someone else had a problem with some habit of yours that you figure is none of their business.If you can come up with a reasonable request, give it your best shot.If not, let it go.Sometimes, to work in an office is to compromise on such matters.
When Designing Luxury Cars Is Like Making Jewelry. And Friends.:::::Photo Earl Lucas, 47, is the chief exterior designer at the Lincoln Motor Company, in Dearborn, Mich. Q.What is your day-to-day like?Its different every day.I interface with multiple disciplines, whether it be packaging, engineering, marketing or public relations.Some days I am at my computer designing digitally.Then I might be in our studio seeing that image converted to a clay model, and later as a fiberglass version of it.Another day I go to our wind tunnel, where we test aerodynamics to make sure we have the right drag count to get the best fuel economy for our product.A.Did you always want to be an automobile designer?I always knew I wanted to do something with design.I studied industrial design focusing on jewelry rings, pendants and earrings for two years at the College of Creative Studies in Detroit.The college also happened to have an outstanding automobile design curriculum.After taking one class in that program, I was hooked.It turns out the principles of designing a ring are the same as designing a car.What or who were your early design influences?I would have to start with my mother, Vessie Lucas, who is an interior decorator.She taught me to think abstractly of what could be at an early age.I read a lot of comics, like The Mighty Thor and Spiderman.I also watched cartoons such as Speed Racer, Battle of the Planets and Star Blazers.In terms of cars, I loved my grandfathers 1984 Continental Mark VII, with two tones of blue paint and an impeccable white interior.After he died, I got to drive it on Sundays to church.Advertisement Continue reading the main story What considerations influence your design concepts?I try to reflect the personality of the brand.In the case of Lincoln, our cars embody effortless luxury.We think of our car as a friend.We convey that through form, shape, color and texture.The most influential design element may be the front grille.It has to stand out but be in proportion with everything else.The centerpiece is our logo called the Lincoln Star which was developed in the 1950s.I have managed to tweak it a little.What do you envision for auto design in the future?Autonomous cars driverless automobiles are the future and we are already developing technologies to accommodate for this shift, which we predict could be in effect by 2030.As highways and streets will be modified, cars will also have different shapes and silhouettes; they may look more like living rooms.Well need to anticipate caravans, where cars will link up to each other to save energy.
How to Win the Battle of the Sexes Over Pay (Hint: It Isn’t Simple.):::::Even defining the gender earnings gap isnt simple: It cannot be reduced to a single number, though it often is expressed that way.According to a commonly used measure adopted by the United States Census Bureau, women in 2016 earned 81 cents for each dollar earned by men, both working full-time.This definition focuses on the annual income of the individual at the median or middle of the income distribution for men and for women.Another valid option is to focus on mean, or average, earnings.Measured that way, the earnings gap is even greater.And there are many other measures.The gap is larger among more educated people, for example, and varies according to occupation, often in big ways.Among college graduates, it is far larger in business, finance and legal careers than in science and technology jobs.In health care, it is larger when self-employment is high (think dentists) and much lower when professionals are mainly employees (think pharmacists).Whats more, the gap is a statistic that changes during the life of a worker.Typically, its small when formal education ends and employment begins, and it increases with age.More to the point, it increases when women marry and when they begin bearing children.Using the data that shows women earn 81 cents for each dollar earned by men, when the careers of recent college graduates start, the gap is much smaller: 92 cents for each male dollar.By the time college-educated women are 40 years old, they earn 73 cents.Similar patterns appear using data for women and men who have earned masters degrees in business administration.Immediately after graduation, women earn 92 cents for each male dollar.A decade later they earn only 57 cents.Correcting for time off and hours of work reduces the difference in the earnings between men and women but doesnt eliminate it.Advertisement Continue reading the main story On the face of it, that looks like proof of disparate treatment.It may seem understandable that when a man works more hours than a woman, he earns more.But why should his compensation per hour be greater, given the same qualifications?But once again, the problem isnt simple.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.The data shows that women disproportionately seek jobs including full-time jobs that are more likely to mesh with family responsibilities, which, for the most part, are still greater for women than for men.So, the research shows, women tend to prefer jobs that offer flexibility: the ability to shift hours of work and rearrange shifts to accommodate emergencies at home.Such jobs tend to be more predictable, with fewer on-call hours and less exposure to weekend and evening obligations.These advantages have a negative consequence: lower earnings per hour, even when the number of hours worked is the same.Is that unfair?Maybe.But it isnt always an open-and-shut case.Companies point out that flexibility is often expensive more so in some jobs than others.Certain job characteristics have a big impact on the gender earnings gap.I have looked closely at these issues, including the extent to which workers are: Subject to strict deadlines and time pressure Expected to be in direct contact with other workers or clients Instructed to develop cooperative working relationships Assigned to work on highly specific projects Unable to independently determine their tasks and goals Occupations with a lower level of these characteristics (like jobs in science and technology) show smaller gaps, corrected for hours of work.Occupations with a higher level (like those in finance and law) have greater gaps.Mens earnings tend to surge when there are fewer substitutes for a given worker, when the job must be done in teams and when clients demand specific lawyers, accountants, consultants and financial advisers.Such differences can account for about half the gender earnings gap.These findings provide more nuance in explaining why the gap widens with age and why it is greater for women with children.Whatever changes have already taken place in American society, the duty of caring for children and for other family members still weighs more heavily on women.And if you thought that moving to a more family-friendly nation would eliminate the gap, think again.In several nations, including Sweden and Denmark, a motherhood penalty in earnings exists, even though these nations have generous family policies, including paid family leave and subsidized child care.Such considerations bring us to a very sensitive area: domestic arrangements at home, especially among couples with children.These are personal questions.In theory, gender earnings equality is possible when both parents take off the same amount of time and enjoy the same flexibility at work.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Yet this isnt easy to accomplish in the world, as it exists now: Individual families that make such choices may incur high costs.From a classic economic standpoint, if one spouse or partner can earn more by working less flexible hours, as a family, the couple would earn more money by having that parent in that job, while the other partner accepts the more flexible one.A man can certainly be the more flexible member of this household though he typically is not.Such decisions need to be made couple by couple.Reorganizing the workplace a complicated undertaking would help diminish the gap.It would also be narrowed if the burdens of family life were shouldered more equitably.In sum, the gap is mainly the upshot of two separate but related forces: workplaces that pay more per hour to those who work longer and more uncertain hours, and households in which women have assumed disproportionately large responsibilities.Equality on this court requires a level playing field at home and in the market.There are many battles ahead.Unfortunately, they need to be fought at several levels.
The Last Time President Xi Took a Question From an American Correspondent? 2014, and Yup, It Was Me:::::Asking questions of a president is nerve-racking under any circumstances.But when I heard my name called by the press secretary, Josh Earnest, in the Great Hall, it felt like stepping to the plate at Yankee Stadium.I stood up and, with camera bulbs flashing, asked Mr. Xi two questions: Did he view Mr. Obamas Asia pivot as a threat to China?And would China ease its refusal to give visas to correspondents in light of a broader visa agreement it had just signed with the United States?I also asked Mr. Obama a somewhat long-winded question about the rise of anti-American sentiment in China, which prompted him to say, Come on, Mark, and joke, after I was finished, that he had forgotten my question (I assumed that was for the benefit of his host).At first, President Xi looked as if he was going to simply ignore the impudent foreigner.He instructed the moderator to move on, taking a scripted question from a Chinese state-owned paper.Mr. Obama, who was clearly eager to hear Mr. Xis answer, shot me a glance and a theatrical shrug, the presidential equivalent of nice try, buddy.It turned out that Mr. Xi was merely biding his time.After he answered the Chinese journalist, he circled back to me and delivered a curt lecture.No, he said, the pivot was not about containment.And the visa problems of The Times were of our own making.China protected freedom of expression, he said, but media outlets need to obey Chinas laws and regulations.When a car breaks down on the road, perhaps we need to get off the car to see where the problem lies.And when a certain issue is raised as a problem, there must be a reason.In Chinese, we have a saying, he concluded.The party which has created a problem should be the one to help resolve it.Advertisement Continue reading the main story As the White House press corps filed out of the room, one of my colleagues joked that he hoped the Chinese would allow me to leave the country.The Chinese media reported that I had violated the ground rules by directing a question to Mr. Xi, rather than only to Mr. Obama.(The White House did not instruct me to address only the American president.)The whole negotiation was somewhat opaque, Mr.Earnest recalled this week.Even as he stood next to the leaders in the Great Hall that day, he said he was not sure the Chinese would follow through on the agreement.The episode apparently did not sit well with the Chinese.On Thursday, Mr. Trumps press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, said, It was at the Chinese insistence there were no questions.Former aides to Mr. Obama and Mr. Bush criticized the Trump White House for not trying harder.They always insist, Sarah, Susan E. Rice, who served as Mr. Obamas national security adviser, said in a tweet.The trick is to use diplomacy to extract that concession as a matter of principle, despite their resistence.Brad Dayspring, deputy director of press advance for Mr. Bush, tweeted, Never got everything we pushed for, but always expanded access from Chinese demands & ensured questions were taken alongside Chinese President.Its an important demonstration of American press freedoms.In Tokyo and Seoul, Mr. Trump took questions with the leaders of Japan and South Korea.But striking a blow for press freedom did not seem high on his list of priorities in Beijing.He did not say whether he had pressed Mr. Xi behind closed doors on human rights issues.Mr. Obama, by contrast, got mileage out of the episode.Two days later, he was standing next to Aung San Suu Kyi, the Burmese pro-democracy leader, in the garden of her lakeside house in Yangon, and brought up the tense Q. and A. in the Great Hall of the People.When I am traveling, it is important as the president of the United States to not just talk about our interests, but also to talk about our values, Mr. Obama said.Sometimes it has an impact; sometimes it doesnt.Although I was impressed that Mark Landler got an answer to his question from President Xi, he added.It might not have been the one he was expecting, but he did end up taking the question.So you just keep on chipping away and seeing if we can make progress.
$300 Billion War Beneath the Street: Fighting to Replace America’s Water Pipes:::::Corporations pay membership fees as high as $25,000 to gain access to some 1,500 mayors and local council members who have signed up for the initiative.At a July convention in Denver that brought together about three dozen local legislators, Bruce Hollands, executive director of the plastic pipe industry group Uni-Bell PVC Pipe Association, discussed what had gone wrong in Flint, and explained what needed to be done to open up local bidding for plastic water pipes.To spur local decision-making, the A.C.C.E.has also adopted model legislation pushing for more open bidding for water pipes.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Were just trying to take up policies that limit the size of government, that keep it from growing exponentially, said Jon Russell, national director of the A.C.C.E.and a councilman from the town of Culpeper, Va. Plastics are an obvious replacement for the countrys aging pipes.Lightweight, easy to install, corrosion-free and up to 50 percent cheaper than iron, plastic pipes have already taken the place of copper as the preferred material for service lines that connect homes to municipal mains, as well as water pipes inside the home.Still, some scientists warn that the rapid replacement of Americas water infrastructure with plastic could bring its own health concerns.Scientists are just starting to understand the effect of plastic on the quality and safety of drinking water, including what sort of chemicals can leach into the water from the pipes themselves, or from surrounding groundwater contamination.Studies have shown that toxic pollutants like benzene and toluene from spills and contaminated soil can permeate certain types of plastic pipes as they age.A 2013 review of research on leaching from plastic pipe identified more than 150 contaminants migrating from plastic pipes into drinking water.Plastics are being installed without any real understanding of what theyre doing to our drinking water, said Andrew J. Whelton, assistant professor of civil engineering at Purdue University, and an author of the 2013 study.We dont know what chemicals were being exposed to.Sensing an opening, the iron pipe industry has started a public relations push of its own, voicing concerns over plastic, wooing President Trump with accolades for his infrastructure drive and setting up a war between the two industries.Iron is just more durable.Its a more proven material, said Patrick Hogan, president of the Ductile Iron Pipe Research Association, the industrys main lobby group.Irons been in the ground for 100 years.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Plastic groups have criticized the studies, saying they focus on older generations of plastic piping and conflate different types of plastics.They also stress that their pipes are independently tested by the third-party organization.Its not a new material.Its a safe material.Its independently tested, said Mr. Hollands, executive director of the Uni-Bell plastic pipes group.The industry outreach, at times, has been more overt.At the height of Flints water crisis, the chief executive of one of the nations largest manufacturers of plastic pipes, JM Eagle, traveled to the beleaguered city and offered to replace the citys lead pipes at no cost.Pipes from JM Eagle would last 100 years and are a long-lasting and safe solution, the companys chief executive, Walter Wang, told the City Council last February.This water crisis, this contamination issue, he said, its hurting children and making them sick.Photo JM Eagle, however, has faced recent legal problems.In 2013, a federal jury in California found that the Los Angeles-based company had defrauded states and municipalities for more than a decade by knowingly selling defective water pipes.In some places, PVC pipes that were supposed to last 50 years exploded in their first year, causing injuries and flooding.JM Eagle declined to comment but has previously said the litigation was based on scurrilous allegations by a disgruntled former employee.Formosa Plastics, a Taiwanese industrial conglomerate that was its parent company at the time, agreed to pay $22.5 million in a settlement with municipalities and other government agencies in California.The uncertainty over potable water pipes of all kinds is exacerbated by a lack of regulation over their safety.There is no federal oversight of the materials or processes used to manufacture plastic water pipes; instead, water pipes are certified and tested by an organization paid for by industry.That organization, NSF International, displays a picture of the Capitol building on its regulatory resources web page and runs a hotline for questions on regulations and product safety.Yet it has never received regulatory authority from the federal government.Nor does it disclose test results for the pipes it certifies.Advertisement Continue reading the main story NSF International called its testing robust.If a product does not meet the requirements of a standard, it will not pass, said Dave Purkiss, the organizations general manager of water systems.For now, Flint is fitting the city with service lines made with another material: copper, at an expected cost of more than $140 million.Officials discussed creating a pilot area using plastic to replace the service lines to houses on several city blocks, according to Plastics News, though a Flint spokeswoman, Kristin Moore, said plastic pipes were not currently under consideration.When you take that inherent issue that we needed to rebuild trust of the citizens in the water system, we felt that copper was the way to go, Michael McDaniel, a retired Michigan National Guard brigadier general put in charge of replacing Flints water pipes, said at a conference this year.In Burton, just next door to Flint, budget realities have made plastics the realistic choice.The small city of 29,000 saved $2.2 million by using plastic to replace its own 1930s-era water system after state regulators alerted the city to critically needed fixes.For a municipality struggling with a dwindling tax base, those savings were huge.We needed safe water, and we needed it fast.We needed to replace the system, and PVC was a good choice for us, said Burtons mayor, Paula Zelenko.Ive got to get the best bang for the buck, because bucks are hard to come by these days.
Farhad and Mike’s Week in Tech: Get Ready for Robot Cars:::::So even though its only happening in Arizona, this is a big deal.Waymo is clearly leading the pack in the race to produce self-driving cars, which makes sense because of Googles multiyear head start in the space.Would you be comfortable being carted around in a self-driving car?I was, but perhaps Im just used to it since its one of the main topics I write about.Farhad: Because I live right near Waymos headquarters, this is all old hat for me.I see the companys cars including the old panda-shaped ones that lack a steering wheel every morning during my commute.Id have no problem riding in one, but I hope Arizonans know that its very annoying to share the road with these robot cars.Theyre slow!They follow the speed limit, they take ages changing lanes and they have a frustrating habit of obeying every single rule of the road.Ugh, live a little, robot car STOP is just a suggestion, not some kind of law.Mike: Yes, well, dont throw away your drivers license quite yet.Or maybe do.AT&Ts Megadeal Hits a Political Bump Mike: Moving on, a bigger piece of telecom and media news.This week, our DealBook team scooped that the Department of Justice under the Trump administration is pushing Time Warner and AT&T to sell off Turner Broadcasting Company, which owns CNN, or DirecTV as a condition of a negotiated merger that has long been in the works.Its a huge ask, and hard to see how its not politically motivated.As we all well know, President Trump is no fan of CNN.Also, Im curious to know what legal grounds the D.O.J.would use to block a merger of this size.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Interested in All Things Tech?The Bits newsletter will keep you updated on the latest from Silicon Valley and the technology industry.Farhad: The move makes for complicated politics.On the one hand, many liberals who are growing wary of ever-larger corporations might agree with the federal government putting stringent conditions on this deal.And yet its hard to tell if these conditions are legitimate, or if theyre being imposed to please a president who has repeatedly vowed to go after businesses that havent toed his line.Advertisement Continue reading the main story I wonder how this sort of thing affects liberals efforts to police big tech.In a speech this week, Senator Al Franken called for greater regulations on tech giants.Trump has suggested some affinity for that stance; during the campaign, Trump often said that The Washington Post, which is owned by Amazons C.E.O., Jeff Bezos, was covering him critically because Amazon was worried that Trump would start antitrust proceedings against the company.Now, imagine if something like that happens would the left cheer Trump, or would they side with Amazon?I truly wonder.Mike: Right, well, we all saw how well the last huge Time Warner merger went, so lets hope this one goes better!Oh, I wanted to note a fantastic story from The New York Times Magazine this week, basically on the opacity of Facebooks algorithms and how its advertising can be so effective at targeting small groups of users that some start-ups are spending all their cash there and nowhere else.Its like Russia and the 2016 election, but for brands!Is Facebook Ruining Our Lives?Farhad: Speaking of Facebook, there was a startling admission this week by Sean Parker, the Napster co-founder and former Facebook executive (played by Justin Timberlake in The Social Network).In an interview with Axioss Mike Allen, Parker said that hed become a conscientious objector on social media, which he said had been built to addict us all.It probably interferes with productivity in weird ways, he said.God only knows what its doing to our childrens brains.Watch for more of this.More and more people both in and out of Silicon Valley are worried about the long-term psychological effects of our digital age.I worry about you especially, Mike.Mike: Too busy looking at Twitter.Actually, the last thing I wanted to note: Will.i.am, the hip-hop artist and self-styled tech evangelist, has raised another $100 million in venture capital.He started on wearables and gadgets, and has pivoted to work on chatbots and devices like Amazons Alexa and Google Home.Advertisement Continue reading the main story So what do you think?Is Will.i.am the next Steve Jobs?Does raising venture capital actually require anything more than a hodgepodge of vague ideas and a series of pivots?What even is capitalism anymore?Farhad: I really dont get it.We live in a world where anyone whos made it constantly gets showered with more and more money regardless of whether theyre doing anything useful.Mike, when do we get to cash in?Mike: Never.Anyway, see you next week!Farhad: Bye!Farhad Manjoo writes a weekly technology column called State of the Art.Mike Isaac covers Facebook, Uber and Twitter.You can follow them on Twitter here: @fmanjoo and @MikeIsaac
Kobe Steel Blames Plant Managers for Quality Control Scandal:::::Photo TOKYO When a roll of aluminum produced at a Kobe Steel factory fell short of customers exacting demands for qualities like strength, plant managers were supposed to make a painful but necessary decision: Start again and make a new, better roll of metal, even if it cost the company time and money.But for at least a decade, according to an internal company report released on Friday, those managers took an easier way out, manipulating test data on some products to avoid expensive do-overs.The report by the Japanese steel maker is its first public accounting of the causes of a data falsification scandal that has shaken the company and prompted around 500 of its customers around the world including manufacturers of cars, trains and aircraft to scramble to verify their products safety.The report, produced by Kobe Steel without input from regulators or other outside parties, concluded that the company had erred by elevating the pursuit of short-term profit over the maintenance of scrupulous quality standards.That failing, it said, was exacerbated by lax oversight by senior executives and an insular corporate culture that discouraged employees from questioning improper but long-established practices.Advertisement Continue reading the main story There was a climate where employees on the ground couldnt speak up.Even if they did speak up, it wouldnt make a difference, Kobe Steels chief executive, Hiroya Kawasaki, said at a news conference.As long as the revenue was coming in, management wasnt interested.
Musical.ly, a Chinese App Big in the U.S., Sells for $1 Billion:::::Photo SHANGHAI The only Chinese social media company to build a major network outside China will be taken over by a fast-growing Chinese upstart.Musical.ly, a video-based social network popular with teenagers in the United States and Europe, is being sold for between $800 million and $1 billion to Bytedance, the company that controls the Chinese news aggregator Toutiao, according to a person familiar with the matter.The deal knits together Toutiaos 120 million Chinese users with the roughly 60 million who use Musical.ly in the United States and Europe, ultimately linking a platform in China with a more global one.Musical.ly will continue to operate a separate product, according to a statement on the deal, though the two companies will cooperate closely.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Despite the dominance of established social media services like Facebook and Snap, Musical.ly rose to prominence among a teenage and tween audience by enabling users to record quick videos set to music.Young users of the app performed coordinated dance moves or lip-synced to the music.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Since then the company has branched out to other types of videos, including live streaming, and has even sought to attract short-form video shows.

China Eases Limits on Foreign Stakes in Financial Firms:::::Goldman Sachs Group praised the Chinese move, saying, We welcome todays announcement and look forward to playing a greater role in Chinas capital markets.China keeps tight limits on a number of industries it considers vital, including energy, transportation, the media and financial services.Companies in the United States, Europe and Japan have increasingly complained about being limited in those markets or shut out entirely, even as Chinese companies make their own investments in similar industries outside its borders.In many cases, Beijings limits have given rise to Chinese giants who dominate markets at home.Officials in Beijing had previously said the government would open the financial sector to outside money, but Fridays move offered the first concrete details.Zhu Guangyao, Chinas vice finance minister, said that his country would start allowing foreign investors to own 51 percent of Chinese securities firms, fund managers and futures companies, and would allow them to own 100 percent three years from now.The current limit on foreign ownership is 25 percent for large, publicly traded securities firms and 49 percent for most other businesses in these categories.Mr. Zhu said that China would also raise the allowed foreign investment in insurance companies, currently 50 percent for most companies, to 51 percent in three years and 100 percent in five years.China also plans to eliminate its current limit of 25 percent foreign ownership in banks, Mr. Zhu said, but he did not say when it might happen.While the moves were announced several hours after Mr. Trump and his advisers flew to Vietnam, Mr. Zhu said that the initiatives were the result of decisions made during the Communist Partys congress last month.Trump administration officials shied away from making commitments while in Beijing over market access, the sort of horse-trading that marked previous presidential visits.They have also been distracted by domestic issues and other trade issues.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Some international banking acumen may be welcome in China.The countrys state-controlled banking system has lent heavily to state-owned companies and affiliates of local governments, leading to vast piles of debt accumulated in a short amount of time.Meanwhile, some smaller businesses continue to complain about lack of access to money.Increased competition could spur state-owned banks to improve their lending decisions.Speaking over all, it is a good thing, said Liu Dongliang, an analyst at China Merchants Bank.There will be more different kinds of capital involved, and their management ideas and risk control ideas may arouse some reaction.Advertisement Continue reading the main story American financial institutions cautiously welcomed the Chinese move.Citibank said that its existing operations in China were already growing, with more than $1 billion a year in China-related revenue, and that it wanted to study the details of the new regulations when they were released.China promised when it joined the World Trade Organization in 2001 that it would rapidly open up its financial markets to foreign competition.Foreign commercial banks were then disappointed when Chinese regulators set high capital requirements for each foreign bank branch, limiting their ability to expand.But the rise of online banking has reduced the need for bank branches, and so has the rise of electronic payments.Over the past couple of years, Citibank has been gradually closing some of its retail branches in China, as it has done in the United States.According to the bank, 95 percent of its retail banking transactions now take place outside bank branches.Yet foreign banks hold just 1.5 percent of the assets in Chinas credit-swollen banking system.State-owned banks have flooded credit markets with so many loans that finding large, financially stable, creditworthy borrowers has become harder in China, forcing newcomers to enter the treacherous market of providing loans to smaller enterprises at a time when the entire Chinese economy is gradually slowing.Chinas financial markets have a reputation for fraud and manipulation, particularly the stock market.Increasing the role of foreign firms in these markets could help introduce overseas practices that might limit misconduct.Asset management companies have already been expanding their role in China, and the new rules announced by Mr. Zhu could speed that process.Peter L. Alexander, the founder and managing director of Z-Ben Advisors, a Shanghai financial consulting firm, said that because Chinese investors tended to have large holdings in relatively simple money market funds and had not yet shown much interest in purchasing exchange-traded funds, theres an opportunity for active managers.Mr. Zhu also repeated on Friday a Chinese pledge made late Thursday to ease joint-venture requirements for electric cars and other so-called new energy vehicles that may be built in Chinas free-trade zones.Unlike any other large car manufacturing nation, China requires either that all cars sold within its borders be assembled in a 50-50 joint venture with a local partner or that an import tax of at least 25 percent be paid, plus a range of other taxes.Tesla has sought and apparently obtained permission to have a wholly owned factory in a free-trade zone in Shanghai, and is still working out other details, like whether cars made in the zone will qualify for electric car subsidies that China currently provides only to domestically produced cars.
When You Experience Sexual Harassment at Work:::::Start with understanding the outcome you want.Is your ultimate goal for the harasser to be removed from the company?Do you want to prevent others from being harassed by that person?Are you seeking monetary compensation?The first priority is for the individual to decide what it is that she really wants and the price she is willing to pay for that, said Deborah L. Rhode, a professor of law at Stanford Law School and the director of its Center on the Legal Profession.Many people want the harassment to stop so they can do their job and advance in their companies, said Suzanne B. Goldberg, a professor at Columbia Law School and the director of the Center for Gender and Sexuality Law at Columbia Law School.Others, especially where the harassment has been severe, seek compensation from the employer for their lost earnings and emotional distress that resulted from the harassment.If you have experienced or witnessed sexual harassment and you want to take action, you have a number of choices.But first: Whatever you plan to do, keep notes and evidence.One of the most important things to do after an incident is to write down what happened, what was said or touched, who did it, whether anyone was around to witness what happened, where you were, what the time was, Ms. Goldberg said.Ms. Gosfield noted that it is helpful to keep notes in a bound notebook (technology fails, she said) and to make sure nothing is stored on work devices.Otherwise, should anything go awry, your employer will have access to the logs you were keeping, Ms. Gosfield said.If there is any physical evidence for example, a dress with fluids on it or pornographic images save it.Advertisement Continue reading the main story When investigating or reporting on a complaint of sexual harassment, accusers will often be asked if they had confided in a friend, family member or colleague at the time of the event or events.Even if you never plan on taking action, confiding in someone at the time can be helpful if you change your mind about taking action later.Now, for your options: You can make a criminal complaint.If you were sexually assaulted, going straight to the police is a good idea.Every state is going to have its own definition of rape, Ms. Gosfield said.Even the terms states use can be different.One state may call rape sexual assault.Another state may call it rape.When youve been victimized, sodomy is a crime in certain jurisdictions.Generally, in cases where the harassment included physical touching, coerced physical confinement or coerced sex acts, it could be considered a crime.If you want to start a criminal investigation, its important to know that there is a legal timeline.If you have been victimized and violated, probably one of the last things you want to do is go to a precinct and relive every detail, Ms. Gosfield said.Nonetheless, it is important for law enforcement to have access to physical evidence if there is any as soon as possible.You can file a complaint through your employer.If you are an employee, you can follow your employers procedure for filing a complaint.Typically this is the first step you should take, unless there is only one point person to report to and that person was the harasser.If that situation doesnt apply, and if you think you may want to file a lawsuit against the employer in the future, you have to report the harassment to your employer first.Otherwise, the employer has a defense, according to a judgment by the Supreme Court.Make sure all of your attempts at reporting the abuse are documented.Write down everything and put everything in writing, said Minna Kotkin, a professor of law at Brooklyn Law School and the director of the Brooklyn Law School Employment Law Clinic.You dont just go and talk to H.R.Employers are given a lot of latitude to draft their policies, Ms. Gosfield said.No one says employers must have a policy that requires you to do X, Y and Z and have this reporting structure.Check your handbook or your internal company website.Hone in on it.Understand the chain of reporting that you should follow.Remember that employers may never have acted on their policies before and you may need to be diligent in pursuing your complaint.And company policy is not always up to date with the courts.Advertisement Continue reading the main story You can go to a federal, state or local agency.If you do not want to, or cannot file through your employer, or if you are unsatisfied with the results of your employers investigation, you can enter a complaint at the federal, state or local level.(You can also do this together with reporting the incident to your employer.)At the federal level, you can go through the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.Title VII of the 1964 federal Civil Rights Act prohibits sexual harassment.You can also head to a Fair Employment Practices Agency.Here is a list.These are state or local administrative bodies that specialize in human or civil rights.Often if you file with a state or local agency, it will automatically co-file the claim with the E.E.O.C.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.If one of the agencies finds that your complaint is warranted, it will issue a right to sue letter that allows you to bring the case to court.You need this letter in order to file a lawsuit.With many state or local agencies, you can generally file a complaint without the help of a lawyer.But often the processes are not quick, where a lawyer can typically intervene more quickly with an employer than a government agency, Ms. Goldberg said.Make sure youre aware of statutes of limitations.Under Title VII, you have to file a claim with the E.E.O.C.within 180 days of the harassment.However, if your state has similar laws protecting workers from sexual harassment, you can file the complaint with both the state and federal agencies, which will extend the statute of limitations to 300 days.And remember, Ms. Rhode said, the statute of limitations doesnt operate in the world of public opinion.Even if years have passed since you were harassed and it is too late to file claims, you can speak about the incident publicly at any time.You can make accusations in public.You can share your experience publicly through social media platforms or with the help of a reporter.Photo What to expect if you go public with your story.One thing we know from social psychology studies is that people dont like complainers, said Joanna Grossman, the Ellen K. Solender Endowed Chair in Women and the Law at Southern Methodist Universitys Dedman School of Law.If youre going public and on social media, you always run the risk that you get labeled a complainer, a problem, a liar.But, she added, that doesnt mean its not worth it.There may be benefits in connecting with other victims, pursuing justice and knowing the accuser wont hurt someone else.Advertisement Continue reading the main story You can expect threats, intimidation and investigation if you make public allegations.There can be strength in numbers.If an employer is ineffective at pursuing complaints, you and other people who have experienced sexual harassment can work together to protect each other or at least warn each other, Ms. Grossman said.A lot of companies will tell you that you cant disparage the company or its employees, Ms. Grossman said.Thats illegal.You can discuss any term or condition of employment, including complaining about sexual harassment by a co-worker.You can do it.Theres such a strong norm of not talking about your pay or your boss that its a social hurdle that prevents us from activating some of those more community-oriented approaches.Ms. Rhode said: One of the triggering mechanisms in some of these cases has been the subculture of rumor and gossip that came to surround people who were serial harassers.When word gets around, you can be sure youre not the only person who has experienced it.And then it takes one brave person to go public and others will follow.Should you confront the harasser?You can say, I do not want you to do this.It is offensive.Stop it immediately.Im going to report you, Ms. Gosfield said.People who are being threatened or intimidated have to choose at that time between de-escalation, distraction or confrontation.No matter what you say at the time to remove yourself from the situation, confrontation can take place later, in safety, or with help.What if youre a freelancer?No matter your work situation, you always have the right to create a criminal complaint or to bring a lawsuit against the perpetrator.Other rights will vary state by state.As a freelancer, in lots of situations, youre just not going to have any rights, Ms. Grossman said.Youre relying on the good intentions of whoever hired you.Make sure you are definitely an independent contractor according to the law before you assume you are.If youre called an independent contractor but youre sitting in a companys offices and using their computers, youre not and you can bring an action, Ms. Kotkin said.She suggests checking guidelines from the Labor Department to understand your status.If you went through a hiring agency, alert the hiring agency about what has happened and seek assistance there, Ms. Goldberg said.If youre freelancing for a company, an important first step is to alert the company about what has happened.Even if the company is not legally responsible, it may be able to take steps to help address the situation.Advertisement Continue reading the main story But keep in mind the risks.You have to understand youre accepting the risk that you will lose the contract, Ms. Grossman said.Maybe that wont happen and I hope it doesnt.But theres just not as much of a deterrent for that company since theyre not bound by nondiscrimination laws.It can sometimes be useful to have an upfront conversation with a hiring agency or a temporary employer about what practices are in place to address sexual harassment.Ask them, Ms. Goldberg said: What is your policy for addressing sexual harassment that happens at a job placement?Where do I go if I am harassed at a job placement?Who is responsible?What steps will you take?Whats the deal with nondisclosure agreements, or N.D.A.s?An N.D.A.is where both parties agree that theyre not going to discuss the terms of the agreement or the allegations, Ms. Gosfield said.Often the agreement is part of a broader settlement that offers the accuser monetary compensation.That makes the culture of silence so much more pervasive, Ms. Gosfield said.This never hits a court where there could be an opinion issued where everyone can understand that this is inappropriate, and what is the sanction, and what is going to be the consequence.What can happen if you violate an N.D.A.?You could be sued by the other party.But I think the real reason people dont violate N.D.A.s is that theyre not lump sum payments, Ms. Rhode said.Theyre paid over a series of years and if you renege on the agreement, the payments stop.What to know about lawyers.Many plaintiff counsels who are focused on victims of discrimination will work on contingency, Ms. Gosfield said.Meaning, The lawyer accepts a fixed percentage.If the client gets nothing, the lawyer gets nothing.Some lawyers charge for consultations and some do not.But they are under ethical duty to tell you if you have a pursuable claim under state or federal law, Ms. Gosfield said.Ask up front how the lawyer would be paid and if they would ask for payment for an initial conversation.If youre unsure of where to begin your search for a lawyer, try reaching out to your state bar association, which can make a recommendation.
What Is Wealth?:::::If every day I feel Ive given back, and I have the freedom to do the things that I love and serve other people, then Im happy to be happy.It makes me so fulfilled.Carlo Wolff Kyle Webb, Los Angeles Photo For Kyle Webb, 32, wealth is about opportunity and access.His financial and business success came from two places: One was luck and the other was being born to entrepreneurially minded parents.Mr. Webb is the chief financial officer of his familys business, Webb Family Enterprises, which operates 16 McDonalds franchises in Southern California.He said that his parents set him up with his first McDonalds franchise and that, along with a good education a bachelors degree in business administration from Morehouse College and an M.B.A. from the University of Southern California set him on his track.Webb says he is not quite what he would call wealthy yet, but he has a clear view of what that will be.Having the financial freedom to contribute to the things that you want to contribute, Mr. Webb said.Thats measured by earning twice the income that is required to sustain your cost of living via passive income.Advertisement Continue reading the main story He said that wealth provides access to more, and that it should extend for future generations to be able to have, again, more access and more opportunities and to be able to extend it to other people whether they are in your familial line or if there are opportunities for other people in your community that you feel warrant opportunity.Citing the McDonalds tagline Americas best first job, Mr. Webb takes pride in the way his familys business extends both access and opportunity to its employees.Jarrett Hill Daniel Buss, Minneapolis Photo Wealth has enabled Daniel Buss, 69, an orthopedic surgeon in Minneapolis, to adopt five children, which cost more than $250,000 in total, and address their special needs, including a string of out-of-state cleft lip and palate operations and specialized tutoring for dyslexia.It allows him to take off work for extended family vacations and for most of the childrens school breaks.Taking more time off puts us in a position where we can get them up to speed on life, Dr. Buss said.Having excess income allows me to be more involved with my family and more involved in my community, he added.With that comes a sense of perspective.I probably make 10 times a year what my dad made as a small farmer in southern Minnesota, Dr. Buss said.Every time I look around, it sort of hits you: Boy, am I fortunate to have had the education I got and then the opportunities after that.Photo Meanwhile, wealth mutes the late-night worries that nag many parents, he said.It gives me some peace of mind that Im going to have resources next week, next month, next year.Still, Dr. Buss said he did not consider affluence to be paramount.Rather, it sweetens a life that is already rich.Advertisement Continue reading the main story It allows us to put the whipped cream on top of the icing, which is over the cake.The money makes it easier.Christina Capecchi Nedim Ramic, St. Louis Photo When Nedim Ramic thinks of wealth, the first thing that comes to mind is health.If youre a healthy person, you are already wealthy, said Mr. Ramic, 35, at his home in St. Louis southern suburbs.The reason I say this is, as you can see with a lot of these refugees, a lot of them were really, really wealthy.They had a lot of money and had a lot of material things, and it just all gets wiped away.And all of them had to start from scratch somewhere else.Its a story that resonates with Mr. Ramic, a Bosnian Muslim whose family fled genocide in his native Bosnia and Herzegovina when he was 10.His hometown, home to 12,000 people when war broke out, sits on the border with Serbia.The family escaped to Germany in 1992 and resettled in St. Louis in 1999 starting over from nothing.If you have your health, if you have your life, you can accomplish pretty much anything if you get the right mind-set, he said.Mr. Ramic went on to finish law school at St. Louis University and became an American citizen.In 2008, he passed the Missouri Bar Exam and the United States citizenship test the same week.He is now a personal injury attorney and maintains several investment properties.Material aspect of wealth is very important, because everything else is much easier to plan around if you are financially stable, he said.Mr. Ramic and his wife had their firstborn a son just last year.What I want him to get out of me, I guess, is if anything you can become anything you want, and this country gives you the foundation for that, Mr. Ramic said.And thats why I think this country is the greatest one in the world.Yeah, weve got our problems.Yeah, were not perfect, but at the end of the day, if you have ambition and youre healthy, you can achieve pretty much anything.Ryan Schuessler Darrin Williams, Little Rock, Ark.Photo Wealth is many different things, said Darrin Williams, 49, chief executive of Southern Bancorp Inc. For me it is an accumulation of assets, and when I use the term assets they dont necessarily have to be financial, he said.I think people can be wealthy in a number of ways.I am wealthy in that I have a loving family and that makes me happy, more happy than money.Advertisement Continue reading the main story When I think of wealth I really go back to my family, said Mr. Williams, a lawyer and former state legislator.I think of what my wife and I will be able to leave our children and our grandchildren, and thats much further beyond just income and money and possessions, but thats also wisdom, thats also advice and a strong faith foundation.I think all of those things make you wealthy.You can be very wealthy and not have a lot of money.Mr. Williams said Southern Bancorp, a Community Development Financial Institution, worked in some of the most impoverished regions of the country to help people break the cycle of generational poverty through employment, homeownership and savings.We believe that wealth building isnt just for the wealthy, he said.He said he and his wife, Nicole, stressed the importance of sound financial decision-making to their children by requiring them to set aside 10 percent of all the money they receive for church contributions and 20 percent for savings.Only then are they allowed to enjoy the remainder.Rob Moritz Hattie Hill, Dallas Photo After an impoverished childhood, Hattie Hill, a consultant, author and womens professional group leader, had to learn the lessons of wealth.We were in survival mode, Ms. Hill said.The transition from scarce resources to financial security was and continues to be a challenge.Its always about choices.Ms. Hill is president and chief executive of the Womens Foodservice Forum, which promotes womens advancement in the food industry.She also writes books and maintains a global speaking and consulting schedule.Wealth covers the necessities of life, she said.It covers the wholeness of families.Its also about making a difference in the community, whether its supporting faith-based organizations or women and girls.She is drawn to initiatives with values.Thats important as a woman trying to make a difference in the world to promote women and girls, sustaining and developing your community, she said.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Ms. Hill described an evolving sense of what is important distinguishing between wants and needs.Randy Lee Loftis Jen Kimmich, Stowe, Vt. Photo Jen Kimmich was waiting tables and managing at a Burlington, Vt., pub when she fell in love with its young, blue-eyed brewmaster.She and John Kimmich married and started saving for their own brewpub.Those were lean times.The experience of struggling on service wages stuck with them even as their Alchemist Pub and Brewery in Waterbury, Vt., started to make money.John and I lived with our son in an 1,100-square-foot condominium until 2013, said Ms. Kimmich, who is now 45.We always had used cars, always bought clothing from the sale rack.We still live well within our means.We like to go out to eat and take nice trips.We know whats important to us and what we value.Tropical Storm Irene destroyed the pub in 2011, just as the Kimmiches started a small production plant nearby.The reality is, while money doesnt make you happy, it does give you freedom to not worry about those financial stresses, Ms. Kimmich said.Last year, they opened an $11 million second brewing plant and tasting room in Stowe, and they now employ a total of 45 people at both breweries.They installed a wastewater capturing system to minimize pollution and set up a charitable arm that supports educational and work-force development programs.The good we can do with our money is really exciting to us, Ms. Kimmich said.If you make it all about you and fancy handbags and trips on private jets, thats all silly stuff that doesnt matter.I dont think that stuff has any impact on your day-to-day living or your happiness, but being able to give back and contribute really does.Carolyn Shapiro Advertisement Continue reading the main story Zach Strief, New Orleans Photo The week before Zach Strief was born, his father was fired from his job as an electrical engineer.His father immediately started his own company, Control Works Inc., which he built and eventually employed 49 people.Mr. Strief, 34 an offensive tackle for the New Orleans Saints and a partner in Port Orleans Brewery in the Irish Channel neighborhood of New Orleans said he was raised upper class in Milford, Ohio, a suburb of Cincinnati, and had no wants as a kid.My dad worked 16 hours a day building his company, he said.I watched him a lot and learned the value of hard work.He said he had learned over time that wealth is an advantage that gives you an opportunity to provide for your family.It does not eliminate problems.It does not create eternal peace of mind.It creates other stresses.But if you dont have money its an immediate stress.He was a union representative for four years, and one of the things he saw a lot was that people cant understand how a player can make so much money and lose it all.Its easy, he said.Photo Spending and taking care of money is a skill not everybody has that skill, he said.He added that when you hand $500,000 to a 22-year-old who has grown up in a family without much money, there is no comprehension of how to deal with it.If financial literacy has to be taught to grown men, he said, it has to be taught to a 10-year-old.This is the power of money; this is how to take care of it.Allen Johnson Sabina Teshler, Vancouver, Wash.

What’s at Stake in the Bonn Climate Talks?:::::Under the Paris agreement, each country submitted a voluntary pledge to tackle its greenhouse gas emissions and then agreed to meet every five years to review their collective progress and prod one another to ratchet up their efforts.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Interested in Climate Change?Sign up to receive our in-depth journalism about climate change around the world.But so far, those pledges have proved inadequate.Most industrialized countries from Europe to Japan to the United States arent on track to meet their emissions goals.And even if they were, the current pledges put the world on course to heat up 3 degrees Celsius or more, an outcome with a far greater risk of destabilizing ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica, drastic sea-level rise and more destructive heat waves and droughts.To stay well below 2 degrees, countries would need to cut back fossil-fuel emissions far more rapidly than theyve promised so far.In 2018, leaders plan to assess their efforts to date and discuss what further action could help lessen the odds of drastic global warming with the goal of crafting newer, stronger national pledges by 2020.But before they can do any of that, they need to agree to formal ground rules for that exercise.That rule book will be a focus at Bonn.How do countries plan to make progress on climate change?One widely recognized problem with the current Paris pledges is that theyre fairly vague.China promised that its emissions would peak around 2030, but the countrys energy data is notoriously murky, so its hard to tell how much progress its actually making.Similarly, the European Union vowed to cut emissions 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030, but offered few specifics on how to achieve that goal making it hard to gauge whether European policymakers could realistically be doing much more.At Bonn, negotiators will be discussing how to make these pledges more rigorous and transparent, so that countries can more readily be held accountable for their actions.That means tackling questions like: Whats the best way to track nations progress, to see if theyre doing what they said they would do?Is there a way to tell if a countrys pledge could be made more ambitious?Which specific policies are working well and which arent?Because the Paris pledges are largely voluntary world leaders would have never agreed to a deal otherwise no one can force governments to take additional action.But, the idea goes, if pledges and policies are made more transparent, world leaders will be better able to pressure and help each other to do more.The final draft of this rule book is not due until next year, and it may not actually get finished at Bonn, but negotiators are hoping to make significant progress on a long list of items at these talks.As always, diplomacy tends to proceed fitfully.Advertisement Continue reading the main story What role will the U.S. play?Even though the Trump administration has vowed to withdraw from the Paris agreement, the United States cant formally exit the climate talks until 2020.So the State Department is sending a small team of negotiators to discuss some of the details of the pact.Photo The United States and China will still preside over a working group on transparency, though it remains to be seen how much influence American officials can wield.The administration will also hold an event in Bonn with representatives from energy companies to promote coal, natural gas and nuclear power as solutions to global warming.Other countries are expected to view the American push to promote fossil fuels with a wary eye.In the meantime, a coalition of pro-Paris governors and other officials plan to attend the conference to tout efforts that states, cities and businesses are making to reduce emissions despite the Trump administrations stance highlighting the countrys deep divide over climate policy.Any disagreements expected?Discussions around the rule book for assessing and ratcheting up pledges could prove contentious.In the past, for instance, the United States has insisted that developing countries be held to the same strict monitoring standards as wealthy countries, while China and India have pushed for a bifurcated system.Developing countries have also argued that they need financial aid from wealthier nations to expand clean energy and adapt to the ravages of climate change.The government of Fiji is presiding over the Bonn conference, which will put the spotlight on issues like loss and damage that is, whether wealthy nations should compensate island nations and other poorer countries for the droughts, storms and rising sea levels that their emissions are causing.The Paris agreement broached this issue only briefly, and industrialized nations have resisted calls to be held legally liable for their role in warming the planet.Whats the best-case scenario from Bonn?Whats the worst?Some climate advocates are hoping for a relatively low-key conference that makes modest progress on issues like transparency and climate finance.In this scenario, American officials would play a quietly constructive role in helping craft the rule book for ratcheting up pledges.And nonstate actors, including cities and businesses, would continue to press forward on efforts to tackle climate change outside of the formal United Nations process.Conversely, its entirely possible that the Trump administrations rejection of the Paris deal could lead other countries to disengage from global efforts to address climate change.Or the talks could get bogged down by the traditional rifts between richer and poorer nations.That, in turn, could stall momentum right before the next big round of climate talks in 2018 when countries are supposed to get down to the details of whats needed to step up their climate policies going forward.
The Travel Podcast Comes Into Its Own:::::Advertisement The Getaway The Travel Podcast Comes Into Its Own Image The Temple of Dendur at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City is featured in an audio tour created by the Memory Palace.Credit Benjamin Norman for The New York Times In a commissioned episode, Nate DiMeo, creator of the podcast the Memory Palace , invites guests of the Freepoint Hotel in Cambridge, Mass., to cross the street and wander around Fresh Pond while he tells a story.Its a dreamy story that reaches well into the ponds past in the 19th century when the entrepreneur Frederic Tudor managed to create an empire in the ice trade, shipping frozen blocks from the pond to distant, sweltering climes.The ice found its way into the drinks of Maharajahs, of men and women in waterfront bars in midsummer in Martinique, he says, over soft music that mixes in sounds referencing the industry and export geography.He had turned pond water into a luxury item.The 14-minute recording, available free from the hotel, represents the vanguard of engagement in the travel realm long saturated in the written word for practical advice and increasingly reliant on video to provide a you-are-there simulation.For travelers in situ versus armchair travelers listening can stimulate the imagination to make the leap from present to past.People like finding things, said Dave McCaslin, the executive vice president of H.H.M., which owns the Freepoint and worked on its podcast portfolio available on RadioPublic , a mobile app for podcasts.It also includes a fitness channel with an episode on the Boston Marathon and a bedtime channel featuring relaxing jazz music and a discussion of how dreams work.In the Memory Palace commission, We wanted something hyper local that people cant really get anywhere.The ideal is to experience something that isnt canned.Taking travel to another dimension in a way that may encourage positive reviews and build a brand is the goal of many podcasts now proliferating across the web, and mostly free to access.The Carlyle, a Rosewood Hotel in New York is launching a podcast in January featuring interviews with celebrity guests in advance of the 2018 movie Always at the Carlyle on the subject.The Detroit Foundation Hotel , opened last spring, houses a podcast studio where Hillary Sawchuk, the host of A Drink With podcasts, has interviewed Detroit personalities, entrepreneurs and artists, sessions that are available on the hotel website.In its first episode released in October, the new travel podcast Unmapped offers the aural travel diary, complete with bumps in the road, of the blogger Angelina Zeppieri.In an age when virtually every smartphone has a voice recorder, podcasting is a cost-effective medium, which could help explain its surge in listeners.In its 2017 report, Edison Research , which tracks digital audio and podcast consumption among other new media, found that 40 percent of Americans over the age of 12 have listened to a podcast, and 24 percent have listened to one in the prior month, up 21 percent versus the year before.Six in 10 respondents said they were familiar with the term podcasting, a 22 percent increase over two years.When it launched its World Nomads Podcast earlier this year, the travel insurance company World Nomads spent less than $4,000 to construct a professional recording studio.The podcast, which has covered topics that include how small towns in Croatia are being overrun by tourists, costs under $200 a month to edit and $20 for podcast hosting.There will always be a place for a few friends sitting around a kitchen table with a USB microphone and a laptop, as long as they talk about interesting stuff.Its the wonderfully democratized end of broadcasting, wrote Phil Sylvester, the communications manager for World Nomads, in an email.Image Among the audio tours that Detours offers is one narrated by the novelist George Dawes Green on the historic squares of Savannah, Ga. Credit Stephen Morton for The New York Times Podcasting, of course, isnt new.In the world of downloads, there are lots of prescriptive podcasts, from tips on how to travel more on a tight budget ( Extra Pack of Peanuts ) to touring by motorcycle ( Adventure Rider Radio ).The host Chris Christensen has offered destination advice via interviews in more than 580 episodes of Amateur Traveler since launching in 2005.Traditional media, including Cond Nast Traveler magazine ( Travelogue ), The Associated Press ( Get Outta Here ) and Frommers.com ( Frommers.com Podcast ), also publish podcasts.There are location-specific podcasts such as Londonist Out Loud and others devoted to forms of travel like the RV Family Travel Atlas .This Week in Travel explores current events and No Vacancy with Glenn Haussman focuses on the travel business.Travel-related companies are hopping onto the podcast platform as a millennial marketing tool.In addition to publishing a travel magazine, the luggage company Away has a podcast, Airplane Mode , that explores the reasons we travel and places we find ourselves.A recent episode covered narrow brushes with danger, souvenirs with a back story, and trips that end in unexpected situations.Among newcomers putting story ahead of service, hotels have been especially active in the podcast arena; some of the best have used the contemporary medium to explore the past.Originally opened as a mens sports club in 1893, the Chicago Athletic Association hotel has used its Storytelling Series of live interviews as a way to examine the history of the building and the culture of Chicago.With many episodes newly available on iTunes , the series includes conversations with a Great Lakes surfer and local artists and musicians.Some audio tours have also taken a more sound-rich approach to storytelling, including a new series that Mr. DiMeo of the Memory Palace did at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.As an artist in residence, he produced eight compelling recordings available on the museums website that provide the back stories on objects ranging from early American portrait paintings to the Egyptian Temple of Dendur.Theres even a scavenger hunt that includes directions to find me a picture of a child and wonder for a moment who she or he grew to be.The audio tour company Detour has used film and television producers to capture and mix place-specific sounds on its walking tours, now available in 17 cities.Most are narrated by experts and figures associated with the locales, including the documentarian Ken Burns on the Brooklyn Bridge tour, the comedian Jenny Zigrino on a pub crawl around Faneuil Hall in Boston to taverns associated with Revolutionary War plotting, and the novelist George Dawes Green, also the founder of the Moth storytelling series, on the squares of Savannah (most downloads cost $7.99).The technology allows you to have an immersive experience, said Stacey Book, the director of content for Detour.You get something unique from someone speaking who you wouldnt have access to.Professionally mixed sound and scoring enrich the stories and help create Detours aural landscapes.As Ms. Book said, You can shoot a blank wall and still have an interesting story to tell with audio.Get the Travel Dispatch Newsletter Every Saturday, get travel tips, destination coverage, photos from all over the world and more.SEE SAMPLE Please verify youre not a robot by clicking the box.* Required field You agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for The New York Times products and services.You are already subscribed to this email.Sign Up
Chinese-Owned Factory in Ohio Fights Off Unionization Plan:::::The company, which has invested more than a half-billion dollars restoring a former General Motors plant, rejected such allegations.Athena Hou, the chief legal officer of Fuyao Glass America, said the U.A.W.was trying to demonize the company.Fuyao mounted an aggressive opposition, littering the factory with material encouraging workers to vote against the proposed union and keep your voice.The company regularly invoked a recent corruption scandal involving a Fiat Chrysler and a U.A.W.official.Workers said Fuyao officials balanced their attacks on the union with emotional appeals, and even treated some workers to free meals in recent weeks, saying that it was to reward good performance.The unionization fight highlighted one of the most sensitive issues in contemporary politics: the quality and availability of American jobs in industries heavily exposed to global competition.Photo During his trip to Asia this week, President Trump who made much of the issue during the 2016 campaign praised Japanese auto manufacturers for putting plants in the United States.Chinese companies, for their part, have followed a similar path, directly investing more than $136 billion in the United States since 2000, according to the Rhodium Group.More than half of that amount has come since the beginning of 2016.In some cases, executives from China, where officials often rein in labor protests, have been caught off guard by the determination of American workers to push back against what they call a heavy-handed management style.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.The less sophisticated and more green Chinese investors dont really understand local dynamics at all, said Damien Ma, a fellow at the Paulson Institute who follows Chinese investment in the United States.And so they either dont care that much about labor conditions, or most likely, they just dont really know but pulled the trigger anyway.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Fuyao arguably fell into this category, having set up its factory in union-friendly Ohio.Fuyaos chairman, Cao Dewang is known for paying the medical expenses of employees relatives, but presides over a company that workers said prizes unquestioned obedience.Some of the workers grievances involved safety, including inadequate measures for shutting down machines that might need work.In March, the company reached an agreement with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration that required it to pay $100,000 and address those issues.In recent months, some workers said, safety conditions at the plant had improved considerably.Debbie Lee Brueckner, a supporter of the union effort who was recently transferred into the safety department after working as a glass inspector, was among them.But she said many supervisors have relied on intimidation and favoritism to control workers.If they like you, theyll remove a point, she said, referring to the plants disciplinary system.If they dont, theyll hold points against you.Its not really fair.Differing cultural norms probably played a role in the tension.Mary Gallagher, the director of the Lieberthal-Rogel Center for Chinese Studies at the University of Michigan, said in an interview this spring that Chinese business owners often expect to order around their workers freely, while American workers usually expect to have input into how they perform their tasks.Whatever the cause, the lingering resentment was evident during the voting.The union challenged the eligibility of workers it believed were not permanent employees, such as interns or foreign nationals on temporary visas, saying their interests did not align with those of long-term employees.The company saw it as xenophobia.The U.A.W., Fuyao Glass America said in a statement, was challenging workers votes based on where this union thinks they were born.

'Humbling' mission: Agency toils to ID 82,000 soldiers still MIA:::::Nov. 10 (UPI) -- It was the cornerstone of the Warrior Ethos in the U.S. Army -- "I will never leave a fallen comrade" -- that led U.S. Army serial number 16055052 home after 73 years.It's the "humbling mission" of the Defense Prisoner of War, Missing in Action Accounting Agency, based at Hickam Air Force Base in Hawaii.On Oct. 25, the DPAA brought home the remains of 16055052, whom the agency had identified as U.S. Army Staff Sgt.Michael Aiello, missing since World War II."You know, I tell people all the time that this is the most rewarding job I have ever had," Lee Tucker, a DPAA public affairs officer, told UPI on Friday, a day ahead of Veterans Day."It's a humbling job to be able to tell the stories of men who gave their life for our country, who paid the ultimate sacrifice."There is just story after story of what these guys did, and if you talk to the family members...who don't know what happened to their father or grandfather, their husband, cousin or brother...I don't want to say provide closure because that's a very personal thing, but to give somebody their name back, to provide a widow with the answer of what happened to their husband 50 years ago is just amazingly powerful."Aiello's mission Aiello served in the D-Day invasion of Normandy, France and the failed joint mission of British and American troops to end the war by Christmas 1944: Operation Market Garden.Aiello grew up in Sherman, Ill., and became a coal miner at age 13 after finishing the eighth grade, according to records.By the time Japan attacked Pearl Harbor in December 1941, Aiello owned a restaurant in downtown Springfield.He entered the U.S. Army in 1942.Defense Department records show Aiello was 35 when he went missing on Sept. 30, 1944, as a member of Company G, 401st Glider Infantry Regiment.That was just five days after Market Garden failed to capture strategic positions around the city of Arnhem, Netherlands, where a key bridge crossing could have led allies over Rhine river and into Germany.Aiello's unit had been assigned to the campaign that called for glider and airborne troops to seize the bridges in the Netherlands to allow British tank units to cross into Germany.Aiello went missing during an intense four-day battle in the Kiekberg Woods near the Waal River bridge at Nijmegen.The War Department issued a presumptive finding that Aiello was killed in action.More than 70 years later, his remains were exhumed from the Ardennes American Cemetery and sent to the DPAA laboratory for identification in May 2016.The DPAA laboratory conducted analysis, comparing the remains to DNA samples taken from Aiello's relatives and found a match.Expert team for delicate work The DPAA's mission is to recover personnel listed as prisoners of war or missing in action from all past wars and conflicts all over the world.The agency has an annual budget of $112 million.Tucker said the agency, made up of civilian and military experts from all branches, successfully identifies about 200 service members each year."We have intelligence analysts that help us research our cases, to explosive ordnance disposal technicians that deploy out to the field with our research team to make sure these ancient battlefields are safe for our personnel," he said.Tucker recalls a mission to Tarawa in the Gilbert Islands, where the U.S. Marines fought the Japanese Army during World War II."We were doing an excavation and one of the villagers next to where we were digging comes to us and says, 'Hey, I found a bomb, years ago, and it's been sitting in my house ever since.'And it was this huge unexploded ordnance just sitting in his living room... We're putting shovels into the ground, we need to make sure it's safe for the team," Tucker said.Anthropologists, counterintelligence experts, human intelligence collectors, researchers and forensic specialists and linguists assemble into a 10-14 member research and investigation team.They research archives in the host nation, investigate leads in "last known alive" cases and obtain oral histories about particular battles.Over 82,000 unaccounted for As of October, the agency is working to recover 82,429 soldiers, with many others pending administrative review.Most of them, 72,978, are from World War II.Another 7,717 are from the Korean War, with 5,000 believed to be in North Korea."North Korea is a tricky one for us," Tucker said, adding that they haven't been able to send teams there since around 2005."In 2011, we were about to send a team ... and two weeks before we were set to deploy, that's when they started firing rockets into the ocean and so the president said 'no go.'"During the Korean War, a North Korean Army major took command of over 700 American prisoners of war in October 1950.Only 262 of those men returned alive.One survivor of the camp, U.S. Army Pfc.Wayne A."Johnnie" Johnson, secretly recorded the names of 496 fellow prisoners who died during captivity and later published them.DPAA still uses that information.Since the early 2000s, DPAA has received 208 boxes of remains from North Korea and the agency has been able to identify more than 400 individuals.Soldiers missing from the Vietnam War number 1,602; the Cold War has 126 missing and six are listed from Iraq and other conflicts.Will DPAA ever complete its mission?"We estimate that 33,000, give or take, can actually be recovered.The other remaining portion of that is like deep-water losses related to World War II and just situations we will never be able to recover the remains from with today's current technology," Tucker said."But are we going to get to a point where we have done all we can?Not in my lifetime, it is painstaking work.But eventually, I hope we don't have any more cases to resolve, that would be a pretty good thing, if we have done everything we can and accounted for every individual we can is a good thing."Aiello was posthumously awarded the nation's fourth-highest award, the Bronze Star, along with the Purple Heart.His name is recorded at the Tablets of the Missing at the Netherlands American Cemetery in Margraten, Netherlands, along with others listed as missing in action from WWII.A rosette will be placed next to his name to indicate he has been accounted and returned home.
Air Force pilot shortage has grown, is 'stretching the force to the limit':::::Nov. 10 (UPI) -- The Pilot shortage that has dogged the U.S. Air Force has gotten worse as the service's top officials say the shortage has surged to about 2,000 airmen.In September, U.S. Air Force Chief of Staff Goldfein told attendees at the annual Air Crew Summit at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland that the service is "in a crisis" that could compromise its ability to defend the nation.According to Goldfein and Air Force Secretary Heather Wilson, it's gotten worse."Last summer, we were reporting to people that we were about 1,500 pilots short in the Air Force -- and we expected it to get worse," Air Force Secretary Heather Wilson told reporters on Thursday."Almost 2,000 pilots short of a force that has 20,000 pilots, so that's one in 10 that we're short."At the Air Crew Summit, Goldfein challenged presenters and leaders in September to develop new and creative solutions for problems such as pilot training limitations, filling staff positions and retaining personnel.Adoption of a new federal budget will help the Air Force start correcting the issue, Wilson said."The fiscal 2018 continuing resolution is actually delaying our efforts to increase the readiness of the force, and risk accumulates over time," Wilson said."We are stretching the force to the limit, and we need to start turning the corner on readiness."Thursday's announcement comes just a month after President Donald J. Trump amended an existing executive order issued under President George W. Bush in the days following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.Executive Order 13223, citing emergency powers and giving broader authority to the Air Force to recall for active duty retired aviators.However, U.S. Air Force officials have indicated they had no plans at the time to act on the authority granted to them by the president.During Thursday's briefing at the Pentagon, Goldfein said that while airmen are meeting requirements to complete missions, the stretch is taking a toll on the Air Force and they are looking for ways to "reduce tension on the force."Goldfein and Wilson both said adoption of a new budget by Congress would help push forward some ideas to ease the strain and help allow the Air Force to maintain its mission."Surge has become the new normal," Wilson said."Less than one percent of Americans serve in uniform and protect the rest of us, and they're carrying a heavy burden.We are burning out our people because we are too small for what the nation is asking of us."
Lockheed awarded contract for integration of F-35, SDB-II:::::Nov. 10 (UPI) -- Pentagon officials announced Thursday that Lockheed Martin Aeronautics has been awarded a contract for weapons technology and development support on the F-35 Lightning II joint strike fighter and small-diameter bomb II for the U.S. Marine Corps and Air Force.The deal is estimated to be worth more than $34.6 million and is classified as a cost-plus-fixed-fee contract -- where Lockheed Martin will be reimbursed by the U.S. government on a negotiated fee that is fixed before the contract is set in stone.Defense Department officials are enabling Lockheed to develop "weapons capabilities technology maturation and risk reduction pre-engineering, manufacturing and development activities," according to a Pentagon statement.In July, Lockheed Martin was awarded a $5.6 billion contract modification to an existing contract for Lot 11 low-rate acquisition of the F-35 Lightning II fighter.That contract called for the procurement needs of the the Air Force, Marine Corps, Navy, allied nations and customers under the foreign military sales program, which provides for 74 Fiscal 2017 aircraft, including 48 F-35As for the Air Force, 19 F-35Bs for the Marine Corps, and eight F-35Cs for the Navy and Marine Corps.Raytheon announced last month that it has already started integrating the SDB-II system on the F-35, F/A-18E/F and F-15E aircraft.Work on Thursday's contract announcement will be performed in Fort Worth, Texas, and is expected to be completed in July 2018, according to Pentagon officials.Fiscal 2017 research, development, test and evaluation funds for the U.S. Marine Corps and U.S. Air Force in the amount of $6 million are being obligated at the time of award, all of which, the Pentagon said, will expire at the end of the current fiscal year.
Oil prices flat, but still seeing a geopolitical risk premium:::::Nov. 10 (UPI) -- Simmering tensions in the Middle East continued to support a risk premium for crude oil prices Friday, with U.S. oil starting to test the $60 per barrel range.Crude oil prices jumped more than 3 percent in Monday trading after a crackdown on corruption in Saudi Arabia was interpreted as a grip on power by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and tacit support for an OPEC-led drive to stimulate oil prices with coordinated production cuts.Those cuts would support the value of Saudi Aramco, which on Thursday signed a handful of deals valued at more than $4 billion.More risk was added, meanwhile, when Riyadh called its citizens out of Lebanon following the abrupt resignation of Prime Minister Saad Hariri."The call to get out of Lebanon is being a possible signal that Saudi Arabia may be about to attack," Phil Flynn, a senior market analyst for the PRICE Futures Group in Chicago, said in an emailed market report.Elsewhere, global markets could be tightening because of developments in Venezuela, a member of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.The country may have failed to met its $1.1 billion in obligations to its creditors last week, and the U.S. government this week hit a dozen Venezuelans with sanctions because of allegations of ties to a fraudulent elections.A market report emailed by RBC Capital on Friday said that geopolitical risk, improved demand and lower global oil volumes meant the bullish sentiments were firmly entrenched."Despite countless head fakes in the oil market over recent years, the drastically improved fundamental backdrop makes the recent rally more sustainable than the previous myriad of stutter steps," the report read.The price for Brent crude oil was up just 0.1 percent to $64 per barrel as of 9:20 a.m. EST.West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark for the price of oil, was flat at $57.17 per barrel.Markets since Monday's surge have been volatile, though gains this year have been substantial.The price for Brent crude oil is up 15 percent since the beginning of October and continues to test multi-year highs.The market may move later in the trading day once oilfield services company Baker Hughes releases its weekly rig count, which offers a reflection of activity in exploration and production.Gains in the United States, where production is testing the OPEC-led balancing effort, could indicate future production growth and drag oil prices lower.Flynn said demand is soaring, however, and the fundamental signs of a stronger market are becoming clear."Oil and product demand is soaring," he said."Oil products like gas and diesel are tightening and we are in a major tightening cycle."
Vehicle emissions per driver on the rise, study finds:::::Nov. 10 (UPI) -- The average emissions emitted per individual driver in the United States is getting worse, a report Friday from the University of Michigan found.The Transportation Resource Institute at the university said its eco-driving index, which measures the amount of greenhouse gas emissions per individual driver, is getting worse."The EDI indicates that the average new-vehicle driver produced 18 percent lower emissions in August 2017 than in October 2007, but 4 percent higher emissions than the record low reached in November 2013," the emailed report read.According to the International Energy Agency, about a quarter of the total global greenhouse gas emissions come from the transportation sector.U.S. refineries switch late in the year to a winter-blend of gasoline, which is less expensive to make because more steps are needed with the summer-blend to prevent excessive evaporation.As a result, summer blends improve gas mileage.The Michigan study, meanwhile, said average fuel economy is lower, but it was basing its metrics on the window-sticker value of new vehicles sold in the United States last month.From September to October, the average mile-per-gallon was lower by 0.1."The value for October is up 5.1 mpg since October 2007, but down 0.3 mpg from the peak of 25.5 mpg reached in August 2014," the report read.Meanwhile, a separate report from the institute, co-authored by Brandon Schoettle and Michael Sivak, found both battery-powered and plug-in hybrids are at the point where they're capable of meeting the daily travel needs of most U.S. drivers.Recent improvements in range and charging times, their report read, has led to wider acceptance and reduced "range anxiety" already.
Commitment questions surface over Keystone XL:::::Nov. 10 (UPI) -- Though market momentum is moving in favor of the project, progress on Keystone XL depends on overcoming some level of reluctance, an analyst said.Pipeline company TransCanada secured a long-awaited permit from the U.S. government this year to advance its cross-border Keystone XL project to the U.S. Gulf Coast.In addressing third quarter performance, the company said it had about 500,000 barrels of oil per day committed to the pipeline, which is about 60 percent of the total design capacity.A decision drafted in 2015 by the State Department under U.S. President Barack Obama said there were questions about the necessity for additional North American pipeline capacity given uncertainties about the future growth of Canadian oil sands production."Long-term trends that drive the investment decisions of oil-sands producers are difficult to predict," the State Department's decision read."Since production remains uncertain post 2018, the corresponding amount of transportation infrastructure required also remains uncertain."In its quarterly statement, TransCanada said it was updating shipping contracts and anticipated modifications because new clients could come on board, while others reduced commitments."We anticipate commercial support for the project to be substantially similar to that which existed when we first applied for a Keystone XL pipeline permit," the company stated.Lower crude oil prices in 2015 crimped spending in the energy sector and starved economies like Canada's that depend heavily on oil for revenue.In terms of cost, the State Department's analysis from 2015 said most Canadian pipeline projects would break even with oil holding steady at between $65 and $75 per barrel.Brent crude oil was $64 per barrel in early Friday trading.Sandy Fielden, the director of research, commodities and energy at Morningstar, told UPI that TransCanada will commit to the project if shippers commit to the project, adding the company might be cautious about upsetting its client base after cancelling its Energy East oil pipeline project meant to feed eastern Canadian markets.Fielden said the overall market outline is improving for Canada, but producers are also nervous about making any sort of commitment."The whole thing is kind of a chicken and egg saga, with producers reluctant to pull the trigger and TransCanada scared to invest without their support," he said.The State Department under President Donald Trump said in its permitting decision the break-evens for Canadian oil projects remained the same, but the sector in general has proven itself to be resilient in the low-price cycle.The ability of Canadian producers to sustain production during a period of lower oil prices led the U.S. government to "have confidence" that more oil pipeline infrastructure was needed.Dan McTeague, an analyst with GasBuddy who monitors pipeline developments in Canada, said the Keystone XL commitments will likely come through."There's a market for heavy Canadian crude oil, which is making its way to the Gulf Coast by hook or by crook," he said.
McDermott contract to help boost oil offshore Saudi Arabia:::::Nov. 10 (UPI) -- Vague on specifics, a contract for oilfield services company McDermott International is tied to boosting oil production for offshore Saudi Arabia.McDermott in its release to the press said work would begin immediately for an unspecified Middle East customer for engineering, procurement, construction and installation services offshore in the Arabian Gulf."This award signifies our long-standing position and strong relationships with our Middle East customers," Linh Austin, a regional vice president, said in a statement.The company offered few specifics other than to say it was a "major contract," which meant the value was somewhere between $750 million and $1.5 billion.Construction is slated at McDermott's facilities in Saudi Arabia and in Dubai, where it has its headquarters.The announcement followed the $4.5 billion in agreements signed between the Saudi Arabian Oil Company, known informally as Saudi Aramco, and a handful of service contractors for "megaprojects" envisioned in the energy-rich kingdom.Saudi Aramco acknowledged Thursday that McDermott was awarded a three-year contract to help enhance crude oil production at the offshore Safaniyah field, though terms weren't disclosed.While McDermott's contract was specific to crude oil production offshore, Aramco CEO Amin Nasser said the entire package of deals was part of an effort to push out more "clean-burning natural gas."The investment, he added, is part of the broader Vision 2030, which aims to bring more non-oil revenue to the Saudi economy.The Safaniyah oil field is the largest offshore field in the world, producing more than 1.2 million barrels of oil per day.Bloomberg news this week reported that Saudi Arabia aims to cut exports by 120,000 barrels per day by December.Saudi Arabia is leading efforts to stimulate crude oil prices with managed production cuts alongside other members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.OPEC economists said Saudi production was around 9.9 million barrels per day last month, adding domestic oil demand in August "dipped steeply."Rising crude oil prices have led to improved financials for companies like McDermott who cater to the exploration and production side of the industry.The company reported operating income for the third quarter at $127.1 million, compared with $43.1 million during the same period last year.
Statoil makes headway with Barents Sea field development:::::Nov. 10 (UPI) -- A construction contract for parts of a facility used to tap the Johan Castberg oil field in the Barents Sea will be signed by Christmas, Norway's Statoil said.Statoil said it signed a letter of intent with Sembcorp Marine Rigs & Floaters in Singapore for contracts related to the construction of the hull and living quarters for the floating production, storage and offloading vessel that will be deployed at Johan Castberg.Statoil estimates Johan Castberg holds between 450 million and 650 million barrels of oil equivalent.As many as 30 wells are planned for the field in the five years ending in 2024.The Norwegian company put the value of the contract at around $490 million and said signing and a final investment decision are expected by Christmas at the latest."Johan Castberg is the next major field development on the Norwegian continental shelf and important to future infrastructure in the Barents Sea," Torger Rd, Statoil's senior vice president for project development, said in a statement.The company said the northern port city of Hammerfest, located in Finnmark county, would serve as supply and helicopter base for the development of the Johan Castberg field.Statoil aims to invest around $135 million per year on the field.Norway posted an unemployment rate of 4.1 percent in August, the last full month for which the government published data.Statoil said Johan Castberg development will have ripple effects across the economy in northern counties, though no Norwegian bidders surfaced for the construction contract.Norway, one of the largest oil and gas producers in the world, said the output from petroleum-related manufacturing turned lower in the third quarter.Total manufacturing output declined 0.7 percent from the second quarter, bogged down mostly by petroleum-related activity.
EV corridor will stretch from Norway to Italy:::::Nov. 10 (UPI) -- German utility company E.ON and a mobility service provider said Friday they would work to establish an electric-vehicle corridor linking Norway to Italy.With $11.6 million in funding from the European Commission, the German company and service provider CLEVER said they'd link the countries connecting Norway to Italy with a network of 180 charging stations for electric vehicles."Although, it is still early days, both companies are seeing a global shift towards electric vehicles," the companies said in a joint statement."Countries as well as the European Union are beginning to make pledges to phase out petrol- and diesel-fueled cars and consumers and car manufactures are switching to electric vehicles."Each station will be equipped with as many as six charging points with enough electricity to charge a 250-mile range battery in about a half hour.Charging stations will be spaced every 90 miles or so across Italy, France, Germany, Denmark, the United Kingdom, Sweden and Norway during the next three years.In Germany, which has one of the greener economies in the world, E.ON already has plans to place an ultra-fast charging station at a motorway between Frankfurt and Nuremberg.Dorothee Br, the federal transport minister, said the government set aside $355 million to help build tens of thousands of charging points on the German highway network.Two million electric vehicles were on the road globally last year, though nearly all of those were in China, the European Union and the United States.A report from the International Energy Agency found that dense metropolitan areas were taking leadership roles in encouraging electric vehicles because of pollution concerns.Beijing is expanding the number of electric vehicles in the public transportation sector.In the United States last month, a handful of governors from western U.S. states rolled out plans to expand access for electric vehicles along more than 5,000 miles of highway.Economists at the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries said the share of alternative-fuel vehicles will increase to about 16 percent by 2040.They lowered a long-term forecast for oil demand in part because of an expected decline in the global economy, structural shifts and "fuel switching, particularly in the road transportation sector."
Kurdish oil export payments in line with average:::::Nov. 10 (UPI) -- Energy companies working inside Kurdish territory in northern Iraq reported payments received by the government for exports that appeared within historic norms.Gulf Keystone Petroleum, which operates the Shaikan oil field in the Kurdish north, reported payments for crude oil exports for July at a gross $15 million.The sales total, of which $12 million is net to Gulf Keystone Petroleum, is consistent with the export payment received by the Kurdistan Regional Government in June.Separately, Norwegian oil and gas company DNO, which operates the Tawke license area in Kurdish territory, reported Friday it received $46.53 million for exports from August.DNO also received another $4.27 million from the KRG, which represents its 3 percent of the Tawke license revenues.DNO shares the export revenue with its operating partner, Genel Energy.Neither company offered an explicit volume designated for exports, though DNO's production estimates would put the total at more than 100,000 barrels of oil per day.DNO said this week that third quarter production averaged 115,200 barrels of oil equivalent per day.Kurdish assets represented the clear majority of the company's portfolio, with output at 110,500 bpd during the quarter.Iraqi forces in early October wrestled for control over oil fields in Kirkuk, a territory of dispute between the federal government and the semiautonomous KRG.Crude oil from northern Iraq flows primarily by truck and through a pipeline from Kurdish territory to a Turkish sea port.A second pipeline from Iraqi territory in the north could be used once it's rehabilitated, and British energy BP suggested it was in broader talks with efforts in Kirkuk.Data supplied by commodity pricing group S&P Global Platts to UPI show total Kurdish exports at around 250,000 barrels per day from Oct. 17.That's less than half the total from before Iraqi forces seized control over the oil fields in Kirkuk, severing an economic lifeline for the Kurdish north.A spokesperson for Genel said operations at the Tawke and the separate Taq Taq areas have continued uninterrupted.
Raytheon, Saab to develop improved shoulder-launched weapon systems:::::Nov. 9 (UPI) -- Raytheon and the Swedish aerospace and defense firm Saab will partner to develop new weapons for infantry forces, the companies said in a joint statement on Thursday.The companies said that they will first look to upgrading the Carl-Gustaf reloadable shoulder-launched weapon, an 84mm anti-tank recoilless rifle used by the United States, Britain and 38 other countries.Additionally, the companies are looking to enhance Saab's AT-4 disposable weapon system to meet near-term U.S. and international requirements.The AT-4 also fires 84mm rockets, however they are unguided."Putting the best equipment in the hands of soldiers is our main mission," Kim Ernzen, Raytheon Land Warfare Systems vice president, said in a press release."Saab and Raytheon bring the power of the world's latest technologies to make this happen."Saab has worked to modernize the multi-role weapon as soldiers' needs on the battlefield change.The company made it more portable by reducing the weight of the newest version, the M4/M3E1, from 22 to 15 pounds."Collaborating with Raytheon, utilizing their technical and product excellence in combination with our technology, will enhance the already world-leading Carl-Gustaf and AT4 weapon systems with additional capabilities that will further increase the operational benefit for the end user," said Grgen Johansson, who leads Saab's Dynamics business.
Navy contracts with Bell Helicopter for two AH-1Z Vipers:::::Nov. 9 (UPI) -- Bell Helicopter Textron has been awarded a contract modification for the manufacture and delivery of two Bell AH-1Z Viper twin-engine attack helicopter to the U.S. Navy, the Department of Defense announced on Wednesday.The deal is estimated to be worth more than $38.3 million and is classified as a fixed-price-incentive-firm contract, meaning that once performance on the contract is complete, Bell Helicopter Textron and the U.S. government will renegotiate the final cost of the deal.The Bell AH-1Z Viper is built to meet the requirements for the United States Marine Corps, and frequently is deployed as a part of a Marine Air Ground Task Force.The AH-1Z Viper is the only attack helicopter in the world with a fully-integrated air-to-air missile capability, Bell says.The Bell AH-1Z's Target Sight System also provides the longest range and highest accuracy of any helicopter currently in existence.About 60 percent of the contract work will be performed in Fort Worth, Texas, the other 40 percent will be completed in Amarillo, Texas.The project is expected to be completed in November 2019.U.S. Navy fiscal 2017 aircraft procurement funds in the amount of $38.3 million will be obligated at time of award, none of which will expire at the end of the current fiscal year.
BAE completes full scale test of F-35A airframe:::::Nov. 9 (UPI) -- BAE Systems announced Thursday that the contractor successfully completed its full scale durability test airframe of the F-35A aircraft.The completion is the culmination of the F-35A's third life testing at BAE Systems' testing facility in East Yorkshire in England, which is equivalent to 24,000 hours of "flying."The airframe, known officially as the AJ-1,is designed to operate from conventional runways, and is the only F-35 variant to carry an internal cannon, according to Lockheed Martin, who also works on the F-35 Lightning II aircraft fleet.The U.S. Air Force, as well as the majority of allied air forces and Foreign Military Sales nations, will operate the F-35A, eventually replacing their 3rd and 4th generation aircraft."The F-35 program requires a service life of 8,000 flight hours," Kathy Nesmith, F-35 joint program office airframe team lead, said in a press release."This is verified through durability testing to two lifetimes or 16,000 hours.Completing third life testing on the F-35A durability article will provide us the data to enable the warfighter to maintain and sustain this aircraft beyond 2050."The F-35B and F-35C durability test airframes already have completed 16,000 hour second life testing, with additional tests being conducted to maximize the life of the aircraft.The good news from BAE Systems comes after years of the F-35 being dogged with controversies that range from overbudgeting to numerous delays and design flaws.In recent years, there have been growing concerns over the F-35's onboard computer systems and, according to the FBI, Chinese hackers may have stolen classified data related to the F-35 project."The 5th generation F-35, with advanced speed and agility, pushes the boundaries of engineering and physics," said Matt Edghill, F-35 structures development director at Lockheed Martin."This durability testing confirms the airframe will perform in and withstand the demanding environments it will experience throughout its operational lifetime.Completion of the F-35A's third lifetime test gives our program great confidence in the aircraft's strength and durability for decades to come."
Raytheon contracted for development, integration of G550 systems:::::Nov. 9 (UPI) -- Pentagon officials announced Wednesday a contract with Raytheon for the development and integration of the Commercial Aircraft Based Instrumentation Telemetry System and the Airborne Command Transmitter System on the G550 airborne early warning aircraft.The deal is estimated to be worth more than $79.6 million and is classified as a fixed-price-incentive-firm contract, meaning, that once performance on the contract is complete, Raytheon and the U.S. government will renegotiate the final cost of the deal.The U.S. Navy purchased the CAEW-based Gulfstream 550 for range support in March 2016 in order to replace the Lockheed NP-3D "Billboard" aircraft brought out of retirement in 2010 by the Air and Test and Evaluation Squadron VX-30, which is based at Point Mugu, California.Work on the contract will be performed in Albuquerque, N.M., and is expected to be completed in February 2022.Fiscal 2017 research, development, test and evaluation funds from the U.S. Navy in the amount of $6.5 million will be obligated at time of award, all of which will expire at the end of the current fiscal year.
Risk premium resurfaces for oil, but economic trends offer balance:::::Nov. 9 (UPI) -- Crackdowns in Saudi Arabia were balanced by signs that European economic growth was stronger, but facing pressures ahead, to send oil prices higher Thursday.The Saudi Center for International Communication said more than 200 individuals have been called in for questioning so far by the nation's attorney general.Arrests during the weekend, ostensibly part of a crackdown on corruption, sent oil prices soaring more than 3 percent early this week.The Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority sought to allay investor concerns, however, by saying Wednesday it was "business as usual" for banks and corporations in the oil-rich kingdom, though what seems to be a grab on power solidifies Riyahd's position of pushing for higher oil prices ahead of plans to offer public shares in state-owned oil company Saudi Aramco.Meanwhile, European data offered mixed signals in early morning trading.Real growth in gross domestic product for the European nations that use the euro currency is on pace to expand at 2.2 percent for its fastest pace in a decade."The EU economy is performing well overall.Economic growth and job creation are robust, investment is picking up and government deficit and debt are gradually decreasing," Valdis Dombrovskis, the commissioner in charge of financial stability, said in a statement."There are however significant differences across member states, with some of them still experiencing considerable slack in the labor market."Momentum slows with growth for the euro area and broader European Union easing to 2.1 percent next year and 1.9 percent in 2019.The price for Brent crude oil was relatively even moments before the opening bell in New York to trade at $63.47 per barrel, a gain of less than 1 percent from the previous close.West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark for the price of oil, was up 0.18 percent to $56.92 per barrel.In other economies, The Conference Board said its leading economic index for Japan declined 0.1 percent in September.In Quebec, Bank of Canada Gov.Stephen Poloz said inflation in advanced economies was soft, but fundamentals were strong, adding "the laws of supply and demand have not been repealed."Crude oil prices continue to test new highs, after breaking two-year records in recent sessions.A commentary sent by email from commodity pricing group S&P Global Platts said the bulls still have it."Bullish sentiment has returned to the market as of late, with contributors including conflict in the Middle East, expectations OPEC will extend production cuts at their upcoming meeting, the U.S. oil rig count continuing to trend downward, and the belief that the global market is approaching balance," the statement read.
Shale-rich Oklahoma fails to pass budget measure:::::Nov. 9 (UPI) -- The worst-case scenario for shale-rich Oklahoma is now a reality after state leaders in the House failed to advance a budget plan, the governor said.Gov.Mary Fallin said late Wednesday she was "extremely disappointed" that House leaders couldn't clear the three-fourths passage necessary to advance a budget measure to the Senate."As a result of their no votes, our state will not have enough funds for agencies to deliver services that work for people, especially with our state facing a $400 million shortfall next session," she said in a statement.The measure would have raised taxes on gross production from new oil and gas wells, cigarettes, motor fuels and low-proof alcoholic beverages.Fallin said that, by not passing the bill on, it killed a last-ditch effort to address a $215 million shortfall in the current budget.State Sen. John Sparks, a Democrat, said the House showed obvious support for using cash-on-hand to plug the budget cap, something he said lead to a downgrade in the state's credit rating.According to state public radio KOSU, employees working for energy companies in the state lobbied against the budget plan, pointing to weakness in the energy sector brought on by historically low crude oil prices.The station quoted Rep. Eric Proctor, a Democrat representing Tulsa, as saying the bill wasn't focused on drawing revenue out of the oil companies."We're not in this mess because cigarettes are too cheap," he was quoted as saying.Oklahoma is home to about 4 percent of the total petroleum reserves in the country and accounts for as much as 5 percent of the total crude oil production.The bill would've doubled the tax rate on oil and gas production at new wells.Taxes on oil and gas production generated $52 million in October, a jump of 48.4 percent from last year.Compared with September, however, tax collections from oil and gas grew just 3.7 percent.About 65 percent of the new revenue came from a 1.25 percent state sales tax on motor vehicles, while a $5 vehicle registration added $1.9 million.The state sits on the Anadarko shale reservoir.The U.S. Energy Information Administration predicts oil production there will increase about 2 percent and gas production by about 0.6 percent from October.Drilling services company Baker Hughes last week reported exploration and production activity is slowing down.
General Dynamics to sustain U.S., British submarine weapons systems:::::Nov. 9 (UPI) -- General Dynamics Mission Systems has been contracted for the sustainment of the U.S. and British SSBN Fire Control System and the U.S. SSGN Attack Weapon Control System aboard each country's nuclear ballistic-missile submarines.The deal, announced by the Department of Defense on Wednesday, is worth more than $25.7 million and classified as a cost-plus-incentive fee contract, meaning, the price paid by the U.S. government changes in relations to costs associated with sustainment services.This reduces the risks assumed by General Dynamics, which ultimately balances the risk shared between the buyer and the seller.General Dynamics will additionally provide training and support equipment, as well as research and development services, according to the Pentagon.The SSBN Fire Control System delivers critical information needed to control the launch sequence of ballistic missiles.The SSGN Attack Weapon Control System is an updated version of the SSBN Fire Control System, and gives submarine combatant commanders the ability to carry out a variety of missions, according to General Dynamics.Over 95 percent of the contract work will be performed in Pittsfield, Mass., with an estimated completion date of December 2020.Fiscal 2017 research, development, test, and evaluation funds in the amount of $976,000, along with fiscal 2018 other procurement funds from the U.S. Navy in the amount of $22.7 million and fiscal 2018 research, development, test, and evaluation funds in the amount of $959,000 will help fund the contract.British funds in the amount of $1.1 million are being obligated on the award as well.Funds in the amount of $976,000 will expire at the end of the current fiscal year, the Pentagon said.
Cuba gets new oil drilling director:::::Nov. 9 (UPI) -- Cuban oil development plans moved one step closer to operation with the naming of an on-site planning coordinator, an Australian energy company said.Melbana Energy Ltd. is one of the few Western energy companies with a Cuban portfolio, and the only one listed on the Australian stock exchange.The company said Thursday it chose a drilling director, Heriberto Vasco Mufioz, whose experience with Cuban and international oil companies spans more than 40 years."This appointment is an important step as we build our organizational capability to progress through the permitting, procurement and logistics phases in preparation for the drilling of up to two wells in Block 9 production sharing contract commencing mid-2018," Managing Director and CEO Peter Stickland said in a Thursday statement.The company aims to tap the Alameda-1 prospect, which the company said is in an area that has more than 630 million recoverable barrels of oil at the high end.Quarterly progress in Cuba included advances on engineering and permitting processes.Hurricane Irma battered the north of Cuba as a Category 3 storm in early September before turning north for its run up Florida's western coast, though Melbana gave no indication that its license areas on the northern shores of Cuba were damaged by the storm.Melbana's announcement came as the U.S. government said it was tightening sanctions on Cuban economic activity to steer revenue away from military, intelligence and security services.The company estimates it would cost at least $10 million to drill two wells in Cuba.Its partnership agreement with Petro Australis Ltd. fell apart because of the lack of approval from regulatory authorities, leaving Melbana with a 100 percent stake in Cuban operations and without a partner that would carry 40 percent of the drilling costs.Cuba produces around 45,000 barrels per day on average, according to Melbana.
House committee passes bill to unlock more U.S. offshore areas to drillers:::::Nov. 9 (UPI) -- Though it passed a committee with bipartisan support, a Democratic leader in the U.S. House said efforts to expand offshore drilling show signs of "mental exhaustion."Texas Democrats joined their Republican counterparts on the House Committee on Natural Resources in passing the so-called SECURE American Energy Act, H.R.4239, which would expand access to drilling for oil and gas offshore and offer some support for wind energy development.Most states bordering the Gulf of Mexico secure royalties from oil and gas operations under measures signed by President George W. Bush.The SECURE Act would expand revenue-sharing to Alaska and Atlantic states and ease presidential control over what can and can't be put off limits, a swipe at President Barack Obama's late-term push to put some offshore areas out of reach.Rep. Raul Grijalva, an Arizona Democrat and ranking member on the committee, said the bill distributes oil and gas revenue in a way that could show favoritism."This bill has all the signs of mental exhaustion," he said in a statement."Nobody outside the petro-bubble takes their [supporter's] arguments seriously any longer."Supporters of the measure say the Obama administration put most of the territorial waters off limits to drillers.The federal government now estimates about 90 billion barrels of oil have yet to be discovered in U.S. territorial waters, and the GOP and industry leaders say more drilling could create hundreds of thousands of new jobs and generate $200 billion in revenue.Dan Naatz, whose Independent Petroleum Association of America is one of seven industry groups supporting the measure, said H.R.4239 was a common-sense act that "reins in bureaucratic overreach and expands offshore energy development opportunities.""With this legislation, we can unlock our vast energy potential, advance American energy dominance and generate revenues at all levels of government," Chairman Rob Bishop, R-Utah, said in a statement.A group of eleven environmental and conservation groups, for their part, called the SECURE Act shameful.In its own statement, ocean advocacy group Oceana said the measure would offer short-term support for the oil industry, but with long-term impacts on marine ecosystems.
OMV sees Brent oil at $52 for the year:::::Nov. 9 (UPI) -- A 9 percent gain in realized crude oil prices during the third quarter helped contribute to a 52 percent jump in year-on-year profits, Austria's OMV said.OMV reported an operating net profit in the third quarter of $933 million, up 52 percent from the same period last year.The company said gains were supported by a 14 percent quarterly gain in Brent crude oil prices, which it said came largely from commitment to an agreement led by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to balance an oversupplied market with managed production declines.The company said its own realized crude oil price increased 9 percent during the period, lower than quarterly market gain because of a varied oil portfolio.The price for Brent, OMV said, should average $52 per barrel for the year.Brent crude was trading nearly $64 per barrel early Thursday.U.S. supermajor ConocoPhillips said earlier this week it was pegging its three-year spending plan on West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark for oil, at around $50 per barrel.Brent had a $6.70 per barrel premium over WTI in early trading.For production, costs for OMV declined by 13 percent during the quarter to $8.80 per barrel of oil equivalent, while output increased 13 percent to 341,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.For natural gas, the company said its primary market in Europe was still oversupplied, though gas prices were following crude oil prices higher for the year.OMV has a role in Russian plans to twin its Nord Stream natural gas pipeline through the Baltic Sea, though U.S. sanctions and European concerns about Russia's grip on the energy sector pose challenges to implementation.Elsewhere, the company said its operations in OPEC-member Libya were moving on the positive side of production.Its share of Libyan operations should yield 20,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day during the second half of the year.Libya is exempt from the OPEC production agreement so it can steer oil revenue toward national security efforts.
DNO says Kurdish oil operations continuing without interruption:::::Nov. 9 (UPI) -- Norwegian oil and gas company DNO said Thursday it was moving full speed ahead in the Kurdish north of Iraq, with operations proceeding without interruption.The company said its operating profit soared in the third quarter and revenues improved year-on-year.Third quarter revenue of $73 million was down 11 percent from the previous term, but 48 percent higher than the same period last year.DNO said third quarter production averaged 115,200 barrels of oil equivalent per day.Kurdish assets represented the clear majority of the company's portfolio, with output at 110,500 barrels per day during the quarter.The company in September assumed the role of operator after acquiring 50 percent of Exxon Mobil's stake in the Baeshiqa reserve area, but conceded that Exxon's early efforts were disrupted by security concerns related to the regional fight against the group calling itself the Islamic State.Iraqi and Kurdish paramilitary forces engaged in battle in the weeks that followed a controversial Kurdish referendum for independence from federal Iraq.As Kurdish forces conceded contested territory, Iraqi troops seized control over the oil fields in Kirkuk, cutting off a revenue lifeline for the semiautonomous Kurdistan Regional Government.The Kurdish referendum coincided more or less with the liberation of parts of northern Iraq from the Islamic State.Oil leaves the Kurdish region from a pipeline and by trucks to a Turkish port at Ceyhan.DNO said operations inside Kurdish territory are continuing without interuption."The company has received year-to-date export payments totaling $297 million net to DNO, up from $210 million during the full-year 2016," it said."With continuing export payments, DNO will step up investments in Kurdistan in 2018."Earlier this week, the Kurdish Ministry of Natural Resources said it was postponing a London oil and gas conference meant to showcase the regional potential "due to the current logistical and other circumstances."
China examines LNG potential in Alaska:::::Nov. 9 (UPI) -- A Chinese energy company, Sinopec, said it may be interested in looking at whether or not it can buy liquefied natural gas from Alaska on a regular basis.Alaska's state government and the Alaska Gasline Development Corp. signed an agreement with Chinese lenders and China Petrochemical Corp., or Sinopec, to advance discussions on the LNG potential in Alaska.The agreement was signed in the presence of U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping.An LNG project in the design phase in Alaska would connect a natural gas reservoir in Prudhoe Bay through 800 miles of pipe to a liquefaction plant on the southcentral Alaskan coast."Sinopec is interested in the possibility of LNG purchase on a stable basis from Alaska LNG," Sinopec stated.Chinese demand for LNG is on pace to grow by about 30 percent from last year by 2020.Kerry-Anne Shanks, the head of Asia gas and LNG research at consultant group Wood Mackenzie, said Alaska's LNG prospects are still in the early stage of development, with a few years to go before planners even make a final investment decision."Wood Mackenzie classifies it as speculative, which means the commercial structure and marketing plan are not yet clear," she said in an emailed statement.Hugo Brennan, an analyst on Asia for Verisk Maplecroft, was more direct."This kind of commercial agreement allows Trump to portray himself as a master dealmaker, while distracting from a lack of progress on structural reforms to the bilateral trade relationship," he said.Both analysts said cost may be an impediment to the arrangement, noting that China could secure LNG from cheaper reserves closer to home, notably from Australia or Qatar, which already have established LNG infrastructure.Russian independent gas producer Novatek reached an agreement with a Chinese bank to help implement an Arctic LNG project last week.Nevertheless, Alaska Gov.Bill Walker was optimistic about the prospects of the deal.His state has already cut 44 percent from its spending obligations over the last four years and tapped into more than $14 billion from savings.With oil prices low by relative standards, he said the state needed to find new sources of revenue to pay the salaries of teachers and police officers.With all major parties at least agreeing on direction, the governor said the LNG plan was a "big project" with "big benefits."There are more steps before a final investment decision is reached, but having the largest LNG buyer in the world participating in this project means the Alaska LNG project has favorable market engagement at the highest level," he said in a statement.
Lockheed test pilot reaches 100 hours in proposed 5th generation trainer:::::Nov. 8 (UPI) -- Lockheed Martin announced Wednesday that their test pilot, Lt. Col. Mark "Red" Ward, a retired U.S. Air Force officer, reached a new milestone by becoming the first pilot to reach 100 flight hours in the T-50A, Lockheed's advanced pilot training.The T-50A is aimed at training future pilots for 5th generation aircraft such as the F-22 Raptor and F-35 Lighting II."This has been a great opportunity to be involved in a project that is so important to the U.S. Air Force and the foundation for pilot training," Ward said."It's a great plane to fly and will make an excellent trainer for generations of pilots to come."The T-50A is similar to flying the F-16, as well as the F-22 and F-35, as it "creates better pilots, in less time, for less cost by enabling student pilots to focus their airmanship skills on improved aero performance, digital flight controls/fly-by-wire, with NextGen air traffic management systems, while operating from an anthropometrically designed 5th Generation cockpit," Lockheed Martin said.Ward passed the 100-hour mark shortly after take-off from Greenville on the way to the 2017 Joint Base San Antonio Air Show and Open House at JBSA-Lackland Kelly Field Annex in Texas, which took place earlier this month, the company said in a press release.
Raytheon, Australia ink first deal for ground-based air defense system:::::Nov. 8 (UPI) -- The Australian Department of Defense has signed a $12.1 million contract deal with Raytheon Australia for the first stage of development for the Short Range Ground Based Air Defense project.Announced Wednesday by Christopher Pyne, Australia's minister for defense industry, the contract will "include Risk Mitigation Activities to inform the final system configuration, which will create up to 10 new jobs.""The year-long Risk Mitigation Activity will examine the system's use in an Australian context," Pyne said."It's a significant project and the work will ensure we make the right decisions to protect our troops."Wednesday's announcement is just the first step in a project estimated to be worth up to $2 billion."The Government has committed to the highly successful National Advanced Surface to Air Missile System [NASAMS], which will be adapted to Australian requirements," Pyne said."Importantly, this work will investigate potential capability enhancements to inform the NASAMS's final system configuration, including integration with existing Australian Defense Force equipment."In April, Australia set out to develop a ground-based missile capability using the Kongsberg-designed National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System.The NASAMS-based solution for the Australian Army came through a single supplier limited tender process to Raytheon Australia, the prime systems integrator.Kongsberg, which manufactures NASAMS along with Raytheon, will be a major subcontractor.The Australian NASAMS will feature locally made components and be mounted on Hawkei vehicles."This will include integration testing with CEA Technologies' phased array radar system and Thales Australia's Hawkei and Bushmaster protected mobility vehicles," Pyne said."The Short Range Ground Based Air Defense system will provide the innermost layer of Australia's enhanced integrated air and missile defense capability, operated by Army's 16th Air Land Regiment."
Waning risk premium, more U.S. production pushes oil prices lower:::::Nov. 8 (UPI) -- A declining risk premium on word of business-as-usual from Saudi Arabia and expectations of a cooler market ahead pushed oil prices lower early Wednesday.Crude oil prices spiked as much as 3 percent early this week after the government in Riyadh rounded up a handful of ministers as part of a sweeping crackdown tacitly broadcast as a move against corruption.That coincided with escalating tensions in the region, pitting rivals Iran and Lebanon against Saudi Arabia.The Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority sought to allay investor concerns, however, putting a lid on the risk premium from early this week."It is business as usual for both banks and corporat[ions]," the official Saudi Press Agency stated.The price for Brent crude oil was down 0.42 percent to $63.42 per barrel as of 9:15 a.m. EST.West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark for the price of oil, was down 0.33 percent to $57.01 per barrel.Oil prices may be approaching the point at which shale oil producers in the United States kick into overdrive, undermining an approach by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to correct an oversupplied market with coordinated production cuts.U.S. supermajor ConocoPhillips said Wednesday its three-year spending plan was supported so long as WTI held above $50 per barrel.In its short-term market report, published Tuesday, the U.S. Energy Information Administration raised its growth forecast for next year by about 6 percent to 720,000 barrels per day, to give an average production rate for next year of 9.95 million barrels per day."The U.S. shale machine is poised to shift up a gear as producers make hay amid the improving price backdrop," Stephen Brennock, an analyst with London oil broker PVM, said in an emailed market report.Markets will react later in the day when EIA releases its official data on U.S. crude oil and gasoline inventories.The American Petroleum Institute reported a drain on crude oil levels of about 1.5 million barrels, though gasoline storage levels showed a slight gain, indicating seasonal demand factors may finally be emerging.EIA forecast a steady drift lower for crude oil prices for the rest of the year, with Brent shedding as much as $7 per barrel for the 2018 average."EIA expects global oil supply growth to outpace global oil demand growth in 2018, contributing to global oil inventories rising by a forecast 0.3 million barrels per day in 2018, compared with an estimated 0.2 million barrels per day draw in 2017," the report read.
Senate, unlike House, would keep mortgage deduction intact:::::Senate Republicans have a message for their House counterparts: leave the mortgage interest deduction alone.On Thursday, Senate Republicans unveiled their version of a tax reform bill, and it retains the current tax break that allows homeowners to deduct interest on mortgages up to $1 million, according to initial materials from the Senate Finance Committee.That's in contrast to the House bill proposed last week, that would limit the deduction to home loans over $500,000.That lower cap would have only applied to new mortgages.As lawmakers work to merge their two plans, a new limit could emerge on how much mortgage interest homeowners can deduct.So far this year, 5.4% of all loans originated were more than $500,000, according to data from ATTOM Data Solutions, or about 325,000 loans.The proposed reduction in the House bill became a major point of contention last week.The housing industry quickly came out against the limit.But the response to the Senate plan was cautiously optimistic."While the Senate plan to keep the mortgage interest deduction at the $1 million mortgage cap is a positive development, we will have to carefully examine the full package once it's released to assess if it is good for housing, middle-class families and the small business community," said Jerry Howard, CEO of the National Association of Home Builders in a statement Thursday evening.Related: What's in the Senate Republican's tax bill The deduction helps make home buying more affordable.While mortgage rates are currently sitting below 4%, home prices have been rising thanks to tight housing supply in many markets.The median home price across the United States is currently $254,000, according to the National Association of Realtors.But even if the $1 million amount is protected, fewer Americans could end up claiming the deduction.Both tax proposals also nearly double the standard deduction, which likely means fewer people will itemize their deductions.In order to claim the mortgage interest rate deduction, homeowners need to itemize.The Tax Policy Center estimated that the percent of filers who claim the deduction would fall to 4% from 21%.
What's in the Senate Republicans' tax bill:::::Senate Republicans on Thursday unveiled the substance of their tax reform bill, one week after their House colleagues released their own legislation.Some of the Senate GOP proposals will be welcomed by critics of the House bill.For instance, Senate tax writers will not propose curbing the mortgage interest deduction.But others will raise hackles.The Senate GOP plan would fully repeal the state and local tax deduction.Below are some key provisions of the Senate bill that would affect taxes on personal income and business income.FOR INDIVIDUALS Change individual income tax brackets: There are seven brackets in today's individual tax code: 10%, 15%, 25%, 28%, 33%, 35%, and 39.6%.The Senate bill also calls for seven brackets but changes the rates on taxable income to: 10% (income up to $9,525 for individuals; $19,050 for married couples filing jointly) 12% (over $9,525 to $38,700; over $19,050 to $77,400 for couples) 22.5% (over $38,700 to $60,000; over $77,400 to $120,000 for couples) 25% (over $60,000 to $170,000; over $120,000 to $290,000 for couples) 32.5% (over $170,000 to $200,000; over $290,000 to $390,000 for couples) 35% (over $200,000 to $500,000; over $390,000 to $1 million for couples) 38.5% (over $500,000; over $1 million for couples) The House bill, by contrast, only calls for four brackets: 12%, 25%, 35% and 39.6%.Nearly double the standard deduction: Like the House bill, Senate Republicans would significantly raise today's standard deduction.In the Senate bill, the deduction for singles increases to $12,000 from $6,350 currently; and it raises it for married couples filing jointly to $24,000 from $12,700.That would drastically reduce the number of people who opt to itemize their deductions, since the only reason to do so is if your individual deductions combined exceed the standard deduction amount.Eliminate personal exemptions: Today you're allowed to claim a $4,050 personal exemption for yourself, your spouse and each of your dependents.Both the Senate and House bills eliminate that option.For families with three or more kids, that could mute if not negate any tax relief they might enjoy as a result of other provisions in the bill.Fully repeal state and local tax deduction: The Senate bill would no longer let individual filers deduct their property taxes or their state and local income or sales taxes.Eliminating the state and local tax deduction was met with strong opposition from House lawmakers in high-tax states and cities.So a concession was made in the House Republicans bill to restore an itemized deduction for property taxes up to $10,000.Related: There's a loophole in House GOP's plan to kill state and local income tax deduction If the House and Senate each pass their own bills and have to reconcile the differences between them, the SALT deduction could be a huge sticking point.Both bills, however, make one big exception: Business owners and partners who pay tax on their company's profits through their individual returns would still get to deduct their state and local taxes as a business expense.Expand the child tax credit: The Senate GOP bill increases the child tax credit to $1,650 per child, up from $1,000 today, and slightly above the $1,600 proposed in the House bill.Senate GOP tax writers would make the credit available for any children under 18, up from today's under-17 age limit.But the $650 increase won't be available to the lowest income families if they don't end up owing federal income taxes.That's because unlike the first $1,000, the extra $650 wouldn't be refundable.When a credit is refundable, it means you still can get money from the government because of the credit, even when your federal income tax bill is zero.The Senate bill also greatly expands who is eligible for the credit by raising the roof on the income thresholds where the credit starts to phase out: To $500,000 for single parents, up from $75,000 today; and to $1 million from $110,000 for married couples.Meanwhile, filers with dependents who are not qualified children may be able to claim a new $500 nonrefundable credit per dependent.Keep mortgage interest deduction as is: The Senate bill would still let you claim a deduction for the interest you pay on mortgage debt up to $1 million.House tax writers proposed capping the loan limit at $500,000.But since the House and Senate bills nearly double the standard deduction, the percent of filers who claim the mortgage interest deduction would drop sharply.The Senate bill does make two changes on home-related financing.It disallows interest deductions for home equity loans.And it lengthens the time you must live in a home to get the full tax-free exclusion on your gains when you sell it.Repeal the Alternative Minimum Tax: The AMT, originally intended to ensure the richest tax filers pay at least some tax by disallowing many tax breaks, most typically hits filers making between $200,000 and $1 million today.Those who make more than that usually find they owe more tax under the regular income tax code, so must pay that tab instead.Tax experts often note the AMT no longer meets its original purpose and further complicates an already complex tax code.But it's been kept on the books because it raises a lot of revenue.Preserve the estate tax, but exempt almost everybody: Unlike the House GOP bill, Senate Republicans have not proposed repealing the estate tax.But they are proposing to double the exemption levels -- which are currently set at $5.49 million for individuals, and $10.98 million for married couples.Even at today's levels, only 0.2% of all estates ever end up being subject to the estate tax.FOR BUSINESSES Cut the corporate rate ... in a year: Like the House bill, the Senate bill would cut the corporate tax rate to 20% from 35% today.But the 20% rate would not take effect until 2019 under the Senate proposal.The delay would reduce the cost of the measure in the first 10 years.Make expensing rules more generous: Senate Republicans want to make it possible for businesses to immediately and fully expense new equipment, for at least five years, similar to a provision in the House bill.Lower taxes on pass-through business income: Most U.S. businesses are set up as pass-throughs, not corporations.That means their profits are passed through to the owners, shareholders and partners, who pay tax on them on their personal returns under ordinary income tax rates.The House bill simply dropped the top income tax rate on pass-through income to 25% from 39.6%, and prohibited anyone providing professional services (e.g., lawyers and accountants) from taking advantage of the lower pass-through rate.But the Senate bill would lower pass-through taxes by letting those in partnerships, S corps or sole proprietorships deduct 17.4% of their income.And it would disallow the 17.4% deduction for anyone in a service business except those whose taxable incomes don't exceed $150,000 if married ($75,000 if single).Prevent abuse of pass-through tax break: If the owner or partner in a pass-through also draws a salary from the business, that money would be subject to ordinary income tax rates.But to prevent people from recharacterizing their wage income as business profits to get the benefit of the pass-through deduction, the Senate bill would automatically limit the deduction to half of the W-2 wages of the filer.Change how U.S. multinationals are taxed: Today U.S. companies owe Uncle Sam tax on all their profits, regardless of where the income is earned.They're allowed to defer paying U.S. tax on their foreign profits until they bring the money home.Many argue that this "worldwide" tax system puts American businesses at a disadvantage.That's because most foreign competitors come from countries with territorial tax systems, meaning they don't owe tax to their own governments on income they make offshore.The Senate bill proposes changes to move the U.S. to a territorial system.It also includes a number of anti-abuse provisions to prevent corporations with foreign profits from gaming the system.And it would require companies to pay a one-time low tax rate on their existing overseas profits -- 10% on cash assets and 5% on non-cash assets (e.g., equipment abroad in which profits were invested).Those are below the 14% and 7% repatriation rates called for in the amended House bill.-- CNN's Ted Barrett, Lauren Fox, and Phil Mattingly contributed to this report.
U.S. hits 10 more Venezuelan leaders with sanctions:::::The Trump administration hit 10 more officials in crisis-ridden Venezuela with sanctions on Thursday, after recent elections there were deemed a fraud.The officials are part of President Nicolas Maduro's regime.The United States and other governments have labeled him a dictator.Under the sanctions, the officials will have their U.S. assets frozen, and Americans are barred from doing business with them."We will maintain our vigorous efforts to sanction Venezuelan government officials ... unless they break from Maduro's dictatorial regime," Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said.Mnuchin has now sanctioned more than 30 Venezuelan leaders this year, including Maduro and Vice President Tareck El Aissami.The Trump administration has also barred banks from trading or buying newly issued Venezuelan debt.The latest round of sanctions covers Ernesto Villegas, the culture minister, and Carlos Osorio, the former food minister.They were imposed after Maduro's party won regional elections in a landslide in October.Related: Venezuela: We can't pay our debts anymore The sanctions hit at a critical time for Venezuela, which is on the verge of default after it missed a major payment to bond investors this week.A default would have grim consequences for Venezuela's 30 million citizens, who are already suffering through severe shortages of basic food and medicine.Children are dying in hospitals, and people are starving.Investors would have the right to seize Venezuela's assets, such as oil, outside the country.Because the government relies almost entirely on exporting oil to make money, it could quickly run out of cash to buy food and medicine.Maduro announced last week that Venezuela plans to restructure or refinance more than $60 billion in debt.Many investors and experts took that to mean that he will stop paying bondholders and default soon.The debt crisis could move quickly in the coming days.A regulatory committee will meet in New York on Friday and could determine whether Venezuela has in fact defaulted.It's unclear whether the state-run oil company, PDVSA, made a payment due on November 2.The grace period ended this week.Related: The chaos in Venezuela could get much worse Another key date is Monday.El Aissami, the vice president, has invited investors to Venezuela to discuss future debt payments.But because he's sanctioned -- the United States accuses him of drug trafficking -- investors can't negotiate with him.Bondholders can't speak with Venezuela's finance minister, Simon Zerpa, either.He was sanctioned in July."You can't sign anything with the president, the finance minister, the vice president and essentially anyone who would be at the meeting," says Fernando Freijedo, a Latin America analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit research firm."Logistically, [the meeting] seems impossible."Although American investors are allowed to go to Venezuela for the meeting, it's unclear whether any will, given the conditions.Related: Venezuela is blaming Trump for missed debt payments Some experts say the meeting is a political maneuver: Venezuelan leaders can say they tried to negotiate with investors.Maduro has long said his country's problems are the result of an "economic war" waged by the United States."The invitation could either be a political tactic to blame bondholders or political propaganda to give the impression that they are resolving the debt problem," says Siobhan Morden, head of Latin America fixed income at Nomura.Morden wouldn't say whether Nomura holds Venezuelan debt.Another investor who requested anonymity because he holds Venezuelan debt said he has no plans to go to Caracas because El Aissami is sanctioned.Venezuelan bonds have tanked this week after Maduro called for a restructuring.The oil company PDVSA's bond maturing in 2019 tanked to 27 cents on the dollar from 48 cents last week, according to MarketAxess BondTicker.
Starbucks' Howard Schultz slams GOP tax plan as 'fool's gold':::::Many business leaders are cheering the corporate tax cuts proposed by President Trump and the GOP.And then there's Howard Schultz.The Starbucks (SBUX) executive chairman slammed the House Republican tax proposal for being too heavily skewed toward tax cuts, instead of giving the outdated system much-needed reform."This is not tax reform.This is a tax cut.This is fool's gold," Schultz said on Thursday at the New York Times DealBook Conference in Manhattan.Schultz, who stepped down as Starbucks CEO this year, said corporate America "does not need" the proposed corporate tax cut from 35% to 20%."The tax cut proposal is not going to create a more leveled playing field and a more compassionate society," he said.Of course, Schultz, a Democrat who backed Hillary Clinton in 2016, could merely be positioning himself for a long-rumored run for president.Asked about a bid for the White House, Schultz said he's "deeply concerned about the country," but "not thinking today about running for president."The Starbucks exec isn't the only one expressing skepticism about the tax plan.Barclays published a report Wednesday saying the GOP tax plan "is skewed in the direction of tax cuts over reform."Barclays noted that "tax cuts tend to produce temporary effects, rather than permanent ones."Related: These powerful business groups hate the GOP tax plan The critical comments from Schultz come just hours after Gary Cohn, President Trump's top economic adviser, talked up the tax plan's support from big business."The most excited group out there are big CEOs," Cohn told CNBC.Pushing back against claims that the tax overhaul would only help business and the wealthy, Cohn predicted companies will return to the United States and workers will get a much-needed raise."We see the whole trickle-down through the economy, and that's good for the economy," he said.The GOP tax plan has received strong support from the Business Roundtable, an influential group of CEOs that champions pro-business policy.On Tuesday, the organization released a national cable TV ad featuring an Illinois manufacturing company to press for tax reform.Related: What's in the House GOP tax bill for businesses But other powerful lobbying groups are trying to kill the GOP tax bill because it would close or limit deductions they covet.For instance, the real estate industry is warning that the housing market could be hurt by proposed limits on deductions for mortgage interest and state and local property taxes.Yet Starbucks itself would seemingly benefit from tax cuts.The coffee giant's effective tax rate last year was 33%, according to Howard Silverblatt at S&P Dow Jones Indices.Asked what Starbucks would do with savings created by the proposed tax cuts, Schultz said at the DealBook conference that the company would not just add it to its profits."We will find other ways to create a contribution back to either the communities we serve, the many initiatives we have about veterans and obviously our people for benefits," Schultz said.
Rising Obamacare costs frighten some early retirees:::::Don and Debra Clark of Springfield, Missouri, are glad they have health insurance.Don is 56 and Debra is 58.The Clarks say they know the risk of an unexpected illness or medical event is rising as they age and they must have coverage.Don is retired and Debra works part time a couple of days a week.As a result, along with about 20 million other Americans, they buy health insurance in the individual market.But the Clarks are not happy at all with what they pay for their coverage $1,400 a month for a plan with a $4,500 deductible.Nor are they looking forward to the Affordable Care Act's fifth open enrollment period, which runs from Nov. 1 through Dec. 15 in most states.Many insurers are raising premiums by double digits, in part because of the Trump administration's decision to stop payments to insurers that cover the discounts they are required to give to some low-income customers to cover out-of-pocket costs."This has become a nightmare," said Don Clark."We are now spending about 30% of our income on health insurance and health care.We did not plan for that."The Clarks' experience points to an emerging shortfall in the ACA's promise of easier access to affordable health insurance for early retirees and the self-employed.Rising premiums and deductibles, recent actions by the Trump administration and unceasing political fights over the law threaten those benefits for millions of older Americans.Related: Obama wants you to know Obamacare open enrollment has begun "These folks are rightly the most worried and confused right now," said Kevin Lucia, a health insurance specialist and research professor at Georgetown University's Health Policy Institute in Washington, D.C. "Decisions about which health plan is best for them is more complicated for 2018, and many people feel more uncertain about the future of the law itself."At highest risk are couples like the Clarks who don't qualify for federal assistance.Their income is just above the amount that would have qualified them for a subsidy, or about $65,000 for 2017.Premiums vary widely by state.Generally, a couple in their late 50s or early 60s with an annual income of $65,000 would pay from $1,200 to $3,000 a month for health insurance.In an analysis released this week based on insurers' rate submissions for 2018, the Kaiser Family Foundation found that individuals and families that don't qualify for a subsidy but are choosing plans on the federal marketplace, face premiums 17% to 35% higher next year, depending on the type of plan they choose.A similar increase would be expected for people who also buy on the marketplaces run by some states or buy directly from a broker or insurance company.The hikes come after a 22% rise in premiums, on average, in 2017.The substantial premium increases two years in a row could lead fewer people to buy coverage."I'm really worried about this," said Peter Lee, CEO of the Covered California exchange."We could see a lot fewer people who don't get subsidies enroll."California has taken steps to mitigate the impact for people who don't get subsidies but "consumers are very confused about what is happening and could just opt not to buy," he said.Related: These states are doing Obamacare open enrollment their own way The ACA has been a boon to people age 50 to 64 whether they get a subsidy or not.It barred insurers from excluding people with preexisting conditions which occur more commonly in older people.And the law restricted insurers from charging older Americans more than three times that of younger people, instead of five times more, as was common.The law also provided much better access to health insurance for early retirees and the self-employed reducing so-called "job lock" and offering coverage amid a precipitous decline in employer-sponsored retiree coverage that began in the late 1990s.Only 1 in 4 companies with 200 or more workers offered any kind of coverage to early (pre-65) retirees in 2017, compared with 66% of firms in 1988, reported the Kaiser Family Foundation.And the vast majority of small firms never did offer such coverage.Overall, before the ACA became law, 1 in 4 Americans age 55 to 64 who wanted to buy their own coverage either couldn't get it because of a preexisting condition or couldn't afford it, according to AARP."The aging but pre-Medicare population was our major reason to support the ACA then and it still is now," said David Certner, director of legislative policy at AARP."This group benefited enormously from the law, and we think society and the economy benefited, too."Just how many 55- to 64-years-olds have been liberated from job lock by the ACA has yet to be fully assessed.But recent data show that 18% of people ages 55 to 64 who were still working in 2015 got coverage through the ACA marketplaces, up from 11.6% in 2013, according to an analysis for this article by the Employee Benefit Research Institute.Related: Most Obamacare enrollees could pay less for policies next year Also, a report released in January 2017 by the outgoing Obama administration found that 1 in 5 ACA marketplace enrollees of any age was a small business owner or self-employed person.A bipartisan effort is underway in Congress to provide dedicated funds to woo enrollees to healthcare.gov and help state agencies explain changes in the law for 2018 triggered by the Trump administration.But the fate of the proposed legislation is uncertain.The Clarks said they'll look carefully at options to keep their premiums affordable in 2018.Said Don Clark, "If we get to a point where we have a $10,000 deductible and pay 40% or more of our income for health insurance, I'm not sure what we'll do.We can't afford that."Kaiser Health News, a nonprofit health newsroom whose stories appear in news outlets nationwide, is an editorially independent part of the Kaiser Family Foundation.
Saudi Arabia says corruption has claimed $100 billion over decades:::::Corrupt practices by Saudi royals and officials have cost the kingdom at least $100 billion over decades.Saudi Arabia's attorney general, Sheikh Saud Al Mojeb, gave the estimate of the losses in a statement Thursday.He also said that 208 individuals have been questioned as part of an extensive investigation.Seven of them have been released without charge."Based on our investigations over the past three years, we estimate that at least $100 billion has been misused through systematic corruption and embezzlement over several decades," the kingdom's top legal official said."The evidence for this wrongdoing is very strong, and confirms the original suspicions which led the Saudi Arabian authorities to begin the investigation in the first place."Saudi authorities arrested dozens of royals, businessmen and senior government officials on Saturday in a surprise anti-corruption sweep.Those arrested included billionaire businessman Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, the former head of the royal court Khaled Al-Tuwaijri and Saudi media mogul Waleed Al-Ibrahim.The Saudi central bank has frozen the personal accounts of people under investigation.And authorities in the United Arab Emirates have reportedly asked banks there for information about assets held by 19 Saudi royals and officials.Related: Arrested Saudi prince built empire from Riyadh to Silicon Valley It looks like the Saudi authorities may be gearing up for a lengthy probe.Some those arrested are reportedly being held in Riyadh's 5-star Ritz Carlton, which has been out of bounds to other guests since the weekend.Now it appears to be "fully booked" until February 1, 2018.Marriott (MAR), which owns the hotel, declined to comment on the situation at the Ritz citing "guest privacy.""We do not discuss the guests or groups with whom we do business or who may be visitors of the hotel," a spokesperson said.The arrests followed the establishment of a new anti-corruption committee headed by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.It has the power to investigate, arrest, issue travel bans and freeze the assets of those it finds corrupt.Saudi officials say the arrests are part of an effort to clean house in support of the crown prince's push to overhaul the country's economy and end what he once called its "addiction" to oil.Sweeping changes are already happening, including subsidy cuts, new taxes and the end of a controversial ban on women driving.Related: Women driving could rev up Saudi economy "The strengthening of [bin Salman's] position should benefit near-term reform momentum given that the crown prince has been the dominant driving force behind Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030 reform agenda," said Fitch ratings agency in a report on Thursday, but it also warned of an increased risk of a political backlash.--Tamara Qiblawi contributed to this report.
Dubai gets sucked into Saudi corruption turmoil:::::Saudi Arabia's campaign against corruption is hurting companies and markets beyond its borders.Some of the biggest names in Dubai real estate saw their shares slump this week as regional markets were hit by fallout from the Saudi anti-corruption purge at the weekend.The sell-off was triggered by concerns about the exposure of companies in Dubai to Saudi business, the risk of Saudis pulling their money out of the United Arab Emirates, and broader fears about regional stability.In a surprise move on Saturday, at least 49 Saudi princes, businessmen and officials were rounded up and accused of corruption.The list includes Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, the billionaire businessman who owns a global network of major investments.He has been charged with money laundering, bribery and extortion, a Saudi official told CNN.His company, Kingdom Holding, has not responded to requests for comment."The market is driven by the recent geopolitical tension in the region and that's causing investors to panic," said Tariq Qaqish, managing director of asset management at Menacorp in Dubai."We expect the market to continue to be volatile due to the uncertainty."The Dubai stock market -- the most active the Gulf region after Saudi Arabia -- posted losses for four straight days following news of the purge.It ended the week down 5%.Emaar, the developer behind the Burj Khalifa -- the world's tallest tower -- saw its shares fall 6% this week.And Damac, which built a Trump branded golf course in Dubai, plunged 8%.Both developers are heavily exposed to the fortunes of Dubai's real estate market, and also have several projects in Saudi Arabia.Related: Riyadh's Ritz-Carlton: Luxury hotel or detention center for Saudi royals?There are deep political and commercial ties between Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates: more than a million Saudis visit Dubai every year.They're also close allies, leading a boycott against neighboring Qatar, accusing it of funding terrorism (a charge Qatar denies), and fighting Houthi rebels in Yemen.The potential for the UAE to be drawn even deeper into the Saudi turmoil was underscored by reports that it had asked banks for information on the accounts of 19 Saudi royals and officials.According to a central bank notice widely shared on social media, UAE authorities want banks to "immediately" search and report on activity on any financial instrument held in the UAE by Alwaleed and others.CNN could not independently verify the document.The central bank did not respond to a request for comment.Saudi Arabia said Thursday that corruption had cost the kingdom $100 billion over decades.Also unnerving investors in the region is the prospect of an escalation in the proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran in Yemen.Iran-backed Houthi rebels targeted an airport in Saudi Arabia's capital with a ballistic missile earlier this week.Saudi officials said the missile was intercepted.In comments reported by the state-run Saudi Press Agency, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman told British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson that Iran's actions "may be considered an act of war against the kingdom.""I believe... [this] could be the start of more upheaval in the Gulf," said Meshal Al Faras, regional head at Janus Capital."The normal reaction is to reduce risk" by selling shares, he added.Related: Saudi Arabia tries to 'clean house' with stunning purge Saudi Arabia's anti-corruption committee is headed by the crown prince.It has the authority to investigate, arrest, issue travel bans and freeze the assets of those it finds corrupt.Prince Mohammed is also leading the country's economic overhaul to reduce its dependency on oil.Fitch rating agency on Thursday said the recent arrests could concentrate power in the hands of the crown prince, bolstering his economic and social reforms, but also raises the risk of a backlash.

Trump's $250 billion China deals: These are the companies behind them:::::The U.S. dealmaker-in-chief appeared to strike a rich vein in China.President Trump and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, on Thursday announced more than $250 billion in deals between the two countries across industries like energy, technology and aviation.But as is common for agreements unveiled on big state visits, there wasn't much in the way of detail.And a significant number of the deals were non-binding, meaning they could change or fall apart before the final version is signed.Here are some of the major ones: Related: Trump: 'I don't blame China' for taking advantage of US on trade U.S. energy China could pour more than $100 billion into U.S. energy projects in the coming years under two of the deals.One is an $84 billion plan from state-owned China Energy Investment Corp. to invest in shale gas and chemical manufacturing projects in West Virginia.That comes with a couple of caveats, though.It's spread out over 20 years and the deal is only a memorandum of understanding rather than a finalized contract.Another plan aims to invest as much as $43 billion in Alaska's energy sector.China Petroleum & Chemical Corp., better known as Sinopec (SHI), and the Alaskan government will jointly develop the state's liquified natural gas industry.Alaska says the agreement will create up to 12,000 jobs.Related: China is crushing the U.S. in renewable energy Both agreements are part of China's strategy to cut its dependency on polluting coal and pivot to relatively cleaner forms of energy.It already imports natural gas from countries including Qatar."U.S. imports could help ensure that Beijing does not become too dependent on any one (country)," said Hugo Brennan, an analyst at consultant Verisk Maplecroft.But he added the deals are structured so Beijing can "quietly back away" later on if it needs to.Commercial jets Boeing (BA) announced it's selling $37 billion worth of airliners to China.It's unclear how many of the orders are new."We're treating these numbers with caution," said Greg Waldron, Asia managing editor at research provider FlightGlobal.Related: China to overtake U.S. as largest air travel market The agreement for 300 planes is with a government holding company that buys jets for state-owned carriers such as Air China (AIRYY) and China Southern Airlines (ZNH).That makes it difficult to track which airlines are buying what, and how many of the orders might already be included in Boeing's backlog.The company didn't immediately respond to a request for more information.A similar $38 billion deal was announced in 2015 when Xi visited Boeing's largest factory in Washington state.What's certain is that China has a huge appetite for new planes.The country is set to overtake the U.S. to become the world's biggest air travel market within five years and needs the aircraft to meet that rapidly growing demand.Over the summer, European rival Airbus (EADSF) won a $22 billion deal to supply China with 140 new airplanes.U.S. chips for Chinese phones American chipmaker Qualcomm (QCOM, Tech30) inked $12 billion in non-binding deals to supply components to Chinese smartphone brands Xiaomi, Oppo and Vivo.China is already a massive market for Qualcomm, accounting for more than half its sales.The company has also run into trouble there: Chinese regulators fined it $975 million in 2015 for breaking antitrust laws.Related: How China plans to beat the U.S. at technology Qualcomm is the subject of a $130 billion takeover bid from rival Broadcom (AVGO) that could create a U.S. behemoth.Some experts have suggested that Chinese regulators could hold up the deal because of Beijing's plans to aggressively expand its own semiconductor industry.-- Jon Ostrower contributed to this report.

Americans see jobs aplenty. Good wages? Not so much.:::::If you ask most Americans, finding work isn't that difficult these days.But getting paid enough to get by still remains a problem.The percentage of residents who think jobs in their area are plentiful spiked to 50% last month, the highest reading since the Pew Research Center began asking the question 16 years ago.Those perceptions match reality.In October, the unemployment rate also reached its lowest rate since 2001, and the number of people working part-time because they can't find full-time jobs is back to its pre-recession level.However, landing a job doesn't necessarily mean paying all the bills.Nearly half (49%) of Americans still feel their wages haven't kept up with the cost of living, Pew's survey found.That percentage has declined in recent years, but still reflects lingering insecurity.Many families say they have little cushion against income shocks, like a job loss or a health scare, and retirement savings are getting thinner from generation to generation.That sentiment tracks with official statistics.Although median wages have risen faster than inflation over the past year, people in especially high-cost cities, like Denver or Seattle, or those living where there are sluggish job markets are still unable to keep up.For these folks, paychecks still haven't grown enough to make up for decades of stagnation.Despite their correlation with real-world conditions, however, the respondents' opinions may also be impacted by political factors.The eight-point jump in positivity towards the job market since February was driven mostly by Republicans.Over the course of that time, President Trump has gone from lamenting the weaknesses of the economy to trumpeting its strengths.Related: People who switch jobs get paid more Opinions are also stratified by income.Those who make more than $75,000 a year believe that jobs are plentiful by a 20-point margin over those making between $30,000 and $75,000.High-income people are also significantly more likely to think that Trump has made the economy better -- 37% of this group believe that, compared to 19% of respondents making less than $30,000.At approximately the same point in President Obama's first term, slightly more people believed his policies had made economic conditions worse 20% to Trump's 18%.But that was also in the depths of a recession, rather than during a years' long streak of job growth and stock market gains that the current White House inherited.
Notre Dame reverses decision to end birth control coverage:::::Reversing an earlier decision, the University of Notre Dame will continue providing students and employees with access to birth control free of charge.The Catholic institution was one of the first major employers to take advantage of the Trump administration's weakening of Obamacare's contraceptive mandate.Notre Dame, which had long battled the Obama administration over the provision, said in late October that it would end coverage for employees after Dec. 31 and for students after Aug. 14.The university said it objects to the mandate based on its religious beliefs.Students and employees quickly protested the decision, holding a demonstration and creating an online petition.Under Obamacare, insurance plans had to cover contraception for women without charging a co-pay.A fairly limited number of employers -- mainly churches and some other religious entities -- could get an exemption to the mandate.Some other employers, such as religious-based universities or hospitals, could seek accommodations so that they didn't have to provide coverage, but their workers could still obtain contraceptives paid for by the insurer or the employer's plan administrator.Notre Dame's students and workers received coverage this way.Related: Notre Dame will stop covering birth control for students and employees The Trump administration, however, issued new rules last month that would let a broad range of employers stop offering contraceptive coverage through their health insurance plans if they have a "sincerely held religious or moral objection."In his annual faculty address Tuesday, Notre Dame's president, the Rev.John Jenkins, said the university had decided to keep the accommodation for employees in place."As I have said from the start, the university's interest has never been in preventing access to those who make conscientious decisions to use contraceptives," he said."Our interest, rather, has been to avoid being compelled by the federal government to be the agent in their provision."A university spokesman confirmed that students would continue to have access to no-cost birth control, as well.Notre Dame's initial response was based on its belief that it could no longer utilize the accommodation because the new rule would prompt insurers to discontinue providing no-cost contraceptives.It then learned that carriers would maintain the coverage anyway.Related: Trump administration deals major blow to Obamacare birth control mandate "We have made the decision not to interfere with the provision of contraceptives administered by insurance administrators and funded independently," said Paul Browne, Notre Dame's vice president for public affairs.Graduate students cheered the reversal."We are grateful and relieved that we were able to help push the administration to respect the Notre Dame community members' right to reproductive healthcare," said the Graduate Workers Collective, an independent group of graduate students.
In a small Kentucky coal town, joblessness leads to a health crisis:::::In the small Appalachian town of Hazard, Kentucky, doctors at the local medical center have identified a high-stakes epidemic that has them scrambling in a race against time.It all began in January, when the Hazard ARH Medical Center started offering free voluntary HIV/Hepatitis C testing to anyone who came into the emergency room.The results stunned doctors: 22% of the 1,631 patients (to date) tested positive for active Hepatitis C virus.(Only two patient tested positive for HIV.)"This is an extremely high rate of Hep C infections," said Dr. Maria Braman, chief medical officer with Appalachian Regional Healthcare (ARH), the non-profit health system operating the hospital in Hazard, as well as 10 others in Kentucky and West Virginia.Located in eastern Kentucky's Perry County, Hazard has been hit by a perfect storm of events.Related: How this Kentucky coal town is trying to bring its economy back to life The collapse of the coal industry forced many of the town's residents into joblessness and also exacerbated the burgeoning opioid crisis in the region.Now the doctors at Hazard's medical center have found one more toxic side effect of the town's economic demise: A sharp increase in residents with Hepatitis C -- a virus that kills more Americans than any other infectious disease and is extremely costly to treat.'A sense of hopelessness' In the last nine years, eastern Kentucky (which includes Hazard) has lost over 11,000 coal mining jobs, according to the Kentucky Department of Energy.When the mining industry plummeted, other businesses started going along with it.High unemployment in and around Hazard has triggered a "sense of hopelessness," said Jennifer Lindon, president and CEO of Hazard Community and Technical College.That has made the ongoing opioid problem even worse."Addiction's reach here has no barriers, from grandparents to parents to their children," said Tonita Goodwin, executive director of the Hazard-Perry County Economic Development Alliance.Related: Opioid epidemic in America It's especially widespread among the growing ranks of out-of-work miners, who are often prescribed opioid medications to deal with the rigors of the job, said Braman."Miners contort their bodies, spending long periods of time in small cavernous holes.It puts them in significant pain," said Braman.Abuse of the prescription pain med OxyContin, or "hillbilly cocaine" as it's commonly known in the area, is especially prevalent."We have a generation that was lost to it," said Minor Allen, Hazard's chief of police.Now things are getting worse."Meth and cocaine have made it here," said Allen, noting that intravenous drug use has become more of an issue than pills."In the last four to five years, we're also dealing with prostitution.We didn't really see that before."Of the 251 babies born at the Hazard Medical Center so far this year, 13% were exposed to opiate drugs in the womb, said Dan Stone, Community CEO of Hazard ARH Regional Medical Center.The drugs.The prostitution.All of this means there's a higher likelihood for blood borne illnesses like Hep C, said Braman.Hepatitis C is transmitted via shared needle use, sexual contact or from an infected mother to her baby.The vast majority of people -- 75% to 85% -- who get infected later develop chronic liver infection.The virus can lay dormant for years.As a result, people often don't get tested for it.Symptoms only appear when the virus becomes active and attacks the liver.Patients experience weight loss, fatigue and a loss of appetite.It is the leading cause of cirrhosis and liver cancer and the most common reason for liver transplants in the U.S. More than 19,000 people die every year from Hep C-related liver disease, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.A Costly Cure There's no vaccine to prevent Hepatitis C, but there is a cure.It's just prohibitively expensive.Gilead Sciences (GILD)is the leading maker of key Hep C medications Sovaldi, Harvoni, Epclusa and Vosevi.But these drugs can cost $74,000 to $95,000 for a typical 12-week treatment."It's why there's tremendous effort now to help people in this area get tested and prevent more deaths," said Braman.Related: Opioid crisis fast facts Last December, Gilead gave Hazard's medical center a $385,000 grant to launch an HIV/Hep C testing program.The grant was part of the drug company's FOCUS (Frontlines of Communities in the United States) program, which gives funding to non-profit hospitals and community health centers for HIV, Hep B and Hep C testing.Most of the medical facilities that receive the grants are located in towns caught in the grip of the opioid and heroin epidemic.Kentucky, for example, has an estimated 60,000 people living with chronic Hep C, one of the highest rates in the country, according to the Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Services.Nearly one-third of Kentucky's population is enrolled in Medicaid, which will cover the pricey treatments under certain circumstances.The state's Medicaid program spent $69.8 million on Hep C medications alone last year, according to the Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Services (CHFS).To qualify for coverage, patients previously had to go through a preauthorization process, which included regular screenings for alcohol and drug use during the first six months of a patient's Hep C treatment.Doug Hogan, a spokesman for Kentucky's Cabinet for Health and Family Services said the state's Medicaid program recently eliminated the screening requirement.Still, the concern among health providers is that many of those who have Hep C won't pursue treatment.That's because many of the individuals battling Hep C are homeless.They haven't signed up for health insurance and can't afford treatment, said Francis Feltner, director of the Center of Excellence in Rural Health at the University of Kentucky's College of Medicine.Nearly 10% of the patients who are Hep C positive are incarcerated and many others aren't ready to treat their underlying drug addiction, said Diana Parker, executive director of Hazard medical center's psychiatric center.Libby Turner, nursing administrator with the Kentucky River District Health Department, reported similar struggles getting individuals diagnosed with Hep C through screening programs in its own clinics."Very few," she said, pursue treatment.Another issue is that there aren't many infectious disease specialists in the area."So people have to travel some distance to find a physician," said Turner.At Hazard's medical center, doctors have put a protocol in place for those who test positive."When patients come to us, we diagnose them, stabilize them and then try to get them to a primary care physician, specialist or a substance abuse program," said Braman.Using the Gilead grant, the hospital hired a patient navigator to assist patients through the process.The navigator has been instrumental.So far, 30% of the patients have made appointments with primary care providers, specialists, or drug abuse programs to seek treatment, Parker said.But the navigator is just a start.The real fix in tackling this epidemic is creating jobs, said Goodwin of the Economic Development Alliance."We have to bring jobs back.People here have a good work ethic.If they have a job, they will show up," she said."We just can't let the situation here get any worse.We have to fix it."
India's small businesses reel from 'terrible year' after cash ban:::::A year ago, Naraina was a bustling industrial suburb of India's capital New Delhi.Now much of it is deserted.The transformation can be traced back to Nov. 8.2016, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi stunned the country by banning 86% of the money in circulation.India's tens of millions of small firms, which analysts say account for 40% of the economy and provide 80% of its jobs, were particularly hard hit because they usually do business only in cash."It's been a terrible year," said Vinod Gupta, who owns a factory in Naraina producing plastic goods such as bottle caps and fobs for car keys."90% of our business has been wiped out."Gupta said he had to lay off more than half his workers, as have other business owners in the area, which produces everything from steel to electronics."Where there were fifteen workers before, now there are three," he added."Soon we might have to ask even them to go home."Modi's ban on 500 rupee ($7.70) and 1,000 rupee ($15.40) notes -- the two largest denominations at the time -- was followed by another huge change this year that also hurt small businesses.Related: What happened when India trashed its cash The government implemented an overhaul of India's tax system in July to replace a complex web of state tariffs with a single national tax.Small firms have struggled to adapt.India's economic growth has slumped to a three-year low of 5.7% as a result.Two million people lost their jobs in the first six months of 2017."It is clear that [the cash ban] severely damaged output and incomes over the past year," analysts at Capital Economics wrote in a research note this week.India has 100 million small firms Praveen Chakravarty, an economic commentator and analyst at the IDFC Institute in Mumbai, estimates that India has 100 million small and medium-sized firms that play a vital role in the economy.They're also vulnerable to sudden policy change."They are predominantly cash based, employ less than ten employees on average and are outside the tax net," he told CNNMoney."They are informal because they can't afford the costs of formality."Modi's predecessor Manmohan Singh, an economist and former finance minister, said on Tuesday that the cash ban and tax reform had "broken the back" of small businesses.The government says its policies will benefit India in the long run by bringing more people under the country's notoriously small tax net and promoting digital payments.Finance minister Arun Jaitley on Tuesday called the cash ban "a watershed moment" that Indians would later look back on "with a great sense of pride."Gupta, the Delhi plastics manufacturer, is not convinced."The note ban, taxation -- they must have had some strategy behind doing it, I'm not saying that they didn't," he said."But they should have shown a little leniency to small business owners like us."Related: India's economy in 'downward spiral.'What did Modi get wrong?The warehouse opposite Gupta's, meanwhile, was devoid of activity except for two carpenters contracted to build an office for the owner.Workers like them, who depend on daily wages, are now struggling to make ends meet.The duo said they used to be busy all month, but now work less than 10 days on an average."The expenses are piling up for laborers like us, while the rich aren't feeling anything," said one of them, Mohammad Sagir."There's no point of a government that lets poor workers starve to death."
How this Kentucky coal town is trying to bring its economy back to life:::::It's a bittersweet celebration.For the past 40 years, Hazard, Kentucky, has thrown its annual Black Gold Festival to commemorate its decades-long history as a coal mining town.This year's festival, held in September, featured a parade, musicians, a shooting gallery and even a display of toy coal trucks built by local elementary school students.But the festivities couldn't hide the starker reality: The area's coal mines have been shutting one-by-one for years, forcing many of the town's residents into joblessness or to look for work elsewhere.Since 2010, the number of residents in Hazard has shrunk 3.6% to roughly 5,300 in 2016.At the same time, the town has been gripped by the growing opioid crisis."One of the pastors in a church here said he kept seeing pews empty out because people stopped coming or moved away," said Tonita Goodwin, director of Hazard-Perry County Economic Development Alliance.Unemployment in Perry County, where Hazard is located, now stands at 7.3%.That's slightly improved from last year, but still nearly twice the national rate.At its peak in January 2013, the county's unemployment rate soared to 15%.Related: In a small Kentucky coal town, joblessness leads to a health crisis "While Perry County's unemployment rate [has] decreased, it is not because the employment situation improved," said Mike Clark, the associate director of the Center for Business and Economics at the University of Kentucky."While there are fewer people unemployed, there are also fewer people working.Overall, Perry County's labor force has decreased."Retraining former miners and attracting new employers are essential to revitalizing Hazard's economy -- and time is of the essence, said Jennifer Lindon, president and CEO of Hazard Community and Technical College."We're fighting the addiction battle and at the same time trying very hard to bring hope to people here and get them employed again," she said.'Sitting on a labor gold mine' Hazard's community is 90% white, with an average annual per capita income of $24,657 -- roughly half the national median.More than a quarter of Hazard's population lives in poverty.In the last presidential election, 77.2% of Perry County voted for Donald Trump, who campaigned on a promise of bringing coal jobs back, among other things.But while some coal mining still goes on here, there's little hope for its resurgence.Related: The first coal bankruptcy of the Trump era "We must diversify Hazard's economy so the whole area isn't devastated when one industry dies," said Lindon."In Appalachian communities, families resist leaving their towns, no matter how difficult things get," said Goodwin."They would much rather jobs come to them."Economic development groups in Perry County recently conducted a study and discovered that the former coal miners' skills in areas like hydraulics, mechanics and electrical engineering -- would be well-suited for other industries."Their skills can easily be transferred to aerospace and other manufacturing, for instance," said Kathy Walker, director of the HAAS eKentucky Advanced Manufacturing Institute in Paintsville, Kentucky."We're potentially sitting on a labor gold mine here."Last year, more than a third of Kentucky's total exports were aerospace products and parts, like civilian aircraft, engines and aircraft landing and braking systems.The state now has 80 aerospace facilities, employing close to 17,000 people, according to a report by the Kentucky Cabinet for Economic Development.Among the top employers in the field are Lockheed Martin (LMT), Safran Landing Systems and Meggitt Aircraft Braking Systems.Related: These high schoolers are manufacturing airplane parts In 2008, the state introduced the Kentucky Business Incentives program, which offers a tax incentive to companies that meet targets for job creation and hourly wages, said Jack Mazurak, communications director with the Kentucky Cabinet for Economic Development.Recently, metal companies in steel, brass and other finished products that require advanced manufacturing skills have started setting up shop in the state, he said."Advanced manufacturing is another big area to boost in the state and we're finding ways to retrain coal miners with tech skills, like coding, to prepare them for high-tech software development jobs," Mazurak said.In November, the institute in Paintsville, an hour away from Hazard, launched a 16-week program to retrain up to 300 displaced workers in eastern Kentucky over the next year.The course trains students for positions such as a CNC (computer numerical control) machinist and as machine building and tool maintenance technicians in the aerospace and advanced manufacturing industries.Hoping the drone industry takes flight The town of Hazard is also embarking on its own efforts to attract a new wave of employers.It is turning the site of a former surface mine into USA Drone Port -- a research and testing facility for drone companies to use.The facility, which is set to open in 12 to 18 months, is expected to be 20,000 square-feet and five stories high.There's also a plan to open an indoor drone testing facility in Hazard in a few months.To provide a local workforce for the drone port, the Hazard Community and Technical College introduced a course in unmanned technology.The course debuted in June and has already graduated 200 students in areas such as drone flight, photography and videography.Several of the students are former coal miners.That's just one of 17 programs geared toward retraining former coal workers offered at the college.Others include welding and construction.One of the most successful programs is the 12-week electrical lineman course, which has a 90% job placement rate.Starting pay for lineman jobs in Hazard range from $18 to $22 an hour.So far, 168 former miners have completed the course, said Lindon.Kentucky Power Co., based in Ashland, Kentucky, serves 168,000 customers in eastern Kentucky and employs 220 workers throughout the state.Matthew Satterwhite, the utility's president and chief operating officer, said he is keenly aware of how much unemployed talent there is in the area.His firm has provided economic development grants to both Hazard Community and Technical College and the HAAS eKentucky Advanced Manufacturing Institute to support programs that teach coal miners new skills.Kentucky Power has already hired two former coal miners as linemen so far."You may say the accent is funny.But people here can tear apart a car and put it together perfectly in 30 minutes," said Satterwhite."The biggest cash crop here is the people."
Trump administration opens door for states to impose Medicaid work requirements:::::States will soon be allowed to impose work requirements on some Medicaid recipients, a major change in how the government health insurance program operates.The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services will start approving state proposals that "promote community engagement activities," Seema Verma, the agency's head, said Tuesday.This includes requiring able-bodied enrollees to work, volunteer, go to school or enter a job training program in order to qualify for benefits."One of the things that states have told us time and time again is that they want more flexibility to engage their working-age, able-bodied citizens on Medicaid," Verma told a conference of state Medicaid directors."They want to develop programs that will help them break the chains of poverty and live up to their fullest potential.We support this."Republicans have long wanted to add work requirements to the Medicaid program, which covers nearly 75 million low-income children, adults, elderly and disabled Americans.The broadening of Medicaid to able-bodied, working age adults under Obamacare -- roughly 11 million have gained coverage under the health reform law's Medicaid expansion provision -- further spurred GOP efforts.Related: Most Republicans in the U.S. like Medicaid.Who knew?States can currently seek waivers to make some changes to the Medicaid program.However, the Obama administration did not approve any state requests to impose work mandates.That will change under the Trump administration, said Verma, who penned a letter to state officials in March encouraging them to submit waiver applications that include work requirements."Believing that community engagement requirements do not support or promote the objectives of Medicaid is a tragic example of the bigotry of low expectations consistently espoused by the prior administration," Verma said Tuesday."Those days are over."Eight states -- Arkansas, Arizona, Indiana, Kentucky, Maine, New Hampshire, Utah and Wisconsin -- have submitted waivers to CMS that include work-related provisions, according to Manatt Health, a consulting firm.Verma served as a Medicaid consultant for Indiana and Kentucky before joining the Trump administration.Related: Medicaid covers a lot more people than you might think While Republicans believe adding work requirements will help Medicaid recipients become independent, critics fear that it will strip away benefits from people in need.Having access to health care can help low-income adults get and keep jobs, said Jocelyn Guyer, managing director at Manatt.Taking away their access to coverage "is too high a price to pay," she said.Many Medicaid recipients already work.Nearly 60% of non-disabled, working-age adults have jobs, while nearly 80% live in families with at least one worker, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation analysis.
There's a loophole in GOP's plan to kill the state and local tax deduction:::::House Republicans want to kill the state and local income tax deduction.But apparently not for everyone.Their tax reform bill, being debated this week by the Ways and Means Committee, would repeal the federal tax deduction that people get for paying state and local income taxes, and it would curb how much they can deduct in property taxes.The tax break known as the SALT deduction is one of the most controversial revenue raisers because it is near and dear to taxpayers -- and lawmakers -- from highly taxed areas across the country.Today, just under 30% of filers claim the state and local tax deduction on their federal returns, according to the Government Finance Officers Association.But tax experts have spotted what appears to be a big exception to the repeal: The owners, shareholders and investors in so-called pass-through businesses would still be allowed to deduct their state and local taxes in full.The provision allows the deduction if the state and local taxes are "paid or accrued in carrying on a trade or a business ... [or on expenses related to] production of income."As for everyone else who currently takes the SALT deduction?Sorry, Charlie, no can do.Related: What's in the House Republican tax bill for businesses Pass-throughs make up the majority of U.S. businesses.They take the form of sole proprietorships, LLCs or S corps.And those with an ownership stake in them pay taxes on the entity's profits on their individual returns.So for them, under the House bill, state and local taxes could be treated as a business expense on their personal return.That would include President Trump, who typically structures his businesses as pass-throughs.But ordinary employees of such businesses would still be barred from taking the deduction against their wages.A spokesperson for the House Ways and Means Committee confirmed to CNNMoney that "all" pass-through owners and investors "will continue to be able to deduct state and local taxes incurred in the conduct of a trade or business."But the provision as written raises big questions for tax policy watchers.A key one is whether professional service firms, which are often set up as pass-throughs, would qualify for the SALT deduction.Professional services include firms providing financial services, legal services and consulting.The SALT provision in the House bill doesn't explicitly say they're not eligible and the word from Ways and Means is that "all" pass-throughs could take the deduction.But -- and this is where it gets tricky -- another provision in the House bill flatly precludes professional service pass-throughs from taking advantage of the proposed new 25% rate on pass-through profits.Related from CNN: Some Republicans say fight isn't over for popular deduction When asked about this at a House Ways and Means hearing Monday, Thomas Barthold, chief of staff at the Joint Committee on Taxation, seemed to indicate professional service providers -- such as partners in a big law firm -- likely would not be allowed to deduct their state and local taxes because all their income would be taxed as ordinary income, and would not receive the special 25% pass-through profits rate.But other experts disagreed."There's nothing in the legislation providing that.[A professional services firm] is still a trade or business that's a pass-through," said New York University Tax Law Professor David Kamin, who formerly served as a special assistant to President Obama for economic policy.When asked to settle the issue, a spokesperson for Ways and Means wasn't immediately available for comment.Kamin believes the exception to the repeal -- if that's what the tax writers truly intended -- would result "in deep unfairness and plenty of gaming."-- CNN's Ashley Killough contributed to this report
People who switch jobs get paid more:::::Jumping ship at your job pays off.Teachers, nurses, construction workers and even hotel employees who switched jobs recently saw bigger wage increases than their former colleagues who stayed put, according to new research from ADP, the payment processor.The findings come as employers are scrambling to hold onto their workers because there's an abundance of job openings.There were 6.09 million job openings in September, according to Labor Department figures released Tuesday.That's a hair under the record high of 6.14 million in July.The government began counting job openings in 2000.Such a high number of job openings are a mix of good and bad news.The good: Employers are hiring and America's job market is strong.Unemployment is at 4.1%, the lowest in 17 years.Related: Can't find good workers?Pay up!The bad: Companies either can't find enough workers at a certain wage or candidates with the right job skills.Employers often say a lack of job skills is holding back the economy, and that America as a whole needs to invest more in job training that focuses on skills that are in demand.Another school of thought argues that companies should just pay more if they can't find anyone.In fact, despite the shortage of workers, U.S. wages overall aren't going up much.Wage growth in October was a sluggish 2.4%.Wages are going up significantly for workers leaving their jobs though.In construction, builders who moved onto new sites saw wages go up 5.8% compared to a year ago.Construction workers who stayed at their current gig saw wages rise less: 4.9%.The same is true in education and health services.Those who left for other jobs got a pay raise around 6.2% at their new gig.Those who stayed saw wages go up 3.9%.Related: Job training saved her life It makes sense that there's such a disparity in wage increases between teachers and nurses who stay versus those who move to other schools or hospitals.Of the total 6.09 million job openings in September, 1.17 million -- or about 20% -- were in education and health services.In other words, schools and hospitals are having a hard time filling openings so some feel forced to pay more to attract new talent.For all U.S. workers, those who switched jobs saw wages go up 4.9% on the year while workers who stayed at their jobs got a 4.3% pay bump.ADP's figures come from the third quarter -- July to September.The trend isn't true in all industries.Manufacturing, mining and transportation firms tend to pay workers more if they stay put than if they're applying from elsewhere, according to ADP.
These state exchanges are doing Obamacare open enrollment their own way:::::The Trump administration may be downplaying the start of Obamacare open enrollment, but the states that run their own exchanges are making sure residents know to sign up.More than a dozen states have their own marketplaces, which gives them more control over advertising, outreach and even enrollment in some cases.Many are taking advantage of this power to spread the word that the Affordable Care Act remains the law of the land and federal assistance is still available.Open enrollment for 2018 began Wednesday and runs through December 15 in the more than three dozen states that use the federal exchange, healthcare.gov.In prior years, there was a bigger ad push and the enrollment period lasted at least until the end of January.The Trump administration has taken other steps that critics say undermine the health reform law.It is doing only one-tenth of the advertising for open enrollment that the Obama administration did last year.It's also cut the federal support for the non-profit agencies that help people sign up.Also, Trump has repeatedly pronounced that Obamacare is dead and has yanked the funding for a key Obamacare subsidy.All this has Obamacare advocates worried that fewer people will sign up.State-based exchanges are trying to counteract that messaging."They understand that the federal chaos will have a negative impact on enrollment," said Emily Curran, research fellow at Georgetown University's Health Policy Institute."State marketplaces are really well-positioned to step up and do more for their consumers."Related: Obama wants you to know Obamacare open enrollment has begun Covered California, which has roughly 1.3 million enrollees, plans to increase its marketing and outreach budget by $12 million this enrollment season.It is spending a total of $111 million, with more than half going towards television, radio, print, digital and other advertising -- including a spot during the World Series Game 7 in Los Angeles.Also, it has allocated $33.5 million for enrollment assistance.Exchange officials are also hitting the road to promote enrollment, traveling 1,300 miles over seven days in a bus wrapped in the Covered California logo.Local artists will paint murals to attract attention to sign up locations across the state.Enrollment in the Golden State will last until Jan. 31.The #1 goal: Encourage people to check out the exchange's website, coveredca.com, and shop."If people shop and see the price, they'll sign up," said Peter Lee, Covered California's executive director, noting that 85% of consumers who get subsidies can find plans with lower premiums for 2018.In Connecticut, exchange officials ran public service announcements on local television stations and social media in October to make sure residents understood that the Affordable Care Act still exists, financial help is still available and the uninsured will still be penalized."It's never been this confusing for consumers," said Andrea Ravitz, director of marketing and sales for Access Health CT, which extended enrollment by a week to Dec. 22.Related: 5 changes for Obamacare open enrollment for 2018 Access Health CT is making it easier for people to sign up by staffing 10 enrollment locations -- up from two last year -- as well as holding five enrollment fairs, which it is promoting heavily.The exchange also debuted a mobile-friendly website to make it easier to shop on cell phones and tablets.And it is mining the data on its 95,000 enrollees to send them tailored messages by email, text, phone and mail.For instance, residents enrolled in unsubsidized silver plans this year will receive messages asking them to update their income on their applications to see whether they now qualify for help and letting them know that bronze and gold plans may be cheaper on the exchange than off it.Also, officials are advising them that if they buy an off-exchange policy, they won't be able to receive a subsidy even if their income drops during the year.Advertising is key to getting people to sign up for Obamacare, experts said.In Kentucky, for instance, each TV ad sparked nearly 8,000 page views of kynect, the state-based exchange, over the first four enrollment periods, according to researchers from the University of North Carolina, University of Michigan and the Wesleyan Media Project.Then, Republican Governor Matt Bevin took office in December 2015 and canceled television advertising for the final four weeks of the 2016 open enrollment period.Kentucky's enrollment dropped 19% between 2015 and 2016."Reductions in public outreach efforts could have negative effects on the individual market if consumers are uncertain about the continued availability of coverage and so-called 'healthy procrastinators' fail to enroll as a result, contributing to lower enrollment and potentially a worse risk pool for insurers," the researchers wrote.Related: Most Obamacare enrollees could pay less for policies next year Conscious of the importance of outreach, the Maryland state-exchange is tripling the number of emails, texts and mailings it is sending this year.Plus, it is pushing notifications through its mobile app.The top priorities are letting consumers know that they must enroll by Dec. 15 and that most can escape the big rate increases since they qualify for financial assistance."We realize it's a shorter period so we have to get people in the door quicker," said Andrew Ratner, chief marketing officer for Maryland Health Benefit Exchange, which runs the marketplace.Sign-ups have been brisk so far, with more than 5,000 people picking plans in the first two days, nearly twice as many as last year.The Maryland Health Connection website, which usually closes at 11 p.m., had to stay open an hour later on Wednesday because 300 people were still online.Maryland currently has about 120,000 Obamacare enrollees.While a lot of consumers are confused about the status of the Affordable Care Act, the news coverage has raised awareness of open enrollment, Ratner said."In some ways, all the attention to the reduction in advertising gets the message out in a different way," he said.
Here's the other small firm that won a big power contract in Puerto Rico:::::Whitefish Energy isn't the only young company to land a multimillion dollar deal to help restore power in Puerto Rico.Cobra Acquisitions, a subsidiary of Oklahoma City-based Mammoth Energy (TUSK) that's less than a year old, won a $200 million contract last month from the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA) to help repair and reconstruct the crippled island's utility infrastructure over the next 120 days.The deal is one of two major contracts greenlighted by PREPA that have come under scrutiny on Capitol Hill since recovery efforts began on the island over a month ago.Public outrage and a series of government reviews forced Puerto Rico's state-owned utility to cancel a $300 million deal with Whitefish, a small Montana-based firm with only two employees at the time Hurricane Maria hit.That deal is currently in the process of being unwound.PREPA, the embattled state-owned utility led by executive director Ricardo Ramos, has faced scrutiny over how these fledgling companies won such lucrative deals over larger, more established utilities.Many question whether PREPA followed the appropriate steps in awarding the contracts.Related: Puerto Rico is killing its $300 million Whitefish contract.Now what?And now PREPA's deal with Cobra is raising eyebrows."Did you or anyone at FEMA approve the Whitefish contract and or the Cobra contract?"Rep. Peter DeFazio, a Democrat from Oregon, asked Brock Long, the head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, at a House hearing last week."There's not a lawyer within FEMA that would have ever approved that contract," responded Long."The bottom line is, it was not our contract.And the other thing to be clear here is we don't approve contracts."To be sure, approval by FEMA on such deals isn't mandatory.The agency only requires a detailed audit of Puerto Rico's emergency spending.Mammoth CEO Arty Straehla told analysts on an Oct. 20 conference call that FEMA was "in the room" and involved in "every step of the way" when PREPA was crafting the deal with its Cobra division.FEMA declined to address whether it participated in the discussions.Instead, a FEMA spokeswoman told CNN that Cobra's contract was "solely between PREPA and the other party."Mammoth, an oilfield services company that provides hydraulic fracturing services, is just three years old itself.It bought Cobra for $8 million earlier this year to expand into the utility infrastructure business.As of Oct. 1, Cobra had 58 fleets and roughly 275 employees.It has also been involved in repairs in Texas and Florida following hurricanes Harvey and Irma.Currently, the company has 69 workers in Puerto Rico -- with plans to bring in over 500 more in the coming days, Cobra spokesman Matt Wagner told CNN.Barges with equipment and supplies, including accommodations, are also on their way to the island, he said.Related: Devastating hurricanes dealt corporate America a major blow As part of its deal with PREPA, Straehla said Cobra agreed to provide accommodations, freshwater generation and medical facilities for its workers.PREPA agreed to pay Cobra $15 million upfront to cover the costs of mobilizing forces to the island, he said.It's unclear how PREPA could afford that upfront payment.Only a few weeks earlier, the bankrupt utility, which is $9 billion in debt, said it picked Whitefish over another contender: PowerSecure, a subsidiary of Southern Co. (SO), because it couldn't afford to pay the $25 million down payment the firm required.Ramos said Whitefish's CEO Andrew Techmanski had agreed to take care of logistics, including lodging and food for the hundreds of journey linemen needed to restore power.Straehla reassured Mammoth's investors that the terms of the deal complied with FEMA's reimbursement requirements, signaling Cobra would be paid for its work."We will be paid, we will bill twice weekly," Straehla told analysts a day after announcing the contract."Quite honestly, we wouldn't have entered this contract if we didn't think we'd get paid, and we feel very, very strongly about that."Typically, agencies like PREPA will pay a contractor first as part of a disaster relief deal.Then it would submit a request for reimbursement to FEMA, which would then audit the expense and determine if it is eligible for repayment, an agency spokesperson told CNN.It's unclear how the disaster relief agency makes its assessment.But lawmakers have raised questions about whether the Cobra and Whitefish contracts would meet the agency's requirements."As I understand these contracts, there's a big question about whether you could find them eligible for reimbursement," DeFazio said to Long at the House hearing last week.Long assured a Senate panel earlier in the week that "not one dollar has gone toward that contract from FEMA" referring to the Whitefish contract.He did not say whether any FEMA money had gone to the Cobra contract.Cobra's spokesman told CNN the company received its full $15 million upfront payment on Oct. 20 from PREPA, the day after the deal was publicly announced.A PREPA spokesman did not respond to a request for comment on FEMA's or its own involvement in the Cobra deal.To help restore power to millions on the island, PREPA has also been working with six other local companies, including Pro Energy, Electrical Mechanical Construction and Aireko Services Installation, a spokesman told CNN.The value of those contracts are unknown.Other contracts have also been awarded by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, including a six-month $240 million contract to Fluor Corp. (FLR), a $40 million deal to PowerSecure to help repair the power grid and a $35.1 million contract to Weston Solutions to provide two generators for temporary power to the city of San Juan.PREPA also plans to tap the mutual aid network, which provides help to other utilities during widespread power outages.Puerto Rico's governor Ricardo Rossello turned to governors in New York and Florida for help following the cancellation of the Whitefish deal.Related: How Whitefish landed Puerto RIco's $300 million power deal On Tuesday, PREPA's Ramos, along with the mayor of San Juan, Carmen Yulin Cruz, and Natalie Jaresko, the head of financial oversight and management board for Puerto Rico, are set to appear before a House panel to discuss the ongoing recovery efforts on the island.A focus of Tuesday's hearing will be cooperation going forward to repair the island's electrical grid.Last week, Rep. Scott Perry, a Republican from Pennsylvania, asked FEMA's Long whether the U.S. government should be "on the hook indefinitely" when it comes to repairing Puerto Rico's electrical grid, especially given decades of lapsed repair of the island's utility infrastructure."I don't think we should be on the hook," Long responded."We've been put in a terribly complex situation as a result of deferred maintenance and a system that was allowed to decay.And unfortunately, everybody wants the power back on."--CNN's Khushbu Shah contributed to this report.
Alibaba: Singles Day sales hit record $25 billion in 24 hours:::::The biggest shopping day on the planet raked in an eye-popping $25.4 billion.Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba (BABA, Tech30) said Saturday that sales soared past $18 billion after just 13 hours of the retail blitz known as Singles Day, eclipsing the $17.8 billion it managed in the full 24 hours last year.Singles Day, a bonanza of online spending in China, has for years racked up more sales than Black Friday and Cyber Monday combined.Earlier in the day, Alibaba said eager shoppers had managed to spend $1 billion in just 2 minutes.As the clock struck midnight in Shanghai, the final sales tally rang in at $25,386,927,848, marking about a 40% increase over last year's record-setting sales total.Singles Day started out as an informal holiday in China celebrating single people on a day that epitomizes not being paired off: 11/11.Alibaba turned it into a festival of discount deals in 2009.Related: Black Friday 2017: When will the stores open?Alibaba has used the now-massive event to lure international companies onto its platforms.More than 40% of the brands taking part this year came from outside China, according to research firm eMarketer Retail.And while Singles Day still mostly targets Chinese consumers, it's also increasingly spreading to other countries, experts say.Local players in Southeast Asia like Lazada (an Alibaba subsidiary), Zalora and Shopee launched their own Singles Day promotions this year, said Xiaofeng Wang, an analyst with research firm Forrester.Related: It's not just Amazon: Chinese tech giants are selling groceries too The event is also evolving beyond its original conception as an online shopping spree.Alibaba and its main Chinese rival, JD.com, have both made significant investments in brick-and-mortar businesses.And they're using the popularity of Singles Day to drive shoppers to offline stores, too.Cosmetics giant L'Oreal (LRLCF), for example, set up an interactive mirror at its Shanghai store where shoppers could try on virtual makeup using augmented reality and then order products on a touch screen linked to an Alibaba platform.But beyond the blockbuster sales, Singles Day also creates an enormous amount of waste.Greenpeace said the manufacturing, packaging and shipping linked to the event produced 258,000 tons of carbon dioxide emissions last year.It would take about 2.6 billion trees to absorb it all.The environmental activist group estimates this year's shopping blitz is on track to leave an even bigger carbon footprint."More over-consumption means more CO2 emissions and waste," said Greenpeace campaigner Nie Li.
Alan Greenspan: Big tax cuts a 'mistake.' Fix the debt first:::::Alan Greenspan has a message for President Trump and Congress: Now is not the time for big tax cuts.Greenspan, the former Federal Reserve chief and Republican economic adviser, is worried about how tax cuts will worsen America's mountain of debt."Economically, it's a mistake to deal with sharp reductions in taxes now," Greenspan told Fox Business on Thursday."We are premature on fiscal stimulus, whether it's tax cuts or expenditure increases.We've got to get the debt stabilized before we can even think of those terms," Greenspan said.That stands in stark contrast to the urgent pleas for lower taxes by Trump, who during the campaign dubbed himself the "king of debt."Trump argues the American economy "desperately" needs "massive" tax cuts.That's despite accelerating economic growth and the lowest unemployment rate in 17 years.The White House has said tax cuts are needed to keep the momentum going and improve wage growth, which remains disappointing.Related: What's in the Senate Republicans' tax bill Greenspan, who was appointed Fed chair by both Republican and Democratic presidents, argues the United States is already at "full employment."He predicted supply and demand for labor will cause wages to "accelerate" on their own.Rather than adding to the national debt, Greenspan says Congress needs to put the country on a sustainable fiscal path."What we ought to be concerned about is the fact that the federal debt is rising at a very rapid pace.There is nothing in this bill that will essentially stop that from happening," Greenspan told Fox Business.When he led the Fed, Greenspan's words were treated like gospel by economists and investors alike, and the press dubbed him the Maestro.But critics have since argued Greenspan's support for light regulation and low interest rates contributed to the 2008 financial crisis.Still, neutral observers agree that the House GOP tax bill would make the national debt worse.The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates the federal deficit would increase by $1.7 trillion over 10 years under the plan, including the impact of higher borrowing costs.Under the tax bill, the CBO expects debt held by the public would rise to 97.1% of gross domestic product by 2027, compared with 91.2% under the existing tax structure.Debt-to-GDP currently stands at about 75%.The House GOP bill would permanently cut the corporate tax rate to 20% from 35%, consolidate income tax brackets for individuals from seven to four and repeal or limit many deductions.The Senate tax bill would change the rate on taxable income for some of the seven individual tax brackets.It would also slash the corporate rate to 20%, but the cut wouldn't take effect until 2019.Related: Is now really the time for massive tax cuts?The White House argues that these changes will speed up the economy enough that they'll pay for themselves in the long run."We see the whole trickle-down through the economy, and that's good for the economy," Gary Cohn, Trump's top economic adviser, told CNBC.Greenspan generally supports the idea of a 20% corporate tax rate to make the United States more competitive with lower-tax countries."It's probably wise to bring down the corporate rate," Greenspan said."But don't look to that as a major factor in expanding the economy."--CNN's Jeanne Sahadi and Phil Mattingly contributed to this report.
Canadian marijuana investors cheer dollar-per-gram tax proposal:::::Investors are loving the Canadian government's proposal to tax legal weed at a dollar per gram.On Friday, the country's Department of Finance reiterated the government's commitment to legalizing the drug for recreational use.It also laid out a plan to levy an excise tax on cannabis products at 1 Canadian dollar per gram (USD $0.79) or 10% of the sale price, whichever is higher.The proposal sent shares of Canadian marijuana companies soaring.The government says the new tax framework will apply to medical marijuana, which is already legal in the country, and recreational products, which the administration has promised to make lawful "no later than July 2018.""The proposed level of taxation is intended to keep prices low to eliminate the black market," according to a notice from Canada's finance department.Related: New Jersey could become the next legal pot state Investors in Aurora Cannabis (ACBFF), a medical marijuana grower that trades on the Toronto Stock Exchange, saw its stock price shoot up nearly 15%.Shares of three other medicinal weed producers trading on the TSE -- MedReleaf (MEDFF), Canopy (TWMJF), Aphria (APHQF), -- each saw their shares climb 3% to 5%.An excise tax is paid in additional to general sales taxes.General sales tax rates across Canada's provinces range from 5% to 15% of the sale price.Even with the excise and sales tax, Canadians may be able to snag their weed for a lower price than some areas of the U.S. Because marijuana is still outlawed on the federal level in the United States, lawmakers on Capitol Hill have yet to tax the drug.But states that have legalized weed have slapped on some hefty taxes.Related: It pays to be a scientist in the marijuana industry In California, where recreational weed sales will be legal beginning January 1, the state is planning to pin a 15% excise tax on weed sales, and consumers will also be on the hook for sales taxes ranging from 22.25% to 24.25%.Between taxes paid by producers, retailers and customers, weed taxes may reach as high as 45% in parts of the state, according to a recent Fitch Ratings report.The tax rates could be enough to keep the black market healthy, one group of Fitch Ratings analysts suggested.In Colorado, where weed has been legal since 2014, the state charges a 2.9% sales tax plus a 15% excise tax and a special 20% sales tax for recreational marijuana.Canada's tax proposal is not set in stone.The government is giving residents until December 7, 2017 to submit feedback.The government says money collected from the marijuana excise tax will be "divided equally between the province or territory and the federal government.""Revenues raised from the taxation regime will help support investments in public education, enforcement, research and other activities integral to an effective system of legalization and regulation of cannabis," according to the Department of Finance.--CNNMoney's Aaron Smith contributed to this report.
China opens up its finance industry to the world:::::Wall Street could soon find it easier to do business in China.Beijing says it will allow foreign companies to own Chinese banks and investment firms in the latest sign the world's second-biggest economy is opening up its vast financial industry.China's vice minister for finance Zhu Guangyao revealed the changes during a press briefing Friday.A cap on foreign investment in Chinese banks will be removed.And foreign investors will be allowed to own 51% in securities firms, investment managers and life insurance providers.Zhu said the new rules would come into play "soon."He gave no further details on timing.Big Western banks are largely absent in China -- only HSBC (HSBC) has a significant presence through its 19% stake in Bank of Communications -- but they are keen to take advantage of the country's growing wealth.The restrictive ownership rules in China's sector have been a big bone of contention for U.S. firms in the recent past.As foreign banks were only allowed minority shareholdings, they had limited influence over big decisions.That's why JPMorgan (JPM) sold a minority stake in its investment banking joint venture in the country last year.But CEO Jamie Dimon has since said he would be up for a second crack at China if the bank could control its business there, and a spokesman for America's biggest bank welcomed the rule change.JPMorgan would "evaluate viable options to strengthen its position in China," the spokesperson added.A top European bank voiced similar approval."The Chinese government's decision to allow foreign companies to take up to 51% in securities joint venture represents an important step in further opening up China's financial sector," said Eugene Qian, chairman of UBS's (UBS) China Strategy Board.The news came at the end of President Trump's visit to China this week.Trump frequently points out China's huge trade surplus with the U.S., which stood at almost $350 billion last year.Making it easier for American firms to sell financial services in China could help to achieve a better trade balance.Experts said the changes had been in the works for a while.Related: These are the companies behind Trump's $250 billion in trade deals A $33 trillion market "These reforms were already in Xi Jinping's playbook," said Aidan Yao, an economist at AXA Investment Managers, referring to the Chinese president.Still, they could prove tantalizing for foreign investors.China's financial sector is the world's second-biggest, with $33 trillion in assets."China's size and growth potential are irresistible attractions," Yao added.China has good reasons for making it easier for foreign financial firms to do business.Many of the big banks and financial services companies in China are owned by the government and lend a lot of cash to inefficient state-owned enterprises.People's Bank of China governor Zhou Xiaochuan recently said that a lack of outside competition could lead to "laziness" in the financial sector.Zhou has called for the market to play a bigger role in who banks lend to.Inefficient allocation of capital has left China with huge levels corporate debt relative to the size of its economy.That's led to an increase in the number of so-called zombie companies, unproductive businesses kept alive only via a drip feed of credit.Opening up the sector to more foreign competition and expertise could force Chinese banks to become more efficient in how and where they lend money, said Larry Hu, chief China economist at Macquarie.But some China experts cautioned against getting too excited about the planned changes."The devil is in the detail," said James McGregor, former CEO of Dow Jones in China and now Greater China chairman of public relations firm APCO Worldwide.China could still fudge regulations so local companies have a competitive advantage over foreign ones, he added.Related: How China plans to beat the U.S. at technology The American Chamber of Commerce in China gave a cautious welcome.Investment restrictions "have been hindering economic activity in China for far too long," Chairman William Zarit said.China has been taking baby steps to open up its financial system in recent years, including making it easier for foreigners to invest in its stock market.-- Steven Jiang in Beijing contributed to this report.

Market stumbles over concerns about GOP tax reform:::::The Dow snapped a 5-day streak of records, as the fate of tax reform hangs in the balance.The index fell as much as 250 points Thursday, before recovering to a decline of roughly 100 points.Analysts said that investors were worried about whether the Republican legislation can pass, citing dissent on key provisions and reports that the Senate's GOP plan would delay corporate tax cuts until 2019."There's two competing bills, and one's more horrible than the next," said Michael Block, chief market strategist at Rhino Trading Partners.The markets have soared under President Trump, at least in part on hopes that his administration would pass tax reform and cut regulations."There's a certain amount of optimism baked into the market, particularly [with regard to] corporate taxes being cut," said Andres Garcia-Amaya, global market strategist at Zoe Financial, an independent wealth management firm.Related: Trump rally: 3rd best since World War II The Dow had closed higher seven days in a row and was at a record for the past five days.Luckily, Garcia-Amaya said, the health of the markets isn't solely dependent on whether or not tax reform gets done."Earnings have done really well -- not just here but globally," he said."The global economy is basically experiencing a synchronized expansion, which we haven't seen in decades."But as tax negotiations shake out, things are expected to be a bit bumpy.Corporate earnings season is coming to a close, which means the focus will shift to Washington, said Jeff Carbone, managing partner for Cornerstone Financial Partners."There will be more time to concentrate on the items of the day," he said."Certainly tax reform is the big one."-- CNNMoney's Matt Egan contributed reporting.
Roku dazzles thanks to its booming ad business:::::Most people think of Roku as a hardware company that makes streaming boxes, dongles and TVs.But it turns out that Roku's most exciting business is advertising.In its first-ever earnings report after going public in September, Roku was propelled by booming ad sales.Roku sells ads that show up on its customers' TV screens.Roku (ROKU)surged 48% on Thursday.Roku's sales from ads and licensing agreements with content providers more than doubled from last year to $57.5 million.That part of the business now makes up nearly half of Roku's total sales after accounting for just 27% of revenue last year.CEO Anthony Wood noted that the company was "becoming a large ad platform" on a call with investors Wednesday.Hardware remains important to the company -- it needs new users to bolster ad revenue.Roku reported a 48% increase in active users from last year.16.7 million people now have Roku accounts, making it the most popular streaming device in the country.Roku TVs, which are made by TCL, were the company's fastest source of those new accounts.But revenue from its hardware business slowed to less than 4%.That's because Roku slashed prices on products as a way to attract new customers and fend off streaming rivals Google Chromecast, Apple TV and Amazon Fire.It makes sense that Roku wants to expand beyond hardware sales.Ad and content agreements are a far cheaper source of revenue than making set-tops and dongles and selling them for low prices (Roku slings start at under $40 and TVs are under $140).And content providers and advertisers are more than happy to accommodate Roku's strategy shift thanks to more and more consumers cutting the cord.More than 60% of 18-to 29-year-olds say they watch TV primarily through online streaming, according to a September Pew survey."It's a great time to be in the streaming business," said Wood.
U.S. hits 10 more Venezuelan leaders with sanctions:::::The Trump administration hit 10 more officials in crisis-ridden Venezuela with sanctions on Thursday, after recent elections there were deemed a fraud.The officials are part of President Nicolas Maduro's regime.The United States and other governments have labeled him a dictator.Under the sanctions, the officials will have their U.S. assets frozen, and Americans are barred from doing business with them."We will maintain our vigorous efforts to sanction Venezuelan government officials ... unless they break from Maduro's dictatorial regime," Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said.Mnuchin has now sanctioned more than 30 Venezuelan leaders this year, including Maduro and Vice President Tareck El Aissami.The Trump administration has also barred banks from trading or buying newly issued Venezuelan debt.The latest round of sanctions covers Ernesto Villegas, the culture minister, and Carlos Osorio, the former food minister.They were imposed after Maduro's party won regional elections in a landslide in October.Related: Venezuela: We can't pay our debts anymore The sanctions hit at a critical time for Venezuela, which is on the verge of default after it missed a major payment to bond investors this week.A default would have grim consequences for Venezuela's 30 million citizens, who are already suffering through severe shortages of basic food and medicine.Children are dying in hospitals, and people are starving.Investors would have the right to seize Venezuela's assets, such as oil, outside the country.Because the government relies almost entirely on exporting oil to make money, it could quickly run out of cash to buy food and medicine.Maduro announced last week that Venezuela plans to restructure or refinance more than $60 billion in debt.Many investors and experts took that to mean that he will stop paying bondholders and default soon.The debt crisis could move quickly in the coming days.A regulatory committee will meet in New York on Friday and could determine whether Venezuela has in fact defaulted.It's unclear whether the state-run oil company, PDVSA, made a payment due on November 2.The grace period ended this week.Related: The chaos in Venezuela could get much worse Another key date is Monday.El Aissami, the vice president, has invited investors to Venezuela to discuss future debt payments.But because he's sanctioned -- the United States accuses him of drug trafficking -- investors can't negotiate with him.Bondholders can't speak with Venezuela's finance minister, Simon Zerpa, either.He was sanctioned in July."You can't sign anything with the president, the finance minister, the vice president and essentially anyone who would be at the meeting," says Fernando Freijedo, a Latin America analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit research firm."Logistically, [the meeting] seems impossible."Although American investors are allowed to go to Venezuela for the meeting, it's unclear whether any will, given the conditions.Related: Venezuela is blaming Trump for missed debt payments Some experts say the meeting is a political maneuver: Venezuelan leaders can say they tried to negotiate with investors.Maduro has long said his country's problems are the result of an "economic war" waged by the United States."The invitation could either be a political tactic to blame bondholders or political propaganda to give the impression that they are resolving the debt problem," says Siobhan Morden, head of Latin America fixed income at Nomura.Morden wouldn't say whether Nomura holds Venezuelan debt.Another investor who requested anonymity because he holds Venezuelan debt said he has no plans to go to Caracas because El Aissami is sanctioned.Venezuelan bonds have tanked this week after Maduro called for a restructuring.The oil company PDVSA's bond maturing in 2019 tanked to 27 cents on the dollar from 48 cents last week, according to MarketAxess BondTicker.
Starbucks' Howard Schultz slams GOP tax plan as 'fool's gold':::::Many business leaders are cheering the corporate tax cuts proposed by President Trump and the GOP.And then there's Howard Schultz.The Starbucks (SBUX) executive chairman slammed the House Republican tax proposal for being too heavily skewed toward tax cuts, instead of giving the outdated system much-needed reform."This is not tax reform.This is a tax cut.This is fool's gold," Schultz said on Thursday at the New York Times DealBook Conference in Manhattan.Schultz, who stepped down as Starbucks CEO this year, said corporate America "does not need" the proposed corporate tax cut from 35% to 20%."The tax cut proposal is not going to create a more leveled playing field and a more compassionate society," he said.Of course, Schultz, a Democrat who backed Hillary Clinton in 2016, could merely be positioning himself for a long-rumored run for president.Asked about a bid for the White House, Schultz said he's "deeply concerned about the country," but "not thinking today about running for president."The Starbucks exec isn't the only one expressing skepticism about the tax plan.Barclays published a report Wednesday saying the GOP tax plan "is skewed in the direction of tax cuts over reform."Barclays noted that "tax cuts tend to produce temporary effects, rather than permanent ones."Related: These powerful business groups hate the GOP tax plan The critical comments from Schultz come just hours after Gary Cohn, President Trump's top economic adviser, talked up the tax plan's support from big business."The most excited group out there are big CEOs," Cohn told CNBC.Pushing back against claims that the tax overhaul would only help business and the wealthy, Cohn predicted companies will return to the United States and workers will get a much-needed raise."We see the whole trickle-down through the economy, and that's good for the economy," he said.The GOP tax plan has received strong support from the Business Roundtable, an influential group of CEOs that champions pro-business policy.On Tuesday, the organization released a national cable TV ad featuring an Illinois manufacturing company to press for tax reform.Related: What's in the House GOP tax bill for businesses But other powerful lobbying groups are trying to kill the GOP tax bill because it would close or limit deductions they covet.For instance, the real estate industry is warning that the housing market could be hurt by proposed limits on deductions for mortgage interest and state and local property taxes.Yet Starbucks itself would seemingly benefit from tax cuts.The coffee giant's effective tax rate last year was 33%, according to Howard Silverblatt at S&P Dow Jones Indices.Asked what Starbucks would do with savings created by the proposed tax cuts, Schultz said at the DealBook conference that the company would not just add it to its profits."We will find other ways to create a contribution back to either the communities we serve, the many initiatives we have about veterans and obviously our people for benefits," Schultz said.
Dubai gets sucked into Saudi corruption turmoil:::::Saudi Arabia's campaign against corruption is hurting companies and markets beyond its borders.Some of the biggest names in Dubai real estate saw their shares slump this week as regional markets were hit by fallout from the Saudi anti-corruption purge at the weekend.The sell-off was triggered by concerns about the exposure of companies in Dubai to Saudi business, the risk of Saudis pulling their money out of the United Arab Emirates, and broader fears about regional stability.In a surprise move on Saturday, at least 49 Saudi princes, businessmen and officials were rounded up and accused of corruption.The list includes Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, the billionaire businessman who owns a global network of major investments.He has been charged with money laundering, bribery and extortion, a Saudi official told CNN.His company, Kingdom Holding, has not responded to requests for comment."The market is driven by the recent geopolitical tension in the region and that's causing investors to panic," said Tariq Qaqish, managing director of asset management at Menacorp in Dubai."We expect the market to continue to be volatile due to the uncertainty."The Dubai stock market -- the most active the Gulf region after Saudi Arabia -- posted losses for four straight days following news of the purge.It ended the week down 5%.Emaar, the developer behind the Burj Khalifa -- the world's tallest tower -- saw its shares fall 6% this week.And Damac, which built a Trump branded golf course in Dubai, plunged 8%.Both developers are heavily exposed to the fortunes of Dubai's real estate market, and also have several projects in Saudi Arabia.Related: Riyadh's Ritz-Carlton: Luxury hotel or detention center for Saudi royals?There are deep political and commercial ties between Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates: more than a million Saudis visit Dubai every year.They're also close allies, leading a boycott against neighboring Qatar, accusing it of funding terrorism (a charge Qatar denies), and fighting Houthi rebels in Yemen.The potential for the UAE to be drawn even deeper into the Saudi turmoil was underscored by reports that it had asked banks for information on the accounts of 19 Saudi royals and officials.According to a central bank notice widely shared on social media, UAE authorities want banks to "immediately" search and report on activity on any financial instrument held in the UAE by Alwaleed and others.CNN could not independently verify the document.The central bank did not respond to a request for comment.Saudi Arabia said Thursday that corruption had cost the kingdom $100 billion over decades.Also unnerving investors in the region is the prospect of an escalation in the proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran in Yemen.Iran-backed Houthi rebels targeted an airport in Saudi Arabia's capital with a ballistic missile earlier this week.Saudi officials said the missile was intercepted.In comments reported by the state-run Saudi Press Agency, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman told British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson that Iran's actions "may be considered an act of war against the kingdom.""I believe... [this] could be the start of more upheaval in the Gulf," said Meshal Al Faras, regional head at Janus Capital."The normal reaction is to reduce risk" by selling shares, he added.Related: Saudi Arabia tries to 'clean house' with stunning purge Saudi Arabia's anti-corruption committee is headed by the crown prince.It has the authority to investigate, arrest, issue travel bans and freeze the assets of those it finds corrupt.Prince Mohammed is also leading the country's economic overhaul to reduce its dependency on oil.Fitch rating agency on Thursday said the recent arrests could concentrate power in the hands of the crown prince, bolstering his economic and social reforms, but also raises the risk of a backlash.
Macy's is stuck in an epic losing streak: Sales drop for 11th quarter in a row:::::Macy's sales keep shrinking as Americans stay away from the mall.Revenue tumbled 6.1% last quarter, the 11th straight quarterly decline.It was a deeper slide than Wall Street had feared.The good news is that Macy's made more money than expected.And although Macy's already expects sales to be down this year, the outlook didn't get any worse.The mixed bag from Macy's didn't do much to help its beat-up stock.It was slightly higher before the market opened.The stock has lost half its value this year.CEO Jeff Gennette struck a hopeful tone, saying he's "pleased with the results," especially a double-digit jump in online sales.Gennette predicted "continued improvements in our trends in the fourth quarter, including a solid lift from loyalty and digital."Macy's launched its Star Rewards loyalty program during the third quarter and said customers are already "responding positively."Related: Sears and Kmart had a bleak three months Yet Macy's, like other brick-and-mortar retailers, still faces a big challenge as shoppers flock to Amazon and other online sites.Walmart (WMT), through its acquisitions of the e-commerce platform Jet.com and the online retailer Bonobos, is also making strides online.These obstacles explain why Macy's still expects full-year sales at stores it owns to drop 2.2% to 3.3%.Kohl's (KSS), another traditional retailer, is also in trouble.The chain said on Thursday that profit plunged 20% last quarter, missing the Street's targets.Sales grew unexpectedly, but Kohl's stock still got punished, dropping 9% in premarket trading.Traditional stores have cut back on pre-holiday hiring.Retail employment rose by 136,700 in October, the lowest for the month since 2011, according to the job-placement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas.
Trump's $250 billion China deals: These are the companies behind them:::::The U.S. dealmaker-in-chief appeared to strike a rich vein in China.President Trump and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, on Thursday announced more than $250 billion in deals between the two countries across industries like energy, technology and aviation.But as is common for agreements unveiled on big state visits, there wasn't much in the way of detail.And a significant number of the deals were non-binding, meaning they could change or fall apart before the final version is signed.Here are some of the major ones: Related: Trump: 'I don't blame China' for taking advantage of US on trade U.S. energy China could pour more than $100 billion into U.S. energy projects in the coming years under two of the deals.One is an $84 billion plan from state-owned China Energy Investment Corp. to invest in shale gas and chemical manufacturing projects in West Virginia.That comes with a couple of caveats, though.It's spread out over 20 years and the deal is only a memorandum of understanding rather than a finalized contract.Another plan aims to invest as much as $43 billion in Alaska's energy sector.China Petroleum & Chemical Corp., better known as Sinopec (SHI), and the Alaskan government will jointly develop the state's liquified natural gas industry.Alaska says the agreement will create up to 12,000 jobs.Related: China is crushing the U.S. in renewable energy Both agreements are part of China's strategy to cut its dependency on polluting coal and pivot to relatively cleaner forms of energy.It already imports natural gas from countries including Qatar."U.S. imports could help ensure that Beijing does not become too dependent on any one (country)," said Hugo Brennan, an analyst at consultant Verisk Maplecroft.But he added the deals are structured so Beijing can "quietly back away" later on if it needs to.Commercial jets Boeing (BA) announced it's selling $37 billion worth of airliners to China.It's unclear how many of the orders are new."We're treating these numbers with caution," said Greg Waldron, Asia managing editor at research provider FlightGlobal.Related: China to overtake U.S. as largest air travel market The agreement for 300 planes is with a government holding company that buys jets for state-owned carriers such as Air China (AIRYY) and China Southern Airlines (ZNH).That makes it difficult to track which airlines are buying what, and how many of the orders might already be included in Boeing's backlog.The company didn't immediately respond to a request for more information.A similar $38 billion deal was announced in 2015 when Xi visited Boeing's largest factory in Washington state.What's certain is that China has a huge appetite for new planes.The country is set to overtake the U.S. to become the world's biggest air travel market within five years and needs the aircraft to meet that rapidly growing demand.Over the summer, European rival Airbus (EADSF) won a $22 billion deal to supply China with 140 new airplanes.U.S. chips for Chinese phones American chipmaker Qualcomm (QCOM, Tech30) inked $12 billion in non-binding deals to supply components to Chinese smartphone brands Xiaomi, Oppo and Vivo.China is already a massive market for Qualcomm, accounting for more than half its sales.The company has also run into trouble there: Chinese regulators fined it $975 million in 2015 for breaking antitrust laws.Related: How China plans to beat the U.S. at technology Qualcomm is the subject of a $130 billion takeover bid from rival Broadcom (AVGO) that could create a U.S. behemoth.Some experts have suggested that Chinese regulators could hold up the deal because of Beijing's plans to aggressively expand its own semiconductor industry.-- Jon Ostrower contributed to this report.
Saudi Arabia says corruption has claimed $100 billion over decades:::::Corrupt practices by Saudi royals and officials have cost the kingdom at least $100 billion over decades.Saudi Arabia's attorney general, Sheikh Saud Al Mojeb, gave the estimate of the losses in a statement Thursday.He also said that 208 individuals have been questioned as part of an extensive investigation.Seven of them have been released without charge."Based on our investigations over the past three years, we estimate that at least $100 billion has been misused through systematic corruption and embezzlement over several decades," the kingdom's top legal official said."The evidence for this wrongdoing is very strong, and confirms the original suspicions which led the Saudi Arabian authorities to begin the investigation in the first place."Saudi authorities arrested dozens of royals, businessmen and senior government officials on Saturday in a surprise anti-corruption sweep.Those arrested included billionaire businessman Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, the former head of the royal court Khaled Al-Tuwaijri and Saudi media mogul Waleed Al-Ibrahim.The Saudi central bank has frozen the personal accounts of people under investigation.And authorities in the United Arab Emirates have reportedly asked banks there for information about assets held by 19 Saudi royals and officials.Related: Arrested Saudi prince built empire from Riyadh to Silicon Valley It looks like the Saudi authorities may be gearing up for a lengthy probe.Some those arrested are reportedly being held in Riyadh's 5-star Ritz Carlton, which has been out of bounds to other guests since the weekend.Now it appears to be "fully booked" until February 1, 2018.Marriott (MAR), which owns the hotel, declined to comment on the situation at the Ritz citing "guest privacy.""We do not discuss the guests or groups with whom we do business or who may be visitors of the hotel," a spokesperson said.The arrests followed the establishment of a new anti-corruption committee headed by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.It has the power to investigate, arrest, issue travel bans and freeze the assets of those it finds corrupt.Saudi officials say the arrests are part of an effort to clean house in support of the crown prince's push to overhaul the country's economy and end what he once called its "addiction" to oil.Sweeping changes are already happening, including subsidy cuts, new taxes and the end of a controversial ban on women driving.Related: Women driving could rev up Saudi economy "The strengthening of [bin Salman's] position should benefit near-term reform momentum given that the crown prince has been the dominant driving force behind Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030 reform agenda," said Fitch ratings agency in a report on Thursday, but it also warned of an increased risk of a political backlash.--Tamara Qiblawi contributed to this report.
New TripAdvisor feature aims to flag sexual assault concerns:::::TripAdvisor is making it easier for users to see if any safety concerns have been flagged about hotels they're researching.The travel site has added a new warning message for businesses where sexual assault and other significant safety incidents have been reported.It has so far put the message, which it calls a "badge," on the pages for three resorts in Mexico.The badges are meant to flag all health, safety and discrimination issues, including theft, sexual assault and rape, TripAdvisor spokesman Brian Hoyt told CNNMoney.Businesses will be "badged for a minimum period of three months, and we hope it will be a catalyst ... to change their ways," Hoyt said.The new policy was first reported by The New York Times.The three resorts flagged by TripAdvisor are the Grand Velas Riviera Maya, the Iberostar Paraiso Maya and the Iberostar Paraiso Lindo.They are some of the most popular resorts in the Playa del Carmen area of Mexico, with thousands of reviews on TripAdvisor.TripAdvisor said they are the first -- but unlikely the last -- properties to receive the new warning."There's potentially going to be more as we continue to vet properties that come up in the news," Hoyt said.The company did an inventory of reviews posted in the last year and found "thousand of issues come up about health and safety and discrimination," he said.Grand Velas Riviera Maya and Iberostar did not immediately respond to requests for comment outside of business hours.Related: Uber pledges $5 million to sexual assault prevention The new approach to warning guests about safety concerns comes after The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported last week that TripAdvisor had removed forum posts and reviews warning about rape and injuries at several resorts in Mexico.Following the report, TripAdvisor apologized to Kristie Love, a 35-year-old mother from Dallas.The Journal Sentinel reported the company had repeatedly removed a post by Love from 2010 in which she said she had been raped by a security guard at Iberostar Paraiso Maya.TripAdvisor has since republished her forum post.The company maintains that it does not take down reviews or forum posts because they mention sexual assault or rape.In 2010, however, forum posts were subjected to a family friendly policy, meant to prohibit sexually explicit language, curse words and the posting of nude photos, according to Hoyt.He said the level of moderation was a "bit of an overreach in 2010."The policy was changed a few years later to enable consumers to post about issues including sexual assault and rape, he said.Related: How companies can stop sexual harassment before it starts TripAdvisor's new badge appears as a warning in a red box at the top of the page that users see after they click to view a resort's details.It says: "TripAdvisor has been made aware of recent media reports or events concerning this property which may not be reflected in reviews found on this listing.Accordingly, you may wish to perform additional research for information about this property when making your travel plans."The message does not explicitly say a business is being flagged for sexual assault or safety incidents.That language may change in the future, but for now the badge is meant to be a warning sign to customers to encourage them to do additional research, Hoyt said.A TripAdvisor committee will be reviewing badges to determine if they need to be kept attached to a business beyond the initial three months.Related: Facebook's imperfect fight against revenge porn TripAdvisor is also rolling out a new policy on communicating with users about why reviews or forum posts are rejected.Reviews are supposed to contain first-hand accounts only, so including a medical diagnosis or relaying a story from another person would lead to the post being taken down and a user receiving a generic rejection notice citing hearsay.Now, users will be told exactly which part of their review violates guidelines."Often it's a sentence that can be edited out and that review can be posted," Hoyt said."We've personally reached out to a lot of folks brought up in the press lately.Several of them have chosen to rewrite their reviews and edit out that second-hand information."Forum posts are regulated differently from reviews in that they do allow hearsay.
Panera is buying back Au Bon Pain:::::After breaking up almost two decades ago, Panera and Au Bon Pain are getting back together.On Wednesday, Panera announced that it's repurchasing the caf chain it sold back in 1999.The terms of the agreement weren't disclosed."With the acquisition we are announcing today, we are bringing Au Bon Pain and Panera together again," Panera founder and CEO Ron Shaich said in a statement.The deal will allow the company to grow in hospitals, universities and urban centers, he added.The company also announced Wednesday that Shaich will step down as CEO on Jan. 1.He'll be replaced by Panera's current president, Blaine Hurst.Shaich will stay on as chairman and will continue to work on strategy, the company said in a statement.Panera, a fast-casual cafe and bakery, has 2,050 locations in the U.S. and Canada.Au Bon Pain has 304 locations worldwide.Over the summer, Panera was acquired by JAB, a Luxembourg-based conglomerate that owns Krispy Kreme and Peet's Coffee.That deal, worth $7.5 billion, closed in July.Related: Krispy Kreme owner buys Panera for $7.5 billion Now, JAB is building up a coffee empire.It also owns Keurig Green Mountain -- known for its K-cups -- as well as Caribou Coffee, and Einstein and Noah bagel stores.Rumors that JAB had its eye on Dunkin' Brands (DNKN) sent the company's stock up in October."How hungry is JAB?The important thing is there could be more acquisitions," said Robert Derrington, a senior analyst with Telsey Advisory Group who watches restaurants.Meanwhile, the holding company seems to be pivoting away from its luxury brands.The firm, which is Jimmy Choo's largest shareholder, approved of the label's recent sale to Michael Kors.
Burberry wants to compete with Louis Vuitton, Gucci. Investors aren't so sure:::::Burberry is hoping to reinvent itself as a super luxury brand.But investors aren't so sure.Shares in the British fashion label dropped by as much as 12% on Thursday after the company said it planned to shift upmarket and offer more "compelling" leather goods.Burberry, which is known for its trench coats and checked patterns, also said it would refurbish its shops and stop selling its products in "non-luxury" stores.The moves are designed to help the company compete against the likes of Louis Vuitton and Gucci, which have built their reputations on pricey leather handbags."By re-energizing our product and customer experience to establish our position firmly in luxury, we will play in the most rewarding, enduring segment of the market," CEO Marco Gobbetti said in a statement.But there are major concerns about how much the reinvention will cost.Burberry said the strategy shift would prevent sales from growing until 2021.Luca Solca, head luxury analyst at Exane BNP Paribas, said the "metamorphosis isn't necessarily straight forward" because Burberry doesn't have a reputation for high-end leather goods.Patient investors, however, could be rewarded if the company can elevate its brand and convince discerning shoppers to splash out on more expensive items.Louis Vuitton, for example, commands vastly higher prices for similar products.Many of the chain wallets sold by the French brand in the U.K. retail for around 1,200 ($1,575), or twice the price of a comparable Burberry product."By selling more expensive bags, [Burberry] would be able to increase margins," said Rogerio Fujimori, a luxury goods analyst at RBC Capital Markets "Everybody is trying to do the same."Related: You'll soon be able to eat breakfast at Tiffany's first-ever cafe Burberry is also in the process of changing key personnel.In October, the company announced that designer Christopher Bailey, who is credited with reviving the brand, would be leaving after 17 years.Solca said that Gobbetti needs to quickly find a worthy successor, preferably someone with a deep knowledge of handbag designs."Any news on the new creative director -- as well as more clarity on the transition period -- should be a key share price driver today and in the near future," Solca said.Burberry stock had been enjoying a very nice 2017, with shares rallying 35% before Thursday.The firm's biggest markets are the U.S. and China, followed by the U.K., Japan and Germany, according to market data provider, FactSet.
Ex-Trump adviser Carl Icahn hit with subpoena:::::Carl Icahn's firm has been subpoenaed over the billionaire's role as President Trump's special adviser on deregulation.Icahn Enterprises said in a recent filing that it's cooperating with the demand for information by the U.S. Attorney's office for the Southern District of New York.The firm is controlled by Icahn, who also serves as its chairman.Authorities want information relating to "Mr. Icahn's role as an advisor to the President," the November 3 filing said.Icahn, one of Trump's earliest and loudest backers on Wall Street, stepped down suddenly in August as Trump's special adviser on regulatory reform.Additionally, Icahn Enterprises (IEP) said authorities are looking into actions taken by both the firm and Icahn relating to the Renewable Fuels Standard -- an EPA regulation that has been hurting a small oil refinery Icahn owns."The U.S. Attorney's office has not made any claims or allegations against us or Mr. Icahn," the filing said.Icahn Enterprises further said that it maintains a "strong compliance program" and does not believe this inquiry will have a "material impact" on its business.Neither Icahn Enterprises nor the White House responded to requests for comment.In his resignation letter to Trump, Icahn announced he would "cease to act as special advisor to the president."Yet he also downplayed his job, saying: "I never had a formal position with your administration nor a policymaking role."Related: Carl Icahn steps down as adviser to Trump Icahn's firm was subpoenaed by the U.S. attorney's office that was previously run by Preet Bharara, who was publicly fired by Trump in March.CNN has reported that Trump personally interviewed a candidate to fill the position: Geoffrey Berman, an attorney at the law firm that currently employs Rudy Giuliani as a leading partner.(Bharara is now a CNN contributor).Icahn had been strongly criticized by Democrats, who said his advisory role created a conflict of interest because he took a formal government job while still running his business.In August, Senator Tammy Duckworth urged the FBI in a letter to investigate whether Icahn violated federal anti-corruption laws.She pointed to how Icahn personally benefited from his efforts to change the EPA rules.The controversy surrounds CVR Energy (CVI), an oil refiner in which Icahn holds an 82% stake.CVR has been hurt by the Renewable Fuel Standard, which requires oil refiners to either blend their oil with renewable fuels or buy credits.Icahn was a vocal opponent of those rules, telling CNN in December 2016 they are "natural stupidity" and could cost CVR $200 million in 2017.According to Reuters, CVR Energy generated an "extremely rare profit" on biofuels credits by betting against them in the months before Trump took office.Biofuel credit prices plunged after Icahn became a special adviser to Trump.They took another hit after Bloomberg News reported that Icahn and a trade group presented the White House with a deal to revamp the renewable fuel standard.Icahn has repeatedly denied conflict-of-interest accusations."Contrary to the insinuations of a handful of your Democratic critics," Icahn wrote in his resignation letter, "I never had access to nonpublic information or profited from my position, nor do I believe that my role presented conflicts of interest."Icahn told CNNMoney back in March that it's "absurd" that Democrats accused him of a conflict of interest."I think that's completely ridiculous.I don't talk to Donald that often," Icahn said.Icahn voiced strong support for Trump at a time when many on Wall Street were deeply skeptical of the businessman.Icahn was such a fan of Trump that on election night, he literally left the victory party early to buy stocks that were crashing in the overnight markets.--CNNMoney's Jackie Wattles contributed to this report.
Tinder Gold is a massive hit:::::Tinder is soaring thanks to its new premium membership plan: Tinder Gold.Match Group, which owns 45 dating platforms including Tinder, OkCupid and Match.com, reported on Tuesday that Tinder Gold subscriptions boosted sales 19% from a year ago.Tinder added a record 476,000 paying members last quarter.Now 2.5 million customers pay for Tinder.Match CEO Greg Blatt called Tinder's quarter "fantastic" in a prepared statement.Investors swiped right on the report: Shares of Match Group (MTCH) spiked 11% on Wednesday.The stock is up 75% this year.Related: Tinder swipes 'yes' to transgender users Tinder already had Tinder Plus, which costs $4.99 a month and allowed customers to increase the number of people who viewed their profiles, use unlimited likes and undo swipes.In August, Tinder debuted Tinder Gold, a $9.99 monthly subscription that lets customers see who they've matched with as soon as they open the app.Tinder Gold saves time on the app because people don't have to swipe through other profiles to find matches."Tinder Gold plays on people's impatience," says BTIG analyst Brandon Ross.Ross says Match Group has mastered how to make money off loyal Tinder users."They're proving that if you have a deeply engaged base you will eventually get them to spend money," he explained.Still, Match Group faces competition from other dating apps like Bumble, Tastebuds, Hinge and Coffee Meets Bagel and will need to show investors that it's adding new paid subscribers.But analysts are convinced Tinder has room to grow and convert more customers to its paid offerings."There's a lot of momentum that remains behind the broader Tinder story," says Piper Jaffray analyst Sam Kemp.
'Grand Theft Auto' is still a monster hit for Take-Two:::::It looks like a happy holiday for video game maker Take-Two Interactive.Shares of the company behind "Grand Theft Auto" surged 12% Wednesday after it provided a healthy outlook for the last three months of the year.The stock has soared more than 140% this year to an all-time high.Take-Two (TTWO) is benefiting from strong demand for the latest "Grand Theft Auto" game -- both online and for consoles made by Microsoft, Sony and Nintendo.Timothy O'Shea, an analyst with Jefferies, joked in a report that "this was supposed to be the slow year" for Take-Two because there's no new GTA game."Grand Theft Auto V" was released in 2013.But he said fans seem eager to buy in-game items, like cars and houses, year-round -- even if there's no new version of the game.That shows how important it is for gaming companies, much like Hollywood studios, to develop reliable franchises.To that end, Take-Two's new "NBA 2K18" basketball game is a hit as well.It's also the first Take-Two title available for Nintendo's hot Switch console, which lets you plug in to the TV at home and then take the game on the road as a mobile device.The Switch has been a big success for Nintendo and is expected to be a popular gift this holiday season.Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick said during a conference call with analysts that the company expects "continued strong demand across all platforms."Take-Two also said that its new "WWE 2K18" wrestling game will be available for the Switch.So will the "L.A. Noire" detective game.Related: Game on -- consoles are flying off the shelves again So will the wildly popular GTA franchise soon be something Switch owners can play?Zelnick was coy, but seemed to suggest that those games might be available soon for the new Nintendo console."Rockstar hasn't made any announcements yet.And of course, as you know, our labels make announcements about what's coming out.We don't intend to do that on these calls," he said.But an eventual release of GTA for the Switch seems like a safe bet.The Switch has been a huge success, helping to fuel a more than 80% surge in Nintendo's (NTDOY) stock this year.And while Take-Two rivals Electronic Arts (EA, Tech30) and Activision Blizzard (ATVI, Tech30) have recently issued more cautious outlooks for the holidays, they too have benefited from the launch of the Switch and continued demand for Microsoft's (MSFT, Tech30) Xbox and Sony's (SNE) PlayStation.Activision's stock soared 6% Wednesday after the company announced strong sales for its new "Call of Duty: WWII" game.The stock is up nearly 80% this year.Related: The Switch is powering Nintendo toward a $1 billion profit And EA's shares are up 45% this year as sales of its sports games and "Star Wars: Battlefront" series continue to impress.EA and Activision have also been producing more games for online and mobile phones, lucrative new revenue streams beyond consoles and PCs.Even Nintendo has finally joined the mobile fray with its "Super Mario Run" game.Nintendo also has plans for an "Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp" mobile game later this year and is reportedly considering a mobile phone game tied to the popular "Legend of Zelda" series.
Trump rally: 3rd best since World War II:::::It's easy to forget that the Trump rally started with palpable fear on Wall Street.Exactly one year ago, Donald Trump's shocking performance on election night sent shudders through global markets.Dow futures crashed by nearly 900 points as investors fretted about Trump's volatility and scary campaign promises on trade and immigration."It was fear and panic that night," said Wade Balliet, chief investment strategist at Bank of the West.But the market freakout vanished by morning, and stocks started the Trump era on a decidedly optimistic note."People quickly decided maybe it's not doomsday.Maybe it's an opportunity," Balliet said.It turned out to be an historic opportunity.The S&P 500 has soared 21% since the close of trading on Election Day 2016.That's the third-best performance during a president's first year since World War II, behind only President George H. W. Bush and President John F. Kennedy, according to Sam Stovall of CFRA Research.The stock market also hit a record number of records under Trump.The S&P 500's 60 all-time highs since the election is unmatched during a president's first year in office, according to CFRA.That achievement underscores the fact that Trump inherited a stock market near all-time highs and an economy that was in solid shape.It also highlights how remarkably tranquil the rally has been.Sharp drops and steep gains have been rare.Related: Trump tax cuts could create boom -- then a bust Unlike most of his predecessors, Trump frequently brags about Wall Street's post-election rise.It's a tactic that could backfire should stocks tumble, as they've been known to do at times.Trump went a step further by recently appearing to take full credit for the market's climb."The reason our stock market is so successful is because of me," he told reporters on Air Force One on Monday.Trump, who has filed for several business bankruptcies, added, "I've always been great with money, I've always been great with jobs, that's what I do."It's true that the initial party on Wall Street was driven by optimism about Trump's pro-business promises: slashing corporate taxes, ripping up regulation and ramping up infrastructure spending.But that wasn't the only driver.Stocks continued to rise, even as Trump's legislative agenda stalled, thanks to impressive corporate profits and a strengthening economy at home and abroad.In a recent survey by E*Trade, 61% of investors listed the improving U.S. economy as a factor driving the bull market in stocks.Just 32% gave credit to Trump and his administration.Some even think that if Trump lost, we could be talking about the Hillary rally right now, thanks to a goldilocks backdrop of low unemployment and even lower interest rates."Regardless of if it was Clinton or Trump, we would be looking at similar market performance this year," said Balliet.Instead of tax cuts, he said Wall Street would be focused on infrastructure spending under Clinton.Related: Janet Yellen leaving on a high note But the real question is: Where do stocks go from here?The economy and corporate profits will need to continue growing at a healthy clip to justify how pricey stocks have gotten.The S&P 500 has rarely been as expensive as it is right now, according to Goldman Sachs.JPMorgan Chase predicted this week that the S&P 500 will barely rise at all next year -- just 3.3% -- due to these lofty valuations.For now, Wall Street will obsessively focus on the fate of the GOP tax overhaul.Failure would likely disappoint investors, potentially sparking a rare selloff.If Trump succeeds in getting "massive" tax cuts, the stock market may celebrate.Of course, it's an open question whether the U.S. economy really needs huge tax cuts right now.Unemployment is sitting at just 4.1%, after all.The risk is that adding expensive medicine to an already-healthy economy overheats the stock market.Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein recently told Bloomberg News now isn't the time for fiscal stimulus, while Morgan Stanley warned that Trump tax cuts could create a "boom then bust."Omar Aguilar, Charles Schwab's chief investment officer for equities, doesn't think next year's ride will be as smooth for investors."We still believe the market can extend its rally.But we do not think it's going to be a straight line.Volatility will come back," he said.
Asia-Pacific leaders say to fight 'unfair trade' in nod to Trump:::::DANANG, Vietnam (Reuters) - Asia-Pacific leaders agreed on Saturday to address unfair trade practices and market distorting subsidies in a statement that bore the imprint of U.S. President Donald Trumps efforts to reshape the global trade landscape.The summit of Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) countries in Vietnam has put on show the contrasting vision of Trumps America First policy with the traditional consensus favoring multinational deals that China now seeks to champion.On the sidelines of the APEC summit, 11 countries kept alive a Trans Pacific trade deal whose future has been in doubt since Trump withdrew from it early this year in the name of protecting American jobs.A joint statement issued by the 21 APEC countries contrasted sharply with the groups communique from last year.We will work together to make trade more inclusive, support improved market access opportunities, and address unfair trade practices, the statement read.We urgently call for the removal of market-distorting subsidies and other types of support by governments and related entities.The comments echoed Trumps own themes in an address in the resort city of Danang.So did a mention of the importance of bilateral trade deals alongside bigger agreements and a call to improve the World Trade Organization (WTO).The 2016 statement was not critical of the WTO.Trump says that the United States has lost out because other countries do not play by the rules, using state subsidies and measures that distort trade to the extent that Asian countries have built huge trade surpluses - Chinas the biggest of all.Earlier in the week, trade and foreign ministers wrangled over the language to be used in APEC statements.Officials said the 20 other countries had been pitted against a U.S. push to change the traditional wording.Those countries still managed to ensure references to pushing for free trade and fighting protectionism - core reasons for APECs founding in 1989 - made it into the final statement.Leaders pose during the family photo session at the APEC Summit in Danang, Vietnam November 11, 2017.(Front L-R) Chile's President Michelle Bachelet, China's President Xi Jinping, Vietnam's President Tran Dai Quang, Indonesia's President Joko Widodo, Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, South Korea's President Moon Jae-in, (back L-R) Peru's President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, Philippines' President Rodrigo Duterte, Russia's President Vladimir Putin, U.S. President Donald Trump, Thailand's Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong.REUTERS/Jorge Silva TRANS PACIFIC DEAL LIVES In a boost for the principle of multilateral trade pacts, countries in the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade deal agreed on the core elements to move ahead without the United States.Their talks had looked in doubt in the face of last minute resistance from Canada, but ministers announced they were near agreement on a deal they rebaptised the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP).Slideshow (16 Images) Japanese Economy Minister Toshimitsu Motegi said he hoped that moving ahead with the deal would be a step towards bringing back the United States.Partly to counter Chinas growing dominance in Asia, Japan had been lobbying hard for the TPP pact, which aims to eliminate tariffs on industrial and farm products across the 11-nation bloc whose trade totaled $356 billion last year.Some 20 provisions of the original agreement were suspended.Those included some related to protecting labor rights and the environment, although most were related to intellectual property - one of the main sticking points after the U.S. withdrawal.Canada, which has the second-biggest economy among remaining TPP countries after Japan, had said it wanted to ensure an agreement that would protect jobs.Chinese President Xi Jinping said APEC members needed to remain true to the groups founding purposes, which included advancing trade, liberalization and strengthening the multilateral trade regime, Chinas Xinhua news agency said.He spoke in favor of an ambitious free trade area that covers the entire region.We need to take determined steps toward a Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific in line with the agreed roadmap, and herald a new round of development in the Asia-Pacific in the course of opening up, he said.
Exclusive: Rupert Murdoch twice discussed CNN with AT&T CEO - sources:::::NEW YORK (Reuters) - Rupert Murdoch telephoned AT&T Inc (T.N) Chief Executive Randall Stephenson twice in the last six months and talked about cable network CNN, sources briefed on the matter told Reuters on Friday.According to one of the sources, the 86-year-old executive chairman of Twenty-First Century Fox Inc (FOXA.O) offered to buy CNN in both conversations.Another source said Murdoch had zero interest in owning CNN.Representatives of Twenty-First Century Fox, AT&T and Time Warner, CNNs parent, declined comment.CNN has become the focal point in antitrust approval of AT&Ts $85.4 billion deal to buy Time Warner Inc (TWX.N), hatched in October 2016.U.S. Department of Justice staff have recommended that AT&T sell either its DirecTV unit or Time Warners Turner Broadcasting unit - which includes CNN - a government official told Reuters on Thursday, in order to gain antitrust approval.On Thursday Stephenson said he had no interest in selling CNN and that he was ready to defend the deal in court if necessary.According to one of the sources on Friday, Murdoch called Stephenson twice, unprompted, on May 16 and Aug. 8 and on both occasions asked if CNN was for sale.Stephenson replied both times that it was not, according to the source.TRUMP COMMENTS WEIGH The fate of CNN has broader political significance.U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly attacked the network for its coverage of his campaign and his administration, while he has publicly praised Murdochs Fox News.In the run-up to last years election he vowed that as president his Justice Department would block AT&Ts purchase of Time Warner.He has not commented on the transaction since taking office in January.Trumps comments have provoked concern that he may improperly influence the U.S. Department of Justice to block the deal.The White House has said Trump has not spoken to the attorney general about the matter.Nevertheless, a group of eight Democratic U.S. senators on Friday wrote to Makan Delrahim, head of the Justice Departments antitrust division, urging the department to oppose any attempt by the White House to interfere with antitrust law enforcement decisions, particularly for political reasons.Rupert Murdoch stands at the U.S. Open men's final in New York, September 10, 2017.REUTERS/Mike Segar Delrahim said he had not had any contact with the White House or the attorney general on the matter, speaking at an event at the USC Gould School of Law in Los Angeles later in the day.Ive got to keep my nose down and be a law enforcer and do whats good and what Ive committed to doing to the American people, said Delrahim.But he appeared to voice doubts about AT&Ts reasoning that the purchase of Time Warner would not result in a company with too much power because the combined company would have to compete with powerful new online rivals such as Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) and Facebook Inc (FB.O).Delrahim referred to a comment by former President Ronald Reagan that the nine most terrifying words in the English language are: Im from the government and Im here to help.FILE PHOTO: Rupert Murdoch, executive chairman of News Corporation, reacts during a panel discussion at the B20 meeting of company CEOs in Sydney, July 17, 2014.REUTERS/Jason Reed//File Photo Id say you should be equally terrified when someone in an incumbent company, whatever industry, comes to you and says Im here to help you against the evils of Netflix, Amazon, Google and Facebook, said Delrahim.Some of these pro-competitive comments and justifications remind me of that quote strongly.NO SENSE It would not be the first time Murdoch has attempted to take control of CNN.His Twenty-First Century Fox made an $80 billion offer for Time Warner in 2014 but abandoned the plan in the face of Time Warners resistance.At that time, Fox had planned to divest CNN - which competes with Fox News - in order to avoid antitrust issues.There is no law against a company owning two cable networks, but there is a Federal Communications Commission prohibition on owning two broadcast networks.A Fox deal with CNN could also raise antitrust concerns because of the market share that a combined company would have among cable news viewers.I have been called and asked if I would sell CNN by numerous people, Stephenson told the New York Times DealBook conference on Thursday.But he added: Selling CNN makes no sense.Fox has held talks in the last few weeks to sell most of its film and television assets to Walt Disney Co (DIS.N), CNBC reported this week, which would leave the company with its Fox News, sports programming and broadcasting stations.. Twenty-First Century Fox would sell its stake in European satellite broadcaster Sky Plc (SKYB.L) in a deal with Disney, according to CNBCs report.Fox is trying to buy the 61 percent of Sky it does not already own but the bid is strongly opposed by some lawmakers and has been subject to lengthy regulatory scrutiny.Time Warner shares closed up 4 percent at $90.60.
MLPs poised for bounce, but could be short-lived:::::NEW YORK (Reuters) - Master limited partnerships (MLPs) have been beaten down in 2017, but conditions may be turning in their favor for a short-term bounce by year-end.Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., November 9, 2017.REUTERS/Brendan McDermid An MLP is a limited partnership that is publicly traded and, as such, enjoys the benefits of paying no tax at the company level as well as the liquidity that comes with being traded on a major stock exchange.They generally deal in the production, processing, storage and transport of commodities such as oil and natural gas, which makes them sensitive to fluctuations in the price of the underlying commodity.A high dividend yield also makes them attractive in low interest rate environments.But there has been a dislocation this year, as WTI CLcv1 and Brent LCOcv1 crude oil have climbed about 20 percent since the end of August yet MLPs have yet to follow suit.If you told me what oil did, interest rates did, credit spreads, all of these things so far this year, I would say MLPs should be up 10 percent this year, said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank in Chicago.Oil prices going above $55 a barrel, interest rates remaining pretty low, U.S. oil production seems to be pretty strong - if you take those factors and triangulate then MLPs should be a lot higher.A recent Reuters poll showed oil will likely rally into 2018 with periods of volatility as an anticipated extension of OPEC-led output restrictions offsets higher U.S. production.[nL8N1N54UR] The Alerian MLP Index .AMZ is down more than 4 percent since Aug. 31 and nearly 15 percent for the year despite the climb in oil prices.That lags well behind the gain of more than 4 percent in the broad S&P 500 .SPX since Aug. 31 and 15 percent gain for the year.That decline has made MLPs cheap and coupled with their high dividend yields in a low interest rate environment, should make them attractive to investors.The average dividend yield of the Alerian index is 7.8 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data.Enbridge Energy Partners (EEP.N), and Suburban Propane Partners (SPH.N) are among the highest-yielding stocks in the index with dividend yields of over 9.5 percent.You buy things that are cheap, that have good income, you sit there and collect your dividend checks and kind of wait it out, said Stephen Massocca, senior vice president at Wedbush Securities in San Francisco.Fortunately you get these big dividends and it offsets a lot of the pain.One factor that could work against MLPs could be seasonality, as investors begin to engage in tax-loss selling by the end of the year, when investors dump underperforming stocks in order to reduce or negate capital gains taxes.The Alerian index has also become less correlated with oil prices themselves, with a 50-day correlation of negative 0.66 to U.S. crude, the biggest disconnect in four years.So as oil prices have increased, MLPs have gone in the other direction.That could indicate investors are not convinced oil prices will continue to rally.You get into these bear super cycles, these long periods where it is really hard for prices to get going because there is just too much supply everywhere and it doesnt go away, said John LaForge, Head of Real Asset Strategy at Wells Fargo Investment Institute in Sarasota, Florida.If oil prices are not going to be headed above $60 and staying above $60, the growth profile for more and more projects just isnt there and Im not going to bid up an MLP.( This version of the story corrects paragraph 10 to change average dividend yield of the Alerian index to 7.8 percent from 7.9, and EEP and SPH dividend yields to over 9.5 percent from 16.08 percent and 14.47 percent, and to say they are among the highest yielding, not the highest yielding)
Emirates may order 36-38 Airbus A380 jets: source:::::DUBAI (Reuters) - Dubais Emirates [EMIRA.UL] may place an order at the Dubai Airshow for 36-38 Airbus A380 superjumbo jets, worth some $16 billion at list prices, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters on Saturday.FILE PHOTO: An Airbus A380 is taking part in a flying display during the 52nd Paris Air Show at Le Bourget Airport near Paris, France June 23, 2017.REUTERS/Pascal Rossignol Emirates and Airbus (AIR.PA) both declined to comment.The order is expected to be one of the highlights of the Nov. 12-16 event at which Gulf carriers - minus Qatar Airways which is absent due to a rift between Arab nations - are expected to put a brave face on fragile business confidence in the region.It comes as Airbus and Boeing chase deals to prop up recently softening demand for wide-body passenger jets.Emirates is by far the largest buyer of the worlds largest passenger jet, the A380, with 142 on order and 100 already delivered.The 544-seat jet entered service amid huge fanfare in 2007, but its future has been thrown into doubt by sluggish sales as airlines turn to efficient smaller jets like the Boeing 777, of which Emirates is also the largest buyer.An A380 sale would bring respite to Airbus which has fallen well behind rival Boeing this year, with 35 percent of their combined new orders.Aerospace manufacturers were pitching for other deals on the eve of the show, one of the largest business gatherings in the Middle East.Boeing (BA.N) sought earlier to dispel concerns about a slowdown in the growth of Gulf airlines as the aerospace industry gathered on Saturday for the Dubai Airshow.
GE cutting staff ahead of new CEO's Monday overhaul: sources:::::NEW YORK (Reuters) - General Electric Co (GE.N) is laying off sales staff and other employees in its software division, according to people familiar with the matter, ahead of new Chief Executive John Flannerys expected announcement on Monday of a plan to slash costs and jettison units in an effort to improve the companys profits.FILE PHOTO: The ticker and logo for General Electric Co. is displayed on a screen at the post where it's traded on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York City, U.S., June 30, 2016.REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo The layoffs at GE Digital, based in San Ramon, California, affect about 100 sales people in the Americas, including those who sell GEs Predix industrial-internet software, according to two sources.The software, central to GEs strategy under former Chief Executive Jeff Immelt, has been beset with technical problems, prompting GE to shift strategy.The 125-year-old conglomerate is considering job reductions across all of its diverse businesses, the sources said.Struggling units such as GE Power are facing significant staff cuts, while aviation and healthcare businesses could see lesser reductions, the sources said.Reuters reported in August that Flannery intended to reduce corporate staff at its Boston headquarters significantly, a process that has begun, according to sources.The company has also slowed construction of its headquarters.It is not clear how many more jobs Flannery now plans to cut, or how quickly.With 295,000 employees, even a 10 percent overall reduction would eliminate nearly 30,000 jobs.At the digital business, which has about 13,000 people including legacy information technology staff, GE is not only cutting sales staff.It is also reducing the number of developers who create the software, according to the two sources, speaking on condition of anonymity.Digital sales staff were given notice in recent days and told they could apply for about 19 remaining jobs in the division or other jobs at GE, the sources said.GE declined to comment on specific staff reductions, but highlighted its plan to cut $3 billion in costs by the end of 2018.Those actions include but are not limited to, employee reductions which have been well underway for many months, spokeswoman Jennifer Erickson said.GE shares closed up 2.5 percent at $20.49.DIVIDEND CUT COMING?Analysts have slashed estimates for GEs 2018 earnings and expect a major restructuring plan on Monday as GE tries to pull out of a 16-year stock slump.GE is likely to get much smaller and more focused, Jeff Sprague, an analyst at Vertical Research Partners, wrote on Friday.It is also conceivable that looking out a few years, GE ceases to exist as we know it, he said, referring to a potential break-up.Staffing has to go down meaningfully, said a large Boston-based fund manager who invests in GE.The company spent billions on restructuring the last few years but without growth in operating profit, he added.Since becoming CEO on Aug. 1, Flannery has doubled the amount of cost cutting targeted for next year to $2 billion, and is cutting $1 billion this year.He said he has found more than $20 billion in GE assets to sell and is looking at further changes to the portfolio beyond that.A 30-year GE veteran, Flannery is due to present the strategic changes and new financial targets at an investor meeting in New York on Monday.The plans also could include cutting GEs dividend for only the third time in GEs history.The other two were during the Great Depression and the financial crisis.Flannery has come under increasing pressure to boost GEs profit and share price after the company badly missed earnings expectations for the third quarter and lowered its financial outlook last month.GE stock has fallen more than 36 percent this year, making it the worst performer in the Dow Jones Industrial Average and posing the risk that the only remaining original company in the widely watched stock index could be kicked out.Activist investor Ed Garden, a founding partner at Trian Fund Management, recently joined GEs board.Trian invested $2.5 billion in GE in 2015 and pressed the company to cut costs and focus on sectors where it is a market leader, such as power plants, jet engines and medical devices.Trian declined to comment.GE is considering divestment of its aircraft leasing, transportation and healthcare information technology businesses.The job reduction efforts in GEs units appear to be independent of those divestitures, the sources said.Flannery already has grounded GEs corporate jets, cut car bonuses for executives and dismissed two vice chairmen to save money.In another sign of austerity, he shrunk the size of GEs annual leadership retreat in January and moved it from ritzy Boca Raton, Florida, to Boston.(For a graphic on 'GE's sagging fortunes create pressure for turnaround' click tmsnrt.rs/1U5M2dd)
U.S. toymaker Hasbro makes new approach to buy Mattel: source:::::(Reuters) - Hasbro Inc (HAS.O) has made an approach to acquire rival Mattel Inc (MAT.O), a source familiar with the matter said on Friday, the latest attempt to combine the two biggest U.S. toymakers in more than two decades.FILE PHOTO: Mattel's Wonder Woman doll is seen at the 114th North American International Toy Fair in New York City, U.S. on February 21, 2017.REUTERS/Stephanie Keith/File Photo A deal would create a toy powerhouse, uniting Hasbros My Little Pony, Monopoly and Nerf brands with Mattels Barbie dolls and Hot Wheels toys.A combined company would have more pricing power to negotiate with entertainment studios over TV and movie franchises.Mattels stance toward Hasbro in this overture is not clear, and it remains far from certain that a deal will materialize, the source said, asking not to be identified because the matter is confidential.Hasbro and Mattel declined to comment.The Wall Street Journal first reported Hasbros latest approach to Mattel.Shares of Mattel jumped about 24 percent in after-hours trading.Hasbro shares rose about 3.3 percent.Hasbro has a market value of about $11 billion after a near 18 percent increase in its stock price so far in 2017.Mattels shares have slumped 47 percent this year, valuing the company at $4.8 billion and making it more vulnerable as a takeover target.The September bankruptcy of Toys R Us, the biggest U.S. toy retailer, highlighted the struggles facing the sector, including online competition and childrens shifting preference for electronics over traditional toys.Some of Mattel's Star Wars merchandise is seen at the 114th North American International Toy Fair in New York City, U.S., February 21, 2017.REUTERS/Stephanie Keith Mattel has pointed to that bankruptcy as a reason for weak sales.Two weeks ago, Mattel suspended its dividend and Chief Executive Margo Georgiadis, who took the job in January, warned the company would miss its full-year revenue forecast.Mattels stock fell to its lowest level since 2009 that day.FILE PHOTO: The Mattel company logo is seen at the 114th North American International Toy Fair in New York City, U.S., February 21, 2017.REUTERS/Stephanie Keith/File Photo Both companies would benefit from a merger, but Mattel stockholders might oppose a deal that values the company on its depressed stock price, said Erik Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigans Ross School of Business.Hasbro and Mattel have had talks several times over the years, including in 1996 and again sometime in late 2015.Hasbro, which is trying to diversify its revenue stream, also sought to buy U.S. movie studio and entertainment company Lions Gate Entertainment Corp (LGFa.N) this year, but those talks ended without a deal, Reuters reported in August.That deal would have given Hasbro a direct pipeline into Hollywood, with more movies and TV shows tied to its toy brands.In 2014, Hasbro held merger discussions with DreamWorks Animation SKG Inc, the studio behind Shrek, but DreamWorks was subsequently bought by Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O).
Bitcoin slides by over $1,000 in less than 48 hours:::::LONDON (Reuters) - Bitcoin dropped below $7,000 on Friday to trade more than $1,000 down from an all-time high hit on Wednesday, as some traders dumped it for a clone called Bitcoin Cash, sending its value up around a third.A bitcoin (virtual currency) coin placed on Dollar banknotes is seen in this illustration picture, November 6, 2017.REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration Bitcoin has been on a tear in recent months, with a vertiginous sevenfold increase in value since the start of the year that has led to many warnings the bitcoin market - now worth well over $100 billion - has become a bubble that is about to burst.It reached a record high of $7,888 around 1800 GMT on Wednesday after a software upgrade planned for next week that could have split the cryptocurrency in a so-called fork was suspended.But it has quickly retreated from that peak, falling to as low as $6,718 around 1330 GMT on Friday.It later recovered a touch to trade around $6,880 by 1645 GMT, but that was still down almost 4 percent on the day.Bitcoin is all ups and downs, said Thomas Bertani, chief executive of Eidoo, a cryptocurrency wallet provider that recently became the first startup in the space to take out a full-page advert in the Wall Street Journal newspaper.The market realized that the price rise was an over-reaching, so people started selling... (and) there are many long and short positions that amplify price movements.As bitcoin tumbled, Bitcoin Cash, which was generated from another software split on Aug.1, surged, trading up as much as 35 percent on the day to around $850, according to industry website Coinmarketcap.Bitcoin Cashs transactions are processed in so-called blocks that are larger in capacity than bitcoins, so can therefore in theory allow for more transactions to be processed at any given time, making transaction fees much cheaper.The fork that had been planned for next week, known as SegWit2x, had also intended to increase the capacity of the blocks, and could thus have reduced fees for bitcoin transactions.Any investors, therefore, that see bitcoin more as a currency than a store of value might be choosing to buy into Bitcoin Cash now that Segwit2x had been scrapped, Bertani said.People who had been supporting Segwit2x could as an alternative move to Bitcoin Cash, he said.There are good reasons to believe that Bitcoin Cash could be an alternative for people who believe that low fees on bitcoin transactions are needed today.
Blooming U.S. business interest in Cuba wilts under Trump:::::HAVANA (Reuters) - Packed into a remote corner of a pavilion, just 13 U.S. companies took stands at Cubas sprawling trade fair this year, in a sign of how firms interest in doing business on the island has dwindled in the first year of Donald Trumps presidency.Last year, amid enthusiasm following a detente in relations agreed between former President Barack Obama and Cuban leader Raul Castro in 2014, 33 U.S. companies took stands at the fair, the premier event on Cubas business calendar.The mood was very different at this years edition, which took place last week in Havana.While China brought a record company delegation, and more than 150 Spanish businesses packed into five pavilions, the handful of U.S. businessmen were downbeat.Ive never seen it this deserted, said Jay Brickman, vice president of Florida-based shipping company Crowley Maritime Corp, who has been attending the fair for 15 years.People have really gotten discouraged, and feel they maybe should be investing their time someplace else.U.S. companies embraced Cuba in the wake of the detente, jostling for a foothold in an opening market of 11 million consumers.Thanks to travel-related exemptions to the embargo, U.S. airlines restored regular flights.Starwood Hotels, a subsidiary of Marriott International Inc (MAR.O), took over management of a Cuban hotel and cruise operators like Florida-based Carnival Cruise Line (CCL.N) included Cuba in their itineraries.But worsening U.S. relations as well as growing awareness of the difficulty of doing business in Cuba put a dampener on that.Trump in June ordered tighter trade and travel restrictions including a ban on business with the military, which controls vast swathes of the economy.The regulations were unveiled on Wednesday.This is a huge step backwards, said former U.S. Secretary of Commerce Carlos Gutierrez, the Cuban-born head of the U.S.-Cuba Business Council.We had made so much progress.An unfolding diplomatic crisis over allegations of attacks on U.S. diplomats in Havana is adding to the gloom.Cuba Trade magazine, based in Miami, last month cut its issuance from monthly to bi-monthly, citing the deteriorating business environment under Trump.Several Cuba business conferences in the United States have also been canceled since June, including an agriculture conference in Chicago.Following the Obama detente, U.S. farmers hoped for legislation allowing them to access credit for exports to Cuba.But Trump has made it clear he is not about to ease, let alone lift, the embargo.We need to get the diplomatic issue off the table first, said Louisiana Agriculture Commissioner Mike Strain, adding U.S. food exports to Cuba could total $1 billion if relations were normalized.HARDER Even before Trump took office, some of the interest fizzled as companies realized doing business in Cuba was hard with its red tape, shortage of hard currency, poor telecommunications and labor restrictions.A view of the pavilion stalls run by Cuban companies at Cuba's annual trade fair in Havana, Cuba, November 1, 2017.Picture taken on November 1, 2017.REUTERS/Alexandre Meneghini Online payments company PayPal Holdings Inc (PYPL.O) sent its chief executive in Obamas delegation on his historic visit to Cuba in March 2016.It had been interested in making its Xoom money transfer service available in Cuba but said operational challenges were too great.When we are able to deliver the speed, convenience and security our customers have come to expect from Xoom, we will launch in Cuba, a PayPal spokeswoman told Reuters.Still, some companies made headway.After receiving all the necessary licenses under Obama, the Puerto Rican dealer for U.S. heavy equipment maker Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N) last week agreed to open a distribution center in Cubas Mariel special development zone.Future deals with Mariel, which boasts tax and customs breaks, will not be possible, as it features on a list published Wednesday of 180 government entities that Americans are now banned from doing business with.The Mariel restriction particularly sticks out because it is the most dynamic and exciting opportunity in Cuba, said James Williams, president of lobby group Engage Cuba.Slideshow (12 Images) The diplomatic crisis has also complicated the logistics for U.S. businesses.The Trump administration in September expelled 15 Cuban diplomats, including all those dealing with U.S. businesses.The following week, the chair of the port of Cleveland, Darrell McNair, traveled to Havana to sign an agreement with Cubas port authority.He said the now-disbanded embassy commercial team had been instrumental in arranging his visit.Cutbacks obviously are going to slow things down, he said.LONG-TERM PLAY The tougher environment under Trump has separated the wheat from the chaff, some business consultants say.The serious players who understand the risks are staying the course, said Pedro Freyre, who heads the international practice at Miami-based law firm Akerman LLP.Jeff Nelson said his firm Strategic Staffing Solutions, which provides companies with IT and other services, was prepared to put in the time laying the groundwork for business with Cuba given the potential of its educated workforce.Doing business in Cuba is a very long-term proposition, said Nelson, who has visited eight times in two years.Some companies were pursuing deals behind closed doors so as to not lose capital with the Trump administration, consultants said.Many Obama-era exemptions to the embargo remain in place.The publication of the new regulations at least provided clarity about what was allowed.Companies know where they stand now and there are definitely opportunities still, said Gutierrez.Every day that goes by is just the missed opportunity where someone else is building a brand, someone else is building awareness among Cubans.
China widens foreign access to its giant financial sector:::::BEIJING (Reuters) - China will raise foreign ownership limits in financial firms in a step granting access to a tantalizing multi-trillion dollar financial services market, as the worlds second-biggest economy seeks to position itself as a major global finance hub.A Chinese national flag is seen among buildings at the Yujiapu financial centre, in Tianjin, China February 22, 2016.REUTERS/Jason Lee The move, announced on Friday by vice finance minister Zhu Guangyao, comes a day after U.S. President Donald Trump reiterated calls for better access to Chinese markets in meetings with Chinese President Xi Jinping.Xi is driving broad economic reforms by opening up Chinas capital markets, internationalizing the yuan currency, and seeking technical know-how through the pursuit of massive inbound and outbound investments.The latest changes include raising the limit on foreign ownership in joint-venture firms involved in the futures, securities and funds markets to 51 percent from the current 49 percent.They will take effect immediately following the drafting of specific related rules, Zhu told a news conference, adding China is formulating a timetable and roadmap for financial sector reform and opening up.The foreign business community gave a cautious welcome to the news.Financial services further opening definitely has been high on our list, said Ken Jarrett, President of American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai.Its a step in the right direction.Well have to see the detailed rules.In China you always have to pay attention to the fine print to see how quickly it moves, but to finally ease up on the cap is something that is welcome.The plan to ease ownership restrictions comes as Beijing faces mounting pressure from Western governments and business lobbies to remove investment barriers and onerous regulations that restrict overseas companies operations in its markets.During his trip to Beijing this week, Trump said that trade between the two nations was unfair, and called for greater market access for U.S. companies.We really have to look at access, forced technology transfer, and the theft of intellectual property, which just, by and of itself, is costing the United States and its companies at least $300 billion a year, Trump said.Both the United States and China will have a more prosperous future if we can achieve a level economic playing field.Right now, unfortunately, it is a very one-sided and unfair one.CHANNELING FOREIGN MONEY Reuters reported on Tuesday that China planned to allow global banks to take a stake of up to 51 percent in their onshore securities ventures for the first time and tie up with local non-financial firms.China has been sluggish to give foreign players more access to its financial sector, but has promised to quicken the pace as foreign investment into Asias economic powerhouse slows.It has implemented strict capital controls to contain capital outflows, while opening up new channels for foreign money to come into the domestic markets.China's Vice Finance Minister Zhu Guangyao, attends a conference during the 2016 IIF G20

market is a big lure for overseas players.Western investment banks operating through joint ventures with local partners in China have struggled to make much headway in the last decade, with many of them loss-making as they struggle to win business against much larger local rivals.A Reuters survey of data from Chinas Securities Association in 2014 found that the average sino-foreign JV lost 21 million yuan a year over the prior 10 years.However, several have said they would be keen to invest more in China and do more broking and investment banking if they had full control over their joint ventures.UBS (UBSG.S), which holds a 25 percent interest in domestic firm UBS Securities Co Ltd, said the changes on Friday were an important step in further opening up Chinas financial sector.China

late.This looks good, but in reality it is pretty small and it is too late, said Keith Pogson, head of the Asia financial services team at EY.If you are an international investment bank, you will be there for the sake of your global franchise and having it as part of your network, not because you think you will make much money in China.All the same, markets reacted positively to the news, with insurers and futures-related firms rallying strongly.New China Life Insurance (601336.SS) jumped nearly 6 percent after the announcement, while Ping An Insurance (2318.HK) (601318.SS) advanced more than 4 percent and China Pacific Insurance Group (601601.SS) rose over 3 percent.China will drop foreign ownership restrictions on local banks and asset management companies, Zhu said.Full foreign ownership of local firms involved in the futures, securities and funds markets will not be permitted until after three years, while full overseas ownership of insurance firms will be allowed only after five years.($1 = 6.6388 Chinese yuan renminbi)
Uber loses UK appeal bid to overturn workers' rights decision:::::LONDON (Reuters) - Taxi app Uber [UBER.UL] lost a bid on Friday to overturn a decision by a tribunal which had said its drivers deserved workers rights such as the minimum wage, in a blow to the company as it also battles to keep its license in London.Uber immediately said it would appeal to higher courts against Fridays decision by the Employment Appeal Tribunal (EAT) in central London.The U.S. ride-hailing service has faced regulatory and legal setbacks around the world amid opposition from traditional taxi services and concern among some regulators.It has been forced to quit several countries, such as Denmark and Hungary.Last year, two drivers successfully argued at a British employment tribunal that Uber exerted significant control over them to provide an on-demand taxi service and should grant them workers rights such as holiday entitlement and rest breaks.That decision did not automatically apply to the apps 50,000 drivers in Britain but was seen as likely to prompt more claims.It could benefit workers at thousands of companies including firms in the gig economy, where individuals work for multiple employers without a fixed contract, such as courier Deliveroo.The Independent Workers Union of Great Britain, which backed the two drivers, said these companies were choosing to deprive workers of their rights.Todays victory is further proof, as if any more was needed, that the law is clear and these companies are simply choosing to deprive workers of their rights, said Jason Moyer-Lee, the IWGBs general secretary.A photo illustration shows the Uber app on a mobile telephone, as it is held up for a posed photograph, with London Taxis in the background, in London, Britain November 10, 2017.REUTERS/Simon Dawson Uber says its drivers enjoy the flexibility of their work and are self-employed, entitling them in British law to only basic entitlements such as health and safety.The firm argued in September that its drivers operate in the same way as minicabs, or private hire vehicles, which sprung up in Britain more than 50 years ago.Slideshow (3 Images) On Friday it confirmed it would appeal against the latest decision.A spokesman said the company had 14 days to submit its application and decide whether to apply to take the case to the Supreme Court, Britains top judicial body.Over the last year we have made a number of changes to our app to give drivers even more control, said Uber UKs Acting General Manager Tom Elvidge in a statement.The main reason why drivers use Uber is because they value the freedom to choose if, when and where they drive.Yaseen Aslam, one of the drivers involved in the case, said they would continue their fight to ensure workers rights were respected.I am glad that the judge today confirmed what I and thousands of drivers have known all along: that Uber is not only exploiting drivers, but also acting unlawfully, he said.Uber, which is valued at around $70 billion with backers including Goldman Sachs and BlackRock, will be back in court on Dec. 11 to appeal a decision by Londons transport regulator to strip the app of its license.Transport for London shocked Uber in September by deeming it unfit to run a taxi service and refusing to renew its license, citing the firms approach to reporting serious criminal offences and background checks on drivers.
What to expect from the Dubai Air Show:::::Leaders of the global aerospace industry are gathering for the Dubai Air Show.The show kicks off Sunday in a region where geopolitical uncertainty has cast a shadow, and where aviation is the backbone of its economic future.But less business is expected to be conducted than in previous years.That's because the trio of super-carriers that dominate the region -- Emirates airline, Qatar Airways and Etihad Airways -- have run into struggles after years of rapid growth that could affect purchasing decisions.Qatar Airways, which has more pending orders for Airbus A350s than any other airline, won't be making the trip at all because the U.A.E.cut diplomatic and transport links with Qatar.Emirates, which took its 100th double-deck Airbus A380 airliner last week, is expected by some to purchase dozens more jumbo jets.But after slashing 3,000 positions to help its first half profits, there's no certainty.Plus, the ability to order jetliners is significantly different from a carrier's ability to actually take delivery once they're built years from now.That will depend on the fortunes of a region that's seen a significant slowdown in traffic growth, according to Bernstein Research.The region's airlines are "managing a slow-moving reckoning," said Richard Aboulafia, vice president of analysis at The Teal Group aerospace consultancy.Companies like Boeing, Airbus, Embraer and Bombardier may use the opportunity to look beyond the Middle East to Indian carriers and those in north and east Africa that may produce orders.Global effect In years past jetliners like the A380 and Boeing 777X have been the prime focus of the show, but a smaller appetite from Middle East airlines means potentially big business for defense companies.This year "in the short term it's military, military, military," said Aboulafia, who expects drone and surveillance aircraft to feature heavily at the show.The region is a crossroads for defense business.U.S., European, Russian and Chinese companies and governments compete to get their hardware into the region's various militaries."You can never have too many sources [of military hardware] because you never want to be cut off," he said.Egypt, for example, is buying Russian-made MiG-29s and French Rafale fighter jets after decades of U.S. aircraft purchases.Russia's state-owned defense firm plans to bring its ultra-manueverable Sukhoi Su-35.An appearance by the U.S. Air Force's F-22 stealth fighter is also planned.While much of the Dubai Air Show focuses on moving soldiers or passengers around the region - Dubai also wants to be a leader in future air taxis, and has signed up with Uber's Elevate program as one of its key test cities.Despite those broader regional concerns, Dubai, a city-state where aviation accounts for 27% of its GDP and which boasts the busiest international airport in the world, has cemented itself on the world's stage.Standing up Dubai with a strategy of "if you build it they will come...they've more or less passed that with flying colors," said Aboulafia.
Should you open a store credit card?:::::"May I help the next customer?"You finally make it to the front of the line and dump your clothes on the checkout counter.As the scanner displays the price of each item, you start having second thoughts about whether you truly need two new pairs of jeans ... and shoes.That's when the salesperson hits you with the dreaded question: "Would you like to open a store card today?You'll save 20% on your order!"What's a young shopper to do?Know yourself If you're prone to shopping binges or are already struggling with credit card debt, signing up for a store account is probably a bad idea.Interest rates on store cards are notoriously steep and can "quickly devour any point of sale savings you can get by using the card," says Eric Dostal, a New York-based certified financial planner.Related: Uber's new credit card targets Millennials Opening any type of new credit card also involves a hard pull on your credit, which can send your score down.The drop is usually temporary, but you should be careful about how many hard pulls you allow, especially if you're getting ready to buy a house or a car, adds Dostal.If you pay off your credit cards every month and you're a responsible spender, opening a store card could help you build credit and save money on purchases.Still, the credit line on store cards is usually low, which means you won't build as much credit as you would with a traditional Visa or Mastercard, explains Hank Mulvihill, a Texas-based CFP.Ask the right questions Before signing up, you'll want to inquire about any annual membership fees.If you only shop at this store a few times a year, a membership fee could very well outweigh the savings.Next, ask about the interest rate.If the card offers special financing, find out how long you'll have to pay your balance before the regular rate kicks in, says Allan Katz, a New York-based CFP.Related: Venmo now lets you shop online You should also ask where you can use the card.Some retailers will allow you to charge the account anywhere, just like you would a traditional Visa or Mastercard, while others limit you to store purchases.Stand your ground If you've decided that a store card isn't right for you, stay strong and don't let the sales associate persuade you."Their job is to get you to sign up," says Chris Chen, a Massachusetts-based CFP.Once you've opened an account, it can be challenging to undo.Related: Don't get duped by these online shopping scams Canceling a credit card can hurt your credit score, especially if the account offered a substantial line of credit or was open for over 6 months.That's because your credit score is affected by the number of accounts you have open and your total amount of available credit.
As digital payments spread, the cash lobby raises its voice:::::It's been called "the war on cash."Credit card companies, tech startups, and even some governments have pushed to move consumers away from carrying around a wad of bills in their pocket toward using plastic or their smartphones to make payments.Digital transactions are safer, cheaper, and more convenient, they argue.But the cash industry disagrees.And now, it's fighting back.A group of companies that make up the global supply chain for banknotes and coins came together last year to form the International Currency Association.Its membership, which costs $35,000 per year for larger companies, includes companies that make the paper for bills, the inks and holograms that are printed onto it, the machines for handling cash, and the machines for destroying it.Its mission, its website says, is "to provide a powerful and cohesive voice to keep currency a preferred payment choice."Crane Currency, the main supplier of paper for U.S. banknotes, joined in solidarity with more than two dozen companies from across the globe."It's not really in our daily business DNA to go this route," said Tod Niedeck, Crane's corporate marketing director."We would be a little irresponsible to not be part of ICA."Cash production isn't in trouble, exactly.Despite the increasing use of digital payments, the value of currency held by the public has actually been rising as a percentage of gross domestic product in the U.S. and Europe since the 1980s -- and particularly quickly in the past decade.According to a 2015 survey by the Federal Reserve, Americans had an average of $59 in cash at any given time, up from $54 three years earlier.For that reason, the U.K.-based International Currency Association's director general Guillaume Lepecq said that they're operating from a position of strength just keeping an eye on the competition."There's a whole industry of people who are wanting to capture part of the market share of cash, because they make a profitable business out of it," Lepecq said.Companies like Visa (V) and MasterCard (MA), for example, have large public relations operations dedicated to putting out white papers casting cash as backward and digital payments as the future.Why is cash still king?The reasons for the enduring popularity of bills are not well understood, even by people who study the industry."If consumers are using alternative forms of payment, why is there still this growing demand for cash?"says Eugenie Foster, executive director of the International Association of Currency Affairs, which includes both central banks and currency producers.Foster theorizes that the drive toward automation at banks may have created a greater need for cash, because more ATMs and self-storage cash vaults used by businesses and individuals mean more bills sitting in more locations.Others have postulated that the public is storing more savings in cash following the great recession because of a lack of confidence in the banking system and the security of electronic deposits.In addition, low interest rates have also created little incentive to put cash in banks and tourists in particular tend to carry cash to avoid international credit card fees while traveling abroad.But one explanation for cash's popularity is also a reason some say it should be made obsolete: Much of the paper money out there is at work in the underground economy.Harvard economist Kenneth Rogoff published a book last year making the case that $100 bills are now largely used for tax evasion, money laundering and bribery."The demand in the legal economy is fading, but governments are continuing to print cash," Rogoff said.For that reason, some governments have been pulling back.Sweden banned physical currency as a means of paying for public transit years ago.Last year, India abruptly canceled its two highest-denomination notes in an effort to combat corruption.Spain and France have imposed 1,000-euro limits on cash transactions in the name of fighting terrorism.The ICA strongly objects to these moves, arguing that digital payments are just as likely to be used for illicit purposes."Evidence shows that the terrorists essentially used anonymous prepaid cards to move money around," Lepecq said."So we think that's a totally false argument.We're not very happy with those restrictions."Related: Americans see jobs aplenty.Good wages?Not so much Through a new website, cashmatters.org, the association also makes the case for why governments should keep cash in circulation: It's useful to have when the power goes out, for example, like it has in Puerto Rico.Plus, the 7% of Americans who don't have bank accounts depend on cash to get by.Meanwhile, the global cash industry is scrambling to come up with ways to make using currency cheaper and more seamless."If we're not efficient, then yes, the usage of cashless forms of payment become more attractive," said Sim Bielak, the chief marketing officer of Suzohapp.The Illinois-based company makes machines that recycle cash, check out grocery customers and run coin-operated laundries, among other things.And why don't these companies just go into the business of digital payments themselves?"The cashless hardware business is very commoditized," said Bielak."It's a very difficult business to make money."
Alibaba: Singles Day sales hit record $25 billion in 24 hours:::::The biggest shopping day on the planet raked in an eye-popping $25.4 billion.Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba (BABA, Tech30) said Saturday that sales soared past $18 billion after just 13 hours of the retail blitz known as Singles Day, eclipsing the $17.8 billion it managed in the full 24 hours last year.Singles Day, a bonanza of online spending in China, has for years racked up more sales than Black Friday and Cyber Monday combined.Earlier in the day, Alibaba said eager shoppers had managed to spend $1 billion in just 2 minutes.As the clock struck midnight in Shanghai, the final sales tally rang in at $25,386,927,848, marking about a 40% increase over last year's record-setting sales total.Singles Day started out as an informal holiday in China celebrating single people on a day that epitomizes not being paired off: 11/11.Alibaba turned it into a festival of discount deals in 2009.Related: Black Friday 2017: When will the stores open?Alibaba has used the now-massive event to lure international companies onto its platforms.More than 40% of the brands taking part this year came from outside China, according to research firm eMarketer Retail.And while Singles Day still mostly targets Chinese consumers, it's also increasingly spreading to other countries, experts say.Local players in Southeast Asia like Lazada (an Alibaba subsidiary), Zalora and Shopee launched their own Singles Day promotions this year, said Xiaofeng Wang, an analyst with research firm Forrester.Related: It's not just Amazon: Chinese tech giants are selling groceries too The event is also evolving beyond its original conception as an online shopping spree.Alibaba and its main Chinese rival, JD.com, have both made significant investments in brick-and-mortar businesses.And they're using the popularity of Singles Day to drive shoppers to offline stores, too.Cosmetics giant L'Oreal (LRLCF), for example, set up an interactive mirror at its Shanghai store where shoppers could try on virtual makeup using augmented reality and then order products on a touch screen linked to an Alibaba platform.But beyond the blockbuster sales, Singles Day also creates an enormous amount of waste.Greenpeace said the manufacturing, packaging and shipping linked to the event produced 258,000 tons of carbon dioxide emissions last year.It would take about 2.6 billion trees to absorb it all.The environmental activist group estimates this year's shopping blitz is on track to leave an even bigger carbon footprint."More over-consumption means more CO2 emissions and waste," said Greenpeace campaigner Nie Li.
Reliable Sources podcast: Following the money is a collaborative effort:::::Upholding the journalistic imperative "follow the money" in 2017 is more complicated as ever, as transactions are shrouded in secrecy and often rely on an intricate web of offshore activities."There's essentially a parallel universe of how a certain segment of the world conducts its business and how it creates and guards its wealth," the New York Times' Jesse Drucker told Brian Stelter in this week's edition of the Reliable Sources podcast.Drucker is part of a group of reporters across 95 newsrooms worldwide who are writing stories based on the Paradise Papers, a massive document leak from the offshore law firm Appleby.The effort is coordinated by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, a nonprofit headquartered in Washington D.C. that led the reporting on the Panama Papers in 2016.The first stories from the Paradise Papers were published this week.Drucker authored a story on how investments in Facebook and Twitter by Russian billionaire and Silicon Valley venture capitalist Yuri Milner were funded by Kremlin-controlled VTB bank and by a financial arm of Gazprom.The story, Drucker told Stelter, "raised interesting questions, I think, about how far back the Putin regime has been interested in U.S. social media companies."Listen to the whole podcast here: Drucker also co-authored a story about Apple, and how the company shifted profits to a tax haven in the English Channel -- the Island of Jersey -- after Tim Cook testified in a Senate hearing in 2013 that "we don't stash money on some Caribbean island."Collaboration has been a key aspect of reporting on the Paradise Papers, Drucker explained.For the Apple story, he collaborated with Simon Bowers from ICIJ."There were several years where he and I were basically competitors," Drucker said."He was covering tax shelters for the Guardian and I was covering basically the same issues at Bloomberg.It was actually quite interesting to work with him after essentially competing against him for several years."Collaborating with reporters spread out in 95 news organizations was a challenge, Drucker told Stelter."Every interaction you have with an outside source has to be shared internally, and then every time you're going to go to someone for comment, and every time you get comment, that all has to be shared."That made for a "complicated process," but based on the stories, Drucker thinks "it was worth it."Drucker emphasized the fact that the documents themselves were merely a "starting point" for the reporting, and how important the collaborative aspect was to extracting relevant information."People in the UK or in Russia may understand the context for something that someone in the U.S. might not and vice versa."The Paradise Papers are "a growing database" that will be "useful on stories for years to come.Potentially forever," Drucker said."The way you would search U.S. securities filings or real estate records, here is another place you'll turn whenever you're looking at folks who have the potential to touch on the offshore world," Drucker told Stelter.Drucker says the documents provide a trove of potential stories that have yet to be tapped into, and more bombshells are to be expected."There are definitely going to be more stories to come out of the paradise papers beyond what you've seen this week," Drucker said.
Canadian marijuana investors cheer dollar-per-gram tax proposal:::::Investors are loving the Canadian government's proposal to tax legal weed at a dollar per gram.On Friday, the country's Department of Finance reiterated the government's commitment to legalizing the drug for recreational use.It also laid out a plan to levy an excise tax on cannabis products at 1 Canadian dollar per gram (USD $0.79) or 10% of the sale price, whichever is higher.The proposal sent shares of Canadian marijuana companies soaring.The government says the new tax framework will apply to medical marijuana, which is already legal in the country, and recreational products, which the administration has promised to make lawful "no later than July 2018.""The proposed level of taxation is intended to keep prices low to eliminate the black market," according to a notice from Canada's finance department.Related: New Jersey could become the next legal pot state Investors in Aurora Cannabis (ACBFF), a medical marijuana grower that trades on the Toronto Stock Exchange, saw its stock price shoot up nearly 15%.Shares of three other medicinal weed producers trading on the TSE -- MedReleaf (MEDFF), Canopy (TWMJF), Aphria (APHQF), -- each saw their shares climb 3% to 5%.An excise tax is paid in additional to general sales taxes.General sales tax rates across Canada's provinces range from 5% to 15% of the sale price.Even with the excise and sales tax, Canadians may be able to snag their weed for a lower price than some areas of the U.S. Because marijuana is still outlawed on the federal level in the United States, lawmakers on Capitol Hill have yet to tax the drug.But states that have legalized weed have slapped on some hefty taxes.Related: It pays to be a scientist in the marijuana industry In California, where recreational weed sales will be legal beginning January 1, the state is planning to pin a 15% excise tax on weed sales, and consumers will also be on the hook for sales taxes ranging from 22.25% to 24.25%.Between taxes paid by producers, retailers and customers, weed taxes may reach as high as 45% in parts of the state, according to a recent Fitch Ratings report.The tax rates could be enough to keep the black market healthy, one group of Fitch Ratings analysts suggested.In Colorado, where weed has been legal since 2014, the state charges a 2.9% sales tax plus a 15% excise tax and a special 20% sales tax for recreational marijuana.Canada's tax proposal is not set in stone.The government is giving residents until December 7, 2017 to submit feedback.The government says money collected from the marijuana excise tax will be "divided equally between the province or territory and the federal government.""Revenues raised from the taxation regime will help support investments in public education, enforcement, research and other activities integral to an effective system of legalization and regulation of cannabis," according to the Department of Finance.--CNNMoney's Aaron Smith contributed to this report.
'House of Cards' writers racing against the clock to rewrite show:::::Writers for "House of Cards" are trying to resolve the biggest cliffhanger they've ever faced -- the future of their show.The future of the Netflix series remains up in the air, following a string of allegations against star Kevin Spacey that have resulted in his termination from the series and a halt in production.Behind the scenes, however, the show's writers are facing a ticking clock as they scrap a Season 6 plan eight months in the making and find a new direction for the show's final season.Sources close to the production told CNNMoney that it's unlikely the show will be canceled.In fact, writers are kicking around ideas on how to rewrite the show without its biggest star.On the British version of "House of Cards," Francis Urquhart, the inspiration for Spacey's Frank Underwood, played by Ian Richardson, was shot and killed in the final installment.The creative weight rests of the shoulders of Melissa James Gibson and Frank Pugliese, who as showrunners lead the writers' room.Gibson and Pugliese, who were promoted to their posts after creator Beau Willimon left ahead of Season 5, have not made any public statements about the future of the show.Related: The end of 'House of Cards' would hammer Baltimore and wipe out 2,000 jobs In a typical writers room, the showrunners would be tasked with arcing out the season, with help and ideas from the rest of the writers.Different writers are then assigned individual episodes, which are workshopped as a group.The showrunners have final say on the direction and pacing of the season and episodes.The decision on whether to proceed with Season 6 after writers find a new direction will rest with Netflix and producer Media Rights Capital, both of which declined to comment for this story.Netflix suspended production on Season 6 after allegations of sexual harassment and assault were made against Spacey.He was fired from the show after a subsequent report by CNN that included testimonies from eight current and past production members who accused Spacey of inappropriate behavior on set, including one accusation of sexual assault.The cast and crew will know by Thanksgiving what the future holds for "House of Cards," a source told CNNMoney.Staffers are still being paid during the suspension, but they are in limbo until Netflix and Media Right Capital make an official announcement, the source said."House of Cards" had been filming in the Baltimore area for about two weeks prior to the production stoppage on October 31.Cast and crew have a finite amount of time to complete Season 6 due to other contractual obligations, a source said.In most cases, extending that commitment due to unforeseen delays is not always possible, as most often have other jobs lined up.Agents for stars Michael Kelly and Robin Wright did not return CNNMoney's request for comment regarding their contracts for "House of Cards."But another source close to the production told CNNMoney that "House of Cards" was slated to wrap in May before these allegations about Spacey prompted the show to go hiatus.It is unclear whether that is now subject to change.There's a lot at stake.Over 2,000 cast, crew and extras are waiting for a decision that could impact their livelihoods."House of Cards," which for five seasons has been filmed in and around Baltimore, is one of the state's biggest productions.CNN's Lisa France contributed to this report.
FX severs ties with Louis CK:::::Louis C.K.'s lucrative deal with FX and FX Productions is no more.The network and production company said they are "ending our association" with the comedian in a statement Friday.Louis C.K.has executive produced five series with the company over the last eight years.In addition to canceling Louis C.K.'s overall deal with his company, Pig Newton, the companies said he will no longer serve as executive producer for any of the four shows they produce with him, including "Better Things," "Baskets," "One Mississippi" and "The Cops."He will also receive no compensation for them.TBS, on which "The Cops" was set to air, said on Friday production on the animated series "has been suspended until further review."(TBS, like CNN, is owned by Time Warner.)"Louis has now confirmed the truth of the reports relating to the five women victimized by his misconduct, which we were unaware of previously," the statement from FX and FX Productions said."As far as we know, his behavior over the past 8 years on all five series he has produced for FX Networks and/or FX Productions has been professional.However, now is not the time for him to make television shows.Now is the time for him to honestly address the women who have come forth to speak about their painful experiences, a process which he began today with his public statement."On Friday, Louis C.K.confirmed reports of sexual misconduct in a statement via his publicist, Lewis Kay.Kay has since parted ways with Louis C.K., announcing late Friday that he no longer represented the "Louie" creator."FX Networks and FX Productions remain committed to doing everything we can to ensure that all people work in an environment that is safe, respectful and fair, and we will continue our review of all of these productions to ensure that was and is the case."FX's statement added.The New York Times first detailed the allegations against Louis C.K.in a bombshell report that included the stories of five women accused him of inappropriate behavior, including masturbating in front of them.Netflix on Friday also announced it had canceled plans for a second standup comedy special with Louis C.K.HBO has also taken steps to distance itself from Louis C.K.
People have called AT&T about buying CNN; was Rupert Murdoch one of them?:::::AT&T says it is not going to sell CNN.It has rejected the notion of spinning off CNN to win government approval to acquire Time Warner, CNN's parent company.But multiple media moguls put out feelers about possibly buying CNN earlier this year."There have been a lot of people" who have "expressed interest in CNN," AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson said Thursday.According to a new report, Fox News CEO Rupert Murdoch was one of them.Reuters reported on Friday that Murdoch phoned Stephenson "twice in the last six months and talked about cable network CNN."Related: AT&T chief says he's ready to go to court to get Time Warner deal done Two sources with knowledge of the calls confirmed to CNNMoney that the calls took place in May and in August.But there is disagreement about what exactly was said.Reuters cited one source saying that Murdoch "offered to buy CNN in both conversations," while "another source said Murdoch had 'zero interest' in owning CNN."Confusing, to say the least.But it's clear that the two men spoke, which is intriguing in and of itself.Murdoch sought to buy all of Time Warner in 2014, but his bid was rejected.If that deal had happened, CNN would likely have been sold.It was impossible to imagine government regulators allowing one company to own both Fox News and CNN.Flash forward three years.Time Warner is being acquired by AT&T, but the Justice Department is putting up roadblocks.The DOJ's antitrust division chief, Makan Delrahim, believes the acquisition would cause anticompetitive harm to consumers, according to sources.He recently surprised AT&T executives and outside antitrust experts by demanding that AT&T sell off some assets to satisfy the government's concerns.One suggestion was to sell Turner, the unit of Time Warner that includes CNN.AT&T is reluctant to do so.Stephenson said Thursday that he is in "advanced stages of negotiations" with the Justice Department.But if there's no agreement, "we're prepared to litigate now," he said.At the conference, Stephenson disputed claims that he offered to sell CNN to win government approval."I have never been told that the price of getting the deal done was selling CNN.Period.And likewise I have never offered to sell CNN," Stephenson said."There is absolutely no intention that we would ever sell CNN.So take those two off the table."When asked about concerns that President Trump, a frequent critic of CNN, is interfering in the deal review, Stephenson said "I have no reason to believe that" is happening.On Friday, hours before the Reuters report came out, Vanity Fair published a story about the Murdoch factor -- specifically how Murdoch has privately opposed the AT&T-Time Warner deal.The story noted that Murdoch and Trump speak frequently and said that some Time Warner executives see Murdoch's "hidden hand" at work.A Murdoch spokesperson called that "laughable and categorically untrue," and told Vanity Fair, "if Trump is doing this to punish CNN we have nothing whatsoever to do with it."On last Sunday's "Reliable Sources," Murdoch biographer David Folkenflik also mentioned Murdoch's opposition to the AT&T deal."He would love for it to be killed" or at least "slowed down and made more costly, made more problematic," Folkenflik said.Spokespeople for Murdoch and Stephenson declined to comment on Friday.
Startup had a 'kink room.' Can it be reformed?:::::Months after a sexual harassment lawsuit plagued virtual reality startup UploadVR, there are lingering questions about the company's leadership.What happened at UploadVR has left the virtual reality community divided.The founders told CNN Tech they've made changes, brought in new executives and established an HR structure.But women who used to work at the startup say the company hasn't gone far enough in creating a positive environment for women.UploadVR's founding story set the stage for a perfect storm: young founders, millions in funding and a lack of corporate structure.The startup launched in 2014 as a hub for other virtual reality startups.It was a coworking and event space for VR companies, and had a digital publication that kept close tabs on everything happening in the virtual space.The idea was to make virtual reality "cool" and accessible beyond a tech-centric crowd.For founders in their early 20s, that meant throwing parties.(Watch the whole

and we're go-getters.'But it led into something that was more than just that," she said.In May 2017, Elizabeth Scott filed a lawsuit against UploadVR, alleging gender discrimination, harassment and a hostile work environment.According to the lawsuit, a space called "the kink room," which had been set up as a demo for an adult virtual reality company, was also used by male employees to engage in sexual activities."I would every once in awhile find underwear in that room, and we would make jokes about it and have to clean it up....that was a part of it.Startup life, I guess," said Berns, who's speaking out separately.Screenshots obtained by CNN show internal chat boards where pictures of underwear were posted and "random sex sessions" were joked about.According to the lawsuit, women were expected to behave as "mommies" and were tasked with "womanly" jobs like cleaning up after parties -- including disposing of leftover condoms.Berns said people pitched in occasionally, but she said it was known that as the general manager, she was in charge of cleaning and doing the dishes."We had a male general manager before and he did not do that," she recalled.UploadVR founders Will Mason and Taylor Freeman acknowledge that the bulk of the cleaning duties fell to women -- but said that was due to the functions of those women's jobs."When you run a space that has events and is a coworking space, you have to have people that are tasked with maintaining that space at all times," Freeman said."Those two people, our events producer and our office manager, were both women.And so, yeah, it was just a very clear part of their responsibility to clean up after events."The lawsuit also alleges more subtle instances of sexism.Male employees "separated and excluded" themselves from the women, according to the lawsuit, which alleged that Scott wouldn't be invited to lunch with male employees where work was discussed.When she asked to join, according to the suit, she was ignored.It also alleged that she was left off emails or excluded from important meetings.The lawsuit also alleged that founders made inappropriate comments about the female employees."Freeman would comment about how the plaintiff was not the ideal size he likes in a woman that he is going to have sexual relations with," it read.Scott settled the lawsuit with Freeman and Mason, and all of them are prohibited from speaking directly about the suit.Berns said she and a handful of employees sent a letter asking the founders to step down after Scott filed the lawsuit in May 2017.When they refused, she quit, along with three others.The following week, another handful of employees quit, according to Berns."[The founders] are completely oblivious to any sexist behavior that they have ever done," Berns said."And have completely denied -- internally and to themselves -- that they ever acted that way."With many women outraged, and others worried about retaliation for speaking out, Freeman and Mason are now saying they've made changes."There were things that we were doing that we didn't realize the impact they were having," Freeman told CNN Tech."We never intended to to put women in a position where they felt out of power or like they weren't being heard.We realize there's a lot of unconscious bias that exists in the entire industry and I'm sure that we were perpetuating without realizing it.We really didn't have the experience to create a culture where they had a voice."Freeman admits that the company's early events veered toward a party culture, with open bars, late nights and "inappropriate behavior in the office.""Unfortunately, it just wasn't the type of atmosphere that we wanted to breed," Mason said."As a company, we've completely shifted over the last year, our focus and the style of events that we throw."One of the executives they hired in June 2017 was Anne Ward, who has 20 years of experience at tech companies was viewed as the female executive hired to clean up a toxic culture.But she left the company after just four months."I saw the opportunity to help a lot of people, to save jobs, give the investors their money back.And so, I felt I had no choice [but to take the job]," she said.Ward believes the founders should step down."What it came down to for me was respect," she said."If I was a founder, and if there was something I could do that would make the team feel better, help the community heal, I would do it without hesitation, I would've stepped down.But that's not what happened."Silicon Valley's virtual reality community is close-knit.Many women have stories of blatant sexism or have experienced Upload's bro culture at the company's events, but they worry about speaking publicly for fear they'll be being shut out of a niche industry.Scott says speaking out meant losing job opportunities."I was completely blackballed in the community," she said."No one wanted to cross them.This one company [was] just like, 'Well, we still want them to write stories about us.We can't touch you.'"Both Berns and Scott landed at jobs they say have respectful environments, but say the experiences at Upload were incredibly difficult and alienating.As the #MeToo movement spreads online and stories of workplace sexual harassment are exploding, people across industries are asking the question: Now what?For Scott, the 20-page lawsuit has given her back power she felt she lost at the company."I kind of feel like this is my voice.It's right there," she says, pointing at a printed copy of the suit."I would absolutely do it again.If it's helped one person, then I know I did the right thing."This story originally published on November 9, 2017.(Watch the whole series Divided We Code)
Popping the Red Pill: Inside a digital alternate reality:::::Red Pill.The phrase comes from a scene in the 1999 film "The Matrix."Morpheus (played by Laurence Fishburne) offers Neo (Keanu Reeves) a choice: Take the blue pill and stay in the safe but fake world you've always known, or take the Red Pill and tumble down the "rabbit hole" of the harsh real world.Today, people (mostly men) who adhere to the "Red Pill" philosophy essentially believe that everything they've been told about gender, race and politics is a lie -- that their version of reality is the true one.(Watch the whole series Divided We Code) "These communities see themselves as opting out of a system that they think is fundamentally corrupt.That's how they see their radicalization," said Rebecca Lewis, a research analyst at Data & Society Research Institute who's been following these groups since 2015.Swallowing the Red Pill can mean different things to different people, but it often starts with the idea that feminism is toxic, men are oppressed and emasculation is ruining society."That was essentially my gateway drug into the manosphere" said Josh, a 36-year-old former Red Piller."The whole concept that feminism was my enemy."(Josh isn't his real name -- he asked to remain anonymous because he's embarrassed of his former behavior and thinks it could cost him his job.)"It was a sense of community, a sense of brotherhood," he said.There are scores of forums and websites that host this school of thought.One notable space is the Reddit forum r/TheRedPill.The subreddit, which has more than 200,000 subscribers, bills itself as a place for "the discussion of sexual strategy in a culture increasingly lacking a positive identity for men."These forums have posts that offer tips for picking up women, conversations about eating healthier and threads with fitness advice.But below the surface of what sounds like a positive digital space for men, there's a deep undercurrent of misogyny.It's really a place where men can commiserate on how they're oppressed by women."The underlying idea of that community is that the modern day is getting to be a more and more difficult time for men," said Lewis."They think that any increase in women's sexual agency is a threat to their dominance in the dating scene."That anxiety is expressed through posts that advocate the manipulation and dominance of women, or, in some cases, the abandonment of romantic relationships altogether.Some posts even go as far as to say that women want to be raped, calling rejection "token resistance.""It can be really vicious," said Lewis."In their mind, it really shifts the idea of rape and erases it."Reddit updated its content policy last week saying it would "take action against any content that encourages, glorifies, incites or calls for violence or physical harm against an individual or a group of people."In a message to moderators, it acknowledged that enforcement "may often require subjective judgment."The company would not comment specifically on the Red Pill groups.Some point to the Red Pill community as a gateway to the alt-right and a breeding ground for toxic views tied to racism and anti-Semitism.According to Lewis, once someone believes that men as a group are oppressed by feminism, those feelings of animosity can widen to include other groups as well."If these people have already given them advice that they trust on dating and on women, then they're going to be more willing to listen to them on issues of race and sexuality," she said."They often have experienced other social challenges, whether that's bullying or unemployment or romantic rejection, and so they may get drawn into these online spaces where they're being told that actually it's women and feminists and immigrants who are the problem.Once you start from that basis, it's really easy for it to snowball."Josh said he experienced this firsthand."The alt-right and a lot of the men's rights activists, they [don't] calm that fear [of emasculation], they kind of stoke that fire."He said he spent nearly 13 years down the Red Pill rabbit hole."It is a very long time to spend angry," he said."I commented.I read.And for anyone who I thought really wasn't carrying the torch properly, I would call them all sorts of horrible names."Josh bounced from movement to movement until he finally saw a post that pushed him to spit out the Red Pill."As soon as I started realizing that they weren't just limiting their vitriol just to women, as soon as they started targeting people of color," he said."There was this very small voice in the back of my head saying, 'Hey, idiot, wake up, they're talking about you.'"Josh is black -- and he said when he was Red Pilled, he turned against his own race, becoming sympathetic to white nationalist causes.According to Josh, what finally broke him was the reaction of this community to the deaths of Trayvon Martin, Mike Brown and Freddie Gray.He said forums that allow commenters to remain unidentified are making it easier for the white nationalist movement to spread."It just made it where people can actually still retain that anonymity without having to put on a white hood," he said.Lewis noted these communities use mainstays of internet culture -- humorous memes and language -- as a recruiting tool online."They draw people in with irreverence and irony," explained Lewis."A lot of people will start being ironically racist before they start being really racist."Dr. Elias Aboujaoude, a psychiatrist who studies internet addiction at Stanford University, said the more time people spend online, the more susceptible some are to internet radicalization."We don't go online to become more moderate," said Dr. Aboujaoude."There isn't communication across groups.There isn't anyone that you're willing to have a rational conversation with who can pull you to the center and away from these more extreme positions."When you think internet radicalization, terrorist groups like ISIS come to mind.But according to Dr. Aboujaoude, this polarization is happening to all of us -- and the more time we spend looking at our screens, the more our digital identities and physical selves merge."There is something rewarding about acting disinhibited online, because you feel like you're getting away with something that, in the moment, can feel good," he said."So, you do it once, you're more likely to do it twice, and then maybe ten times online, and then after the 10th time, it's become so normalized that it's easier for it to be transposed offline."While these groups are scattered across the internet, they found a cause to rally around in 2016."Trump was a way that [the Red Pill community] could all come together and unite around a common goal," said Lewis."As they're getting radicalized, they are trusting establishment media less and less, they're trusting education less and less.They really liked that he represented this anti-establishment movement."Red Pillers saw candidate Donald Trump as a champion of their own views: He blasted political correctness, made comments that many viewed as sexist and lobbed accusations of "fake news" at the mainstream media.Some even went so far as to call him the "Red Pill candidate."Now that Trump is in office, Red Pillers think they have an opportunity to bring their views into the mainstream and are attempting to convert the public, otherwise known as "normies," to their version of reality, according to Lewis."They're trying to spread misinformation to social networks, to amplify their messages using Twitter hashtags, to try to get Trump to retweet something," said Lewis."I think we need to be very on guard about the ways that their extremist ideas are going to start slipping into our culture more and more."This story originally published on October 29, 2017.(Watch the whole series Divided We Code)
Alt-Tech platforms: A haven for fringe views online:::::As the power of information becomes concentrated in the hands of a few major tech companies, new platforms are popping up to challenge their dominance.These aren't just alternatives to Google, Facebook and Twitter.They're also communities that cater to people with fringe views who have been kicked off mainstream sites.One of the more recent startups is Hatreon, a crowdfunding site for people creating controversial content.(Watch the whole series Divided We Code) "Even if we find ideas objectionable, they have to be there for us," said Cody Wilson, the 29-year-old founder of Hatreon."We have to support them, and not because they're easy, only because they're controversial."Who's being funded on Hatreon?Right now, it's a who's-who of the alt-right -- people like prominent white supremacist Richard Spencer and Andrew Anglin, founder of neo-Nazi website The Daily Stormer.Hatreon "patrons" support these men, and many other provocative figures, on a monthly basis.Anglin collects the most money, getting $7,800 a month from more than 200 patrons.The people on Hatreon have been widely condemned as racists, misogynists, anti-Semites and white supremacists who may inspire violence with their rhetoric.But Wilson tries to reframe their vitriol."These people are, at worst, trolls, performance artists, provocateurs, vulgarians," he said."At best, they represent elements of a political speech that should not be censored."While he doesn't align himself with all their worldviews, Wilson is enabling the "political speech" of these characters.He's taking a cut too: He gets 5% of every dollar raised on Hatreon.The site is a direct response to the escalating debate over content policies on the internet.Tech companies are increasingly forced to find a balance between removing propaganda and harassment while still embracing free speech.A growing number of people like Wilson are accusing the companies of politically motivated enforcement.Hatreon sprung up this summer after two high-profile users were kicked off Patreon, a more mainstream crowdfunding site for artists and creators."Why do we approve of Facebook's decision on what is and isn't acceptable speech?"asked Wilson."Why would we approve anyone deciding what is and isn't acceptable for us to read?And who would we give that job to even if we had to?"Hatreon isn't the first controversial project from the Arkansas native, now living in Austin.Several years ago, Wilson posted directions online for how to 3D print a gun, leading Wired to call him one of the most dangerous people on the internet.(The State Department forced him to take the blueprints down, but he's fighting to put them back up.)"I think I'm known, at least in the underbelly of the internet, as one of the more radical free-speech activists," he said.AN OPPORTUNITY PewTube is another "alt-tech" platform launched earlier this year.It was started as an alternative to YouTube after the Google-owned site started being more aggressive about removing content."I think we're reaching a point where these sites are becoming monolithic," said PewTube founder Anthony Mayfield."When there is a need for [new] technology because of a clampdown, a lot of really smart minds say, 'OK.Here is a problem,' and they think about how to address it.It's going to spur a huge backlash and digital innovation."PewTube is still small -- it just passed 400,000 total video streams.And the content is mostly amateur postings, much of it extremely disturbing -- including videos that glorify mass murderer Dylann Roof, those that equate black protesters with primates from "Planet of the Apes," and one that puts Holocaust atrocities to the tune of Simon and Garfunkel's "Sound of Silence."But Mayfield is less concerned about what's being said, and more concerned that these content creators not be censored."It's a scary moment right now for the internet and free speech," he said."We run a really dangerous risk saying people who we find distasteful aren't able to use these services."Mayfield said he was inspired to start the site when a professor and free speech advocate he admired, Jordan Peterson, was temporarily locked out of his YouTube and Gmail accounts earlier this year.While Peterson told the Toronto Sun he expected "political reasons," the details as to why he was locked out aren't clear.He did not respond to CNN Tech's request for clarity.Google said it would not comment on individual user's accounts but said, "YouTube never took down or suspended his account, and his videos have remained accessible."Gab, an alternative to Twitter, launched just before the 2016 election and is probably the most notable of the "alt-tech" sites right now, claiming more than 200,000 users.Gab says "all are welcome" -- a nod to the First Amendment.But, really, it gained popularity by attracting "contrarians" who got sick of Twitter's terms of service.In August, the company tweeted that it crowdfunded more than $1 million to keep the site going.FIGHTING THE BEHEMOTHS This is all happening as tech companies not only find themselves part of the broader culture wars, but as they come under greater scrutiny for their sheer size and power.And it's not only people with extreme political views who are sounding the alarm."What we're seeing with these platforms is a monopolization of control over commerce on the Internet," said Barry Lynn, executive director of the Open Markets Institute, a left-leaning nonprofit that had its own run-in with Google."When you have this much power in these few hands...not only might they take this information and manipulate the flow for their own political good, they're also just sloppy about it."The debate inevitably comes down to what the government's role should be in regulating these behemoths.Lynn, for his part, believes anti-monopoly laws have to be part of the solution.Alphabet Chairman Eric Schmidt, unsurprisingly, advocated that tech companies have an important role in "ranking" content on the internet."Would you rather have us make this decision, or the government make this decision?"he asked in an interview earlier this month.Hatreon's Wilson doesn't want either group to have that power.That's why he created his peer-to-peer funding platform."Google is an advertising company.It has no role in policing American discourse.It sells f***ing ads on the internet, right?Facebook is a social media company that just steals your data from you because you voluntarily gave it up.They have no role of authority in American living."Currently, Facebook, Youtube and Twitter monitor hate speech on the basis of race, religion or sexual orientation and have content policies that prohibit violent threats.But the perception of uneven or arbitrary enforcement has plagued the platforms.In some ways, the big tech companies have acknowledged the shortcomings of their policies, or at least their inconsistent enforcement.Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey have addressed the issue in the last year under public pressure.But even consistently defining hate speech has proved difficult for these platforms."It doesn't mean anything, it distracts you.It uses a moral justification to silence and to censor," Wilson said."Any book is, in the right hands, like a grenade.This can't be controlled and we shouldn't try to control it."THERE'S STILL A LINE Of course, even these more radical sites have their own content restrictions.PewTube says it doesn't allow copyrighted material or pornography."We don't want to have to deal with obscenity and stuff like that," said Mayfield.Wilson said he legally can't let people crowdfund who have been convicted of money laundering, fraud or those who are on the State Department's terror list.While Hatreon's community guidelines say the "site stands for free speech absolutism," Wilson reserves the right to kick people off if there are violent threats or illegal activity."A lot of these questions are already handled legally," said Wilson."If I'm abusing you, if I'm harassing you, then there are laws [to prevent] abuse, harassment, intimidation....These are not free speech acts."But revenge porn, the distribution of sexually explicit material without the subject's consent, is a gray area.Hatreon's terms of service are broad: "If you do harmful things we may cancel your account."Wilson admits that revenge porn is a "wrong and a direct harm," but since it's not illegal in all jurisdictions, it's not explicitly addressed and won't necessarily get you kicked off Hatreon.As for his motivations, Wilson has a few."I'm making this stand because I have to carry on the tradition of the English civil liberties and free speech if no one else will," he said."The closest my politics comes to any traditional school is anarchism," he said."I don't like the imposition of state controls over human creativity, freedom, individuality.The way to oppose these things is to undermine the powers of traditional liberal institutions."This story originally published on October 29, 2017.(Watch the whole

Where the battle over free speech is being waged online:::::The delicate balance between supporting open expression and shutting down abusive content has become a flashpoint for the tech industry.You don't need to look any further than Twitter's recent decision to suspend Rose McGowan's account after she tweeted a phone number in the wake of the Harvey Weinstein scandal.Decisions are politicized.Transparency is questioned.And tensions are rising."Are we like the phone company where it's creepy for us to listen in?"asked one prominent tech CEO, Matthew Prince."Or are we like a newspaper that should have an editorial decision?"(Watch the whole series Divided We Code) These questions have thrust companies into the crosshairs of an evolving discussion on how to monitor content.Companies like Facebook and Twitter have argued they're tech platforms -- not media companies.In the early days of the internet, the idea of an open web, free from censorship, was key to its success.But that hands-off approach is becoming less defensible, as we see Russian troll farms buying political ads on Facebook, disgruntled exes posting revenge porn and ISIS recruits being radicalized online.For Prince, that tension culminated one morning this summer.His company, Cloudflare, is a large but mostly invisible web infrastructure company that helps websites run quicker and provides protection from attacks.10% of all internet requests pass through its network, without which sites could be left vulnerable to cyberattacks.But when one of his customers said Prince wouldn't kick him off because Cloudflare's senior leadership was itself full of white supremacists (it's not), Prince took decisive action.He terminated service for neo-Nazi site The Daily Stormer, saying it was a one-time decision not meant to serve as a precedent."I woke up in a bad mood and decided someone shouldn't be allowed on the internet," Prince wrote in a memo to employees in August, "No one should have that power."The son of a journalist, Prince told CNN Tech that he takes issues of free speech "very, very seriously," but he also has the right "not to do business with jerks."The Cloudflare CEO sat down with CNN Tech to describe what's happened since that one controversial decision.Most notably, he said Cloudflare has received requests to terminate more than 3,500 different customers -- including from governments, people trying to enforce copyright law, and others who simply find particular content problematic."And the amazing thing is that it's not just neo-Nazis," Prince said."It's far right, far left, middle people, things that people just think are disgusting, things that people might disagree with because they don't like one point of view or another."He said part of the reason Cloudflare has been able to deflect these types of requests in the past is that the company has never taken a political position -- it has treated all content equally.Now, he worries it will be much harder to use that defense.He's concerned, for instance, that because he kicked off one site, he will no longer be able to fend off foreign governments' requests to censor LGBT organizations in countries where they're persecuted.As tech companies grow in their ability to shape culture and communication, the question of who should have the power to make these weighty decisions becomes even harder to answer.Meanwhile, social networks are starting to accept responsibility for writing algorithms that better detect hate speech and online abuse, according to Andrew McLaughlin, a former policy director at Google and former deputy chief technology officer for President Obama."I think the obvious trigger for it is the Trump election and the spread of fake news.And that has caused of lot of these companies to do some soul-searching where they say, 'Alright, we now have to accept that we can't be neutral,'" McLaughlin said."We're making choices that are incredibly consequential for what speech gets aired and seen by ordinary people."Tech companies are also attempting to roll out stopgap measures to combat harassment.Last month, Instagram introduced a tool that allows users to filter comments.Users say it's a step in the right direction, but there's still a lot to be done to root out the trolls on social media.And earlier this month, Twitter outlined policy changes, including one that addresses how the site plans to treat hateful imagery.The content in question will be blurred and users will need to manually opt in to view.But what exactly Twitter defines as a hate symbol wasn't clearly spelled out.Some tech executives, including Prince, argue that the responsibility falls on political institutions to set clearer guidelines.While he said he's not arguing for more regulation, Prince said tech CEOs don't have the same accountability as elected officials.Others, like McLaughlin, are less trustful of the government becoming the gatekeeper of online speech."I'm not a big fan of governments getting directly involved in the management of tech companies," said McLaughlin."History shows that that power tends to be abused pretty easily."It's not just issues of online abuse and harassment that have cropped up in recent years.The 2016 election thrust the issue of fake news onto center stage."There's a line between abuse and misinformation, and most of these companies for a while, and including Twitter, were more focused on abuse," said Ev Williams, cofounder of Twitter and CEO of Medium."I think the misinformation thing is something that's come up really in the last year much more dramatically."Williams has long believed in the internet's role in the free exchange of information.But, lately, he said, identifying trustworthy sources is "something that we really need to work on building into these systems more.""Silicon Valley is a place of optimism, [but] it can be blind optimism," Williams said."That's part of the evolution that we're going through -- we're no longer as blind."Controlling and labeling misinformation is one of the biggest challenges facing tech companies today.Facebook, Twitter and Google increasingly must determine the difference between diverse political viewpoints and things that are just plain inaccurate, Williams said."That's when some people are calling for editorial guidelines," he said."And you get into an area where most tech companies would be like, 'It's not something that really fits in our model or that we would even be good at.'"But whether they like it or not, tech platforms are being called on to take a more active role in identifying abuse, harassment and fake news."There's a principle that evil festers in darkness.One of the things you don't want to do is basically suppress racist speech in a world where they can just go elsewhere, and do their evil in darkness," McLaughlin said."The product balance being struck here is when we find ways to elevate and suppress without censoring, and I actually think that is possible."This story originally published on October 29, 2017.(Watch the whole series Divided We Code)
The new counterculture: Conservatives in Silicon Valley?:::::When doing on-camera interviews in the past, I've been asked to hide identities of sources and subjects.There were victims of harassment, sex workers worried about repercussions, hackers who'd committed a crime, people worried about their safety.But a technology worker afraid of publicly outing himself as "conservative" in Silicon Valley?That was a new one for me.In reporting this story, I made dozens of calls to conservative-leaning people in Silicon Valley.They told me there was too much at stake in a divisive climate and could only speak under the veil of anonymity.Many say a crossroads came in August when Google engineer James Damore was fired after writing a controversial memo criticizing Google's lack of ideological diversity.He argued there were fewer women in tech due to "biological" reasons.It brought loaded subjects to the surface -- gender, diversity and political correctness in the Trump era.(Watch the whole series Divided We Code) While Google CEO Sundar Pichai said Damore was fired for his controversial statements regarding women, many conservatives retorted that his firing made it harder to be open about their political ideology at liberal-leaning tech companies.We spoke with two "undercover conservatives" in Silicon Valley who asked us to conceal their identities.We'll call them Jack and John."John" is a founder who's worked at several large tech companies."Jack" is currently at an early stage startup funded by influential investors.Both entrepreneurs have extensive backgrounds in tech.Below are excerpts from our conversations with them, as well as one with Harmeet Dhillon, a lawyer who represents Damore.The interviews occurred separately, but have been edited together by topic.THE COST OF BEING CONSERVATIVE Jack and John -- in addition to other entrepreneurs we spoke to -- are committed to hiding their political leanings.They say the cost of disclosure is greater than an awkward conversation or a red-faced debate.We asked them what would happen if they revealed their names.Jack: Let's say you and I met at a conservative event.Then, if we were at a broader event, and I wanted to introduce you to a liberal who I thought might be able to give you good career advice or something, we probably would lie about how we met.Or we wouldn't tell the whole story.We'd say we met at a dinner or something, but we wouldn't provide much context.In one sense, it can be a little bit depressing when pretty much everyone you interact with is liberal.On the other hand, it's actually quite invigorating being part of a small group of people sort of battling what many see as the status quo or a herd mentality.John: If I walked into work with a "Make America Great Again" hat, there would be repercussions.Quite a few people would take it as a personal affront, and I would expect to be out of the company within weeks, if not a month.Jack: The main reason why it can be tough to be conservative is actually because of business reasons.There's such a lack of skilled workers, even in Silicon Valley, so you already are in a recruiting war.If you come out and say you're conservative, you may not be able to attract this top talent that's so critical to build a multi-billion-dollar business.Pretty much anything that seems remotely right wing could really hurt your business.You can lose your job and your livelihood, all because of a political belief that you feel is shared by half the country.ON PERSONAL POLITICS Politics isn't black and white (as much as it can feel that way).There's always been a libertarian streak in Silicon Valley -- a laissez-faire attitude toward business and culture.Even in 2017, that rubs off on Jack and John.Jack: I'd describe myself as a blend of conservative and libertarian.On fiscal issues, I'm pretty conservative.On some social issues, I'm liberal.[On some], I tend to be moderate.On immigration, I'm moderate to conservative.On foreign policy, I'd say I'm a moderate hawk.John: Fiscally, I consider myself to be very conservative.On social issues, I consider myself to be much more libertarian.But unfortunately, in today's political discourse, those things would probably make me a conservative in a lot of people's minds.And especially in the state of California right now, that makes me a conservative.ON TRUMP Donald Trump got less than 20% of the vote in the Bay Area.But Aaron Ginn, an open conservative in tech, thinks the number could have been as high as 25% in the tech community.He says Trump's election was a "strong slap in the face to elite cities like San Francisco."Jack and John both believe the 2016 election and Trump's victory exacerbated the polarization.Jack: Since President Trump took office, a lot of people are saying, "Oh, I won't go work for a conservative company or for someone who seems to be associated with conservative people."Those passions are much higher.President Trump, I do think, definitely threw fuel on the fire here.John: The hysterical nature of the political climate [has] turned into fear, where people are afraid of ideas that challenge their own and they think people who hold those ideas are not only wrong ... but in some ways they're evil.It's unfortunate.And it leads to people saying and doing things that normally they wouldn't feel comfortable doing.ON JAMES DAMORE'S FIRING While Jack and John both agreed with some of the points that Damore made in his memo, they still believe his firing was justified.Jack: Some parts of it I agreed with, some parts I didn't.But from a conservative perspective, Google not only had the right to fire him, but I think it was the right move.At Google and at any company, there's a lot of positivity to having a culture that isn't extremely diverse from an ideological perspective.There are certain things that should be open for debate in a company, but you need everyone to have a degree of sameness where they'll get close to each other, they'll form common bonds and they'll actually work harder.Google has picked to adopt this very, sort of, progressive-leaning culture, and if James Damore was doing things antithetical to that, which upset a majority of the employees, then you have to maintain the productive culture, and get rid of them.John: I don't feel like any time I've been working for a company, I would feel comfortable posting something like that at work.The right place for that is Quora, which has historically been a place to have these kinds of debates on subjects like politics, religion and diversity.ON COMBINING WORK AND POLITICS Tech CEOs increasingly are taking stances on political issues like immigration.Jack and John see that as another example of the "hyperpartisan" nature of today's culture.John: It's become popular to be hyperpartisan, and it's blurred it into these companies, maybe partially because they're newer and the people running them don't have the experience of why it's good to separate non-business activities from political activities.If the CEO has a stated position on something, generally everyone falls in line whether or not you agree with it.Jack: If I say I want more border security, are people going to complain to HR about that?Am I going to get fired for saying that?John: The arrogance to think that we have somehow figured stuff out better than everyone else just because there's a lot more money and a lot more jobs in this area is extremely annoying.Jack: I think it's a big deal as these tech companies get more and more control over the things we see.Easy content distribution, coupled with fewer gatekeepers, means the people in these companies are going to have far more power.It's a sad state where conservatives feel they might lose their jobs and can't speak out about some of the editorial decisions.LEGAL BACKUP After James Damore was fired, he hired Harmeet Dhillon, a civil rights attorney and a California representative for the Republican National Convention.I spoke with her about what she claims are the repercussions for conservatives at tech companies.Dhillon: It's being disciplined for innocent remarks.It's being not considered for job opportunities and internal promotions.It's being abruptly terminated for manufactured reasons that frankly, are not supported by the law and the facts.Segall: You could literally take that exact thing you just said and apply that to some of the women's cases at these tech companies.Just like I'm sure you got a lot of calls from conservatives, I got a lot of calls from women in tech saying, "I feel demeaned by a lot of the rhetoric [in Silicon Valley]."Dhillon: I've suffered sexual harassment as a woman as well.The fact that that exists does not take away from the fact that political and viewpoint discrimination exists in Silicon Valley.Both can exist.Jordan Malter contributed to this report.This story originally published on October 29, 2017.(Watch the whole series

Silicon Valley's fault lines are exposed:::::When I started covering technology, the questions seemed more simple: Where did the name Twitter come from?How will social media democratize information?Those were the days when Facebook made the news for connecting long lost relatives, when people marveled at Uber's innovation rather than the company's sexual harassment scandals.Fast forward to 2017, and Silicon Valley's fault lines are exposed.Between ongoing revelations about sexism in tech to Russian troll farms that sought to influence the election, the tech industry is under fire.In this series, Divided We Code, we dig into a culture of growing influence and power, of politics and fear, and of deeply entrenched sexism in one of the most influential industries in the world.(Watch the whole series Divided We Code) INTERNET 2.0's TRAGEDY OF THE COMMONS The internet was supposed to be a place where freedom of expression would allow us to share our ideas -- the good and the bad.In the utopian world coded by tech entrepreneurs, people would navigate the information flow and engage in quality conversations online.But that now seems idealistic and a little naive.Andrew McLaughlin, former director of public policy at Google, said the best metaphor for the current state of the internet is the so-called Tragedy of the Commons."If you have a common space, a park, and anybody can go and see it without any controls, the tragedy will be that that space gets trashed," he said.And as the metaphorical park takes a beating, so does Silicon Valley's idealism.Ev Williams, who cofounded Twitter and founded Medium, has always believed that if we could speak freely, the world would be a better place.But lately, he's realized it's not quite so simple."I still fundamentally believe that, but I also think we were nave," he said."People won't feel free if there are certain types of behaviors dominating a conversation or putting them down."You see this play out daily on Twitter, where harassment seems rampant and meaningful dialogue is drowned out by trolls."The racists can attach their racist, abusive speech to every single tweet, every single post," McLaughlin said."In the public square here, imagine if the racist could just basically build an infinite number of robots to overwhelm the people on the other side of the line -- that's what's been allowed to happen on the internet."UPDATED STATUS: IT'S COMPLICATED Once arm's length from anything editorial, tech CEOs are realizing they can no longer be neutral when it comes to content on their platforms.Where's the line between a difference of opinion and straight-up lies -- and who should make those decisions?"You get into an area where most companies would be like, 'It's not something that really fits our model or that we would even be good at,'" said Williams.But increasingly, there's little choice.Cloudflare CEO Matthew Prince described the nuance when he made the decision to kick neo-Nazi site The Daily Stormer off his platform, which helps protect websites from online attacks.He put it flippantly in a memo to employees: He woke up one day and decided someone shouldn't be allowed on the Internet.He worries about that power, and so should you.In today's polarized climate, that power can be viewed as politically motivated, according to Prager University CEO Marissa Streit.Prager University isn't an actual academic institution.It was founded by divisive radio host and conservative commentator Dennis Prager and produces online videos for YouTube -- the segments tend to promote conservative ideology."Our topics are ideological in nature," Streit said."We do pro-America.We believe in economic freedom."This includes videos like "How to Raise Kids Who Are Smart About Money" and "Did FDR End the Great Depression?"-- but it also includes some more controversial content, like "Are 1 in 5 Women Raped at College?"and "Gender Identity -- Why All the Confusion?"Streit noticed some of the content -- including the latter two videos -- was being categorized as "restricted" on YouTube, which is a setting for "potentially mature" content.This makes it more difficult to find the videos in a search.The group has 250 videos -- around 30 of which have been restricted by YouTube.Streit said she was frustrated by the lack of transparency."We kept going back to them, [saying], 'There's no pornography in our videos.'We've always been very clear about our mission," she said."We do know that we present a certain ideology that may or may not agree with everyone.The question is: Is Google the one who gets to decide what everybody gets to watch?"When asked about PragerU, Google responded broadly in a statement: "Giving viewers the choice to opt in to a more restricted experience is not censorship.In fact, this is exactly the type of tool that Congress has encouraged online" Prince saw the lack of transparency play out on the other side."We could have done it differently.We could have just said, 'They violated section 13G of our terms of service...and swept it under the rug,'" Prince said, regarding his decision to kick off The Daily Stormer."It would be BS if we did it, and it's BS when any other technology company does it.That's the point that is important: There are arbitrary decisions that get made."THE NEW ESTABLISHMENT Streit and Prince aren't alone in worrying that tech companies have too much power over what people see and who has a voice on their platforms.In response, a number of alternative platforms have sprung up.Sites like Hatreon, PewTube and Gab cater to controversial, far-right figures, many of whom were kicked off more traditional sites like Patreon, YouTube and Twitter.These platforms are small and may have limited influence, but they're building communities for people who explicitly reject Silicon Valley's influence.The founders champion free speech, but their platforms give a voice to some of the ugliest ideologies."What we're seeing with [social media] platforms is a monopolization of control over commerce on the Internet," said Barry Lynn, executive director of the Open Markets Institutes."When you have this much power in these few hands, then you're going to have problems.Not only might they take this information and manipulate the flow for their own political good, they're also just sloppy about it.They just don't do a good job of managing the process."SILICON VALLEY'S DIVIDE The irony isn't lost: A place that promised to unite us, to connect the world, is suffering from its own massive divisions.In the current political climate, you could argue the tech built in Silicon Valley is pulling us into our own filter bubbles, with algorithms that only reinforce our beliefs.Meanwhile, behind closed doors, conservatives in tech are forming an underground community.I spoke to a number of entrepreneurs who identify as conservative but keep it a tightly held secret.Being conservative in tech, they say, is enough to threaten their jobs.Aaron Ginn founded Lincoln Network, a community for conservatives and libertarians.He said if you're conservative in Silicon Valley -- whether or not you voted for Trump -- you're often perceived as racist or homophobic."The fact is that if you have any center right view, you're automatically put in that camp now," he said.And as Silicon Valley deals with scrutiny over a lack of gender and racial diversity, there's a rather unexpected group that feels underrepresented: wealthy, white, conservative males.Former Google engineer James Damore wrote a controversial memo over the summer, criticizing Google's lack of ideological diversity and arguing that "biological" reasons hold back the number of women working in tech.He became a touchpoint in Silicon Valley's culture wars -- standing in for all the men who feel oppressed by tech's professed liberal values.Damore hired Harmeet Dhillon, a civil rights attorney, who said she's now representing those people."I've always had a penchant for the underdog and right now, conservatives are the underdog in Silicon Valley."SEXUAL HARASSMENT: 'THAT'S JUST LIFE IN SILICON VALLEY' When you look at everything festering just below the surface, when you see how misogyny and sexist rhetoric have been exacerbated and amplified on sites like Twitter and Reddit, it's not hard to see how Silicon Valley itself has been hit by widespread allegations of sexual harassment and discrimination.Susan Fowler's eye-opening account of sexual harassment at Uber was only the beginning.Reports in the New York Times, The Information and a CNN Special highlight the countless instances of bad behavior in the tech industry.While tech leaders are getting better at responding to overt harassment, deep-rooted issues of sexism are still all too present.But what is changing is the movement of women starting to come forward.One of those women, Elizabeth Scott, filed a lawsuit against influential virtual reality startup UploadVR, alleging gender discrimination, harassment and a hostile work environment.The suit paints a picture of a company rife with immaturity and sexism.While Scott settled and is unable to talk about the details of the lawsuit, another former employee, Daisy Berns, spoke to CNN Tech publicly for the first time.A former general manager at UploadVR, Berns recounts a party culture where the lines between employer and employee blurred, and women at the company were tasked with cleaning duties.For Berns, that meant picking up underwear left on the floor from "office" parties thrown by the founders.The Upload founders acknowledge that the bulk of the cleaning duties often fell to women -- but said that was due to the functions of those women's jobs."When you run a space that has events and is a co-working space, you have to have people that are tasked with maintaining that space at all times," said Taylor Freeman, one of the cofounders."Those two people, our events producer and our office manager, were both women.Ultimately, it's just unfortunate that our office manager at the time had to deal with finding some of these things."Freeman acknowledged that the atmosphere in the company's early days lacked professionalism but chalked it up to their relative lack of experience -- he was 23 when he started Upload (his cofounder Will Mason was 24)."We never intended to do anything wrong or to put women in a position where they felt out of power or like they weren't being heard," he said."We really didn't have the experience to create a culture [and] the structure where they had a voice."Freeman and Mason took responsibility for enabling the environment.They said the company has since built an HR structure, stopped its party culture and hired executives to help take the company forward.But it hasn't been a smooth process.Anne Ward, one of the executives hired to help the company, stepped down after four months, citing an overarching lack of respect."The tone from the top needs to change," she said.Scott, meanwhile, suffered ramifications for speaking out.After multiple interviews, another tech company informed her they couldn't hire her -- she was a liability.Many other women told me they couldn't share their stories about UploadVR publicly for fear of retribution.We protected the identity of conservatives in Silicon Valley who said their bottom line would be impacted if they were "outed," but women in tech are wondering how they can speak out without their job prospects taking a hit.It's 2017, and sexual harassment in Silicon Valley is still running rampant.The question being asked in the internal message boards for women in tech -- now what?Scott, who felt powerless, said the 20-page lawsuit is her voice."It makes it real to see it in writing," she said."There is power in speaking up, even if not everybody believes you."This story originally published on October 29,

Google cracks down on disturbing cartoons on YouTube Kids:::::YouTube is trying to clean up its kids' app.Recent reports have called attention to troves of videos with profanity and violent themes on YouTube Kids, the video-sharing site's kid-friendly platform.Content for YouTube Kids is pulled from the main YouTube platform using machine learning and algorithms.But some videos, such as cartoons disguised as age appropriate, slip through the cracks.Videos flagged as inappropriate for kids will be slapped with an age-restriction warning on its main YouTube app.This will prevent them from being pulled onto the Kids app.Only those logged into YouTube who are over the age of 18 will be able to view it.Videos flagged with an age restriction (18 and older) are already banned from YouTube Kids.The app is geared toward children under 13.The Google-owned company announced it will roll out the new policy in the coming weeks.But it told CNN Tech the move is not in response to recent headlines but to improve upon the service.A Medium post made rounds this week from writer James Bridle, who detailed the content he's noticed on YouTube Kids for "some time.""Disturbing Peppa Pig videos, which [promote] extreme violence and fear, with Peppa eating her father or drinking bleach, are, it turns out very widespread," he wrote."The architecture [YouTube and Google] built to extract the maximum revenue from online video is being hacked by persons unknown to abuse children," he added.Related: To combat revenge porn, Facebook wants some users to send their intimate photos Last week, YouTube's global head of family and learning content Malik Ducard told The New York Times the inappropriate videos were "the extreme needle in the haystack."One search for Peppa Pig on YouTube's main page turned up a video called "Cocaine pancakes" with nearly 1 million views.Multiple curse words appeared in the first 17 seconds alone -- but it is not yet flagged as age-restricted content.In the past 30 days, the company said that less than .005% of videos viewed in the Kids app were removed for being inappropriate."Earlier this year, we updated our policies to make content featuring inappropriate use of family entertainment characters ineligible for monetization," said Juniper Downs, YouTube director of policy, in a statement."The YouTube team is made up of parents who are committed to improving our apps and getting this right."
Casper founders wanted to make it easier to buy a mattress:::::The five founders of Casper had their big idea -- sell mattresses online, direct to the customer -- after they had a talk about their own sleeping habits."We kind of compared notes on how we were sleeping and what we were sleeping on.We saw there was a big variation, and none of us knew if one was better than the other," co-founder Philip Krim told CNNMoney.They realized they also dreaded the experience of buying a mattress, which felt a lot like buying a used car.There had to be a better way."It's still a very antiquated experience where you go to the store on every corner, you walk in in your street clothes, you're expected to lay on a mattress under fluorescent lights and then know how you'll sleep," Krim said."It just seemed very perverse to us.""That's where we came up with the idea of letting people try it in their home and actually sleeping on the product before they were committed to it."Still, it took a while for investors to see the merit."We were laughed out of the room a lot of times," Krim said of the team's fundraising efforts."People thought we were crazy.How could you make a mattress brand cool?"The founders eventually did raise enough money.They launched Casper in 2014.Related: Harry's founders wanted to make razors more affordable As it grew in popularity, other direct-to-customer mattress companies popped up.At the same time, online reviews proliferated for all kinds of products.That includes affiliate reviewers, who partner with companies and are compensated when a customer buys a product because of their referral.In April 2016, Casper sued three mattress bloggers for false advertising and deceptive practices.The suits alleged that the bloggers steered readers away from Casper and toward mattress companies that the bloggers had a business relationship with.Two of the cases settled quickly.The third, against the blog Sleepopolis, dragged on before eventually settling, and Casper helped another company purchase the site.(The founder of Sleepopolis, Derek Hales, did not respond to requests for comment.)"We do work with affiliate reviewers," Krim said."We have no issues with affiliates, but we require that everyone discloses what their relationship is with us, what their relationships are with others.And we only work with folks that we believe are following best practices in this space."Related: The founders of Away changed the luggage industry after a travel mishap While Casper is an industry leader, Krim said there's a long way to go before he'll label the company a success.He and the other founders are still looking for ways to innovate, and they have lofty aspirations.Nike made active lifestyles appealing and Whole Foods popularized healthy eating, he said, and "we think the third pillar of wellness is sleep.""We want to be the brand that people talk about as really accelerating the movement around realizing that prioritizing sleep is an important thing," he said.
How the cops can get what they need off of your iPhone:::::Apple once again is finding itself at the center of a debate around law enforcement and encryption.On Thursday, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein cited the recent Texas mass shooting as an example of why encryption backdoors -- or ways to circumvent security and privacy protocols -- are necessary.The tech company said it offered to help the FBI after the agency said it could not unlock the phone of Texas shooter Devin Kelley.He is accused of killing 26 people and then himself at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas on Sunday."Our team immediately reached out to the FBI after learning from their press conference on Tuesday that investigators were trying to access a mobile phone," Apple (AAPL, Tech30) said in a statement."We offered assistance and said we would expedite our response to any legal process they send us."A source familiar with the matter confirmed the phone was an iPhone.The FBI declined to comment.The source told CNN that law enforcement agencies did not contact Apple for help within 48 hours after the shooting.Consequently, investigators may have lost crucial time that could have helped them investigate the shooter's phone.The 48-hour window In theory, law enforcement could have used the shooter's fingerprint, even if deceased, to unlock the device in the hours following the incident.Researchers have previously shown it's possible to easily spoof the fingerprint sensor if you have a clay replica of the person's finger.The FBI would not need Apple's assistance to unlock the phone in this manner.If the the agency had called Apple, the company may have suggested this method.However, it's unclear whether the shooter had Touch ID enabled.But the fingerprint scanner no longer works if the iPhone hasn't been unlocked for 48 hours -- Apple then requires users to input a passcode.Some Android phones have similar time limits before requiring a passcode to unlock.Apple has featured the 48-hour time limit since rolling out Touch ID in 2013.Its decision to frequently require the passcode helps people remember the security key.iPhone users must also enter the passcode to do things like update their software.Related: DOJ grows frustrated with tech firms over encryption Other methods Some security experts have speculated the Texas incident could further the debate on encryption backdoors.California Senator Dianne Feinstein reportedly wants to revisit proposed legislation to require tech firms to share encrypted messages if given a warrant, according to a Politico report.The encryption issue came to a head in 2015 following the San Bernardino terror attack.Apple CEO Tim Cook very publicly pushed back on the FBI's order to create software that could unlock one of the shooter's iPhones."In the wrong hands, this software -- which does not exist today -- would have the potential to unlock any iPhone in someone's physical possession," Cook wrote in a letter.Ultimately, the FBI found an alternative solution to get the information needed: it paid around $1 million to hack that iPhone.Anyone, including law enforcement, can buy hacking tools to break into phones and computers.But, as witnessed in the case of the iPhone hack, these tools can be expensive.Security experts believe the Texas shooting case is different.There is no suggestion of co-conspirators and it won't end up in court, said Nicholas Weaver, lecturer in the computer science department at UC Berkeley.Weaver said there are other ways for law enforcement to get similar data to what you would get unlocking an iPhone.For example, law enforcement can compel Apple to provide iCloud backups of information stored on the phone and disable the remote wipe feature.Tech companies such as Facebook (FB, Tech30) and Twitter (TWTR, Tech30) can also provide chat logs or other information when compelled by law enforcement.Further, cell phone providers can hand over data related to location and with whom a criminal is exchanging texts.Law enforcement can also get information from message recipients.Another workaround: If someone backs up a phone to a computer, it's possible to get the data from the computer instead.Weaver said computers tend to be weaker in terms of preventing analysis without a password.Apple said the company works with law enforcement every day.Its latest transparency report said law enforcement requests range from asking for information about stolen credit cards to account purchase history.The report also revealed law enforcement submitted 4,479 device-based requests and 1,692 account requests from Apple during the first half of 2017.The company provided data 80% of the time for device requests and and 84% for account inquiries.During the same time frame, Twitter received 2,111 account information requests from the U.S. government and turned over at least some information 77% of the time."We offer training to thousands of agents so they understand our devices and how they can quickly request information from Apple," the company said in a statement.
Ford workers are testing out exoskeletons to help reduce injuries:::::Ford factory workers are getting a lift -- literally.The automaker is testing out new exoskeletons at two Michigan assembly plants, designed to help employees avoid fatigue and injuries while working on the line.The devices, which cost about $6,000 apiece, provide upper-body support for overhead work.They aren't electrically powered -- instead, they help shift the body's weight to make repetitive tasks more comfortable.Superhero fans should note that the exoskeletons aren't Iron Man suits.They "aren't designed to make you stronger," said Marty Smets, senior ergonomics engineer with Ford.Instead, Smets said, they move some weight to a worker's legs, relieving pressure on the shoulders."The shoulder is an inherently weak joint," Smets said.Plus, he added, fixing shoulder injuries gets incredibly expensive.The United Automobile Workers union is in support of the new initiative, and the group subsidized the purchase of the first few exoskeletons, according to Ford.Related: Navya unveils its self-driving taxi "The health and safety of our membership has always been our highest priority," UAW-Ford Vice President Jimmy Settles said in a statement."With the proven success at the piloted locations, we look forward to expanding this technology to our other UAW-Ford manufacturing facilities."The move is the latest effort by Ford (F) to reduce workplace injuries.Incidents in North America that resulted in time away from the job have fallen 83% since 2005.Its 2016 incident rate -- 1.55 incidents per 100 full-time North American employees -- was a record low, according to the company.The 2016 rate for private employers in the U.S. is 2.9 cases per 100 full-time workers, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Alibaba Singles Day sales hit $1 billion in just 2 minutes:::::The biggest shopping day of the year is off to a fast start.It took just two minutes and one second for e-commerce giant Alibaba (BABA, Tech30) to hit $1 billion in sales for Singles Day, China's annual online shopping extravaganza, the company said Saturday.Alibaba's sales topped $10 billion after an hour and six minutes.Singles Day takes place each year on November 11.It started as an informal holiday, sometimes dubbed an anti-Valentine's Day, intended to celebrate those not in relationships.Alibaba began using the day for product discounts in 2009.The company has since turned it into a global event with discounted products and celebrity appearances.Think Black Friday, but even more staggering.Related: The jaw-dropping numbers behind China's Singles Day Alibaba kicked off this year with gala featuring a mix of Chinese and American stars, including musician Pharrell Williams, actress Nicole Kidman and tennis player Maria Sharapova."Alibaba's Singles Day shopping event no doubt will hit another record in sales this year as the Chinese online giant has expanded it to a 24-day shopping and entertainment bonanza," Andria Cheng, an analyst with research firm eMarketer, said in a statement earlier this month.To put this year's sales in perspective, it took Alibaba nearly five minutes (or more than twice as long) to hit $1 billion in sales on Singles Day in 2016.Alibaba's total sales for the day were $17.8 billion last year.
Starbucks adds new holiday drinks, offers 2-for-1 deal:::::Starbucks is kicking off its holiday season by offering two drinks for the price of one.From Thursday through Monday, customers who buy one holiday beverage get a second one free.The offer is valid only from 2-5 p.m. Two new holiday drinks have been added to the Starbucks menu this year, including a toasted white chocolate mocha and a chestnut praline chai tea latte.The Seattle-based beverage giant says the buy one, get one free offer is part of its "Give Good" campaign and encourages customers to share their extra drink with someone.It has used the event to launch its holiday offerings for several years.
How one man says he grosses millions by reselling clearance items online:::::Buy low, sell high.Its a simple idea that a bored accountant used to create a multi-million dollar business, and one that he says you can replicate as a side-hustle.Ryan Grant, a 28 year-old former accountant from Minneapolis, Minnesota, started shopping for sales in popular retail stores.He would beeline for the clearance rack and buy items in bulk.But instead of purchasing what he liked, Grant came armed with a secret weapon: an Amazon seller account and his phone.Grant would find sale items in Walmart, Target and Toys R Us, then used the Amazon seller app to compare them to online prices.ABC Soon, Grant learned the basics of business by buying low, listing on Amazon, selling high and repeating.Using this plan, he left his accountant job and started a part-time gig that he says now generates almost $4 million dollars in revenue.I was able to get that to about $1,000 a month in profit working about 10 hours a week," said Grant, who documents his shopping endeavors on his website, Onlinesellingexperiment.com.Amazon has its own marketplace, not unlike eBay, where businesses and individuals can sell almost anything.The seller app lets users scan a barcode and see the going rate on Amazon.Grant realized that if the price online was 50 percent higher than the price in store, he could net a profit.Since this started as a side-hustle for Grant, I wanted to see what the learning curve was and try it myself.ABC A how-to on buying low, selling high on Amazon.It takes me a total of five minutes to create an Amazon seller account.It ties into your existing Amazon account, so all you really need to add is your Social Security number and bank information.The seller account I signed up for costs $39 a month.I download the seller app to my phone and head to a local superstore.I go straight to the clearance rack and fire up the app.I use the built-in barcode scanner to quickly check prices on all the items.I find a set of Sharpie pens marked down to $10.On Amazon, they are selling for $17.89.I also find a ninja toy marked down to $4 thats $9.49 online, and a set of snow tire chains on clearance for $25 but selling on Amazon for $59.99.Calculating my profit is not exactly simple, so let me try to explain: the app does a good job showing you what you will make after Amazon takes a percentage in fees.My tire chains had a $9 Amazon fee, $1.42 fee on the toy and $2.68 on the pens.ABC The issue of shipping.Since I have a short time-frame for this experiment, I choose mail to sellers directly.It's not terribly cost effective and it takes my total profit down to about $35.Grant, on the other hand, is working at a larger scale--but he says even a part-timer can do this.Grant buys as many of an item as he can and sends it all to an Amazon warehouse.They do the shipping to individual customers.Its what that phrase fulfillment by Amazon means next to an item.It saves him the hassle of shipping, but he factors 50 cents per pound in cost on every item he has to bulk-mail to the Amazon warehouse.Individual sellers like me can mail directly to customers, but theres a lot of postage costs that Amazon can even out at its scale.Its this fulfillment by Amazon that Grant says makes the business viable in ways it wasnt in the past by using eBay or Craigslist.ABC Grant's advice for profiting big.Grant says hes on track to gross nearly $4 million in total sales this year.He pays 11 employees including himself, and his salary is $60,000 a year.He says the company nets a profit of about 10 to 15 percent, but he is reinvesting that back into the business to grow it.ABCNews.com When asked if he thinks this is a viable side-hustle, he says, "Yes, but give yourself a few months to learn."Grant also noted that it takes one to two months to figure out a system, understand what sells and find good sale items.As for his two worst purchases along the learning curve: a Dremel-like dog nail trimmer and life-size Elsa dolls.But for a man whos figured out how to get paid to bargain hunt, it seems like they are lessons well learned.
Equifax apologizes again, lays out costs going forward:::::A day after posting sizeable profit declines due to a massive data breach, Equifax said it expects to incur related costs of between $60 million and $75 million in the current quarter.The Atlanta company reported a 27 percent slump in third-quarter profit, largely due to a hack that exposed the personal information of 145 million Americans.Opening a conference call Friday, interim CEO Paulino do Rego Barros Jr. apologized again for the breach, and said executives will not be receiving bonuses.Richard Smith, who appeared before Congress to explain what happened, stepped down as CEO less than three weeks after the credit report company was hacked.Equifax Inc. is trying to keep clients from fleeing and also outlined ways in which it is strengthening security.It revealed Thursday that, in relation to shares sales by executives in the immediate aftermath of the breach, it has now received subpoenas from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Georgia, where it is based.Word of the subpoenas arrived one week after the company said that an internal review, done by a special committee of independent directors, found that four executives who had sold a combined $1.8 million worth of shares in the immediate aftermath of the breach had done nothing wrong."We have received requests for information and subpoenas for a number of United States and Federal Regulatory Agencies and several regulatory agencies outside the U.S.," Barros said."In each case, we are cooperating with agencies to provide the requested information."The company said Thursday that it had recorded $87.5 million in costs related to the breach in the last quarter.So far, more than 240 class actions have been filed by consumers against Equifax in federal, state and Canadian courts relating to the cybersecurity incident.Various other investigations now surround the data breach and the company.What makes the data breach so dangerous is the information that Equifax holds.Social security numbers, identification, addresses and personal information held by Equifax and the two other, major credit agencies is used to determine a person's creditworthiness."We are also working to monitor for the use of storing personal identifiable information, being used for furthering transactions," Barros said Friday."And to date, we do not have any evidence that we can probably add problem activity to data stolen from Equifax."This story has been corrected to show that Equifax expects to spend up to $75 million, not $75 billion, in the fourth quarter on the data breach.
Bids for used car soar after filmmaker's funny ad goes viral:::::A filmmakers attempt to sell his girlfriends used car by making a spoof ad sent online bids for the car soaring to thousands of dollars above its listed value.Max Lanman created the commercial to sell his girlfriends 1996 Honda Accord, nicknamed Greenie, that has more than 141,000 miles on it.I thought it would be hilarious to make a high-end car commercial for a really junky car, Lanman told ABC News.And she had just the car.ABC Lanmans commercial features sweeping views of cliff-side roads that overlook an ocean but closeups show the cars features, like a cassette player.A woman driving the car with a cat in her lap is also in the video.The voiceovers in the commercial have an aspirational tone but realistic words.This is not a car, this is you, the narrator says.Introducing a used 1996 Honda Accord.A car for people who have life figured out and just need a way to get somewhere.Luxury is a state of mind, according to the tagline of the video, which has more than 4 million views on YouTube.YouTube/Max Lanman The value for the Honda is listed as $1,432 in Kelley Blue Book.Lanman listed the car on eBay for $499 and quickly saw bids soar well beyond that.I mean we had the eBay bid up to $150,000, said Lanman, who posted the commercial on YouTube on Nov. 2.EBay canceled Lanmans listing due to concerns around illegitimate bidding, the company told ABC News."We've since worked with Mr. Lanman to re-list the item and we've put additional measures in place to ensure a successful auction," eBay said in a statement."Mr. Lanman is a talented filmmaker and we're pleased that the eBay platform brought us together.We're hoping to work on some creative video projects with him in the future."YouTube/Max Lanman Lanman's listing is now back up and running with a current bid of $4,300.After making the commercial, Lanman and his girlfriend got engaged.I don't know if it made her fall deeply in love with me, but the process definitely tested our strength, he said.Not all car sellers have Lanmans filmmaking skills.Kelley Blue Book executive publisher Karl Brauer shared with ABC News his three tips for getting the best price for your car, even without a viral commercial.1) Know your car's value: "You don't want to sell your car and find out later that you gave it away."2) Wash the car's windows and clean the interior: "Windows are key.You look out the window and it's this clean unobstructed view.It can psychologically make the car feel much newer."3) Treat the car's photo like a dating app profile photo: "Make this car look beautiful and then the other [cars] on the list, they're the uglier people."

How people are reacting to Amazon's new in-home delivery service Video:::::Transcript for How people are reacting to Amazon's new in-home delivery service We move on and take a closer look at Amazon service that delivers inside your home even when you're not home.Customers tried it out and Becky Worley is in San Francisco with what we're hearing about how it works.Hey, Becky.Reporter: Good morning, George.So far we're looking at a self-selecting trial of who's trying this Amazon key service, the folks who fear security issues, they haven't signed up but for those who choose convenience over privacy, this is an experiment in progress.Thanks.This is the optimal way to receive a package.This, less optimal.Why?Porch pirates.Thieves who steal packages from your doorstep.It happened to Jennifer Henry novich.It feels like an invasion of privacy.Reporter: It led her to test out Amazon key, the new unlock the front door and put the package right in your house delivery service.It just rolled out for prime members in 37 cities.You need some special equipment, a wi-fi connected lock.And this Amazon camera connected to the cloud.Does that make you feel uncomfortable at all it's recording in your home?It is only recording in your home when the delivery is going on.Reporter: Once installed -- You just get a notification the driver can coming.Reporter: Then live video of the delivery.Did it feel weird someone was walking into your house?You know, a little bit but at the same time not really because it was so fast.Reporter: When a delivery happens during our visit.There it is.Pushes it in and relocks the lock.Reporter: While Jennifer is all in, many are hesitant.Everybody kind of panicked.I think there's something about the idea of letting a delivery person into your home without any intervention from you that just instinctively terrifies people.Reporter: Amazon counters saying all its delivery people have been background checked and vetted.Amazon has been careful if how the system works and becomes part of every moment of your life that involves going in and out of your house which is a pretty powerful place to be.A big issue here is pets making sure they don't escape or bite.The delivery guy told me he scouts for pets before opening the door and he often uses the package to block any escape routes.I mean try this in my house and would walk out with a chihuahua clinging to your pants by it's teeth.I don't know if those attacks are covered by my insurance but will find out before getting Amazon key.Our house would be dachshund attacks so I feel your pain.Thank you, Becky.This transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.
Man says he's grossing millions reselling clearance items from Walmart on Amazon Video:::::Transcript for Man says he's grossing millions reselling clearance items from Walmart on Amazon We have a surprising story about a man who turned what he called his side hustle reselling items from clearance racks into a successful company.Becky Worley has his secrets.She's going to tell them now.Reporter: Buy sale items and sell them at a profit but one savvy shopper turned that straightforward idea into big business and he says, you can too.This is Ryan grant.Former job accountant.I would say about six months into that job I realized this wasn't the path for me.Reporter: But he learned the basics of business, buy low, sell high.And with that idea started a part-time job that he says now generates almost $4 million in revenue.The 28-year-old who lives in Minneapolis found sale items in Walmart, target, toys "R" us then used the Amazon seller app to compare them to online prices.He'd buy low, list on Amazon, sell high and repeat.I was able to get that to about a thousand dollars a month in profit working about ten hours a week.Reporter: That made him confident enough to quit his accounting job.Now he says he has a warehouse full of boxes, a staff of 11 people and he says you can do it too.Okay.Let's try it.I've already installed the Amazon seller app.It took me like five minutes online.So now all I have to do is go into the store, find some clearance items and then take them home and sell them online hopefully at a profit.Sure enough, I fire up the Amazon seller app and then it has this camera.Using that I scan the bar code for this toy that cost 4 dis here in the store.Online it's selling for $9.49.That's a profit.These pens, buy it for $10, sell it online and make over $5 profit.Finally tire chains.$25 in store, but listed online for $59.Even after I take into account Amazon fees and shipping costs, I profit about $15.After a few months of learning what sells and how to factor in those shipping costs, Ryan thinks you could make $1,000 to $2,000 doing this part time.I do think it's something anyone can do if you're willing to put in the work.Ryan says he's making about 15% profit on sales of roughly $4 million.He only pays himself 60,000 in salary but I see how you could make money in this.I listed my items right from my phone.It took me 60 seconds per thing I'm selling.I tan to make 35 bucks in profit in my little small-scale test.It's not 4 million but it's a start.No, but it's something.Now, I guess it's this app must make all the difference.We've had craigslist and Ebay and people didn't seem to do it.It's all about that phrase you've read before fulfillment by Amazon.He buys in bulk and males everything to an Amazon warehouse.They deal with all the shipping to customers.Ebay and craigslist doesn't do that.This transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.

seriously.I take it seriously.I called a good friend, Michael J.Fox, Mike fox who's like -- yeah So I was so puffed up.At first I called my mom.She's like oh, my god.My son is finally going to be a doctor.My Irish immigrant mom.Big move and Mike, I said you're not going to believe this.I'm going to be a doctor.He said, welcome to the club.I go, what do you mean.Mike didn't even finish high school, okay.He was on "Family ties" when he was like 16.He said, I have eight doctorates because they just hand them out to famous people.Great.We'll get you another one.Now I'm upset.Spreeing of handing things out, no, but I'm going to give you a fruitcake.What do you think about that?I'll tell you what I think -- don't applaud.Please.This is -- I just want to say something about fruitcake.I'm Irish.I had aunts that used to make these things and I play hockey.They last longer than hockey.These are not food.You can throw this at somebody in an argument and hurt them, okay.This is the most thoughtless gift you could give to a person.This is like walking outside and going, hey, a rock, let me give it to robin.Merry Christmas.That was -- you just proved the point, fruitcakes are known as the most thoughtless gift.Horrible and have you ever tasted one.No, I have not.Just once.I have not.They're horrible.No, no.The reason I'm talking about this, target is actually trying to combat people receiving gifts they don't like and saying a feature called gift now, sends an e-mail to your recipient.They can either accept the gift you've chosen for them whether it be a fruitcake or choose an entirely different gift.What do you think about that?Before they ship it you can say, no, thanks, I don't want to fruitcake I'll take socks.I think it's brilliant.I'm tired of my kid, adult, 27 and 25.I know it's a cliche when they say what do you want.I say, this rancwrench.Then they buy me sog I don't want and don't get the socks or wrench.So now you can change it.I do like it.I think it's good.Is it already up and running for the holidays?But Dr. Denis Leary, this is his new book out right now and, you know what, we have been -- Can we say the title.You can say it.We can't say all of it.So I'll say it.So you won't get in trouble.Look, we blocked it out, the last word.It's called "Why we don't suck."Hang on and how all of us need to stop being such partisan little -- rhymes with stitches.What are you doing here?I can see it's on the book.Are you blurring it out.Blurring it out right there.You did start with a warning.I start the book with a warning.Listen, here's how I wrote the book because I -- I voted for Hillary Clinton but I didn't want to, okay.I thought she was a terrible candidate.They don't know what to clap for.[ Laughter That's like, Donald Trump, I didn't vote for Donald Trump obviously.I knew Donald Trump.He did a cameo on an ABC sitcom I did years ago called "The job."He also did a tinge on "The apprentice" for my foundation.He was a nice guy.He was generous.He was on time.He knew his lines when he had them memorized but he was a different color.He was white.He was actually -- he made me look like I was a dark skinned person.He was so white so it was a different guy.But he -- whatever you want to say about trump, he has changed the game.So after the election I did -- I do this concert every year for the cancer foundation at T.D.Garden.This year it's November 18th.Yeah.So four days after the election, I did a concert and what I basically did was go up and stage and vent against Hillary and against trump and the audience was explosive so people -- I could tell they had -- half voted for Hillary and half voted for trump so to me I thought I got to write ray book about it because it got more and more divisive and nothing is getting done.So in trump's world which he's changed the game, celebrities can now become president so I think we have to look at it that's why I said George 2020.Weed to to stop -- yeah, let's change the process.I want to have -- talk about so you think you can dance or "Dancing with the stars" we should have a reality show to elect the next president.Someone said we already did that.Right.I mean, because the debates suck.We don't learn anything at the debates so I say you have a 13-week reality show called "President idol" as Howard Stern was calling it or I call it "America's got leaders."Four celebrity judge answer have all these people that want to run for 1 week, give them tanks, make them dance, sing, whatever you want to do and on November 2nd or 7th we vote by phone.That's it.No electric tort college.That's it.The winner is the winner.I mean I think that's the future, you know.Something to think about.It's so scary.Nick lachey would be a great presidential candidate on that show.I'm telling you.Justin Timberlake could be president.I think we need a woman.I want Oprah.Yay.There we go.I want Oprah.There you go.Because --S if.Oprah would be so great because you know every three weeks she'd give us free stuff.You know what I mean.That wouldn't suck.That would be great.That would be awesome.So anyway the book is about -- it starts with the election and just want to remind I'm out to make people laugh their asses off but I want to talk about racism.All the stuff that was so divisive that's still happening, racism and sexism and all that stuff and make people laugh about how twisted we have been in the last couple of years.And that we don't suck.And we don't suck?That is nice and remind ourselves how great of a country we are and like my democratic friends have lost their sense of humor.My Republican friends have lost their sense of humor and nothing is getting done.Look at the carvilles.No, no, no.You don't want me to be president.I'd be impeached within four months.All I would do can just a free beer for everybody.No fruitcake.No fruitcake.No fruitcake.But you can doesn't "Why we don't suck," it's out today.Out today.Are we done?This transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.

Mattel stock soars on report of Hasbro takeover offer:::::Shares of Mattel soared in after-hours trading Friday after a report that rival Hasbro has made a takeover offer for Mattel.Such a deal could bring together well-known brands like Monopoly, Nerf, Barbie and Hot Wheels.The Wall Street Journal, citing people familiar with the matter that it did not identify, said Hasbro approached Mattel recently about a deal.Hasbro said it does not comment on "rumors or speculation."Mattel did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Toy companies, including Hasbro and Mattel, have had trouble selling their toys to today's kids, many of whom would rather play with a tablet.Revenue at El Segundo, California-based Mattel has fallen every year since 2013, and its stock has lost nearly half its value since the beginning of the year.Hasbro, based in Pawtucket, Rhode Island, has fared better after it took over the rights from Mattel for Disney's "Princess" and "Frozen" dolls in late 2014.Hasbro's stock is up 18 percent this year, and the company has a market value of $11 billion more than twice as much as Mattel.Both companies took a hit when Toys R Us filed for bankruptcy protection in September.Hasbro and Mattel said that they temporarily reduced shipments to the toy store operator ahead of the bankruptcy filing, but said they were working with the retailer to get their toys on its shelves during the holiday season.Shares of Mattel Inc. rose $3.38, or 23 percent, to $18 in extended trading.Hasbro Inc. shares rose $2.55, or 2.8 percent, to $94.
Equifax apologizes again, lays out costs going forward:::::A day after posting sizeable profit declines due to a massive data breach, Equifax said it expects to incur related costs of between $60 million and $75 million in the current quarter.The Atlanta company reported a 27 percent slump in third-quarter profit, largely due to a hack that exposed the personal information of 145 million Americans.Opening a conference call Friday, interim CEO Paulino do Rego Barros Jr. apologized again for the breach, and said executives will not be receiving bonuses.Richard Smith, who appeared before Congress to explain what happened, stepped down as CEO less than three weeks after the credit report company was hacked.Equifax Inc. is trying to keep clients from fleeing and also outlined ways in which it is strengthening security.It revealed Thursday that, in relation to shares sales by executives in the immediate aftermath of the breach, it has now received subpoenas from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Georgia, where it is based.Word of the subpoenas arrived one week after the company said that an internal review, done by a special committee of independent directors, found that four executives who had sold a combined $1.8 million worth of shares in the immediate aftermath of the breach had done nothing wrong."We have received requests for information and subpoenas for a number of United States and Federal Regulatory Agencies and several regulatory agencies outside the U.S.," Barros said."In each case, we are cooperating with agencies to provide the requested information."The company said Thursday that it had recorded $87.5 million in costs related to the breach in the last quarter.So far, more than 240 class actions have been filed by consumers against Equifax in federal, state and Canadian courts relating to the cybersecurity incident.Various other investigations now surround the data breach and the company.What makes the data breach so dangerous is the information that Equifax holds.Social security numbers, identification, addresses and personal information held by Equifax and the two other, major credit agencies is used to determine a person's creditworthiness."We are also working to monitor for the use of storing personal identifiable information, being used for furthering transactions," Barros said Friday."And to date, we do not have any evidence that we can probably add problem activity to data stolen from Equifax."This story has been corrected to show that Equifax expects to spend up to $75 million, not $75 billion, in the fourth quarter on the data breach.
Business Highlights:::::___ Tax split between House, Senate poses a big challenge WASHINGTON (AP) The House and Senate tax overhaul plans are broadly similar, but crucial differences are creating headaches for Republican leaders.They're determined to keep myriad interest groups and factions of the GOP satisfied.And then there's the ambitious timetable of finishing in time to get legislation to President Donald Trump by Christmas.GOP test: Expiring tax cuts would mean little bang for buck WASHINGTON (AP) Most economists say temporary tax cuts would swell the national debt while doing little for economic growth.And without faster economic growth, few individuals would stand to benefit from the pay raises and job gains being promised by President Donald Trump and Republican congressional leaders.Talking tough on trade, Trump pushes 'America first' in Asia DANANG, Vietnam (AP) President Donald Trump is delivering a roaring "America first" message before a summit of Asian leaders keen on regional trade pacts.And he's denouncing China for unfair trade practices just a day after he had heaped praise on President Xi Jinping in Beijing.Trump tells CEOs on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation conference that he's "not going to let the United States be taken advantage of anymore."The gaping US trade gap: A sign of weakness?Not necessarily WASHINGTON (AP) Economists say President Donald Trump's obsession over America's trade deficits is misplaced.A big trade gap by itself doesn't make the U.S. an economic weakling.In fact, a swollen trade gap which shows how much the value of imports exceeds the value of exports can reflect economic might: When times are good, after all, consumers feel more prosperous and confident enough to spend freely on imported goods as well as on home-grown goods.Alaska lawmaker sees financial boon in refuge drilling WASHINGTON (AP) Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski says her legislation to open Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil and gas drilling would generate $2 billion in royalties over the next decade with half the money going to her home state.But environmental groups and other critics call those projections wildly optimistic.A fiscal watchdog says drilling is likely to generate about $100 million for U.S. taxpayers one-tenth the amount Murkowski and the Congressional Budget Office predict.Accord on revised Pacific Rim trade pact stalled DANANG, Vietnam (AP) Talks on a Pacific Rim trade pact abandoned by President Donald Trump appear to have stalled.Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said Friday that leaders of the 11 countries still in the Trans-Pacific Partnership had to postpone a meeting meant to endorse a basic agreement.Abe made the comments after meeting with his Canadian counterpart, Justin Trudeau, who stayed away from the TPP leaders' gathering at a summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.Climate activists stage protest at German coal-fired plant BONN, Germany (AP) Environmental activists protested at a German coal-fired power plant on Friday the same day that Italy became the latest country to announce a deadline for ending its use of the heavily polluting fossil fuel.Protesters projected images of Pacific islanders threatened by climate change onto the cooling tower of the lignite-fuelled power station in Neurath, in western Germany, along with the words "coal destroys our future."Equifax apologizes again, lays out costs going forward NEW YORK (AP) A day after posting sizeable profit declines due to a massive data breach, Equifax says it expects to incur related costs of between $60 million and $75 million in the current quarter.Opening a conference call Friday, interim CEO Paulino do Rego Barros Jr. apologized again for the breach, and said executives will not be receiving bonuses.China to ease curbs on foreign business in finance, autos BEIJING (AP) China has taken what it calls a major step toward opening its financial industry with a promise to ease limits on foreign ownership of banks and securities firms following a visit by U.S. President Donald Trump that was dominated by trade issues.The announcement by a Cabinet official appeared to respond to mounting U.S. and European complaints that Beijing hampers foreign activity in a variety of industries in violation of free-trade commitments.UK panel rules Uber drivers have rights on wages, time off LONDON (AP) A British panel has ruled that Uber drivers are workers with labor rights like paid time off, in a decision with broad implications for the so-called gig economy.The ride-hailing service immediately announced plans to appeal.Employment lawyers expect the case will be heard by the Supreme Court next year.US stocks on two-day losing streak as health stocks fall NEW YORK (AP) US stocks fall for second day as medical device makers take sharp losses.Energy companies give up some of their recent gains, but media companies and retailers rise.Stocks fall for the second day in a row, a first in a month, and end an eight-week winning streak.The Standard & Poor's 500 index lost 2.32 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,582.30.The Dow Jones industrial average slid 39.73 points, or 0.2 percent, to 23,422.21.The Nasdaq composite rose 0.89 of a point to 6,570.94.The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks inched up 0.26 of a point to 1,475.27.U.S. crude oil lost 43 cents to $56.74 a barrel in New York.Brent crude, used to price international oils, gave up 41 cents to $63.52 a barrel in London.Wholesale gasoline gave up 1 cent to $1.81 a gallon.Heating oil lost 1 cent to $1.93 a gallon.Natural gas rose 1 cent to $3.21 per 1,000 cubic feet.
US stocks on two-day losing streak as health stocks fall:::::So that's what a losing streak feels like.Stocks fell for the second day in a row Friday, which hadn't happened in a month, as Amazon put a scare into yet another industry: medical device and health care equipment companies.Those companies slumped after an analyst for Citi Investment Research said Amazon might be on the verge of shaking up their industry by speeding up distribution and cutting prices.Energy companies gave up some of their recent gains while retailers, media companies and household goods companies moved higher.Stocks finished the week with small losses, ending an eight-week winning streak.One factor in those losses was uncertainty over the Republican plan to cut taxes.Stocks dipped Thursday after Senate Republicans proposed leaving corporate tax rates alone in 2018 before cutting them in 2019.That surprised investors, who pulled stocks down slightly from their recent record highs."We would expect a little bit more of that as we get more delays and uncertainty in the tax plan," said Sean Lynch, the co-head of global equity strategy for Wells Fargo Investment Institute.Lynch said an eventual tax cut for companies, and for at least some individuals, would give investors "a dose of confidence" that company earnings will grow a bit faster and the economy and stock market will rise for a bit longer.The Standard & Poor's 500 index lost 2.32 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,582.30.The Dow Jones industrial average slid 39.73 points, or 0.2 percent, to 23,422.21.The Nasdaq composite turned higher and rose 0.89 points to 6,750.94.The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks inched up 0.26 points to 1,475.27.The S&P 500 set an all-time high on Wednesday, but finished the week down 0.2 percent.The index had gained five percent over its winning streak, the longest in almost four years.The Russell 2000, which is comprised of smaller companies that might benefit more from a corporate tax cut, fell 1.3 percent this week.That was its largest loss in three months.Citi Investment Research analyst Amit Hazan wrote Friday that Amazon is making quick progress in the medical supply field and could soon start distributing goods to hospitals, as some organizations appear interested in working with the online retail giant."New online distribution/wholesaling models like Amazon's will come to dominate the supply chain" in coming years, Hazan said.Baxter International, which sells intravenous pumps and other hospital equipment, fell $1.35, or 2.1 percent, to $64.04.Becton, Dickinson dipped $5.25, or 2.3 percent, to $219.23.Medical device maker Medtronic slid $1.48, or 1.8 percent, to $79.33.Competition with Amazon has hurt retailers for years and the online giant has also pressured supermarkets and grocery stores with its purchase of Whole Foods.In recent weeks, health care product companies, medication distributors and drugstores have all fallen as Wall Street wondered what Amazon's logistics expertise and its willingness to slash prices will do to their businesses.Drugstores CVS and Walgreens jumped Friday; investors may be relieved that Amazon could turn its focus to industries they are less involved in.Long-suffering department stores made gains Friday.J.C. Penney advanced 42 cents, or 15.3 percent, to $3.17 after it said a closely-watched sales measurement grew for the first time in more than a year.The company also took a smaller quarterly loss than analysts had expected.Macy's built on its 11 percent jump a day ago and added another 48 cents, or 2.5 percent, to $19.98.Competitor Kohl's rose $1.87, or 4.5 percent, to $43.04.All of those companies have seen their sales and stocks tumble in large part because of increasing online competition.Walt Disney Co. rose $2.10, or 2 percent, to $104.78 after it said it received bigger payments from cable companies for ESPN and offered more details about its planned sports streaming services.The company also announced plans for a new "Star Wars" film trilogy."Star Wars: The Force Awakens," released in late 2015, grossed about $2 billion and investors have high hopes for next month's "The Last Jedi."U.S. crude oil lost 43 cents to $56.74 a barrel in New York.Brent crude, used to price international oils, gave up 41 cents to $63.52 a barrel in London.Wholesale gasoline gave up 1 cent to $1.81 a gallon.Heating oil lost 1 cent to $1.93 a gallon.Natural gas rose 1 cent to $3.21 per 1,000 cubic feet.Bond prices slumped.The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.38 percent from 2.34 percent.Gold dropped $13.30, or 1 percent, to $1,274.20 an ounce.Silver fell 10 cents to $16.87 an ounce.Copper lost 1 cent to $3.08 a pound.The dollar rose to 113.54 yen from 113.32 yen.The euro fell to $1.1618 from $1.1643.The FTSE 100 index in Britain fell 0.7 percent.The French CAC 40 lost 0.5 percent and the German DAX dipped 0.4 percent.Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index lost 0.8 percent and South Korea's Kospi fell 0.3 percent.In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng dipped less than 0.1 percent.AP Markets Writer Marley Jay can be reached at http://twitter.com/MarleyJayAP His work can be found at https://apnews.com/search/marley%20jayt

Buying and renting: Your biggest financial decision:::::Buying a home is the most significant financial decision in most people's lives.For tenants, paying the rent is the biggest monthly outgoing.So it is little wonder that house prices are an obsession for some, and a source of frustration for others.The financial crisis had huge implications for those wanting to buy or sell property.Here is the story of what has happened to the UK housing market in the past 10 years.1.House prices are rising... or are they?The price of the average UK home has risen in the past 10 years, as you would expect.Prices of goods and services in general, as measured by the Consumer Prices Index measure of inflation, have increased faster.So, in real terms, the average UK house price has fallen compared with a decade ago.2.Price rises or falls depend on where you live The average UK house price masks a massive regional divide.In London, the average property value has risen by nearly 70% in 10 years, whereas in Northern Ireland it has fallen by more than 40%.3.This is not only a story of prices The number of sales was 30% higher 10 years ago, so who is no longer buying?Many people already with a home and a mortgage have chosen to stay put, rather than buy somewhere bigger.Recent tax changes have also cut the numbers of buy-to-let investors.4.The housing ladder's rungs are further apart Look at the difference in price when moving from a three-bedroom home to a four-bedroom one, and it is no surprise that many families have chosen not to move.Many may have spent their money on an extension instead.A lack of four-bedroom family homes on the market has pushed up prices of this type of property.It means the cost of moving to a bigger house has stymied many people's dreams of moving up the housing ladder - perhaps to give the children their own room.5.First-time buyers haven't had it easy Government schemes, such as Help to Buy, mean first-time buyers are still in the game.Despite this assistance, lenders have been much more demanding of young borrowers.Mortgage providers wanted a much bigger initial deposit when they were left reeling by the financial crisis.Those deposit requirements have eased since, but first-time buyers still need some hefty savings, or help from their parents, to secure a home loan.6.Pay has done little to help them Wages have risen slowly, if at all, for most people in the last 10 years.This has made it even tougher for potential buyers in their 20s and 30s to save some of their income.The money has been used to pay the bills, not to fund soaring deposit demands.7.There's been a shift from owning to renting These financial pressures have meant people choosing to rent rather than buy, or to continue as tenants into their 30s and 40s when they might previously have bought a home by then.This has led to some robust debate over the plight of renters in recent years, from lettings agent fees to the length of tenancies.8.The South has the lion's share of property wealth Collectively, London property has the highest value, followed by the South East of England.If you believe that property is always a good investment, then just look at what has happened to the collective value of homes in the North of England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland in the past 10 years.9.Borrowing has been cheap for homeowners Ten years of low interest rates, and rock-bottom home loan rates, have meant that mortgage repayments account for less of a typical homeowner's income than at any time in the past 10 years.The bad news is that it is unlikely to get any cheaper.Policymakers at the Bank of England have put up interest rates, so borrowing on any kind of loan is going to get more expensive.10.Where can I afford to live?Lucian Cook, director of residential research at estate agents Savills, predicts that deposits are likely to stay relatively high compared to incomes in the coming years.Owners will continue to take fewer steps up the housing ladder compared to the past, he adds.This is a result of the stricter regulation following the financial crisis that, he believes, will remain in place for the foreseeable future.The other major factor, looking ahead, is how rising interest rates will "be the next restraint on house price growth", he says, particularly in London.Savills predicts that an average mortgage rate will double to 4% in the next five years.Huge national, regional, and even neighbourhood disparities mean it is well worth checking where you can afford to live in the UK.Our calculator will help you.
Fraudsters jailed for £107m 'cynical' green tax scam:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption High earners were persuaded to invest in projects focused on reforesting areas of Brazil Six men who orchestrated an "audacious and cynical" tax fraud have been jailed for between 11 years and 20 months.They persuaded wealthy people to invest in environmental projects in exchange for tax breaks, but then used the money to fund lavish lifestyles, buying overseas property and luxury holidays.HM Revenue & Customs said it could have lost up to 107m as a result.HMRC's Simon York said the men showed "complete disregard" for the ecological causes they claimed to be supporting."These individuals thought they had worked out the perfect fraud," he said, adding that work had started to recover the proceeds of their crime.'Bare-faced dishonesty' HMRC said the group, led by "self-styled ringleader" and scientist Michael Richards, enticed 730 high earners to invest in research and development projects focused on reforesting areas of Brazil and China.The convictions follow a 10-year investigation by HMRC.Mr Justice Edis said: "It was bare-faced dishonesty and you did everything to inflict loss on the public, the people who pay their taxes, who were also victims."It was utter dishonesty, sophisticated planning and astonishing greed hidden behind a mask of concern for the environment."Richards, 55, from Alfriston, East Sussex, and Robert Gold, 49, from Dubai - who was described in court as the ringleader's "bulldog and negotiator" - were both sentenced to 11 years in prison.Rodney Whiston-Dew, 66, from Greenwich, south-east London, a solicitor and a former president of the Rotary Club of London, was jailed for 10 years.Ex-banker and former music industry executive Evdoros Chrysanthos Demetriou, 78, from Oxford, received six years and Jonathan Anwyl, 44, from Ringmer, East Sussex, described as an environmentalist and business consultant who is the son of retired judge Shirley Anwyl, QC, was sentenced to five and a half years in jail.The five men were all found guilty of conspiracy to cheat the public revenue.The sixth man Malcolm Gold, 73, from St Albans, admitted cheating the public revenue and was sentenced to 20 months in jail in January 2017.
Uber loses court appeal against drivers' rights:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Two Uber drivers take opposing views on how the company should treat them Taxi-hailing app firm Uber has lost an appeal against a ruling that its drivers should be treated as workers rather than self-employed.Last year a tribunal ruled drivers James Farrar and Yaseen Aslam were Uber staff and entitled to holiday pay, paid rest breaks and the minimum wage.Uber appealed, arguing its drivers were self employed and were under no obligation to use its booking app.The firm said it would appeal against this latest ruling, too.Uber which has up to 50,000 drivers using its app in the UK, claims 80% of them would rather be classed as self employed.Uber said there were two further possible stages in the appeal process - the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court.The Employment Tribunal upheld its original decision that any Uber driver who had the Uber app switched on was working for the company under a "worker" contract.Image caption James Farrar is one of the two drivers at the centre of the case It said they were therefore entitled to workers' rights.Uber has faced regulatory and legal setbacks in a host of cities around the world.In London, where it has the bulk of its business, it is fighting to retain its licence to continue operating.'Huge relief' James Farrar, from Hampshire, told the BBC how he was feeling: "Just huge relief.I really hope it will stick this time and that Uber will obey the ruling of the court."I'd like Uber to sit down and work out how as quickly as possible that every driver who is working for Uber get the rights they are entitled to."Image copyright PA How did the Uber case come about?The law firm Leigh Day started the legal action against Uber on behalf of 25 members of the GMB union, which initially included Mr Farrar and Mr Aslam, although the two pursued this latest case with a different union, the IWGB.Leigh Day is still involved in legal action against Uber and represents a total of 68 drivers in a group claim against the company.The company's Nigel Mackay said, in theory, any Uber driver in the UK could benefit from Friday's tribunal ruling, should it stand uncontested: "The judgment directly applies to the original 25 claimants in the claim, and since then another 43 drivers have joined."However, given that all Uber drivers work in essentially the same way, then there is no reason why the same principles wouldn't apply across all drivers in the UK and they would all be free to join the claim and be entitled to compensation."IWGB's general secretary, Dr Jason Moyer-Lee, said: "Today's victory is further proof, as if any more was needed, that the law is clear and these companies are simply choosing to deprive workers of their rights."The GMB union said the ruling, by the Employment Appeal Tribunal (EAT), was a "landmark victory" for workers' rights, especially in the gig economy, a system of casual working which does not commit a business or a worker to set hours or rights.Maria Ludkin, the GMB's legal director, said: "Uber must now face up to its responsibilities and give its workers the rights to which they are entitled."GMB urges the company not to waste everyone's time and money dragging their lost cause to the Supreme Court."Image copyright PA Tom Elvidge, Uber UK's acting general manager, said: "Almost all taxi and private hire drivers have been self-employed for decades, long before our app existed."The main reason why drivers use Uber is because they value the freedom to choose if, when and where they drive and so we intend to appeal."He went on to say that EAT's decision relied on an assertion that drivers were required to take 80% of trips sent to them when logged into the app, but, he said, "as drivers who use Uber know, this has never been the case in the UK".He also said a number of changes had been made to the app over the last year, and that Uber had "invested in things like access to illness and injury cover".
TPP trade deal talks move forward despite Canada wobble:::::Image copyright Reuters Image caption The meeting was held during the Apec summit in Da Nang, Vietnam Members of the Trans-Pacific Partnership have agreed a new framework to revive the proposed trade deal, following the US withdrawal earlier this year.Meeting on the sidelines of the Apec summit in Vietnam, the remaining eleven nations released a joint statement saying they were committed to free and open trade.Canada had been accused of stalling.However its trade minister said good progress has now been made.Franois-Philippe Champagne also denied that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had deliberately skipped a leaders' meeting on the TPP on Friday and blamed his no-show on a scheduling mix-up."There was never an intention not to show up at any meeting," he said.Mr Trudeau said earlier in the week that Canada would not be rushed into a renewed TPP deal.The country's delegation said labour and environmental rights would be crucial pillars of a new agreement, but added that a lot of work still needs to be done.Canadian officials said Canada was not the only country that wanted more time to work through the agreement.Image copyright Reuters Image caption The meeting was held during the Apec summit in Da Nang, Vietnam The other countries working towards an agreement are Australia, Chile, New Zealand, Brunei, Singapore, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, Peru and Vietnam.President Donald Trump withdrew the US from the original 12-nation TPP agreement in January.The bid to revive the TPP, which would have covered 40% of the global economy, was led by trade ministers from Japan, Australia and New Zealand.Moving on without Trump By Jonathan Head, BBC South-East Asia correspondent When President Trump abandoned the TPP it was widely expected that the deal would collapse.It had originally been championed by President Obama, partly as a way of maintaining US influence in the Asia-Pacific region, and the US economy was bigger than that all of the other members combined.The remaining countries are now having to renegotiate the terms of the deal, as access to the huge US market was the prize that persuaded less developed countries, including Vietnam and Peru, to sign up to tough conditions on issues such as labour rights and protection of intellectual property.Canada remains concerned that commitments made could affect any renegotiation of the huge North American Free Trade Agreement, which may be needed if President Trump keeps up his threats to pull out of that deal as well.But the 11 TPP members now say they have enough agreement on what they call the core elements of the trade pact to move ahead, although it is still not clear when it will be finalised.
Christmas ad spend 'to hit record high':::::Image copyright John Lewis Image caption The latest John Lewis campaign focuses on a little boy and his friendship with an imaginary monster Brands will be spending a record 6bn on Christmas advertising in 2017, according to an industry body forecast.The Advertising Association says it is being driven by intense market competition, especially within the retail sector, and the rise of big-budget campaigns.It believes spending on ads has jumped nearly 40% in just seven years.The figures come as campaigns by major retailers such as John Lewis, M&S and Asda get under way."There have been so many blockbuster campaigns over the last 10 years," says Karen Fraser, director of Credos, a think tank which compiled the forecast with the Advertising Association.John Lewis' Christmas ads have become particularly anticipated by the public and advertisers in recent years.A recurring theme in John Lewis adverts has been to take out branding and centre on stories to grab people's attention.Their latest campaign - launched this week - focuses on the tale of a little boy and his friendship with an imaginary monster living under his bed.Rival Marks and Spencer has launched an advert featuring Paddington Bear stumbling across a burglar he mistakes for Father Christmas.Image copyright Marks and Spencer Image caption Marks and Spencer's ad has Paddington handing out a marmalade sandwich Meanwhile, Asda's ad follows a girl and her grandfather visiting a festive food factory.Upping the ante Among a survey of 1,000 Brits interviewed on behalf of the Advertising Association, nearly half said they had been moved to tears by Christmas ads they'd seen.One in six also said they have changed plans to watch the premiere of their favourite Christmas ad."It's just upped the ante," adds Karen Fraser, "and so many brands and retailers are looking to compete in that market but it means that everyone needs to work harder to get people's attention."Image copyright Asda Image caption Asda's advert features an imaginary creative workshop - the Imaginarium Latest figures from the Office for National Statistics show that purchasing from retailers - traditionally the biggest investor in Christmas advertising - has increased.Prices of consumer goods have also undergone their highest year-on-year growth since March 2012 at 3.3%, meaning shops are facing an uphill struggle to attract consumers as real wages fall."A lot of businesses don't have much of an option other than to go for it," says Craig Mawdsley, chief strategy officer at advertising agency AMVBBDO."Some brands get to grow, but most are trying to offset the growth of others".
Savings: More banks fail to pass on rate rise in full:::::Image copyright Getty Images Three more banks have failed to pass on the full rise in base rates to savers, despite pleas from Number 10 and the Bank of England.Royal Bank of Scotland, NatWest and Tesco Bank have announced their savings rates will rise by 0.2% or less.That is despite last week's rise in base rates from 0.25% to 0.5%.Both the governor of the Bank of England and a spokesperson for Number 10 have urged banks to pass on the benefits to savers.The Royal Bank of Scotland group - which includes NatWest - said "the majority" of its accounts would pay more, with the average rise being 0.2%.However, it would not say whether the 0.01% rate on its Instant Saver account would see any increase.By contrast, the bank is increasing mortgage rates by almost the full amount.Borrowers with Standard Variable Rate (SVR) mortgages will have to pay an extra 0.24% from 1 December.Image copyright Getty Images Tesco Bank announced that it would increase its savings rates by 0.15%.However, at the same time it said it would only increase the rate on its SVR mortgages by the same amount."We believe our approach of increasing rates for both savers and mortgage holders is equitable and fair in balancing the interests of customers," said Benny Higgins, the chief executive of Tesco Bank.About 20 providers out of 150 have so far passed on rate increases to savers, but many have not passed on the full amount.Others are still waiting to make a decision.
Broadband and landline users to get automatic compensation:::::Image copyright BT Householders who receive poor service from their telecoms provider are to get automatic compensation, the regulator Ofcom has announced.From 2019 they will get 8 a day if a fault is not fixed, paid as a refund through their bill.This is less than the 10 that was proposed when Ofcom began its consultation earlier this year.Providers will also have to pay 5 a day if their broadband or landline is not working on the day it was promised.If an engineer misses an appointment, they will have to give 25 in compensation.Ofcom has estimated as many as 2.6 million people could benefit from the new rules.142m pay-outs The agreement covers consumers who have contracts with BT, Sky, Talk Talk, Virgin Media and Zen Internet - which make up around 90% of telecoms customers in the UK.Plusnet and EE are expected to join the scheme at a later date.How compensation will work Image copyright Getty Images Consumers will have to phone up to complain initially Service not working, and not fixed after two days: 8 compensation a day Missed engineer appointment, or less than 24 hours notice of cancellation: 25 for each appointment Delayed starting date: 5 a day "Waiting too long for your landline or broadband to be fixed is frustrating enough, without having to fight for compensation," said Lindsey Fussell, Ofcom's consumer group director."So providers will have to pay money back automatically, whenever repairs or installations don't happen on time, or an engineer doesn't turn up."People will get the money they deserve, while providers will want to work harder to improve their service."Ofcom said the scheme would not come in to operation until early 2019, because of the complexity of the changes.It said that billing systems and online accounts would need to be altered, and staff would need to be re-trained.Help In total, customers can expect to get 142m in pay-outs every year, according to Ofcom's estimates.At the moment telecoms users can get compensation in theory, but only around 15% of those who complain manage to get a refund.Even then most only get small amounts, said Ofcom.Anyone wanting to obtain compensation under the current arrangements can find help on the Ofcom website.Which?said that those providers who have not already joined the automatic compensation scheme should do so.
New Star Wars trilogy raises Disney hopes:::::Image copyright Getty Images Walt Disney has announced a deal to make three new Star Wars movies.The company said it had struck a deal with Rian Johnson, director of the upcoming "Star Wars: The Last Jedi", to create a new trilogy of the science fiction blockbuster.Disney is also working on a live-action Star Wars series for a new online streaming service.The news overshadowed Disney's first drop in annual profits since 2009, amid steep competition from online rivals.Profits for the year to September fell 4% to $8.98bn (6.8bn).Disney's shares fell initially in after-hours trading on the release of its results, but they then rallied to 1% higher on news of the new Star Wars movies.Chief executive Bob Iger said: "We remain optimistic about our future, in part because quality truly does matter."The entertainment giant also plans to launch a sports-focused ESPN+ app in the spring, and a Disney streaming service in 2019.Mr Iger said those investments, which add to an existing Disney subscription service in Europe, were "vital" to the firm's future."Our goal here is to be a viable player in the direct-to-consumer space, a space that we all know is a very compelling space to be in," he said.He declined to address reports that the company had held talks with 21st Century Fox about acquiring parts of its business, but he did not rule out an acquisition."I don't think there's ever such a thing as having too much quality."Under pressure Disney is grappling with a challenge from online video, which has won viewers of traditional television and movies and is driving a shift away from cable television.In the fourth quarter of Disney's financial year, covering the three months to the end of September, profits dipped 1% to $1.7bn.Quarterly revenues fell 3% to $12.8bn as the impact of hurricanes, lower advertising revenue and a decline in cable subscriptions weighed on the results.Revenue in its movie division sank 21%, which Disney said was due to a tough comparison with last year, when a new Star Wars movie lifted results.Disney's parks and resorts business, which has steadied results in recent quarters, was the only division that reported year-on-year revenue growth in the quarter, rising 6%.But even that unit was affected by the hurricanes that struck the US earlier this year.Disney said that accounted for a roughly 3% decline in US attendance.

LSE shareholders win vote on chairman's future:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption LSE chief executive Xavier Rolet (L) and chairman Donald Brydon (R) Shareholders in the London Stock Exchange (LSE) will vote on whether to eject its chairman and keep its chief executive following investor pressure.The LSE confirmed it would hold an extraordinary general meeting following a request from The Children's Investment Fund Management (TCI), which owns more than 5% of the LSE.The fund is seeking the removal of chairman Donald Brydon.It wants Xavier Rolet, due to leave next year, to remain as the LSE's boss.The LSE has 21 days to send a notice to shareholders about a meeting.It then has 28 days from the date the notice is sent to hold the extraordinary general meeting.Mr Brydon has been under increasing pressure regarding the departure of Mr Rolet amid claims that the chief executive is being forced out.The LSE announced in October that Mr Rolet would step down next year and that it was beginning a search for his successor.However, Christopher Hohn, the investment manager of TCI, claims that Mr Rolet is being forced to leave the company he has led for nine years.In a letter to Mr Brydon, Mr Hohn wrote: "You have failed to provide shareholders with any substantive basis for the removal of the chief executive."On Friday, the LSE confirmed that it had received a notice from TCI seeking an extraordinary general meeting.TCI wants Mr Brydon to be removed from office "with immediate effect".It also wants a vote on terminating the search for a new chief executive and, subject to Mr Rolet's consent, permit him to remain in his post until 2021.
Fed policymaker sees further rate rises:::::Image copyright Reuters US interest rates are likely to rise again next month and a further three times next year, one of the Federal Reserve's rate-setters has said.John Williams, who sits on the Fed's Open Markets Committee, said a rate rise in December "makes sense, at least based on the information I have today".He also told the BBC he was "pencilling in" three further increases next year, as interest rates returned gradually to "a normal level" of about 2.5%.The key rate target is now 1% to 1.25%.That's the highest level since 2008, when policymakers cut rates to encourage borrowing and spending after the financial crisis.The Fed raised interest rates for the first time since the crisis in December 2015.Policymakers acted in December 2016 and again in March and June this year.Stimulus problems Mr Williams said that central bankers globally faced new problems."Due to fundamental shifts in demographics and slower growth," he said, "the new normal for interest rates is likely to be much lower in the future than in the past."He added: "I think this is going to be the big challenge for us going forward - how to operate monetary policy effectively when the normal or average interest rate is 2.5 to 3%."During a recession, the typical response of a central bank like the Fed would be to cut interest rates by five percentage points to stimulate the economy."Well, if you're starting from 2.5 or 3%, you obviously don't have as much manoeuvring room to give the economy a boost."'More continuity' Mr Williams said Janet Yellen had done a "fantastic job" as Fed chair "during a very difficult period of time".He said he expected her successor, Jerome Powell, who takes over in February next year, to continue "making sure that we have a strong consensus around our policy decisions and strategy"."From my own perspective, I think there will be more continuity than differences in terms of the approach to policy."On banking regulation, Mr Williams added: "I do think there's areas where many people in the Fed think that we can adjust the approach around supervision regulation of especially smaller or medium-sized banks in ways that will not risk financial stability issues or things like that, but maybe are positive for the economy."
UK industrial output jumps in September:::::Image copyright Getty Images The UK's industrial output grew at its fastest pace so far this year in September, according to official figures.Production rose by 0.7% compared with the month before, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said, boosted by machinery and equipment output.Separate data showed the UK's trade deficit in goods and services narrowed by more than expected in September.However, construction output fell by 1.6% in the month, the ONS said.'Mixed' outlook The increase in industrial production was better than analysts' forecasts, and the fastest growth seen since December last year.Manufacturing output - a subset of industrial output - also rose by 0.7% in September."Industrial production has risen for six consecutive months, a feat last achieved 23 years ago," said Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.However, he added that the recovery in manufacturing output could be hit by recent rises in the oil price.Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club, said the outlook for manufacturing appeared "mixed".Domestic conditions looked "challenging despite recent decent demand", he said."Increased prices for capital goods and big-ticket consumer durable goods, weakened consumer purchasing power, and economic and political uncertainty threaten to hamper manufacturers."On the export side, a very competitive pound and healthy global demand are helping UK manufacturers competing in foreign markets.The weakened pound also appears to be encouraging some companies to switch to domestic sources for supplies."Image copyright Getty Images The UK's trade deficit in goods and services narrowed by 0.7bn between August and September 2017 to 2.75bn, mainly due to trade in goods exports increasing by 1.3bn.Despite this, the UK's trade performance during the third quarter as a whole worsened, according to the ONS data.In the three months to September 2017, the total UK trade deficit widened by 3bn to 9.5bn, mainly due to a increased imports, including of machinery, non-monetary gold and fuels.The construction output data was much weaker than expected.As well as the sharp fall in September from August, output was only up 1.1% from a year earlier - the weakest annual rate since March last year.The ONS said the latest economic data did not suggest there would be any change to its initial estimate that the UK economy grew 0.4% in the third quarter of the year.

Paradise Papers: UK millionaires 'using offshore tax avoidance schemes':::::Image caption A Mauritian company owns Mr O'Toole's mansion in Northumberland More than 100 UK millionaires have been identified as tax dodgers after hiding their wealth using offshore schemes.Documents in the Paradise Papers leak show the identities of taxpayers who moved assets worth tens of millions of pounds into companies in Mauritius.The tax avoidance schemes involve them claiming to no longer own property, cash and investments in order to keep their fortunes out of reach of HMRC.It appears many of them use the companies like personal bank accounts.This allows them to continue to enjoy the benefit of their hidden riches.'Gave away fortune' Mark Faulkner and his partner Harriet Logan moved more than 28m in cash and assets to a Mauritian company called Babington PCC.Officially they have given away their fortune, but the Paradise Papers documents show they could still control how cash was spent because they acted as "investment advisers" to Babington.They have advised the offshore company to buy a 3.25m country mansion, properties in London, a brand new Aston Martin, an art collection, a collection of classic photographs and a cellar of vintage wines.Image copyright homemakermagazine.co.uk Image caption Harriet Logan and Mark Faulkner It also owned their holiday home in Florida, funded the upkeep of another holiday home in the south of France, paid for trips to New York and Miami, and spent more than 100,000 a year funding Mr Faulkner's hobby of classic yacht racing.Mr Faulkner, a former banker, and ex-war photographer Ms Logan contributed 1.6m of the offshore money to the "Education Purpose Trust" - which would then fund their four children's entire private education.Mr Faulkner initially denied putting any money into the Mauritian company, but his lawyers later told BBC Panorama that while they did not accept our assertions, they have "now commenced dialogue with HMRC to review the arrangements that their previous advisers had recommended".Investment adviser The tax avoidance schemes were administered by Appleby, the law firm at the centre of the Paradise Papers leak.Image caption The leaked documents show dozens of Britons have moved their wealth into companies based in Mauritius They were set up by James O'Toole, a British lawyer who has made his own fortune by advising the wealthy how to dodge tax.The documents show that Mr O'Toole has personally used a similar type of tax avoidance scheme to his clients.He was an "investment advisor" to a Mauritian company which owns his mansion in Northumberland.He has also not owned two Aston Martins, a BMW, a Range Rover, luxury watches including a Rolex, and a Harley Davidson motorbike - which were all kept at his home.Mr O'Toole even advised his offshore company to use his tax-free cash to pay for his own personal shopper.She was paid tens of thousands of dollars to buy his clothes, shop for groceries, pick up nappies, order limos and suggest Mother's Day presents.Some of the cash came from the huge fees he charges clients.One British couple were charged 960,000 for tax advice by Mr O'Toole's company - 827,000 of that cash was paid straight into the offshore bank account connected to Mr O'Toole's company.Panorama asked Mr O'Toole whether he had declared this income to HMRC.Mr O'Toole's lawyer said the allegations are "ill-judged and unsupported by any relevant evidence".He said Mr O'Toole "prepared a detailed and rigorous rebuttal" but could not comment further.In a statement on the Paradise Papers, Appleby said it was a law firm which operates in jurisdictions regulated to the highest international standards and "advises clients on legitimate and lawful ways to conduct their business".Find out more about the words and phrases found in the Paradise Papers.Your browser does not support this Lookup Your guide to financial jargon Enter your search term The papers are a huge batch of leaked documents mostly from offshore law firm Appleby, along with corporate registries in 19 tax jurisdictions, which reveal the financial dealings of politicians, celebrities, corporate giants and business leaders.The 13.4 million records were passed to German newspaper Sddeutsche Zeitung and then shared with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ).Panorama has led research for the BBC as part of a global investigation involving nearly 100 other media organisations, including the Guardian, in 67 countries.The BBC does not know the identity of the source.Paradise Papers: Full coverage; follow reaction on Twitter using #ParadisePapers; in the BBC News app, follow the tag "Paradise Papers" Watch Panorama on the BBC iPlayer (UK viewers only)
FTSE 100 slides to a six-week low:::::Image copyright Getty Images The UK market has ended the week at its lowest level for six weeks as retail shares continued to lose ground.By the end of the day, the benchmark FTSE 100 share index had lost 51.11 points at 7,432,99.Retail distribution group Bunzl was the biggest faller in the index, down more than 6%, after Morgan Stanley flagged up the risk to the company from Amazon's business-to-business venture.Burberry shares fell again, dropping nearly 3%.On Thursday, shares in the luxury fashion group had sunk 10% after it unveiled plans to move further upmarket.Marks and Spencer fell 1.9% and Primark owner AB Foods lost 1.5% as investors digested a week of downbeat retail news.In the FTSE 250, Ultra Electronics fell more than 11% after the defence firm said a decision on its purchase of US firm Sparton was set to be delayed.Ultra Electronics announced in July it would buy Sparton, which makes anti-submarine devices, for $234m.However, it said in September that the US Department of Justice had asked for more information, and it now expects the department to make a decision at the end of March.On the currency markets, the pound rose 0.5% against the dollar at $1.32090 and was also 0.4% higher against the euro at 1.13330.
Pre-payment meter installation cost to be capped:::::Image copyright Getty Images Tens of thousands of energy users will no longer have to pay up to 900 each if they are forced to have a pre-payment meter installed.From January, energy regulator Ofgem is to set a maximum charge of 150 in such cases.The most vulnerable will see their charges waived completely.At the moment about 40,000 people a year are obliged to pay large fees when their energy supplier gets a court warrant to have a meter put in.On average, customers have to pay 400 to cover the costs of the installation.Such costs include court fees, and the use of locksmiths or dog-handlers, if these are needed.However, some energy firms already supply such meters for free.'Last resort' Those who will not have to pay anything include people in "severe" financial difficulty, or those who would find the experience "severely traumatic", for example, due to mental health issues.Those who are forced to have pre-payment meters installed are frequently in debt in the first place - making it difficult for them to pay the extra charges."At the moment vulnerable customers face a double blow when they're hit with high warrant charges on top of existing debt - risking making their situations worse," said Rachel Fletcher, Ofgem's senior partner for consumers and competition."The measures will protect all consumers, including the most vulnerable, from experiencing unnecessary hardship due to having a meter installed under warrant."Ofgem also warned suppliers that installing pre-payment meters should be a last resort.Customers should instead be encouraged to manage their debt through repayment plans.Since April, the price of energy for pre-payment meter customers has also been capped.
Equal pay day: What is the gender pay gap like where you are?:::::The gap in pay between men and women will take 100 years to close, a campaign group has warned.Campaigners highlight 10 November as the point in 2017 when a woman on an average wage stops being paid relative to their male counterparts.But in some parts of the UK, the gender pay gap is so wide, it is as though women work unpaid from September.Vivienne Hayes, of the Women's Resource Centre, said progress had moved at a "snail's pace".Campaign group the Fawcett Society said that progress in closing the pay gap has "stalled".If the mean average pay gap for full time workers of 14.1% closes at the rate it has over the last five years, it won't reach 0% until 2117, it said.Sorry, your browser cannot display this map Map built with Carto.Can't see the map?Click here The government wants large firms to disclose their pay gap, but will not force them to comply.Ms Hayes, chief executive of charity the Women's Resource Centre, said: "We are here again, year after year lamenting the seemingly impervious issue of equal pay for men and women."Even though we have had a law since 1970 outlawing the practice of sex discrimination in pay, our progress is probably not even at a snail's pace."Why does it differ from area to area?There are different ways of calculating the pay gap.For example, for full time workers.the gap based on median hourly earnings has narrowed to its smallest for 20 years, according to the Office for National Statistics, but was still 9.1% in 2017.Taking into account all workers, both full and part time, the median average gap has risen slightly from 18.2% in 2016 to 18.4% this year.In 183 out of 206 local authority areas, men in full time jobs earn more on average than women, but the gap varies from place to place.The top 10 includes the City of London and Tower Hamlets, which contains the financial area Canary Wharf.However, it is not a simple case of the gap being highest in the areas with the most lucrative jobs.Blaenau Gwent in Wales has the highest percentage gap between male and female full-time workers, with the average man on 14.07 an hour and average woman on 9.54, a difference of 32%.That is equivalent to women not being paid from 4 September.Knowsley in Merseyside, one of the most deprived areas of England, also appears in the top 10.Roger Smith from the Office for National Statistics said women tend to earn more in areas with a higher rate of people working in the public sector while the age of the workforce also played a part.The Fawcett Society said when higher earning jobs, more commonly held by men, are given more weight the average would mean effectively women stopped being paid from 10 November.Jemima Olchawski, of the society, said: "One of the biggest gaps is in finance, which is why you'll see the City of London and Tower Hamlets high up."There will also be issues around care.Women still make up the vast majority of carers.So we need to see more support for fathers to take time out to be with their children or care for relatives."Image copyright Leigh Day Image caption Lawyer Linda Wong says financial penalties are needed when firms do not disclose their pay gap Linda Wong, a solicitor with law firm Leigh Day, said: "The pay gap will persist unless there is commitment and consistency across the board."The firm has been representing 17,000 former and current employees of Asda and 1,000 Sainsbury's workers in claims for equal pay.An employment tribunal found in 2016 that the Asda women, who mainly worked at check-outs or stacking shelves, could compare themselves to higher paid men working in warehouses.Lawyers said the difference in pay was between 1 and 3 an hour.Asda strongly disputed the claims and is appealing.It said the demands of the jobs were different."Pay rates in stores differ from pay rates in distribution centres for legitimate reasons, including the different market rates for different jobs in different sectors," a spokeswoman said.Presenters want 'real change' at BBC Image copyright PA/Getty Images Image caption Chris Evans and Claudia Winkleman are the BBC's highest paid male and female stars The gender pay gap at the BBC has also been exposed with men found to be earning an average of 9.3% more than women.However, Director General Tony Hall said it showed the BBC was "in a better place than many organisations" where the gap is higher.Female presenters have demanded "real change" by the end of 2017 after it was revealed two-thirds of stars on more than 150,000 a year were men.Analysis by Robert Cuffe, BBC News Head of Statistics If official figures say the gap is 9% and campaigners say it's 14%, is someone using a dodgy number?Not necessarily.Both figures come from the Office for National Statistics.They use different averages.The 9% figure uses the middle (median) number.The 14% figure uses the mean average.The mean can be pushed up by very a small number of high values.If Bill Gates walks into your local pub, the mean wealth there will shoot up by millions, but the median won't change much.The ONS prefer 9% for that reason but campaigners say that the average should reflect the gaps across all of society.Whether equal pay day lands on 10 November (mean), 27 November (median) or on a different day in your area, this analysis shows that there are few places in the UK where it lands on 31 December.Where women make more than men There were 23 areas of the UK where women's average pay was greater than men's.This included Middlesbrough and Stoke-on-Trent, which have a high proportion of people out of work due to unemployment, sickness, disability or caring duties.However, they also included areas like Bexley, Havering and Sutton, which have low levels of unemployment.Image copyright Getty Images Across the UK, the average full-time male chief executive or senior official earns 48.53 an hour, or 93,960 a year.A woman in a similar role earns an average of 36.54 an hour, or 70,000 a year.The UK ranks 20th out of 144 countries around the world for closing the gender pay gap, but no country has absolute equality.In Iceland, which is ranked the best by the World Economic Forum, women walked out of their workplaces at 14:38 on 24 October 2016 in protest at the gap.According to unions, this was the time of day that women began working unpaid relative to men.Minister of state for apprenticeships, skills and women Anne Milton said the government had introduced a legal requirement for all large employers to publish their gender pay and bonus data by April 2018."By shining a light on where there are gaps, they can take action to address it," she said."There are no excuses, employers now need to get on with the job of publishing their pay gap and pledge to improve workplace equality."The fight for equal pay Image copyright PA Image caption Female workers won an equal pay claim against Birmingham City Council Women who worked for decades for Birmingham City Council celebrated when they were told they had won their battle for equal pay, but were angry it had ever had to go to court.In 2012 the Supreme Court ruled the council would have to pay claims brought by former employees who earned less than male counterparts.The following year the council agreed to settle 11,000 claims.Pam Saunders spent almost 30 years with the authority and worked as a mobile home care assistant, helping people to wash, do their shopping and housework.She told the BBC in 2012: "At the end of the day we did work hard for them.We really, really did and so why shouldn't they have paid us the right amount in the beginning?"More about this story The BBC England Data Unit used the Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings published by the Office for National Statistics and analysed the full time hourly median earnings, excluding overtime, for male and female workers in each local authority area to get the percentage gap between their earnings.We then calculated the dates on which the average female worker in each area effectively stops being paid, relative to male workers, because of the gap in their earnings.Produced by

Twitter halts 'broken' verified-profile system:::::Image copyright Getty Images Twitter has suspended its verified-profile scheme and described it as "broken", following complaints over the type of accounts being verified.Typically, prominent people, including musicians, journalists and company executives, get a blue icon on their profile after proving their identity.However, some far-right and white-supremacist accounts have now also been verified.Twitter founder Jack Dorsey said the scheme would now be "reconsidered".Image caption Verified profiles display a blue badge next to their name In a statement, the company said: "Verification was meant to authenticate identity and voice, but it is interpreted as an endorsement or an indicator of importance."We recognise that we have created this confusion and need to resolve it."The company said no further "general" accounts would be verified, while it worked on a fix.Twitter has been making a series of changes to address abuse and harassment on the social network.Last week, it published a rewritten version of its rules, which it said would make them easier to understand.
Toy sellers bet on Christmas as sales dip:::::Image copyright PA Image caption A girl plays with the Fingerlings toy UK toy retailers are holding out for a busy Christmas after sales fell by 2% in the first nine months of the year.Analysts and retailers expect a flat full year at best for the industry following two consecutive years of rapid growth.Spending on toys totals 121 per child up to the age of 11, according to analysts NPD, with lower-income families cutting their spending.The industry has unveiled its list of "must-have" toys.Cheaper collectables feature prominently on the list, alongside more traditional games and film and TV tie-ups.Frederique Tutt, global industry analyst for the NPD Group's toy division, said that sales had been "sluggish" in the year so far, whereas activity had risen in the other major toy markets in Europe, the US and Russia.She pointed to a correction following two years of 7% growth in the UK, which had outstripped other markets and had been driven in part by the success of the Star Wars franchise.Image caption Frederique Tutt with one of the Toy Retailers' Association's top toys Seven of the 10 best-selling toys of the year so far have had a price tag of less than 10, she said.Toy facts Some 38% of toy purchases in the UK are made online Nearly two-thirds (61%) of Christmas toys were chosen by the giver, rather than included on Christmas lists A third (34%) of annual spending on toys is at Christmas Source: Toy Retailers' Association/NPD Alan Simpson, chairman of the Toy Retailers' Association, which compiles the Dream Toys list, said the weakness of the pound had pushed up prices in the UK as most toys were imported.The toy market was suffering from the income squeeze of customers as much as other sectors, he added."However, the rule book gets thrown away at Christmas, no matter how tough things are [for parents]," he said.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption A drone is one toy mirroring the advance of technology Ms Tutt said that this year's list of top toys was relatively low-tech, with traditional games playing a more "dynamic" part in the market."Parents are saying that too much screen time is not good," she said.Only 1% of toys were "connected" via the internet, yet the influence of the web - and particularly social media - was clear from the design of new toys.One of the expected best-sellers at Christmas is the L.O.L.Surprise - a heavily wrapped toy inspired by "unboxing" videos on YouTube and other social media channels.Marketing for other toys had been launched on social media rather than TV adverts, she said.and manufacturers were counting on shared videos of youngsters playing with their new toys as another form of advertising.
Dubai Airshow: Storm clouds over the 'Middle East three':::::Image copyright AFP Image caption Dubai's last airshow was in 2015 They've been aviation's 21st Century success story.For years, Emirates, Etihad Airways and Qatar Airways - the Middle East three or ME3 - looked unstoppable.They became a benchmark for service and quality.And their global reach earned them a nickname, "the super-connectors".However, the headwinds are strengthening.The Dubai Airshow, which starts on Sunday, promises to be a bigger and better showcase for all things aviation, space and defence than the last gathering in 2015.But for the region's biggest three airlines, the economic, political and competitive backdrop is very different to two years ago.Falling oil prices have hit revenues and trade in the region.Security worries about terrorism, particularly in the US, have led to cuts in airline routes.There has also been a long-running diplomatic and trade impasse between Saudi Arabia and its allies on the one hand, and Qatar on the other.And years of rapid growth has led to concerns about over-capacity, which comes just as competition from lower cost carriers - long-haul and short-haul - has intensified.'Under pressure' The impact on profits for airlines in the region was underlined in a report by the International Air Transport Association (IATA), the industry trade group.It expects Middle East carriers to post a collective $400m profit this year, down from $1.1bn in 2016.For the first six months of 2017, trading conditions "sharply declined" and "some business models have come under pressure", IATA says."The region is struggling with increased infrastructure taxes/charges and air traffic congestion," it adds.To worsen matters, the once-surging cargo operations have also taken a hit.Image copyright Reuters Image caption Emirates' chairman Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum takes delivery of the airline's 100th Airbus A380.Emirates' woes underline the problems.In May, the region's biggest operator posted its first full-year profit decline for five years.Profits plunged 82% to Dh1.3bn ($340m) after what the airline's president Sir Tim Clark said was one of the carrier's "most challenging years to date".Emirates reported far better news on Thursday when it said half-year net profits more than doubled to Dh1.7bn.It was a result of cuts in capacity and dollar exchange rate benefits.But trading remains tough.IATA says that in September Middle East operators saw their slowest rate of monthly international growth for eight years, with demand up just 3.7%.Its senior economist David Oxley says services from the Middle East to America are clearly suffering despite the lifting of the cabin ban on large portable devices.The Middle East-US "is the only international market not to have grown in annual terms over the first eight months of the year," he says.Image copyright AFP Image caption Etihad posted a $1.9bn loss last year The situation at Abu Dhabi-based Etihad is even worse.Says analyst Seth Kaplan, managing partner of US-based Aviation Weekly: "Emirates is struggling relative to its own history, but it is keeping its head above water.But Etihad is clearly in a lot of trouble."Etihad posted a $1.9bn loss last year, which included an $800m write-down on the value of its investments in other airlines.The airline has spent hundreds of millions of dollars buying stakes in other airlines, including Virgin Australia, Air Serbia and Jet Airways.One of the rationales was to help feed more traffic through Abu Dhabi's hub.But the strategy is under review, a move that landed on Europe's doorstep this summer: Alitalia and Air Berlin filed for bankruptcy after Etihad decided not to invest further in the struggling airlines.Cooperation Lower-cost operators such as India's Indigo, Singapore-based Scoot, and the fast-growing Norwegian Air are chipping away at their bigger rivals.Norwegian was recently offering Amsterdam-Dubai prices at more than half the price of Emirates.The Gulf carriers helped bring back a certain luxury to air travel.But some of the fastest growth is now among airlines in the low-cost long haul market.Image copyright AFP Image caption The Gulf has a fast-growing low cost airline market This month, Emirates deepened its alliance with Flydubai that was first announced in July.There will be some co-ordination of schedules, marketing and reciprocal frequent flyer benefits.But a bigger deal may be on the cards.Last month, Emirates' Mr Clark said he was open to cooperation with Etihad.A merger, or alliance, would cut capacity and costs significantly, given their proximity.But it would be fraught with political hurdles, not just commercial ones, Mr Kaplan says.Even a limited agreement on, say, joint purchasing or maintenance would be complicated, as both sides tried to negotiate common standards, work-share, and protection for their huge airport bases.A lot depends on future oil prices and the revenues generated for governments, says Mr Kaplan."The more prices rise, the less chance of a deal."On "co-operation" with Emirates, Etihad said only that it would consider all opportunities that might make commercial sense.Dubai Airshow The trade-only show has been a regular feature since 1989, when 20 aircraft and 200 exhibitors took part This week's event is expected to attract 72,000 trade visitors, 1,200 exhibitors, 160-plus aircraft and 1,350 media representatives The 2013 event saw the biggest tally of commercial aircraft orders of any airshow - $206bn Russia and China, keen to assert their influence in Middle East will have a big presence, with both displaying fighter jets The space sector will feature prominently during the week, as the United Arab Emirates has a mission-to-Mars programme Of the three major Gulf carries, Qatar Airways had been holding up relatively well.Net profits for the latest financial year rose 22% to 1.97bn (400m) Qatari riyals.The airline has also made more astute investments than Etihad, raising its stake in British Airways-owner IAG to 20% and buying 10% of South America's Latam Airlines.But that was before the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Bahrain imposed an embargo on the state of Qatar in June, accusing it of sponsoring terrorism, which it vehemently denies.The blockade has piled on huge extra costs on the national airline, not least because of the need to re-route flights.In September, Doha was forced to inject $38bn into the economy to cushion the blockade's impact.Image copyright AFP Image caption Qatar Airway's chief executive Akbar al-Baker The ME3's problems mount just as some of their fiercest rivals, the US carriers, see signs of revival.US airlines have long complained that the ME3's success has been bolstered by state subsidies that violate the Open Skies agreement that gave Gulf carriers access to America.They argue that the ME3 has collectively received $42bn in subsidies since 2004.A trade row had seemed unlikely - until Donald Trump was elected president, that is.It now resonates more with his "America First" world view.The ME3 deny receiving unfair aid.Besides, they point out, it was US Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection that helped big US carriers restructure after years of losses.It's possible that life for the ME3 will get worse before it gets better.But in long run they will retain significant advantages.With two-thirds of the world about an eight-hour flight from the Gulf, it will remain a fuel-efficient, time-efficient place from which to fly.And the region's desire to build a tourist industry and diversify from oil-dependence will continue to underpin domestic carriers.Add to that, a lack of disruptive unions and lobby groups complaining about noisy flights, and the Gulf remains a pretty advantageous place to base an airline.
Why have governments struggled to tackle offshore money?:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption How can countries clamp down on tax avoidance?If we needed reminding, the Paradise Papers have shown how attractive it can be to keep money offshore.Wealthy individuals do it, companies do it.So can governments do anything about it?Can they get big firms and the rich to pay what many regard as their fair share of tax?In some cases the appeal of going offshore is to hide illegal behaviour from the gaze of law enforcement authorities.But much of what has been revealed in this massive leak of documents is lawful.In many cases it's about avoiding tax, which is legal, though it involves gaining a tax advantage in a way that the legislation did not intend.What are governments doing about it?Much of the effort needs international co-operation to be effective, and the forum where it's taking place is the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), an international agency whose members are mainly the rich countries.An important part of this initiative involves the exchange of information between tax authorities.The OECD initiative has two systems.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The Cayman Islands are a popular offshore financial centre Under one a tax authority gives information about an individual's finances if the person's home tax authority asks.The drawback is they need to know who to ask about.There is also a system, which is more recent and has fewer countries involved so far, of automatic exchange of information.That might catch more cases, but it can also create a huge volume of information that tax authorities might struggle to assess.Countries can also check schemes that wealthy people use more thoroughly to assess whether they conform with the law.There have also been initiatives on the roles of tax advisers.The UK, for example, has legislation that means advisers can end up paying hefty financial penalties if they recommend schemes that are subsequently ruled against.There is another initiative in the OECD, designed to address some types of tax avoidance that are used by multinational corporations.How do multinationals limit their tax?One technique for minimising tax bills has a very long history and goes by the name of transfer pricing.Different subsidiaries of multinational companies located in different countries buy and sell things to one another.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Starbucks agreed to pay more tax in the UK It may be components, raw materials or sometimes intangible things such as the right to use a trademark, a patent or copyright - known as intellectual property.The choice of what price to charge affects the amount of profit each subsidiary makes, and companies can set these prices with a view to ensuring that the profits appear to be made in the country with the most favourable tax regime.Another technique is for the subsidiary in the low-tax country to lend money to one facing higher business taxes, which can use the interest payments to reduce its tax liability.The OECD's latest plans The OECD has produced a package of proposals and is monitoring the implementation by its members.It's quite a technical initiative, but there are some broad principles involved.One is the idea that tax should reflect where economic activity really takes place.Another is the idea of arm's length transactions.That is the notion that transactions between a multinational's subsidiaries should be at prices that would be charged if they were entirely separate businesses.Many campaigners and experts say that the work being done in the OECD is useful but doesn't answer all the problems.The Tax Justice Network described the OECD's work on corporate tax as a huge step forward.But it also said: "The process has been continually undermined by the army of paid corporate tax advisers and lobbyists, as well as governments seeking to protect some of their pet tax breaks to business."The view of a tax expert Professor Rita de la Feria, a tax expert at Leeds University, says that much of the action taken so far is a temporary fix until firms find new ways to get around the rules.There are options, she argues, that could reduce the scope for avoidance.One would be that countries could tax a multinational's profits on the basis of the proportion of its sales in each state.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Google's tax affairs in Ireland have been criticised It would work better if all countries agreed that approach, she argues, but small groups or even individual states could do it.What we have now though, says Prof de la Feria, is more modest reforms undertaken by countries - with help from the OECD framework - and some incentives on companies, such as "naming and shaming and fear of a reputational impact".In one famous case that led to the coffee shop business Starbucks agreeing to pay more corporation tax in the UK.The Paradise Papers are potentially another example.Prof de la Feria says: "Until we have a global tax reform this is probably the most effective way of making individuals and corporations behave slightly differently."In Europe some companies have been ordered to pay taxes following investigations by the European Commission, and Apple was on the receiving end of this type of action over its tax affairs in the Republic of Ireland.These were investigations into what's called state aid, where the company concerned was found to have had a competitive advantage as a result of its tax arrangements with the EU country concerned.The EU Commissioner for Competition Margrethe Vestager put it like this: "The large majority of businesses, which pay their fair share of tax, shouldn't have to compete with rivals that get special favours from government."Still it's easy to believe that it was not just about tax, that she was also motivated by a more general desire to see large firms pay their share.Find out more about the words and phrases found in the Paradise Papers.Your browser does not support this Lookup Your guide to financial jargon Enter your search term The papers are a huge batch of leaked documents mostly from offshore law firm Appleby, along with corporate registries in 19 tax jurisdictions, which reveal the financial dealings of politicians, celebrities, corporate giants and business leaders.The 13.4 million records were passed to German newspaper Sddeutsche Zeitung and then shared with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ).Panorama has led research for the BBC as part of a global investigation involving nearly 100 other media organisations, including the Guardian, in 67 countries.The BBC does not know the identity of the source.Paradise Papers: Full coverage; follow reaction on Twitter using #ParadisePapers; in the BBC News app, follow the tag "Paradise Papers" Watch Panorama on the BBC iPlayer (UK viewers only)
'I've sat in a changing room in my underwear for ages':::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Would having your own personal stylist on demand help you decide what to wear?Dressing angst.We've all had it.Does this outfit make me look fat?Is it inappropriate for work?Is it something someone half may age would wear?Should I just give up and stay in bed forever?It's then we need help and advice from people we trust."I've sat in a changing room in my underwear for ages waiting for my friends to get back to me," says Sophia Matveeva, founder of fashion advice app, Style Counsel."I wanted their advice on the outfit I was thinking of buying.And my friends on WhatsApp were always asking me what they should wear, but we'd often be in different time zones and the answers would come too late."Fashion dilemmas like this gave her the idea for an app to help women crowdsource advice from stylists and sister fashionistas in a safe, troll-free environment."Young women have always cared about what others think about their look, but social media has amplified this", says Ms Matveeva."Your image can reach far more people than ever before - it's like being a celebrity, and this has made us a lot more worried."Image copyright Style Counsel Image caption Style Counsel founder Sophia Matveeva believes fashion is a social activity Style Counsel users wanting advice on an outfit can post a photo and receive "yes" or "no" answers from other users, or more detailed advice from vetted fashion stylists and bloggers "within minutes", she says.So far around 7,000 people have downloaded the app, and more than 90 stylists are on hand to dispense advice.Photos are being uploaded from North America and Australia, as well as the UK, she says.Fashion advice is a growing business, with dozens of apps, such as AskAnna, Mallzee and StyleDotMe, springing up, primarily targeting young women.Image-focused social media platforms such as Instagram and Pinterest have been a key place for fashion enthusiasts to share ideas and opinions for some years.And all this data about people's like and dislikes is gold dust for retailers."The most expensive piece of research retailers pay for is to find out why something didn't sell.Our platform tells them why - that's valuable feedback," says Ms Matveeva.This endless appetite for customer data undoubtedly prompted retail giant Amazon to launch its Echo Look camera.The $200 (150) voice-controlled device - powered by Alexa - can take full-length photos and videos of your outfit and send them to the accompanying smartphone app.Image copyright Amazon Image caption Amazon's Echo Look camera and app will give advice on which outfit suits you best A "style check" function then compares photos and gives its algorithmically-derived opinion of which outfit is better, based on fit, colour, style and current fashion trends.Amazon says its own panel of fashion experts has helped develop this function.But will this rather impersonal form of advice really appeal to social, sharing-obsessed twentysomethings?"Women, more than men, are social creatures - AI will never stop us talking to each other," says Ms Matveeva."We need human-first technology.Girls will always want the approval of the cool girl at school, and on Instagram there are millions of cool girls."Most young people like to search for and buy clothes online via their mobiles these days - no queues, less stress.But getting the right fit is difficult and leads to hundreds of billions of dollars worth of items being returned each year, at great cost to retailers.Image copyright Adriana Tripa Image caption Isabelle Ohnemus says social media helps online shopping to be a social experience "Every brand has its own sizing parameters - there are no international standards," explains Isabelle Ohnemus, chief executive of EyeFitU, a fashion website that finds clothes to fit your figure."This is why returns are so high."We can set up your size profile in a few seconds with 80% accuracy just knowing your gender, height, weight and age," she says.EyeFitU has about 60 retailers on its site - "mostly big international brands", says Ms Ohnemus - and using all the data it has collected, translates these differing national and brand sizings to suit your actual shape.Tech company Metail is also trying to solve the size issue by enabling shoppers to create digital 3D versions of themselves that they can they dress up virtually on retailers' websites.More Technology of Business Image copyright Getty Images "You can create your own body model giving your main measurements - height, weight, bust size, inside leg, neck size, hips and waist," explains Metail chief executive Tom Adeyoola."We can reach 92-96% accuracy just on those measurements."You can then go on to a Metail-friendly fashion website and see what your digital avatar looks like wearing any of the clothes you select.The images are altered by computer to fit your figure.To get to this stage Metail has to have photographed the retailer's range of clothes as worn by a manikin standing on a revolving turntable.The special photo rig, based in Bangalore, can "shoot 200 garments a day", says Mr Adeyoola.When you think that an online fashion retailer like Japan's ZozoTown can have 500,000 items in its range, that's a lot of photos to take.Mr Adeyoola hopes that his firm's technology will help make buying clothes online "a much more interactive and engaging experience" - as it used to be in-store.It will also provide retailers will valuable insights into our personal preferences.So far 7.5 million people have created "e-models" of themselves, he says.Image copyright Amazon Image caption With Amazon's Prime Wardrobe service you can try clothes at home first before you buy Of course, the biggest drawback of online shopping is that you can't touch and feel the clothes before your buy - another reason why returns are such a big issue.This is why Amazon has launched its Prime Wardrobe "try before you buy" service.Prime subscribers can order online but have seven days before deciding which clothes to keep and which to return in the prepaid box.All without paying a penny up front.Global fashion retailer Asos, which has 15.4 million active customers worldwide, recently followed suit in the UK with its own "try before you buy" option."The challenge of not being able to try on items before buying them is an an e-commerce perennial," says Dan Winter, Asos director of corporate communications."So it made sense to explore a try before you buy service here in the UK.With this option, customers don't have to worry about waiting for refunds because they will only be paying for what they choose to keep."But when it comes to making those choices, we get by with a little help from our friends.
What ingredients make the world's greatest cocktail bar?:::::Image copyright Rob Lawson Image caption Erik Lorincz is head bartender at the American Bar in London New York likes to think of itself as the home of the cocktail.But these days, London's scene is giving the Big Apple a run for its money.So when it comes to picking the world's greatest cocktail bar, which city wins?Elizabeth Hotson went to find out.From the Gin Rickey and Mint Julep swilling characters in The Great Gatsby, to the Mad Men who can't get enough Manhattans and Whiskey Sours, in the past it's New York that has tended to put the fizz into fancy mixed drinks.But these days, for true flaunt-it decadence, London's hotel bars are hard to beat.Take, for example, The Connaught Bar.At 5pm on a Saturday we're ushered to the last available table, surrounded by Art Deco opulence, all wood panelling, polished chrome, glass and leather.A waitress provides a bowl of fat, bright green olives.Their signature cocktail, the Vieux Connaught, arrives on a mirrored tray and involves a long list of ingredients: rum, rye whiskey, dry vermouth, Benedictine, Angostura bitters, orange bitters.It's not cheap at 20 ($26), but it comes in fitting style - garnished with orange peel in the shape of a lightning bolt and topped off with saffron-infused smoke.Image copyright Niklas Halle'n Image caption Smoke and mirrors - all part of the experience The Connaught represents the glossy, upmarket end of London's cocktail scene.It's about the experience as much as the contents of your glass.If you order a Martini, the Martini trolley is wheeled over, and the gin and vermouth are mixed to your precise specifications.007 would approve.Ten years ago, New York arguably led the cocktail scene; new bars were cropping up offering freshly squeezed juices and craft spirits, often in simpler, less plush surroundings.Now, inspiration has rippled around the globe and most capital cities boast plenty of places where the barman knows his Woo Woo from his Sex On The Beach.So this year, competition for a place on The World's 50 Best Bars (compiled by publishers William Reed) is stiff."A great cocktail isn't just about the liquid in the glass," says Sandrae Lawrence, one of the competition judges and editor of The Cocktail Lovers magazine."It's an overall experience that you're looking for."Great bars come in all shapes and sizes, from neighbourhood bars, to dive bars and five star hotels," she says."You've got to look at hospitality, the team work, how that bar makes you feel."Image copyright Rob Lawson Image caption Cocktails are now sold at 37,000 outlets across the UK, according to CGA And when it comes to the drink, as well as the chemistry and the artistry of presentation, there's also geography - where the ingredients come from; the story behind them is becoming ever more important, she says.According to industry figures, Britons are drinking more cocktails.CGA, which collates data on the food and drink industry, says the market reached 500m last year and is growing at 10% per annum.We're also becoming more adventurous according to CGA's chief executive Phil Tate, and eager for that "added element of theatre" on a night out, particularly in the age of Instagram.Image copyright JCMT agency Image caption Cocktails add an "added element of theatre" on a night out But "theatre" isn't always about sumptuous surroundings.An anonymous door off Old Street roundabout in east London, is the threshold of a more bohemian cocktail scene.Like the rough and ready speakeasies of 1920s America, which offered illicit drinking in an era of prohibition, the tiny basement bar, Nightjar, has bare wooden floors and exposed bricks, subdued lighting and live music.A Little Devil waits for me on the counter.Image copyright Addie Chinn Image caption Edmund Weil co-owns the Nightjar Although the venue is more basic, the drink is far from understated: served in pewter goblet with a serpent winding its way to the top, it's a concoction of rum, the Italian herbal liqueur Amaro, the Chinese herb schisandra, and devil's claw root, commonly used as a herbal remedy.The cocktail world can sometimes seem a little swept away by its own mythology, bartenders who "build" or "create" drinks rather than mixing them, infusions and dashes of ever more exotic ingredients.Might they be accused of going a bit overboard, I wonder, experimenting for the sake of it, rather than for the taste?Edmund Weil, the co-owner of NightJar says not."We really do go to a lot of effort to source interesting ingredients, but you do have to produce drinks with real substance which hang together perfectly," he says.Image copyright Rob Lawson Image caption The American Bar's Black Diamond with salted Lapsang Souchong syrup With the growing fashion for cocktails, the lower priced end of the market is booming, too.The chain Be At One now has over 30 bars all over the country, offering cocktails for 7.50 to 11.Be At One sold two million cocktails in 2016, up fourfold over the last five years.Its most popular is the Pornstar Martini - made with vodka, passion fruit liqueur and prosecco - representing 15% of all its cocktail sales.But the winner of the world's best bar, voted on by over 500 experts, bartenders and waiters, was only ever going to be one of those at the top end of the market.More stories from the BBC's Business Brain series looking at interesting business topics from around the world: So who won?In the end, the American Bar at the Savoy Hotel in London takes first place, its name a nod to a spirit of transatlantic conciliation.But the number two spot was taken by another London bar, Dandelyan.New York's Nomad comes in at number three.After celebrating wildly with his team on stage, Erik Lorincz, the American Bar's head bartender, reflects on the result."We look into every aspect of what we do," he tells me."It's not just the drinks themselves, it's how we serve them and how we greet the guests and look after them."He says he will be toasting the win with a few of his bar's house cocktails."I'll probably start with a Diamond Jubilee Fizz.That's Bombay Sapphire gin, grapefruit and orange oleo saccharum - a sugared oil - Earl Grey tea, lemon juice, almond syrup and champagne."The World's best bars 1.The American Bar, The Savoy, London 2.Dandelyan, London 3.The Nomad, New York 4.Connaught Bar, London 5.The Dead Rabbit, New York 6.The Clumsies, Athens, Greece 7.Manhattan, Singapore 8.Attaboy, New York 9.Bar Termini, London 10.Speak Low, Shanghai Source: William Reed
Have you got what it takes to be a secret shopper?:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The firm transforming market research Meet 29-year-old Hakan Sevgin.He is helping to improve consumer products and shops around the world.A Turkish man who lives in Istanbul, Hakan doesn't work for any retail firm.Instead he is a stage lighting manager in a theatre.Yet he is continuing to help retail companies around the world improve the products they sell, and the shops in which we buy them.So what does Hakan do?In his spare time he is a secret shopper and product tester for a Turkish market research company called Twentify.Twentify has just 27 permanent employees, and has only been going for three years, but its global clients now include Coca-Cola, Danone, KFC, Philips, L'Oreal, Samsung, and Unilever.Image caption Hakan Sevgin earns money doing regular jobs via Twentify's Bounty app, such as photographing storefronts The firm is one of a new breed of market research companies that are transforming a global industry worth $44.3bn (33.4bn) in 2015.Instead of needing an army of employees to conduct interviews or tests, Twentify uses a crowdsourcing model to connect directly with tens of thousands of members of the public via its app, which is called Bounty.So anyone with a smartphone in the countries where Twentify operates can use the Bounty app to do some research for it, and get paid in return.For example, if a chocolate-maker in the US wants to make sure that its bars are being correctly positioned in the stores of a certain retailer, it can ask Twentify to get a mass of Bounty users to find out.Each would then be asked to go to a store, and surreptitiously take a photo, and the geo-locator function on their phone would confirm that they did indeed go to the right place.They simply upload the photo via the app, and get paid $15 for their troubles.Bounty users can be tasked with reviewing whether staff are sufficiently friendly and professional, for instance, or if the store is clean enough.Meanwhile, they can also get paid for testing products or carrying out surveys from their own home.A growing number of apps have very similar business models, such as Findyr, Eyes On, Gigwalk, and Field Agent.Image caption Twentify and its rivals are using apps to transform the market research industry Hakan started using Bounty in 2015, and says he has now made a total of $735.He admits to being very nervous the first time he was a secret shopper."My first attempt, I was excited and I was shy," he says."I was thinking it would seem like it would be difficult to do the task.In fact we are doing these things in our daily lives [testing products and stores].I realised that later on, which made it easier."Twentify is the brainchild of 27-year-old Turkish entrepreneur and the firm's chief executive, Ilker Inanc.Previously a software developer for an Instanbul marketing agency, he quit because he wanted to start his own company.The idea for Twentify was born when Ilker realised that carrying out market research via an app could get results more quickly and cheaply than carrying out more traditional surveys which need a team of staff going out with clipboards, or doing phone interviews.Image caption Ilker Inanc admits that running a business has its stressful moments To attract business customers from around the world the firm advertises on the internet, while most of the members of the public who use its Bounty app join after being told about it by friends.Twentify has now worked with more than 150 business clients in Canada, Turkey and the US.More than 330,000 people have downloaded its Bounty app to do market research in those three countries plus Mexico, Nigeria, South Africa, Thailand, and Ukraine.The aim is to expand further internationally, but Ilker admits that it has not all been plain sailing since the firm was founded in 2014.A year and a half ago the company was not meeting the high growth targets he had set, so salaries and budgets had to be adjusted.Image caption People can earn money doing surveys for a number of firms via their mobile phones "I remember sitting in a meeting room in the office and going through all this stuff that I had to do, and suddenly I realised there were tears coming out of my eyes," he says."It was not because I was sad it was just the pressure, stress levels were high."The firm has also had to wrestle with the different banking systems across the world, to ensure that its users are promptly paid.This is the fourth story in a new series called Connected Commerce, which every week highlights companies around the world that are successfully exporting, and trading beyond their home market.Twentify has yet to make an annual profit as it instead invests to grow.This year it expects to see revenues reach $1.2m, with a loss of between 500,000-600,000.Backed by private investors, including Welsh-Canadian billionaire Terry Matthews, Twentify aims to increase its revenues to $10m by 2018.The company is also planning to relocate its headquarters to Toronto, Canada, but still maintain its existing office in Istanbul.Image copyright Chris McGrath Image caption Turkey does not have a large community of young start-up firms Ilker admits that being a young company in Turkey can be hard as the country doesn't have a large start-up community, so it can be difficult to gain investment, both in terms of finance and mentoring support.Can Selcuki, a board member of the Istanbul-based think tank Centre for Economic and Foreign Relations Research, agrees that this is an issue for Turkish start-ups.Image caption The global market research sector is huge "If you have an investor you don't just need the money, you also need their business knowhow, their connections, their mentorship basically, and I think that is the biggest obstacle in Turkey that tech start-ups face."Ilker says that moving the head office to Canada is needed in order to expand worldwide.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Twentify will soon be moving its main base to Toronto, but will keep its office in Turkey "Going global from North America is much easier for a tech start-up, you are closer to the capital, you are closer to big brands, big clients," he says."We have to make sure we are positioning ourselves not as a Turkish company, but as a global company."
Terror survivor's call for open speech on extremism:::::Image copyright One Young World Image caption Bjorn Ihler survived an attack and now wants to tackle extremist ideas Bjorn Ihler read Anders Breivik's book only a week after jumping into lake Tyrifjorden in Norway to escape the terrorist's bullets.Bjorn was one of the survivors on Utoya island where Breivik killed 77 people in July 2011.What Bjorn found in the far-right "manifesto" surprised him."His worldview was not purely driven by hatred," he says."It was much more about fear of what was happening to his society."This was a guy who grew up in the same city as me, we had similar backgrounds, we went to similar schools, but he saw the world in a completely different way."Since this experience, 26-year-old Bjorn devoted his life to trying to keep other young people from following a similar path to Breivik.Looking for extremists He has scoured the internet and seeks out extremists and former extremists to understand how they came to their views.He claims the unusual and unenviable record of meeting more reformed extremists than anyone else.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Bjorn wanted to tackle the "mindset" of Anders Breivik And he is now one of the leaders in a project talking to students in UK schools about extremist ideas.Bjorn says that before Breivik appeared in court after the attack, people were describing him a "super-intellectual far-right monster".In an echo of Harry Potter's nemesis Lord Voldemort, some were calling Breivik "He Who Must Be Named".Image caption In 2012 Bjorn gave evidence of how he had escaped by jumping into the lake But when Bjorn saw Breivik in the dock, he realised he was no longer at risk from him."I decided that the problem to address right now is all the people who share his mindset," he says.Bjorn is part of an initiative called Extremely Together, a partnership involving the Kofi Annan Foundation, One Young World and the European Commission.Not shutting down debate Bjorn's main recommendation for schools is that they teach students that people are allowed to hold very different ideas and opinions."I would like to see a class teaching critical thinking or philosophy in every school," he says.Image caption Extremely Together visit schools with a message of open debate "Students need to learn to analyse the information they receive, and to understand that there are many ways to interpret information, rather than see the world as black and white."He is concerned that many education systems are "shutting down critical thinking and teaching propaganda".Bjorn says teachers should encourage students to share ideas in the classroom, however unpleasant some of the ideas might seem.He says the mentorship of his old philosophy teacher helped him get through a difficult year following the attack."I was all over the place, I couldn't make sense of anything, so I decided to call my old high school philosophy teacher," he says."He had taught me that people can see the world in different ways.If Breivik had had him as a teacher, I think things could have been very different."Against 'safe spaces' Bjorn says the trend towards safe spaces in educational institutions is "extremely destructive" because it means teachers are hesitant to allow discussion of sensitive subjects."I've probably met more former extremists than anyone else, and one thing they all shared was that no one outside of their group would listen to them," he says.More from Global education Ideas for the Global education series?Get in touch."They never felt they were valued as human beings, they said no one would listen to their ideas."The only way to stop people from believing these ideas is to build a culture in the classroom where they can be discussed, analysed and criticised."Image copyright Reuters Image caption A memorial after Breivik's deadly attack on Utoya island He says this feeling of alienation is a "driving force" for why people turn violent."If they cannot promote their worldview through democratic means, they do it through violence."Countries around the world have been examining how to counter extremism in educational institutions.Bjorn warns that too much interference in schools could "backfire" - if students feel they are being unfairly targeted, they will feel targeted and be more prone to radicalisation.He argues that trying to ban access to extremist material online is "not a solution"."Educational institutions should be places where you are allowed to have weird ideas and discuss them without being reported to the police or have it show up on your record," he says."There is a difference between security and safety, and schools should not be places where ideas and opinions are policed."
How 'Asian Tiger cubs' are driving online shopping:::::Image copyright Post Office Bank of Singapore Image caption Children at Admiralty High School in Singapore show off their new payment wristbands Asia is driving the massive growth in online shopping, with youngsters in particular leading the charge.But why are they so keen and what are they spending their money on?In Admiralty Primary School, in Singapore's Woodlands neighbourhood, a group of students has just joined the e-commerce world."Now I don't need to think about losing my wallet," says Bosco Wong, a 10-year-old student, sporting a new wristband for making digital purchases while at school.The wearable band, called "Smart Buddy", is sponsored by the Post Office of Singapore Bank, and everyone at Admiralty has just received one.It is all part of Singapore's drive to go cashless, and the country's Education Minister Ong Ye Kung was at his school to launch them.Parents can track and manage their children's purchases online.Asia - its younger generations, in particular - has embraced online shopping and digital payments with remarkable enthusiasm.And given the UN's estimate that there are 720 million people aged 15-24 living there - dwarfing North America's 47 million and Europe's 82 million - it's no wonder Asia is driving the e-commerce explosion.China, which overtook the US in 2015 as the country with highest e-commerce spending, now accounts for 40% of the world's online commerce.Image copyright AFP Image caption Jack Ma founded Alibaba in 1999 Retail giant Alibaba, founded by billionaire Jack Ma, recently reported a 61% rise in quarterly revenues to 55.1bn yuan ($8.3bn; 6.4bn), thanks largely to the popularity of its online shopping platforms, Tmall and Taobao.Monthly active users of its Chinese retail marketplaces grew to 549 million in September, up 20 million from three months ago - that's an astonishing rate of growth.By 2020, 60% of all those aged 18-29 will live in Asia and will have a disposable income of $6tn (4.6tn), says consultancy firm Accenture - that's higher than any preceding generation.But why are Asia's youngsters so keen on buying online and what do they spend their money on?Well, this has clearly been a technology-driven phenomenon, with the smartphone as the key innovation changing consumer behaviour.About two-fifths of younger people in Asia have bought something online via their mobile, says Accenture."I do buy quite a lot of books online," says Theophi Kwek, 22, who recently finished university at Oxford and is now doing national service in Singapore's army.Books from overseas are cheaper than they are in Singapore, he says.He often uses UK sites and says shipping "usually takes a couple of weeks at most".Image copyright Theophi Kwek Image caption Singaporean Theophi Kwek likes buying books online from abroad But Yi Ying Ng, the 27-year-old founder of AllSome, a parcel tracking service, is part of a rising trend to connect other Asian markets to China's engine.The volume of packages from China to Malaysia has gone up from about one million a year in 2012, to about 73 million now, says Ms Ng.She takes goods from the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen, and delivers them to online buyers in Singapore and Malaysia, where she is originally from.She will be expanding next year to Indonesia, then Thailand, she says.When she started her company five years ago, posting a parcel from China cost $15-25 and took 30-50 days.She has found ways to lower this to $5, and shorten the delivery time to three days, she says.But her real innovation is helping small merchants to sell to friends and family through Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat, she says."We're trying to help everyone become a merchant, a decentralised approach," she says.Image copyright Ng Yi Ying Image caption Yi Ying Ng wants to help everyone sell online Research from TMI Strategy suggests that worldwide, 62% of e-commerce users under 30 take their cues in purchases from influential users online, whether friends on social media or specialist bloggers.Ms Ng calls her approach "social commerce".Most of her merchants are between 24-28, she says, and most of their customers are in their early twenties.But while China increasingly sells online to the rest of Asia, younger people in its rising urban middle classes are buying goods and services online from further afield.Qiaoyun Zhang and Xiaochen Xu are parents in their thirties, and live in Beijing's prosperous business and embassy district, Chaoyang.Recently they started using a platform called VIPKid to buy live English lessons from teachers in North America, for their four-year-old daughter, Lu-Ke.More Technology of Business Image copyright Getty Images "My husband and I seldom use English in our daily life," says Ms Zhang, "and maybe our English is not that good.So we don't want to teach our children to speak English."The lessons last 25 minutes and their daughter takes four of them a week on an iPad."North American teachers, they are very patient compared with Chinese teachers," Ms Zhang says.Companies wanting to sell to these younger Asian audiences like Mrs Zhang should realise brand loyalty doesn't any more exist, says Michael Talbot, co-founder of 3radical, a brand engagement firm working in East Asia.His firm provided the technology behind Singapore's Smart Buddy."These young people, they're not disloyal, they're just using tools in a very competitive landscape.It's fundamentally different from having one high street with a Chinese, an Indian, and a couple of pubs," he says.Loyalty schemes accordingly tend not to work in China, Vietnam and Thailand, but games tied into a brand and incorporating an element of luck have cultural appeal there, says Mr Talbot.So how will the likes of 10-year-old Bosco Wong be shopping in future?Using his voice to authenticate a purchase perhaps?Tapping the side of his augmented reality glasses?Whatever the technological innovations, these Asian Tiger cubs are likely to be in the vanguard as e-commerce continues to sweep across the world.
The non-stop problem solver who loves to invent:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Uddhab Bharali epitomises India's "jugaad" spirit "I like to solve problems," says Uddhab Bharali."I like to make [people] a little more comfortable with themselves, or a little independent."This is what drives Uddhab Bharali to keep inventing.He started making things to sell more than 30 years ago in order to help pay off a large family debt.Today it is his life's passion.He has created more than 140 inventions, many of which are sold commercially with some winning international awards.He says his main motivation has always been to help people.Across India he is already well-known for his agricultural inventions but his new ideas are helping those with disabilities.He explains that because there is limited government support in India for people with physical disabilities it is up to people like him to come up with solutions.Image caption As well as complicated machines Uddhab invents simple small devices like this coconut cracker.Raj Rehman is 15-years-old and was born with congenital amputations and cerebral palsy.The simple device that Mr Bharali has made for him attaches to his forearm and is made from everyday items like Velcro fasteners and a spoon.It helps him to eat and to write.Mr Bharali has also adapted some footwear which means Raj is able to move around much more comfortably."I used to worry about myself before but now I feel stress free.I don't have to worry how I will cross the railway line to reach school as now I can walk without difficulty," he says."I am happy that I can take care of myself."Human ingenuity Initially, Mr Bharali recalls that people thought he was "worthless" and it took him 18 years to establish himself as "an innovator with class".Image caption Uddhab has become famous because of his inventions Most of his innovations are low cost and use locally available raw materials.This type of frugal innovation is known as "jugaad".It is a Hindi term which can also translate as "ingenious improvisation".Jaideep Prabhu is from Cambridge University's Judge Business School and has written a book about jugaad.He thinks it has a huge role to play in inspiring people to innovate: "This is mainly because it doesn't require much more than your innate human ingenuity."The whole approach is designed for you to find problems that surround you in your community - problems that affect you and people like you, and then to take resources that you have access to and solve those problems," he says.The BBC's Innovators series reveals innovative solutions to major challenges across South Asia.Ever heard of the concept of "jugaad"?It's a Hindi term meaning cheap innovation.If you have created a life hack or innovation that you are proud of, or spotted one while out and about on your travels, then share your picture with us by emailing yourpics@bbc.co.uk, use the hashtags #Jugaad and #BBCInnovators and share your picture with @BBCWorldService, or upload your submission here.Learn more about BBC Innovators.Mr Bharali makes an income from selling his inventions as well as designing technical solutions for businesses and government.But he is keen to help others make money and improve their own financial situation.He has set up a couple of centres to give people access to his machines.At one of these centres women from the local villages are able to come and use a rice-grinding machine that he has designed.The rice flour is then made into cakes and other edible items that can be sold.No shortcut According to the World Bank only 27% of women in India over the age of 15 are economically active."We have no facilities or employment to earn our livelihood in the villages," says Porbitta Dhutta, one of the women who comes to the centre."Here we can use innovations to change our lives to become self-sufficient and make respectable money for ourselves and our families."Men in rural areas have also benefitted from Mr Bharali's ingenuity.He has developed and sold over 200 cement-brick making machines.Each one requires five people to operate it and he estimates that over one thousand men are now employed because of it.Image caption Raj Rehman says he is happy that he can look after himself, thanks to Uddhab Bharali's inventions Although Mr Bharali says there is no shortcut to success, his hard work means his life is now comfortable and he is able to support 25 other families with the proceeds from his business.His engineering background has certainly helped Mr Bharali but he thinks that the fundamentals of innovation cannot be taught: "Any person with a restless mind, who is uncomfortable with things in the world, is an innovator."Innovation comes from inside you.No-one can make you an innovator, you have to feel it."Originally he would design his machines and then hope that they were commercially successful but such is his reputation now that people are commissioning him to make bespoke solutions and he has no intention of slowing down.For him the excitement of innovating continues: "I just enjoy the challenge.Always something fresh.And the joy of being the first person to do something new."Additional research and reporting by Priti Gupta.
How South Sudan refugees are boosting Uganda’s economy:::::Image caption Penina used to have a salon in South Sudan Uganda is often called one of the best places in the world to be a refugee because of its welcoming policies.But how do you rebuild your life - and start making money - having left everything you knew and held dear?The BBC's John Murphy has been finding out."Starting any business is not easy because it's difficult to get money at the beginning," Penina tells me.Most entrepreneurs would tell you that.But imagine how much harder it is when you are living in a refugee settlement in northern Uganda, having escaped war."It's not easy for the refugees to even get money," she continues."You see, they sell their own things like beans, they pay you with [cooking] oil, because there's nothing, there's no money."Penina fled South Sudan with her four children.She didn't want to."I was not going to leave because I love my country, I love my home," she says."But the worst thing is when I saw a woman and a child being killed.How could I, as a woman, continue to stay in South Sudan when such things are happening, when women and children are being killed?"Her husband stayed behind.She says he refused to come and, for a short while, they communicated by phone.But his number no longer works and she doesn't know what has happened.'Use your brain' According to the United Nations refugee agency, the UNHCR, around 85% of the more than one million South Sudanese refugees now in Uganda are women and children.They do get some help from the UN, the international aid agencies and the Ugandan government.Image caption Penina says she finds it therapeutic to work in her salon They are given plots of land - wild bush land - which they have to clear and build shelters on and, when they can, grow vegetables in.They are also given plastic sheeting to construct their homes with, some cooking utensils and food rations.However, a lack of international help has meant that in the last year those monthly food hand-outs have been cut, and many refugees we met complained that the food does not actually last the month.That is where Penina has an advantage.She has a skill.She was a hairdresser back in Yei, in South Sudan, and she has brought that skill with her.She has also been a refugee in Uganda before, in the late 1990s, when there was fighting between north and south Sudan.It means she knows how things work in Uganda and she has a network of local friends.Uganda's refugee influx Uganda saw the largest number of refugees of any other country in 2016, UN figures show.The bulk of the new arrivals (489,000) came from South Sudan, with a smaller number (18,600) coming from Burundi More than a quarter of a million refugees are living in the Bidi Bidi camp alone More people arrived in Uganda in 2016 than crossed the Mediterranean into Europe 'Why I gave my land to a refugee' Is Uganda the best place to be a refugee?Uganda hosts 1m South Sudan refugees One in particular, who helped her set up her hair salon in Imvepi refugee settlement.The salon is, in fact, a shack made of wooden poles and UNHCR plastic sheeting.Hanging from the poles are pictures of hairstyles and an assortment of hair extensions.There is also a large poster of Jesus Christ.When I ask Penina where her energy comes from, she looks to the sky."That's God," she says.I point out that it is her too."Yes," she replies."But you have to use your brain.God has given me all this.I have to use my brain to do something, rather than stay idle."She says business is slow.Sometimes the only way for her to make money, so that she can buy the things she needs for her business, is to take those food rations the refugees give her in payment and to sell them, to get some cash."What can we do?It's the condition we are in."But her salon has proved therapeutic."It's good when you just chat together," she explains."You forget about the stresses and other things in South Sudan, the bad things people were doing."'Business is booming' Not far away, I come across a young man surrounded by piles of charcoal, which crunches underfoot.It is widely used by both refugees and Ugandans for cooking."Business is booming in the refugee camp," says Abdul Karim Ali, a lively 25-year-old Ugandan.He comes from the local town, Arua, which in the rainy season can be about an hour-and-a-half away, driving along muddy roads.He explains how the South Sudanese refugees "cure" the charcoal and he buys it from them, then transports it back to town to sell at a profit.Image caption "In business sometimes you win, sometimes you lose," says Abdul Karim Ali "Charcoal is very expensive in town.But, due to the conditions, they sell it cheaply," he says of the refugees."Some even sell their own stuff, the things given to them by the UN.We get a lot of profit from them."Yet that is a dangerous business, he tells me.The Ugandan government does not like people profiting from the goods handed out by the UN and the police could arrest you if they find you trading in refugee items."But we still buy," insists Mr Ali."In business sometimes you win, sometimes you lose."His positivity is infectious."Look around," he tells me."We are all mixed up in the market, South Sudanese and Ugandan, doing business so that we can survive better."It is true.Swathes of the north Ugandan countryside are being transformed.It is part of the reason why the Ugandan government has been so welcoming to the refugees.What was unproductive bush land in a poor region is being cleared, markets are sprouting up in the settlements and small businesses are growing roots.With little sign of peace returning to South Sudan anytime soon, the refugees have to make new lives for themselves.And some local Ugandans are benefiting too.Find out more on the BBC's Global Business programme
From berated blogger to beauty millionaire:::::Image copyright Lowengrip Image caption Isabelle Lowengrip got into blogging in the late 2000s After finding fame with her lifestyle blog, Isabella Lowengrip went on to establish one of Sweden's best-known beauty companies.But it wasn't all plain sailing for the 27-year-old.When she started her blog at the age of 14, the mainstream media didn't take her seriously at all."Swedes, and particularly teenage girls, were very fast and early adopters," she says of the blogging boom that swept the country a decade ago."But I remember the Swedish media laughing at us and saying, 'look at those young women trying to do business with blogs'.We didn't give up though, and I'm very proud of it."Under the pen name Blondinbella, she quickly became one of the most-read bloggers in the Nordics, and today some 1.5 million people visit her site every week.Image copyright Lowengrip Image caption The Lowengrip Care & Color range includes moisturisers, facial creams, mascara and shampoo Translated into English, German, and more recently French and Arabic, the blog focuses on fashion and beauty, Ms Lowengrip's business ventures, and her efforts to balance a busy career with bringing up two young children.It has also propelled her to becoming one of the Nordics' best known "social influencers", as well as being a launch-pad for a raft of successful spin-off businesses."I see myself more as an entrepreneur than a writer," she admits as we chat at her glitzy offices in Stockholm."I still think I write quite badly!"Ms Lowengrip first showed a flair for business as a teenager, when she secured numerous advertising and sponsorship deals for her blog.Image copyright Lowengrip Image caption Ms Lowengrip with her business partner Pingis Hadenius While some of her contemporaries partied away their earnings, the Swede chose to invest in new ventures.In 2012, she launched her own beauty brand, Lowengrip Care & Color (LCC), which was ranked as Sweden's fastest-growing beauty company last year.It markets itself as selling "gentle" products that offer fast results, including facial creams, mascara, shampoos and body lotions.More The Boss features, which every week profile a different business leader from around the world: LCC has expanded across the Nordics and into Switzerland and Estonia, and last year reported sales of 35m Swedish krona (3.3m)."Building a company is my passion," says Ms Lowengrip of her decision to try new business ventures beyond blogging."It's hard for me to just wear somebody else's make-up or clothes - I want to create everything."But LCC and the blog remain strongly intertwined.Both ventures share the same office space above the exclusive Stockholm mall Sturegallerian and together employ 40 employees in total.Image copyright Isabella Lowengrip Image caption A management meeting at Lowengrip's offices in Stockholm Ms Lowengrip's posts also frequently reference her work at LCC - from meetings with designers and toxicologists, to appearances at beauty fairs and major contract wins.She also often asks her readers' for their opinions on her products or projects.Ms Lowengrip's other business interests include a shoe brand, a clothing label, an investment company and personal finance workshops, and the whole group expects to report sales of 75m Swedish krona this year."When it turned out she had a talent for business, she was taken much more seriously," reflects Frasse Levinsson, a Stockholm-based media commentator and digital editor of popular culture magazine Nojesguiden."She knows which way the wind blows.For example, skincare has become a hot topic in the feminist movement in Sweden.Image copyright Lowengrip Image caption Ms Lowengrip at an LCC product launch "But it's almost like she predicted that because she released her own skincare products just beforehand."Ms Lowengrip puts her success down to a range of factors, from the sheer number of hours she's invested in educating herself on business matters, to collaborating with "smarter colleagues" in her ventures.However, she admits that the time and effort involved in building her career has put a strain on her personal life.She is also candid about projects that failed to blossom, including Egoboost, a traditional glossy magazine that never turned a profit, and Bellme, her first online store, which went bankrupt shortly after she sold the business."I learned so much during those years, so I am very grateful for all those mistakes.You have to just jump on the horse again and not be so afraid of what people are thinking."Image copyright Lowengrip Image caption Ms Lowengrip sometimes models her own products The 27-year-old says she's accepted she's "not the best leader", arguing that she's better at coming up with ideas, and focusing on LCC's bigger vision "to become the next Estee Lauder".For this reason, her business partner, the economist and journalist Pingis Hadenius, has taken on chief executive duties at LCC.Ms Lowengrip's official title is creative director, but she also remains the brand's more public face.Dividing opinion Such a public persona continues to be a mixed blessing.Despite being an icon for hundreds of thousands of Swedish women who've grown up reading about her life, Ms Lowengrip, perhaps inevitably, divides opinion.She recently faced a backlash after divorcing from her husband and being vocal about subsequently buying in more home-help for cooking and cleaning - something of a taboo in Sweden's social democracy.But the mother-of-two says she refuses to be judged for her lifestyle."It's important for me to not have to choose between my business and my family life," she says."And if I'm a happier person by myself, then I am also a better mum, a better colleague and a better leader."
Could giving property rights to the world's poor unlock trillions?:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption What effect do property rights have on the economy?Some of the most important parts of our modern economy can't be seen - but they can be heard.That's what one Peruvian economist concluded while walking through the idyllic rice fields of Bali, Indonesia, in the 1990s.As he passed one farm, a dog would bark at his approach.Then, quite suddenly, the first animal would stop and a new guardian would begin to yap away.The boundary between farms was invisible to him - but the dogs knew exactly where it was.The economist, Hernando de Soto, returned to Indonesia's capital, Jakarta, and met cabinet ministers to discuss setting up a formal register of property rights.They already knew everything they needed to know, he said, cheekily.They merely needed to ask the dogs of Bali who owned what.50 Things That Made the Modern Economy highlights the inventions, ideas and innovations that helped create the economic world.It is broadcast on the BBC World Service.You can find more information about the programme's sources and listen online or subscribe to the programme podcast.Hernando de Soto is a big name in development economics.His energetic opposition to Peru's Maoist guerrilla group, the Shining Path, led to three assassination attempts.His big idea is to make sure that the legal system can see as much as the dogs of Bali.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Hernando de Soto argues better property rights could make a big difference to the world's poor While the Indonesian government was trying to formalise property rights, others have tried to abolish them altogether.Daring plan In 1970s China, for example, where the Maoists weren't the rebels but the government, the very idea that anyone could own anything was seditious, bourgeois thinking.Farmers on collective farms were told by Communist Party officials that they didn't own a thing.Everything belonged to the collective.What about the teeth in my head, asked one farmer?As noted by NPR's Planet Money podcast, he was told that even his teeth were owned by the collective.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The land, its produce - and even the workers' teeth - belonged to the collective in 1970s China This approach worked terribly: if you don't own anything, why bother to look after it?Avoiding toothache is an incentive to brush your teeth.But collective ownership of land left farmers in desperate, gnawing poverty.So, in Xiaogang in 1978, a group of farmers secretly met and agreed a daring plan.Conspicuous success Instead of farming as a collective, they would informally divide up the land, and each keep whatever surplus they produced after meeting collective quotas.It was a treasonous agreement in Communist eyes: discovery risked execution.In fact, they were found out thanks to their conspicuous success: their farms produced more in one year than in the previous five years combined.But luck was on their side.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Deng Xiaoping, who became leader in 1978, laid the foundations for China's modern economy.China now had a new leader: Deng Xiaoping.And Deng let it be known that this was the sort of experiment that had his blessing.And 1978 was the beginning of China's breakneck transformation from utter poverty to, by some measures, the largest economy on the planet.Invisible web The experience in China shows that even informal property rights can be incredibly powerful.If you know your neighbours respect your boundaries, you can feel confident investing time in weeding your vegetable plot, or building a house.But in one critical way, it doesn't help me that my neighbours agree that I own my house.If I want a loan - to improve my house, or build a business - lenders need collateral.And land or buildings make particularly good collateral because they tend to increase in value, and it's hard to hide them from creditors.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Banks will lend against property only if its ownership can be proven in law But the lender needs to be confident it could take the house away from me if I don't repay the loan.So, I need to prove that the house really is mine.That requires an invisible web of information that the legal system and the banking system can use.For Hernando de Soto, this invisible web is the difference between my house being an asset - something useful that I own - and being capital - an asset recognised by the financial system.'Dead capital' In poor countries, a lot of assets are informally held.Hernando de Soto calls them "dead capital", useless for securing a loan.His estimate was that at the start of the 21st Century there was almost $10tn (7.5tn) worth of dead capital across the developing world - more than $4,000 (3,200) for every person.Other researchers think that's an overestimate and the true figure is probably $3tn (2.2tn) or $4tn (2tn), but either way, it's a huge amount.More from Tim Harford: 'The devil's rope': How barbed wire changed America How a creative legal leap helped create vast wealth Do passports restrict economic growth?The great intellectual property trade-off But how do assets become capital?How does the invisible web get woven?It needs a government.Enforcing property rights is one of the few things pretty much everyone on the political spectrum agrees a government should do, except perhaps the Maoists.It's not just an altruistic measure to make it easier to get a mortgage.When government knows who owns land, it can tax it.Napoleonic 'cadastres' Perhaps the first recognisably modern property registry was in Napoleonic France.Needing to fund his incessant wars, Napoleon decreed that all French properties would be carefully mapped, and their ownership registered.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Napoleon decreed that all properties in the territories he controlled would be mapped and registered Such a property map is called a "cadastre", and Napoleon proudly proclaimed that "a good cadastre of the parcels will be the complement of my civil code".After conquering Switzerland, the Netherlands and Belgium, Napoleon introduced cadastral maps there, as well.Bold pioneers In the mid-1800s, the idea of the land registry spread quickly through the British Empire, too.The government drew up maps and allocated title deeds.Of course at that time, nobody with any power had much interest in the fact that indigenous people had their own claims on the land.The process doesn't have to be top-down.In the United States, there was a bottom-up approach.After decades of treating squatters as criminals, the state began to think of them as bold pioneers.Image copyright Chris Dorney / Alamy Stock Photo Image caption The 1862 Homestead Act set out the rules on who could own land in the US's western territories The US government tried to formalise informal property claims, using the Preemption Act of 1841 and the Homestead Act of 1862.Again, the rights of the native people who had been living there for thousands of years were not regarded as of much significance.It was hardly justice.But it was profitable.By turning a land-grab into a legally recognised property right, these land registries unlocked decades of investment and improvement.And some economists - most prominently Hernando de Soto himself - argue that a good way to create property registers for developing countries today is to use the same bottom-up process of recognising informal squatters' rights, coupled with modern databases.Do improved property registers really unlock what Hernando de Soto calls "dead capital"?Evidently, they can.In Ghana, for example, farmers with clearer property rights invested more in their land.Essential infrastructure But the answer, of course, is "it depends".It depends on whether there's a banking system capable of lending, and an economy worth borrowing money to invest in.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The Philippines' labyrinthine property registration system involves 168 steps And it depends on how smoothly the property register works.Hernando de Soto found that in the Philippines, legally registering property took 168 procedures, 53 agencies and a waiting list of 13 to 25 years.Faced with such obstacles, even formally registered properties are likely to become informal again - the next time the property is traded, both the buyer and the seller may decide that formalising the deal is just too time consuming.But get it right, and the results can be impressive.The World Bank has found that after controlling for income and economic growth, the countries with simpler, quicker property registries also had less corruption, less grey-market activity, more credit and more private investment.Meanwhile, the property registry doesn't get much love: it's not a high-speed rail line or a gleaming new airport.It's an unfashionable, invisible piece of infrastructure.But without it, developed economies would go to the dogs.Tim Harford writes the Financial Times's Undercover Economist column.50 Things That Made the Modern Economy is broadcast on the BBC World Service.You can find more information about the programme's sources and listen online or subscribe to the programme podcast.
Persuading would-be migrants to stay at home:::::Image caption Hassan Odjo says he is happy to be back in Senegal It is 10 o'clock at night, and outside the arrivals hall of Dakar's main airport, two Senegalese men are taking a moment to get used to their freedom.Hassan Odjo, 42 and Issa Ba, 23 have just stepped off a flight from Libya, where they had been trapped for months."I was praying every day to Allah to give me the chance to come home," says Hassan, a huge smile spread across his face."I saw people dying in front of my eyes.Every day I was praying to be back in my country.Today is the happiest day for me, it's like it's my birthday."Both Hassan and Issa have returned home under a voluntary repatriation programme run by the International Organization for Migration (IOM).They had travelled through Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger and ended up in Libya - where they became trapped, unable to go further.Dangerous route Hassan had attempted to cross the Mediterranean, but after his boat got into trouble he was picked up by local militia and held in detention.Image caption It can be hard for some to come back and say they failed to get to Europe, says Seydine Ken Hassan tells me of the suffering facing economic migrants in Libya, and describes being held in a room with 300 people, being given only bread twice a day, and bad water."When they catch you they lock you in prison, beat you or maltreat you, ask you to call your parents to send money."In Libya detaining migrants has become a business in itself, he says."They are selling black people like coffee, like a cup of coffee.Yes I'm telling you the truth!"Faced with this reality, it isn't surprising that more migrants are opting to return home.Returning home The International Organisation for Migration has access to the Libyan detention centres, and works with national consulates to offer people the choice to get out.So far this year, the IOM in Senegal alone has helped more than 2,000 people return home.Most of them have either been flown in from Libya, or bussed back from Niger.Others have been brought back from Morocco and Tunisia.Image caption Too many migrants don't realise the dangers they'll face, says the IOM's Senegal boss Jo-Lind Roberts Sene Sitting quietly next to Hassan is Issa Ba.He cuts a contrasting figure; he looks visibly shaken and for him the homecoming is bittersweet."I feel happy because I am going to see my parents again, but at the same time I'm very disappointed.It's a shame you know, it's a dishonour going back without getting to Europe."Listening to all this is Seydine Ken, the IOM case-worker who is at the airport to meet the two.He's used to seeing these kind of reactions from returnees.Seydine says: "The social pressure is really difficult because when they organise their trip, the family mobilises money, and sells their goods to pay for it."And it's very difficult for them to come back, and see what their family invested in the [failed] migration."Seydine is part of the government welcome party; and at the airport he provides pocket money and information to take care of immediate needs, and also questions the two about their migration experience.He's a regular at the airport and says he can be there twice a week to welcome returnees."They have not met their dream.They are very disappointed, physically they are very tired and psychologically they are very weak.These people need help - financial help, health and personal development."Returnees' role The IOM's chief of mission in Senegal is Jo-Lind Roberts Sene.Time and again she notices the serious lack of information about the realities of migrating."It's very frustrating when each time we have a charter flight, I get to the airport and have the same exchanges over and over again - they didn't have sufficient information, they knew the trip was dangerous but never knew to what extent."Image caption In rural Senegal, a lack of jobs is one reason many choose to try and reach Europe Jo-Lind says that around Dakar there is more awareness about the dangers, but that in the countryside and other areas - home to a lot of would-be migrants - there is not this awareness.Voluntary returnees like Hassan and Issa play a vital role in helping change people's views.One of the regions where young men are being re-absorbed is Tambacounda in eastern Senegal, close to the border with Mali.Being a poor, rural region, it is the lack of well-paying jobs for young people that encourages them to leave in the first place.So attempts are being made to reintegrate returned migrants into the community - giving them something to do and a way of earning a living.One project is a maize farm in the rural community of Jalakoto.It's run two European NGOs, Coopi and La Lumiere, along with the IOM, and helps around 100 young men in the surrounding villages.Image caption The maize farm is designed to help people earn a living - and for them to meet returning migrants For men like Mamadou Biagey, who came back from Libya three years ago, it's the only thing they have."Since I arrived I have lived in hardship because all the money I had I used to travel to Libya.For two years I stayed here without doing anything - it's only this year that I started doing something."The Jalakoto project is also designed to give young men thinking of leaving for Europe a reason to stay - not just by providing an income and a purpose, but also by encouraging them to rub shoulders with people who can talk of their experiences travelling to Europe."Sometimes in our debates there are young men who ask, 'what did you do and how did you do it to get to Libya?'," says Mamadou Biagey, "but I try to discourage from going."A quick show of hands among the 15 men working in one field reveals one man who says he initially intended to leave."In the beginning I only wanted to go and I saved enough money," he explains."Later on they brought us the project and explained what it was about and they convinced me.That's how I decided not to go."Competing narratives In Tambacounda and throughout Senegal there is a battle going on between two narratives of what migration to Europe actually entails.Image caption Warnings about the dangers of migrating are competing with individual success stories, says Issaga Cee Back in the town, Issaga Cee, a school principal for 13 years, explains how real-life accounts of the dangers of the journey compete for space with apparent success stories on social media."People communicate a lot through WhatsApp - its very easy to tell the story of someone who has succeeded," he explains."Most of those who return at least have an experience of all the difficulties in Libya, so they have become lecturers about that very difficult trip and its consequences."The IOM's Jo-Lind Roberts Sene says returning migrants have a crucial role to play: "If it's a message that comes from Europeans it won't go through."If it's someone who's tried it, and hasn't made it, and can really explain what it was they experienced along the way, then it will take time - but they really are the ones that can put the message across."A note on terminology: The BBC uses the term migrant to refer to all people on the move who have yet to complete the legal process of claiming asylum.This group includes people fleeing war-torn countries such as Syria, who are likely to be granted refugee status, as well as people who are seeking jobs and better lives, who governments are likely to rule are economic migrants.
Spreading the word: How to promote your online business:::::Image copyright Gemma Day Image caption Nosh Detox founder Geeta Sidhu-Robb used bloggers to help promote her brand Online businesses now have a wealth of digital tools and techniques at their disposal to help them get noticed in the global marketplace.Geeta Sidhu-Robb, founder of juice and health food delivery service, Nosh Detox, was using social media to promote her business long before it became fashionable to do so.Ten years ago, in fact.On a tight budget and needing to convince a sceptical public, she tapped in to the power and reach of bloggers to promote her diet and wellbeing products."Juice fasts didn't really exist in the UK at the time," recalls the former corporate lawyer and single mum of three."In fact some people actually thought a detox could kill you.""We couldn't afford PR [public relations] agencies or expensive advertising campaigns, so we'd talk to pretty much anyone with an online presence and persuade them to take photos, film us on YouTube and write about us," she says.The bloggers would include a link to her website on their pages - occasionally in return for some Nosh Detox freebies Ms Sidhu-Robb admits.This helped push the business to the top of organic - not paid-for - search rankings.A 2m turnover and Hollywood A-list clientele followed, along with significant followings in Russia and Australia.It shows how, on social media, a little can go a very long way when it comes brand promotion.Image copyright EyeFitU Image caption Isabelle Ohnemus is a big believer in finding the right social media "influencer" for your brand Now social media marketing is a business in its own right.Convenient and low cost, with a potentially vast audience reach, the platforms have overtaken all other media for small businesses, says research firm BIA Kelsey.Former investment banker Isabelle Ohnemus has extensively used "influencers" to promote her Zurich-based fashion company EyeFitU, which is an online platform aimed at remedying some of the sizing inconsistencies across fashion brands.Usually young, fashion-conscious females with a prominent online presence act as "brand ambassadors" for EyeFitU, promoting the company to their followers on Instagram, Snapchat or Facebook.Big brands will sometimes pay in excess of $30,000 (23,000) to such influencers for a single post, but smaller companies with more modest budgets can still get in on the action."There is a trend for going with smaller-scale bloggers rather than those with million-plus followers," says Ms Ohnemus,."Having those kinds of numbers doesn't necessarily mean a higher number of conversions."In other words, it's the quality of the following not the size that matters.People who trust an influencer's opinion are more likely to buy the brand's goods, she says.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Reality TV star Marnie Simpson fell foul of the Advertising Standards Authority Of course, there are rules governing this sort of social media influencer marketing, so you have to be careful.Geordie Shore TV star Marnie Simpson recently got into trouble for uploading images of products from two firms she had business relationships with, without identifying them as adverts A spokeswoman for the UK's Advertising Standards Authority tells the BBC: "Our current codes state that if an advertiser gives payment to a social media influencer - this can be in the form of a monetary payment or a freebie - and there is control over the contents of the ad, the social media post would be considered an ad; thus the influencer must clearly indicate somewhere on the post that this is an advertisement."Know your customer One of the main advantages of an online business compared to a traditional bricks-and-mortar shop is the amount of data you can gather about your customers.You can find out which search words people use to find your business, for example, which images they respond to the most, and which website content they share on other platforms.This all helps to refine and target your marketing efforts.Free monitoring tools, like BuzzSumo and Metrixapp, not to mention Google Analytics, are all powerful helpers for the small business.Image copyright Gourmet Meat Club Image caption Gourmet Meat Club found that images of cooked food were more popular than raw ingredients Vikas Shah, visiting professor of entrepreneurship at the MIT Sloan School of Management, says: "You can easily start by using many free SEO [search engine optimisation] tools on platforms like Google and Twitter, and because this activity is very much results driven, you will see a fairly robust relationship between spend and return on investment."Gourmet Meat Club, an online provider of free range British meat, is one of the 54% of websites globally using Google Analytics to delve into customer quirks.Recent insights reveal that Android mobile users visit more web pages than those on an Apple phone, and images of cooked food generate more views in a digital ad campaign than images of raw ingredients.Furthermore, the technology tracks the most popular food searches online, giving Gourmet Meat Club the opportunity to create content based on the very latest trends.More Technology of Business Image copyright Getty Images "It's crucial to act fast," says Stuart Cordingley, the firm's managing director, "jumping onto popular searches as soon as they emerge to get ahead of the competition and be present where the public is discussing its new favourite food topics."This is the best way for the brand to get "ample exposure", he says.Data is now "central to the marketing mix".This up-to-the-minute content is sent to journalists and shared on the firm's own Facebook and Twitter pages.Social media marketing expert Andy Barr says it is an example of how online businesses are increasingly morphing into social media communities, creating content that positions them as authorities on particular topics.But he also advises supplementing this approach with social media advertising."As a general rule of thumb, it's worth spending between 7-12% of your total monthly revenue or income on social media promotion for the best results," he says.
Ever fancied joining a private members' club?:::::Image copyright Paul Winch-Furness Image caption The Hospital Club is one of a new breed of trendy private members' clubs A new breed of fashionable private members clubs are growing in popularity around the world, promising to be more inclusive and diverse than their stuffy older counterparts.Yet while the newer venues certainly have a far more youthful membership, and you certainly don't need to have gone to a posh school or university, they still have high joining fees and strict vetting processes.So how less elitist are they?And what are the benefits of getting your name on the list?"I like how organically relationships happen at Soho House," says tech entrepreneur Tyler McIntyre."You can't wear business suits, you can't hand out business cards, and you can't take phone calls."The 26-year-old joined Soho Beach House in Miami two years ago, after visiting with friends who were members."It's a laidback place to network but it's also given me the opportunity to try things I typically wouldn't do by myself, like wine tastings or a jam-making class.Image copyright Dave Burk Image caption Soho House New York has a rooftop pool "And sometimes I'll go to the sunset DJ parties by the pool, which are loud and pretty crazy."Welcome to the new breed of private members' club, which claim to be less restrictive and more diverse than the stuffy gentlemen's clubs of the past.These modern venues - with their co-working spaces, screening rooms and rooftop pools - are fast becoming the places where many of today's young creative class choose to work and play.Membership isn't cheap though, with some charging more than $2,000 (1,500) per annum, along with joining fees of $300.Image copyright Tyler McIntyre Image caption Tech entrepreneur Tyler McIntyre joined Soho House Miami two years ago "In the past, members' clubs were seen as being elitist and populated by people who went to the same public schools and universities," says Richard Cope, a senior trends consultant at Mintel."But these places are more for entrepreneurs and self-made people.The only thing you have to be able to do is pay the fee, and it can be fairly expensive."While trendy members' clubs have been around for years, they became much more common after the launch of Soho House in London in 1995.The trend has also gained a foothold in the US and other countries."We've see a huge jump in the number of the new types of club coming online, as compared to the traditional model," says Zack Bates of Private Club Marketing, a firm that promotes members' clubs.Image copyright Soho House Image caption Soho House Barcelona looks to attract creative entrepreneurs "In Los Angeles, you can't get into Soho House.So others are being built, the Hospital Club, Griffin House and Norwood, to keep up with the appetite for these spaces."Soho House itself now boasts 18 venues around the world, including in New York, Istanbul, Berlin, and soon Mumbai.Group revenue rose 3% in 2016 to 293.4m, while global membership jumped from 56,000 to 70,000.However, you have to do more than just fill out an application to join its venues.Membership costs between 400 to 1,580 per annum, depending on the club, although there are discounts for under-27s.Image copyright Soho House Barcelona Image caption The gym at Soho House Barcelona More stories from the BBC's Business Brain series looking at interesting business topics from around the world: Image copyright The Hospital Club Image caption The Hospital Club has a TV and music studio on site And there's a tough background check to ensure potential members are part of the creative class - Soho House frowns on those who work in financial services, for instance.Once accepted, members enjoy a host of perks.Soho House Barcelona, for example, one of the chain's newest venues, boasts a retro-themed gym, pool and free classes like yoga.Members pay full price for food and drink but get discounts on the club's hotel rooms.Mr Cope says: "These clubs offer people a discreet place to network and wind down, typically in cities where personal space is at a premium."However, they are also about "showing off to a degree"."In an age of social media, people like to let others know where they hang out or which restaurants they eat at.So there's an element of satisfying those peacock tendencies."Image copyright Richard Booth Image caption The Hospital Club says it provides its members with networking opportunities The newer clubs do serve more practical functions, though, such as offering young entrepreneurs a place to work.Take London's Hospital Club, based in Covent Garden, which offers its own meeting and conference rooms, and even an in-house TV and music recording studio.Standard membership costs 865 plus a 250 joining fee.While some might find such fees high, it's still cheaper than forking out for your own office space, says Mr Bates."It suits today's digital nomads, who work remotely via their laptops.Paying for an office can be prohibitively expensive, especially in a major city."Members' clubs also offer vital networking opportunities that help further your career, says Zikki Munyao, 40.The remote IT worker joined Common House, a private member's club in Charlottesville, USA, largely for this purpose.Image copyright Andrea Hubbell Photography Image caption The co-working space at Common House "There are areas to socialise and meeting spaces where I can have privacy," he says of the club, where membership costs $150 (113) a month, plus a $600 joining fee."I even met my estate agent over a game of pool."The new breed of members' clubs does face challenges, though.Some warn that as clubs proliferate, their exclusivity is becoming diluted, and they struggle to attract the celebrities that once lent them cachet.The social commentator Peter York tells the BBC: "Traditionally private members' clubs have played on their exclusivity and being able to attract the 'magic people'."But as more and more of them pop up, you get blase.The magical people also can't be corralled in one place anymore."He adds that as clubs like Soho House keep on expanding, they seem to be "more about business", which further dilutes their brand."The danger is that a new challenger, which looks younger and groovier, arrives and steals your limelight."But Mr Cope believes the market for these new clubs is going to expand."Having somewhere where you can unwind and host friends in the centre of cities is useful.So there are a lot of practicalities around this."It is also about expressing your individuality, so I think the emotional need for this is only going to grow."
The new port trying to fulfil our shopping obsession:::::Image copyright DP World Image caption DP World London Gateway opened in November 2013 Just five years ago, DP World London Gateway was still being dredged from the Thames.Now the UK's newest port is trying to lure the world's biggest ships to its quayside to get us our shopping quicker.You browse online, click on something you fancy, and lo and behold often as little as 24 hours later it's on your front door step.This seemingly magical process - a relatively recent phenomenon - is being made possible by one of the oldest industries on the planet - shipping.Most of us don't spend a lot of time thinking about how what we buy gets to us.Yet most of the clothes you wear, much of the food you eat, the TV you watch, your phone and even the materials for the house you live in will have come to you via a ship."You can put anything in a box more or less," quips James Leeson, head of port commercial, at DP World London Gateway.The boxes here mostly contain frozen foods such as chicken and beef, and fruit such as bananas.Occasionally they may contain the lifelong belongings of a family moving overseas, expensive cars, or even, as was the case recently, Virgin founder Richard Branson's yacht.The port officially opened for business just four years ago.Image copyright Thinkstock Image caption Most of what we buy arrives by ship The windswept, vast space has literally redrawn the Essex landscape.Situated 20 miles down the River Thames from London, in Thurrock, Essex, the port sits on a bed of sand and silt dredged from the Thames on the site of a former oil refinery.The 1.5bn construction saw a staggering 350,000 animals moved off site into new habitats.At one stage DP World's office building on the site homed tanks of great crested newts before they were moved into newly created ponds.It was planned long before the financial crisis when the world economy was booming and ports were struggling to handle the sheer volumes of goods coming in.The two busiest container ports in the south east are Hutchison Whampoa's Felixstowe, in Suffolk, and DP World's other port in Southampton.And so far the number of containers London Gateway has handled in its short existence has been dwarfed by its rivals.Last year, Felixstowe handled almost six times as many containers as London Gateway.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Most of the port's processes are automated Mr Leeson is undeterred - saying the company is in it for the long term."It takes a bit of time to get moving.Shipping volumes are up and we've got big names signing up to leases in logistics park," he says.The port's deep channels means it can handle the latest biggest ships, the so called Neo-Panamaxes.These giants, equivalent to the width and length of three football pitches laid end to end, are increasingly the way goods are shipped.Its other big advantage is that most of the port's operations are automated.In a space which is twice the size of the City of London just 500 people are employed.'Frictionless trade' This means faster "frictionless trade", says Mr Leeson.It is this that London Gateway believes will help it to gain more customers.Incoming trucks have to pre-register and are scanned on arrival, before being sent to a specific bay where an automated crane removes or adds their container, meaning they can be in and out in half an hour.The containers themselves are organised by huge cranes which stalk the landscape like Star Wars At-Ats.Like an oversized game of Jenga, where each container goes is carefully organised to make sure that the boxes which need to unloaded or loaded first are near the top.A sophisticated computer system continually tracks where the containers are in the port.Mr Leeson says this is crucial."It used to be that your box would arrive at port and you'd have no clue what happened.Now you can track it through port and see when it's ready for collection.Consumers are more and more demanding and we had to respond to that," he says.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Containers are continually tracked But it is the scale of its logistics park which DP World is betting on to be London Gateway's biggest lure.Currently most of the goods imported into the UK are taken by road, and some by rail, to big distribution centres in the Midlands, the traditional logistics hub for the country.This means shipped goods are often driven from the south, up north to be packaged or priced, and then driven back to the south where the majority of items are bought and sold.DP World believes the space it is offering will enable firms to process goods immediately after arrival, speeding up their deliveries to shops and to consumers increasingly used to Amazon Prime's 24-hour delivery promise.Environmentally it will cut carbon emissions, but crucially DP World also expects it to cut costs.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Consumers increasingly expect goods to arrive within 24 hours So far, parcel giant UPS and discount supermarket Lidl have taken space, with Dixons Carphone also reported to soon be opening up a warehouse.And fruit importer SH Pratt Group is getting ready to build a giant refrigerated facility for its new venture Halo, which will package chilled and frozen goods.Currently, the space is a muddy patch of wasteland, but Halo's managing director Gavin Knight says it will be up and running by next summer.He says the decision to choose London Gateway was "quite simple"."As soon as you put a container on wheels it adds cost.[This way] we're saving time, food miles and money," he says.Global Trade More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade: But Neil Davidson, shipping consultancy Drewry's senior analyst for ports and terminals, says firms will have to weigh up the advantages against the potentially higher cost of renting space and hiring staff in the south east.With the shipping market growing "steadily but not hugely", the only way for London Gateway to succeed will be to steal market share from its local rivals, Mr Davidson says.It's something that London Gateway has already started to do, albeit on a small scale.But Mr Leeson is confident its growth will continue, "We built London Gateway as a future proof model for future trade," he says.And its other big advantage as Brexit looms is that 99% of its trade comes from outside the EU."We are confident that whatever happens we will see an upturn in trade," he says.
Play it again: The firm saving vinyl:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption How a small company in the Czech Republic became the world's largest maker of vinyl records Whether gathering dust in your loft or currently spinning on your turntable, it's a fair bet that at least some of your vinyl records came from a small factory in the Czech Republic.The facility in question is the headquarters of GZ Media, based in the small town of Lodenice, 25km (16 miles) west of the Czech capital, Prague.GZ is today the world's largest producer of vinyl records, of which it expects to press 30 million this year, for everyone from the Rolling Stones and U2, to Lady Gaga and Madonna.The success of the company is a far cry from the early 1990s, when vinyl records appeared to be on the way out, with music fans having switched en masse to compact discs.Back in the early 1970s more than three-quarters of album sales were on vinyl, but by the 1990s that had plunged to just 1.5%.Image caption Producing vinyl records is a multi-step process "In 1993 our output was at its lowest, vinyl was almost dead," says GZ's chief executive Michal Sterba."If we'd have stayed as a vinyl-only producer in the 90s, GZ would be no more."The operation had only become a private company two years earlier after the fall of communism.Prior to that it had been a state-run enterprise called Gramofonove Zavody (Gramophone Record Factory) which had started in 1951, and had pressed records for the world's largest music companies.With demand for vinyl having dwindled, GZ realised that it had to diversify to survive, so it branched out into printing and making packaging for consumer goods.Image caption Michal Sterba is now expanding GZ, with new sister factories in the US and Canada Crucially though, it kept pressing vinyl to satisfy what little demand there was.At the lowest point in 1993 it made just 350,000 discs."We wanted to be the last company standing in the field of vinyl record production," says Mr Sterba.So when the resurgence of vinyl began around 2010, GZ was in a position to take advantage of it.Unlike most rivals, GZ still had the vinyl-making equipment and the expertise.Its successful diversification also gave it the cash to invest.Image caption The company has also seen a rising demand for picture discs Mr Sterba says: "Our competitors could buy machinery and materials, but the know-how is very hard to acquire."The firm's printing and packing capabilities give it another advantage over its rivals, he adds: "As well as producing the actual vinyl discs, GZ also makes the packaging, prints the artwork and any extras such as posters or booklet."One particularly tough job, he recalls, was producing a real metal zip on the cover of the reissued Rolling Stones' Sticky Fingers album.How vinyl records are made The original music, on tape or a digital file, is transferred to a diamond-tipped cutter This cuts a groove of the music into a steel disc coated in a layer of copper just 100 microns thick This master disc is then placed into a solution of nickel salt though which an electric current flows.This forms a layer of nickel on top of the copper The nickel layer is then peeled off, and has ridges that are a mirror image of the grooves on the master disk.This nickel plate forms the "stamper" that will imprint the vinyl Next the vinyl compound (a type of plastic) is heated to 160C, and the stamper is pressed into it with the weight of more than 100 tonnes, to produce one side of a vinyl record To keep up with demand, GZ Media's Czech factory now runs 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and employs 1,600 permanent workers.It's a fast-paced operation at every stage of the production process; from the initial stamping to the high-speed ballet of forklifts loading trucks for delivery.The company has invested $20m in equipment, building 12 new presses, but the old still runs alongside the new.Image caption GZ's Czech factory has a permanent workforce of 1,600 plus 400 seasonal workers Bright white, computer-controlled stations sit next to their huge, pale-green iron counterparts, still dripping oil into trays and buckets.GZ's revenues this year are expected to total $110m (83m), and are growing by 9-10% per year.Meanwhile, its vinyl output has tripled since 2010.For the industry as a whole, global sales of vinyl records are expected to reach $1bn in value this year.This may be just 6% of total music industry revenues but vinyl sales are now at a 25-year high.With most of its customers in North America, GZ recently bought a vinyl plant in Memphis, Tennessee, to supplement its Czech production.It has also opened a production facility in Ontario, Canada.Image caption Staff at the factory listen to the records to test them GZ still makes albums for small indie bands - the punk and metal bands that kept the company going in the 1990s, but now it also works with massive global stars."We'll still press 100 records for a small metal band," says Mr Sterba, "but we're also pressing 100,000 for U2.""As for the future," he says, "we're concentrating on making a success of our plants in North America.But in the longer term, we think manufacturing in Asia and preferably Japan [as well], is the right thing to do."This is the third story in a new series called Connected Commerce, which every week highlights companies around the world that are successfully exporting, and trading beyond their home market.Yet, while vinyl sales are growing, some who buy the records don't actually play them.Last year a BBC/ICM poll found 48% of those questioned said they'd never played the vinyl they'd bought and 7% said they didn't even own a turntable.These fans buy a vinyl album for the "feel" of owning a physical object and for the artwork that often comes with it - but they never actually play it.Image caption Staff at GZ had to add a real metal zip to the cover of the Rolling Stones album Sticky Fingers While vinyl sales are growing, they remain tiny compared with their 1980s heyday, says Paul Lee, a music industry expert at accountancy group Deloitte."Vinyl's first and biggest peak was back in the 80s when a billion records, just albums were sold per year.This year we're expecting about 40 million, so it's about one 25th... so it is nothing like that we had back in the 80s."Image caption The company can make vinyl records in any colour Mr Lee adds: "The reality is vinyl is a lovely product, it's also very difficult to consume compared to just tapping in the name of a song on a smart phone... so we would expect the market to be approaching a peak."Yet with music giant Sony announcing earlier this year that it was to re-open its vinyl manufacturing plant in Japan for the first time since 1989, it doesn't look like the vinyl revival is coming to an end any time soon.
The problem facing Trump's China probe:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Trade tensions will be top of mind during US President Donald Trump's visit to China When US President Donald Trump visits China, one subject high on the agenda will be the sweeping trade investigation of Chinese policies that he ordered in August.The White House said it would probe practices that encourage the theft of intellectual property from US businesses - a long-simmering source of tension in the US, Europe and elsewhere.The Chinese government has said the inquiry was a "serious concern" and has warned that it will not sit back if the US takes actions it deems unfair.But one of the biggest challenges for Mr Trump's investigation comes from his own country.Since the White House started its inquiry, a slew of US business groups have submitted formal comments describing their concerns.But just six companies have proved willing to come forward with complaints, according to the public record of comments.Many of them are smaller businesses describing already known incidents.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The US could risk a trade war with one of its biggest trade partners Analysts say companies are hesitant to put at risk their access to one of the world's biggest markets by speaking out.But the decision to stay quiet has consequences: it is likely to limit the administration's ability to build a strong case against China.It may hurt the ability to identify effective remedies, while also making unilateral action more appealing to the White House."It's going to be a huge problem that companies are unwilling to provide specifics because it's going to be very difficult for the United States government to take effective action," says Lee Branstetter, a professor of economics and public policy at Carnegie Mellon University.Intellectual property The White House's focus on intellectual property theft in China follows years of concerns in the US, Europe and elsewhere over counterfeit goods, piracy, hacking, patent violations and other forms of theft.The Commission on the Theft of American Intellectual Property estimates that the annual cost to the US economy from counterfeit goods, pirated software and theft of trade secrets is between $225bn and $600bn.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption General Motors, which has opened factories in China, is among those working with local partners In recent years, the US says the Chinese government has encouraged some of those practices as part of its economic and national security strategies.Those involve state-backed enterprises and are focused on boosting certain industries such as aerospace, robotics and biotech.The US inquiry asked for information about topics including policies that pressure companies to share information with local business partners; opaque approval processes; and possible cyber espionage backed by the government.But previous US efforts to tackle the issue have been hindered by the hesitance of major companies to speak out, says Phil Levy, senior fellow at the Chicago Council on Global Affairs."This has been the problem," says Mr Levy, who served as a trade economist under former President George W Bush."If you want to say China has these violations and we are acting in response to that... you need to have that fairly well documented.And to do that you need to have the co-operation of the companies involved."Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Beijing has promoted renewable energy and US firms in the industry have been among the few to speak out Edwin Rogers is co-founder of Bonumose Biochem, a small Virginia-based start-up that was one of the six companies that shared its complaints.In his case, he says scientists in China filed a copycat patent for a process of making a healthy rare sugar - technology that he believes his company had purchased rights to after acquiring a firm last year.The scientists worked in the US for that firm, he says.They are affiliated with the Chinese Academy of Sciences, a government-backed entity, and have political connections.He says he felt a "duty" to come forward and hopes his story will help the White House craft a response.China's response The office of the US Trade Representative, which is leading the inquiry, did not respond to requests for comment about the investigation.China maintains it has responded to concerns, pointing to laws that forbid intellectual property theft, success by western companies in Chinese courts, and its own efforts to address cyber crime.In September, after the Trump administration launched its investigation, it announced a four-month crackdown focused on intellectual property and foreign investors.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption China says it has made strides to prevent intellectual property theft In comments submitted to US investigators, Chinese organisations told the US that decisions to establish joint ventures and share technology are voluntary agreements between private companies.They cast government initiatives, such as Made in China 2025, as "promotional" - not mandatory - programmes.Some US businesses also defend China's approach.William Mansfield is the intellectual property director at Abro Industries, a 25-person company based in Indiana that makes products such as glue and tape for sale overseas.He says he has spent years fighting against counterfeiters in China - and has figured out successful ways of using China's system, like asking for help from local authorities instead of immediately pursuing a lawsuit.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption President Trump has reportedly told advisors he wants "tariffs" He says US companies often don't understand how China works and unfairly blame problems on the government."I've just never seen anything that would lead me to believe it's anything other than individual counterfeiters acting to maximise their profit and not really caring about the rules," he says.What next?Many US analysts expect the White House to find fault with Beijing; pointing to the growing corporate involvement of the Communist Party and rules that require foreign companies in some sectors to use local partners.But it is unclear what the White House might do after that.The US could work with the Chinese government, collaborate with other countries to craft a response, bring a complaint in an international forum such as the World Trade Organisation, or take unilateral action.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The US has long had concerns over Chinese intellectual property theft and hacking That risks triggering a trade war but President Trump - who has repeatedly attacked China while dismissing international pacts - may be more open to that approach, Mr Levy says.The White House China's strategy remains unclear as different advisors appear to promote clashing approaches, he adds.Investigation of Chinese steel companies, for example, has not led to action.The White House also wants Chinese cooperation as it responds to missile tests from North Korea."It's hard to puzzle out what they're doing," Mr Levy says.Business concerns US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross says he expects addressing the issue to take time.But he says the US is looking for immediate deals, like ones struck between Boeing and Saudi Arabia, as a sign of good faith.Many businesses remain worried the White House could damage the US relationship with China to satisfy isolationists among President Trump's supporters.Erin Ennis, of the US China Business Council, says about 20% of its members have faced pressure in China to transfer key technology in recent years, but adds that they also report that the environment in China is improving.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Chinese President Xi Jinping visited a US Boeing plant in 2015.Aerospace is one of the industries the Chinese government has promoted She urges the administration to focus on specific changes in China, rather than simply imposing penalties, such as sanctions.For example, China could stop making a distinction between foreign and domestic companies, she says.Even without testimony from major companies, associations like hers have provided enough suggestions for the White House to work with the Chinese government, says Ms Ennis.But Prof Branstetter says the US will need to take stronger, more targeted action if it expects intellectual property thefts to stop.He says it doesn't have the information to do so now and he has doubts about this administration's abilities to craft an adroit response."It's easy to see this going badly," he says.
What happens to Mexicans returned from US?:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption There were protests over the threats to deport undocumented young migrants from the US Hundreds of thousands of Mexicans are deported to their home country each year from the United States.The Trump administration's pressure on undocumented young migrants - the so-called "Dreamers" - could mean many more coming home.But what are so many returning people going to do?Starting a new life in Mexico has been harder than expected for Reyna del Rio, a 29 year old who spent most of her childhood in South Carolina before returning to Mexico.Like many returning bilingual Mexicans, she was able to get a job at a call centre.Tough returning But the long hours and angry customers started to take a toll on her.A new initiative by Mexico's public education ministry, known by the Spanish acronym SEP, could be her ticket to a stable career."If you work at a call centre you do things repeatedly.I don't see it as enjoying my job," said Ms del Rio.Image caption Reyna del Rio has returned to find work in Mexico, having left for the US as a young child "I would like to teach and learn new skills.I would like to pass on what I've learned because I think it will fulfil me more than just doing customer service."She is part of a group of young deportees and voluntary returnees who are in the process of applying for English teaching positions through SEP.It's a project trying to make the most of their English language skills.For more than 600 new teaching jobs, the education ministry adapted the application process to encourage repatriated Mexicans.There were changes to make the positions more accessible to returnees, who often face bureaucratic roadblocks related to their time outside of Mexico.The goal is twofold.It aims to provide employment for young deportees and help Mexico reach its goal of being bilingual - in Spanish and English - in 20 years."We made that clause flexible particularly for repatriated Mexicans, because the idea is that no one who might have the possibility of being an English teacher should be left without the chance of doing so," said Mario Chavez Campos, director of the general directorate of higher education for professionals in education, an office within SEP. 'Dreamers' sent back As well as those deported, there are others returning by their own choice, although often forced by the lack of higher education and job opportunities.This was the case for Ms del Rio, who left South Carolina at the age of 18, hoping to access better educational opportunities in Mexico, when she couldn't get financial aid as an undocumented student in the US.Image copyright Reuters Image caption Prototypes for the proposed border wall between the US and Mexico When she arrived in 2009, she barely remembered the country she left when she was five years old.But she persevered."We have the culture of never giving up," Reyna said of her fellow "Dreamers"."We have always had to fight for many things."These undocumented young people, who might have come to the US as children, are feeling vulnerable.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Looking through from Mexico into New Mexico in the US President Donald Trump decided in September to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals programme, known as DACA.This allowed young undocumented immigrants to work legally in the US and be temporarily shielded from deportation.About 800,000 youths received protected status under DACA, and more than 600,000 were from Mexico.Many could soon face deportation as their DACA permits expire in the upcoming months.Retraining as teachers Mexico has pledged to support returning deportees, with initiatives to help them access employment, health and education.But many of these still remain promises.So far 80% of the returned deportees trying to get a job as an English teacher through SEP have had difficulty meeting requirements, primarily for reasons related to their time spent outside of Mexico, according to Israel Concha, founder of the New Comienzos group which support people returning to Mexico.More from Global education Ideas for the Global education series?Get in touch."They have to understand it's an emergency," said Mr Concha, a deportee himself."Tomorrow if thousands of people get deported because there is no immigration reform or there is nothing for DACA, we need to be ready and the federal government is not ready."To be eligible for teaching, all candidates must have their US schooling recognised in Mexico, pass a test in Spanish grammar and Mexican history, and earn a college degree.The scheme intends to break down the barriers returnees face in completing these steps, but there are still discussions about how to achieve this.Mexican dream Not all bilingual deportees have the training required to become a teacher, so the SEP is brainstorming other ways to incorporate Dreamers into English language lessons at public schools, such as through conversation clubs or as teacher's assistants."This call for English teachers is just the first step," said Mr Chavez Campos of the public education ministry."From there, we have a list of the dreamers and deportees who are interested in participating in the national English strategy."Image copyright Reuters Image caption What opportunities are there for those returning to Mexico?He says this is Mexico's "rapid response to the migration policies of the US".Working as an English teacher would mean a new start for many of Mexico's deportees.If selected to be an English teacher for SEP, Ms del Rio would receive much more than the minimum wage with a starting salary of about $1,100 (830) per month, plus benefits and holidays.Unlike working in a call centre, an English teaching position would provide a long-term career."We need more opportunities where we can have a job where we can retire," said Mr Concha."That's what we are looking for: the actual American dream in Mexico.""The Mexican government wants to make Mexico bilingual in 20 years," said Mr Concha."What better place to start than the dreamers that are coming back?"
What will Brexit mean for our bacon?:::::The United Kingdom imports the majority of the pork products we consume, from loins to bacon.With 17 months to go until we are due to leave the European Union, how will Brexit affect our pork?Denmark is the main supplier of the UK's imported pork.There are thousands of pig farms across the country and pork is the Danes' third most valuable export.And it is Jutland which is the heart of Danish pig country.At one farm, Baldershave, 35,000 pigs are born every year.Soren Sondergaard's farm has been in his family for five generations and the UK is one of their biggest markets.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Denmark is the largest overseas supplier of pork products to the UK "We follow it a lot, and we keep an eye on what is happening in the UK at the moment," says Mr Sondergaard."We hope of course we can continue to do trading together, but we have 130 markets all over the world which we will be looking to instead if it will be a hard Brexit."The Danish port trade with the UK started 150 years ago, and now about 25% of all UK imported pork products come from Denmark.What might happen to food exports after Brexit?The single market has meant there are no tariffs on the food we import from this Nordic country.There have been warnings from the meat industry that if the UK adopts world trade tariffs then imported food could be more expensive.Transport Secretary Chris Grayling said earlier this month that the UK would respond by: "Growing more here and buying more from around the world".Image caption Soren Sondergaard hopes that Brexit won't significantly affect Danish pork exports to the UK At the annual conference of the Danish pig industry, there is a positive mood about Denmark's future trading relationship with the UK.Brexit is one of the key issues on the agenda."The ideal situation for us would be that the UK would remain within the European Union, that unfortunately is not going to happen," says Christian Fink Hansen, from the Danish Agriculture and Food Council."So we hope that we will reach an agreement that will be as close as possible to the current situation."Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Rearing pigs is big business in Denmark Mr Hansen adds: "We have high levels of animal welfare, high veterinary standards."The alternatives for you would be to look to Brazil, to Canada, to the US, where they have lower standards of animal welfare."At its facility in the Danish city of Horsens, staff at Danish Crown - the world's largest pork exporter - are preparing pork loin which will be sent to the UK to be cured and made into back bacon."The only thing we know is uncertainty, and the one thing we know we don't like as a business is uncertainty," says Lars Albertsen, head of exports at Danish Crown.Image caption Lars Albertsen hopes that Denmark's close ties with the UK will limit the impact of Brexit on Danish pork exporters "We don't know what the trade agreement with the UK will be, but we know there is a need for imports [in the UK]."And we also think the affinity there is between Denmark and the UK, especially with food, will prevail.We need the UK and the UK needs us as well."The majority of the pork exported from Denmark to the UK travels via Esbjerg on the country's west coast.Daily shipments sail to Immingham in Lincolnshire, and currently there are not any border checks.Authorities at the port of Esbjerg are now closely watching what is happening across the North Sea."The UK is one of our top five export markets for Denmark," says Jesper Bank, the chief operating officer at the port.Image caption Jesper Bank says that Danish ports can cope with any extra Brexit paperwork "The total value of our exports [to the UK] is about 10bn euros ($12bn; 9bn) a year, so obviously we are concerned about what is going to happen [with Brexit]."Mostly our concerns are not about the practicalities of what will happen, we are quite sure that if we get administrative burdens we can sort some of those out with the technology."But some of our concern is what will happen in the UK.Will your economy slow down?Will the buying power of the British people slow down?".British hauliers have warned that the possible introduction of checks for goods coming into the UK could lead to queues at both British and continental ports.Mr Bank says that he and his team are confident about their ability to cope with the possible changes."We are aware that even small delays in times can have effects on ports due to custom clearance," he says."This will obviously create some sort of line in this port we have the capacity to cope with that, but I'm aware that some of our colleagues in the UK will have raised this issue."
How solar-powered suitcases are helping babies in Nepal:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The solar suitcase was the brainchild of obstetrician Dr Laura Stachel and husband Hal Aronson, co-founders of We Care Solar Hari Sunar is a 24 year-old mum whose second child is due in a few days.She walked from her home in the remote Nepalese village Pandavkhani for her final antenatal check up at her local birthing centre through shuddering thunder, a drenching rainstorm and one of the village's frequent power cuts.These power cuts can last up to two weeks and used to cause the birthing centre significant problems.But now it has its own power solution.The light in the birthing centre stays on and she smiles."I am really happy," the young mum says."Because we have a solar light at the birthing centre."That light is powered by a bright yellow suitcase bolted to the delivery room wall.This is a solar suitcase.Image caption Hari Sunar's final antenatal check at Pandavkhani health post in Nepal Connected to a solar panel on the roof, the device is a miniature power station that provides light, heat and battery charging and a baby monitor.Life saving For local midwife, Hima Shirish, the solar suitcase has been a lifesaver.She was determined find a solar solution for her health centre's energy problems.A charity called One-Heart Worldwide sourced the solar suitcase and installed it in Pandavkhani in 2014.Since then there have been no maternal or baby deaths here."Pregnant mothers used to be afraid of the dark when they came to give birth at the health post," Hima says.Image caption Midwife Hima Shirish switches on the solar suitcase to power life-saving medical equipment "They feared losing their babies.But now the fear is gone and they are relieved that they are going to have a baby using the solar light."Off-grid solution The solar suitcase is the brainchild of California-based obstetrician-gynaecologist Dr Laura Stachel of We Care Solar.While in Nigeria in 2008, she witnessed complications and even deaths when babies were delivered at night without reliable light or power.Dr Stachel devised a suitcase-sized, off-grid, solar electric system with her husband, solar engineer, Hal Aronson.The prototype was so successful in Nigeria, they decided to bring the innovation to clinics and health stations in other countries with high rates of maternal and new-born baby mortality.Earthquake challenge In Nepal, the 2015 earthquake destroyed many of its hospitals and left most of the remaining facilities without reliable power.Weighing just 16kg (35lbs) solar suitcases were ideal for deployment over tough terrain.They provided life-saving power to makeshift medical and birthing tents in the immediate aftermath of the quake.The BBC's Innovators series reveals innovative solutions to major challenges across South Asia.Ever heard of the concept of "jugaad"?It's a Hindi term meaning cheap innovation.If you have

able to generate the electricity its people need."There are a lot of maternity or small clinics in rural areas where they have no electricity at all."Up to a third of rural areas have no reliable power, says Raj Kumar Thapa, managing director of Solar Solutions Private Limited.Government schemes to increase small-scale power generation using solar, wind or hydro have had limited success, he says, because it is difficult for private companies to install and maintain systems in remote areas while still making a profit."So as long as the users are provided with proper training on the operation of the system I think there is a bigger role to play for solar energy especially on a charitable basis in Nepal."Before the birthing centre was built in Pandavkhani in 2013, most babies were delivered at home, sometimes by torchlight or in total darkness.Image copyright We Care Solar Image caption The 16kg solar suitcase was light enough to be deployed to remote earthquake zones in Nepal In difficult cases, mothers in labour would be taken on a 65km (40-mile) mountainous trek over mud and rocks to the hospital in the nearest town, Baglung."Some babies were in the wrong position and we did not have the equipment to help them," Hima recalls."Mothers used to die from haemorrhaging."Now Hima and her staff are also able to charge their mobile phones, another vital piece of kit in this remote part of the world."Sometimes the power cuts can last for 15 days," Hima explains."We used to be completely out of contact because we could not charge our mobile phones."Mrs Sunar is just one of 175 mothers who have already given birth at the centre at least once.As she waits to deliver her second child, she is reassured by her experience during the birth of her daughter."When I was in labour with my first child I arrived at the health post and the light had just been cut.But the health worker said they had a solar suitcase so I didn't need to worry."
Somalia's 'touch and feel' e-commerce hit:::::Image copyright Innovate Ventures Image caption Muraadso co-founders Abdiqani Ibrahim, Hamse Musa and Saed Mohamed When Saed Mohamed, a young entrepreneur from Somalia, pitched his online shopping business Muraadso as part of an East African start-up competition in 2015, he was prepared for rejection.And rejection is what he got.Abdigani Diriye, head of the Somalia-based accelerator, Innovate Ventures, which oversaw the competition, was not impressed."We had a few applications from e-commerce start-ups and they just weren't really doing it for me," he told the BBC.But Mr Mohamed and his team were not about to give up."We have had a lot of rejections and we have learned to be persistent.We wouldn't take no for an answer," he says.They did eventually get on the programme and ended up winning it."The irony is they went on to become the most successful start-up we took on," joked Mr Diriye.But the business they were pitching - a online store selling mainly electronics - "failed miserably" at first, admits Mr Mohamed.Image copyright Muraadso Image caption Users can see goods before they buy by visiting one of Muraadso's three offline stores It seemed Somalia wasn't ready yet for online only.Perhaps this isn't surprising given that less than a third of its 14 million people are able to access the internet and few have bank accounts.It's an uphill struggle to get any online business off the ground.So he looked to how Western retailers were combining offline and online sales to revive the flagging brand."The hybrid model is the thing right now.Amazon has opened a physical store and Walmart and other traditional retailers are acquiring e-commerce sites," he told the BBC.Muraadso did the same and "sales sky-rocketed," he said.Opening bricks and mortar stores in three different cities meant that potential buyers could go and touch the goods first before committing to buying them.The site offers traditional home deliveries and flexible ways to pay, including cash on delivery.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Amazon opened a physical bookstore in Seattle in November, 2015 Many purchase are made via mobile money transfer service, Zaad, which operates in a similar way to Kenya's famous M-Pesa platform.Zaad has an 80% market share in Somalia, charging no fees to send or withdraw money, but making its money instead from offering extra services and mobile airtime."The hybrid model wasn't a concept that I was familiar with, but Muraadso started implementing it late last year and they have been growing ever since, going from a three-man team to employing dozens and looking to raise another round of funding," says Mr Diriye.E-commerce in Somalia is nascent, and across Africa generally, online shopping remains niche, says Matthew Reed, a consultant at research firm Ovum."Many people are still living on desperately low incomes, so e-commerce is really just for the middle classes.And there are other big challenges for e-commerce firms, not just in Somalia," he says.Image copyright AFP/Getty Images Image caption Terrorism, drought and famine have hampered Somalia's technological progress Chief among them is lack of infrastructure - both decent roads that enable quick and efficient deliveries, and the telecoms infrastructure that allows people to access the platforms in the first place.But things are changing.Millions in Africa have bypassed traditional telephone landlines and leapt straight to mobile - the oft-quoted "leapfrog" effect.According to mobile body the GSMA, there will be 725 million unique mobile subscribers on the continent by 2020.And Somalia is benefiting from this improved connectivity.In 2013, fibre optic firm Liquid Telecom connected the East African country to its network of cables, which now spreads 50,000km (31,000 miles) across 11 other African countries."There is increasing connectivity, mobile is increasingly widely available, and more of that is data-enabled with the increase of 3G and 4G networks," says Mr Reed.More Technology of Business Image copyright Getty Images "Devices are also becoming more affordable."Changing social and cultural patterns of behaviour, an increasingly youthful population, and urbanisation, mean the stage is set for e-commerce to thrive, he believes.According to Mr Mohamed, Facebook is "huge" in Somalia among younger people, so Muraadso is aggressively exploiting the platform to market its products, gaining 25,000 likes along the way.It aims to have 100,000 by the end of the year.Perhaps unsurprisingly, South Africa has the most mature e-commerce market in Africa, with others such as Kenya and Nigeria gaining user quickly.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Jumia delivers goods via scooter and offers a variety of payment options Online retailer Jumia is in all three countries and, while it offers a very similar set of services to global market leader Amazon, there is one crucial difference."They realised that they couldn't just copy-and-paste the approach and methodology of Amazon because of factors such as infrastructure, access to couriers and cultural preferences," explains Dr Diriye.So Jumia pioneered the idea of letting customers see the goods before they paid for them.Safari.com, Kenya's leading communications firm, recently announced that it would be launching its own online shopping offering by the end of the year and it plans to expand that service beyond Kenya.Muraadso is still small - its turnover is at around $40,000 (30,000) a month - but already it has a rival - Samionline - and Dr Diriye predicts more will follow."Every day another one pops up in Somalia as the digital wave starts to flow," he says."People are getting online, becoming more tech-savvy and the cost of owning a smartphone is falling."The benefits to the people of Somalia go beyond access to better quality goods and more choice, he adds."It also saves them time as they don't have to travel to town, and it saves them money because they don't have to pay for a bus."People are more productive with their time, and when you multiply that to a whole city or country, the impact can be very significant."
Countdown to Brexit: How to divide food sold to the EU:::::Image copyright Getty Images Here's a Brexit recipe: lamb with grapes and lemon.I haven't tried it, but the recipe does exist and it looks delicious in the pictures I've seen.It also gives us the ingredients for looking at one of the food issues that comes up as the UK prepares to leave the European Union.All of them are covered by a trade arrangement that most people have spent their lives blissfully unaware of.It goes by the name of "tariff rate quotas".Now what on Earth does that mean?When countries import goods, including foods, they often impose a tariff, a tax that is applied only to traded goods.The UK does not currently have its own national tariffs.They are set by the EU for all member nations.Countries and blocs of countries such as the EU, that are members of the World Trade Organization, have made commitments to the others that the tariffs will not exceed certain levels.Many countries have agreed to import a certain quantity of some goods at a lower or even zero tariff, as a negotiated compromise between the interests of: overseas exporters domestic producers concerned about exposure to foreign competition consumers That quantity of goods that gets in on the lower tax rate is called a tariff rate quota.It is a bread and butter dish on the trade negotiating menu, routine enough to have its own acronym, which is TRQ.TRQs are often used for farm products.The EU has about 100, negotiated at the WTO on behalf of all member states, which currently have an impact on the UK.All three of our ingredients have a TRQ for imports into the EU.Image copyright Getty Images In the case of lamb, 280,340 tonnes a year can be imported at a reduced tariff.There's a quota for table grapes of 1,500 tonnes, and for lemons it's 10,000 tonnes.So how does Brexit come into this picture?The UK and the remainder of the EU have to work out how to divide the existing TRQs.The EU doesn't want to take the existing TRQs for the 28 states and use them for the remaining 27, because each EU country may end up importing more food on the low tariffs, therefore creating tougher competition for EU farmers.Image copyright Getty Images Unlike on many other Brexit issues the UK and the EU actually agreed, and told the other WTO members, in a letter, that they wanted to divide the TRQs in line with recent trade flows.That would mean, for example, the UK taking a large share of the quota for lamb because comparatively the UK has been importing more lamb than the other EU countries.But the proposal was met with a raspberry by several countries, including the United States, Canada and New Zealand.Although the UK-EU proposal would give the same total TRQs as today, they would lose flexibility.As things stand, if the price of lamb fell in the UK, they could divert some or all of it to other parts of the EU.After Brexit, that would not be possible.Image copyright Getty Images The other WTO countries feel they should be compensated with a higher combined TRQ in order to maintain the same commercial benefit they currently enjoy.In other words, they see Brexit as an opportunity to negotiate better access for their goods to Europe.There is another option.In some cases, the UK could decide to remove the tariffs altogether.Now, some economists think we should do that anyway with all tariffs, that Brexit is a glorious opportunity for unilateral free trade.This seems politically unlikely for products where there are UK producers.In our recipe, lamb is a case in point.Unrestricted tariff free access for lamb from anywhere in the world would be a problem for many British lamb producers.With lemons, that is not an issue.We are not citrus producers.There are British table grapes.It's not a big industry, but it is a new one so that might need some consultation with producer and consumer groups too.There's another complication: cross-Channel trade.British farmers can now automatically sell, for example, their lamb to France tariff free.The same applies to French cheese sold in the UK.Depending on what sort of deal there is, that might not be true after Brexit.So will the UK and the EU get some share of each other's TRQs?That's another thing to be negotiated.Read more from Reality Check Follow us on Twitter
Managing the managers: The rise of the business 'philosopher-kings':::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Are the new ideas and approaches pioneered by management consultants worth their fees?The place: a textile plant near Mumbai, India.The time: 2008.The scene?Chaos.Rubbish is piled up outside the building - with almost as much inside.There are piles of flammable junk, and open chemical containers.The yarn is at least bundled up in white plastic bags, but the inventory is scattered around the plant in unmarked piles.Such shambolic conditions are typical in the Indian textile industry, and that presents an opportunity.A team of researchers from Stanford University and the World Bank is conducting a novel experiment.They're going to send in a team of management consultants to tidy up some of these companies - but not others.Then they'll track what happens to their profits as part of a rigorous, randomised controlled trial.It will tell us conclusively whether the management consultants are worth their fees.50 Things That Made the Modern Economy highlights the inventions, ideas and innovations which have helped create the economic world in which we live.It is broadcast on the BBC World Service.You can find more information about the programme's sources and listen online or subscribe to the programme podcast.That question has often been raised over the years.If managers often have bad reputations, what should we make of the people who tell managers how to manage?Picture a management consultant.What comes to mind?A young, sharp-suited graduate, earnestly gesturing to a bulleted PowerPoint presentation that reads something like "holistically envisioneer client-centric deliverables"?Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Some management consultants are criticised for their reliance on business jargon Okay, I got that from an online random buzzword generator.But you get the idea.The industry battles a stereotype of charging exorbitant fees for advice that, on close inspection, turns out to be either meaningless or common sense.Managers who bring in consultants are often accused of being blinded by jargon, implicitly admitting their own incompetence, or seeking someone else to blame for unpopular decisions.Still, it's big business.The year after Stanford and the World Bank started their Indian study, the UK government alone spent well over $2bn (1.5bn) on management consultants.Globally, consulting firms charge their clients a total of about $125bn (94bn).'Noble' origins Where did this strange industry begin?There's a noble way to frame its origins: economic change creates a new challenge, and visionary men of business provide a solution.In the late 19th century the US economy was expanding fast, and thanks to the railway and telegraph it was also becoming more of a national market and less a collection of local ones.Company owners began to realise that there were huge rewards to be had for companies that could bestride this new national stage.So began an unprecedented wave of mergers and consolidations.Image copyright Alamy Image caption Heinz, which dates back to 1869, grew substantially at the beginning of the 20th century Companies swallowed each other up, creating giant household names: US Steel, General Electric, Heinz, AT&T.Some employed more than 100,000 people.And that was the challenge: nobody had ever tried to manage such vast organisations before.Enter a young professor of accountancy by the name of James McKinsey.His breakthrough was a book published in 1922, with the not-entirely-thrilling title Budgetary Control.Accounting for the future But for corporate America, Budgetary Control was revolutionary.Rather than using traditional historical accounts to provide a picture of how a business had been doing over the past year, McKinsey proposed drawing up accounts for an imaginary corporate future.These future accounts would set out a business's plans and goals, broken down department by department.And later, when the actual accounts were drawn up they could be compared to the plan, which could then be revised.McKinsey's method helped managers take control, setting out a vision for the future rather than simply reviewing the past.Image copyright McKinsey & Company Image caption James McKinsey saw the potential of setting out a corporate vision of the future McKinsey was a big character - tall, and fond of chomping cigars, ignoring his doctor's advice.His ideas caught on with remarkable speed: by the mid-1930s he was hiring himself out at $500 (380) a day - about $25,000 (19,000) in today's money.And as his own time was limited, he took on employees.If he didn't like a report they wrote, he'd hurl it in the bin."I have to be diplomatic with our clients," he told them."But I don't have to be diplomatic with you bastards!"Aged just 48, James McKinsey died of pneumonia.But under his lieutenant, Marvin Bower, McKinsey & Company thrived.Bower was a particular man.He insisted that employees wore a dark suit, a starched white shirt, and, until the 1960s, a hat.McKinsey & Co, he said, was not a business but a "practice".It didn't take on jobs, but "engagements".It was not a company, but a "firm".Eventually it simply became known as "The Firm".'Business philosopher-kings' Duff McDonald wrote a history of The Firm, arguing that its advocacy of scientific approaches to management transformed the business world.It acquired a reputation as perhaps the world's most elite employer.The New Yorker once described McKinsey's young Ivy League hires parachuting into companies around the world as a "Swat team of business philosopher-kings".But hold on.Why don't company owners simply employ managers who've studied those scientific approaches themselves?There aren't many situations where you'd hire someone to do a job, and also hire expensive consultants to advise them how to do it.What accounts for why companies like McKinsey gained such a foothold in the economy?Part of the explanation is surprising: government regulation.The Glass-Steagall act of 1933 was a far-reaching piece of American financial legislation.Image copyright Alamy Image caption The Glass-Steagall act - signed by Franklin Roosevelt in June 1933 - was meant to limit conflicts of interest Among many provisions, Glass-Steagall made it compulsory for investment banks to commission independent financial research into the deals they were brokering.Fearing conflicts of interest, Glass-Steagall forbade law firms, accountancy businesses and the banks themselves from conducting this work.Effectively, the act made it a legal requirement for banks to hire management consultants.In 1956 the Justice Department banned the emerging computer giant IBM from providing advice about how to install or use computers.Another business opportunity for the management consultants.More from Tim Harford: How market research revolutionised advertising and shopping How a creative legal leap helped create vast wealth How much wealth is hidden offshore?The great intellectual property trade-off Minimising conflicts of interest was a noble aim, but it hasn't always worked out well.Some time after McKinsey's long-serving boss, Rajat Gupta, left the firm, he managed to get himself convicted and imprisoned for insider trading.McKinsey also employed Enron's Jeff Skilling, and then was paid for advising him, before quietly fading into the background while Enron collapsed and Skilling went to jail.Here's another argument for employing management consultants: ideas on management evolve all the time, so maybe it's worth getting outsiders in periodically for a burst of fresh thinking.'Land and expand' But often it doesn't work like that: the consultants continually find new problems to justify their continued employment.Some use the analogy of leeches, attaching themselves and never letting go.It's a strategy known as "land and expand".One UK government ministry recently admitted that 80% of its supposedly temporary consultants had been working there for more than a year - some for up to nine years.Needless to say, it would have been much cheaper to employ them as civil servants.No doubt the consultancy firms will claim that their expertise is giving the taxpayer value for money.Which brings us back to India, and that randomised controlled trial.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Management consultants saw an opportunity in the often shambolic Indian textile industry The World Bank hired a global consulting firm to put some structure into these jumbled Mumbai textile factories, instituting preventive maintenance, proper records, systematic storing of spares and inventory, and the recording of quality defects.It worked.Productivity jumped by 17% - easily enough to pay the consulting fees.We shouldn't conclude from this study that cynicism about management consulting is always misplaced.These factories were, after all, what a jargon-filled PowerPoint presentation might call "low-hanging fruit".But it's scientific proof of one thing, at least.As so often in life, when an idea is used simply, and humbly, it can pay dividends.Tim Harford writes the Financial Times's Undercover Economist column.50 Things That Made the Modern Economy is broadcast on the BBC World Service.You can find more information about the programme's sources and listen online or subscribe to the programme podcast.
The woman who won the lottery and used it to do good:::::Image copyright AFP Image caption Rachel Lapierre set up Le Book Humanitaire after winning the lottery What would you do if you won the lottery?Buy a new house, a sports car, or travel the world perhaps?But how many of us would use our winnings to set up a charity?That is exactly what Rachel Lapierre, a former Miss Quebec, did back in 2013.The Canadian always loved volunteering, and after running her own modelling agency and working as a nurse, she was looking for a way to follow her idol, Mother Teresa, and dedicate her life to charity.Then fate came knocking when she won a lifetime salary of C$1,000 (605) a week in the Quebecois lottery "Gagnant vie", or "winner for life".Image copyright Andreane Williams Image caption Ms Lapierre meets a family of Congolese refugees living in Quebec "At first I couldn't believe it, but I didn't celebrate or shout it from the rooftop because I had made a promise to the universe and I was determined to keep it."I wanted to do something I loved for the rest of my life.I wanted to help others," she says.It took Ms Lapierre only two months to quit her nursing job and launch her own charity, Le Book Humanitaire.Her non-profit organisation, which is located in Saint-Jerome, about 60km north west of Montreal, uses social media to connect those in need with people who can help.Image copyright Rachel Lapierre Image caption Ms Lapierre became Miss Quebec in 1982 On its Facebook page, which has 22,000 followers, those who are struggling can let the community know about their plight.At the same time, members of the public can advertise services or goods they want to donate."Let's say that you have clothes to give away.We will put you in contact with a family that needs those clothes and will allow you to go give them yourself," Ms Lapierre explains."It's not only about material things.You might end up driving a cancer patient to a doctor's appointment."It's a far cry from Ms Lapierre's former career in the more glamorous, and some might argue consumerist, world of modelling.More The Boss features, which every week profile a different business leader from around the world: In the early 1980s she joined a local modelling school where she was encouraged to enter the Miss Quebec beauty pageant.To her surprise, the then-21-year-old won the contest."I thought modelling was for tall blondes with blue eyes and I was short and brunette...But I am so glad I entered, it was a great experience."The following year she toured Canada as Miss Quebec and even got to meet Rene Levesque, the then-premier of Quebec.Image copyright Andreane Williams Image caption Ms Lapierre meets with a family of Syrian refugees in Saint-Jerome It inspired her to set up her own modelling school in 1984, to teach young women how to build careers in the industry.It had about 10 staff."Running my own business taught me about accounting and how to manage employees," Ms Lapierre says.She closed the business in the late 1980s to focus on bringing up her four children, but also dedicated herself to voluntary work - making numerous trips with humanitarian organisations to places like India and Haiti.It was this passion that led her to set up Le Book Humanitaire four years ago.This year, the charity has made 15,000 "direct actions" in Quebec, ranging from furnishing an apartment for a family of Syrian refugees, to finding a home for a homeless mother who had just given birth.Image copyright Andreane Williams Image caption The charity donates food to those in need She has also funded the organisation - which has 10 full-time volunteers and its own board - entirely by herself, investing $70,000 to date."This weekly C$1,000 I get from the lottery allows me to not go to work anymore and finance my organisation," she says."I pay for things such as our office rent and other administrative costs."There are limits to Ms Lapierre's budget, though.After she was interviewed by a popular Quebecois television station earlier this year, Le Book Humanitaire saw a huge increase in its Facebook followers, from around 4,000 to more than 20,000.It led to an influx of requests for help, as well as donations, and the charity has struggled to keep up.Image copyright Andreane Williams Image caption A volunteer, Ms Lapierre and her sister Guylaine discussing strategy at the charity's offices It needs to open several new facilities to store donated items, but Ms Lapierre can't afford to do this alone."We are counting on municipalities to lend us offices and make donations," she says."But there are always ways to make things work."Growing pains Jean-Pierre Tchang, the founder of IRIS Mundial, a non-profit group that works to improve visual health in developing countries, says that building a successful charity is not easy."The main difficulty is money and getting funding," says Mr Tchang, who worked with Ms Lapierre earlier in her volunteering career."You also have to know your limits.You can start feeling overwhelmed by all the work and forget oneself...I am sure Rachel's nights must be very short."Despite the challenges, Ms Lapierre shows no sign of slowing down.She is also taking a workshop class on managing non-profit organisations to get better at what she does.She continues to get joy from her work, which, she says "is nothing like running a regular business" and instead "feeds her soul"."Volunteering work represents billions of unrecorded dollars across the world.Without it, the world would not function."
How Facebook saved a dying mill town:::::Image copyright Alan Brandt A mill town with high unemployment has seen its fortunes changed by Facebook's need for data servers.But will the town have to radically change to save itself?The people of Prineville live deep in a valley surrounded by dense forests.In the 1800s, it was the first place in central Oregon where white settlers drove out Native Americans to start a city.Steve Forrester's grandparents got here in 1902.When he was growing up in the 1970s, Prineville felt idyllic."It was a magical, magical place to grow up," he remembers."My dad worked in the sawmill industry as an electrician; my mom didn't work.We all learned to hunt and shoot a gun."We all learned how to drive in the forest before we were 16.In the spring, we could snow-ski in the morning and water-ski in the afternoon."And everybody had a job, and everyone did well."Prineville was the largest producer of ponderosa pine in the world.But when the federal government restricted logging and increased protections for animals like the spotted owl, the city's milling industry was decimated.As an adult, Forrester took a job with one of the few remaining mills, because he wanted to live in Prineville.Eric Klann was driven by the same devotion.He's the seventh generation of his family to live here.Out of college, he also took a job in Prineville that he knew wouldn't last."There was always a little voice in the back of my head saying, 'What are you doing - you want to be here, but you're in a dying industry,'" he says.A few years later, the US housing bubble burst and demand declined for parts made by the last mills.Lots of people lost jobs and left.It felt like Prineville couldn't catch a break.Image copyright Alan Brandt Image caption One of Prineville's new kind of "factory" - a data server farm Both Forrester and Klann felt lucky to land jobs at the city - Forrester as city manager, Klann as city engineer.Their chance to save Prineville arrived in 2009 in the form of a mysterious email from a company called Vitesse."For the longest time, we had no idea what Vitesse meant," he says.All Klann knew is that Prineville's natural resources made it perfect for a new industry - the information industry, created to save the massive amounts of information people post on the web.Vitesse wanted to build a big warehouse and fill it with rows and rows of servers - servers that tend to get hot.Central Oregon's cold nights could cool them naturally.Klann remembers the first in-person meeting with Vitesse, and how it felt like Prineville's last chance."Right before I walked into our conference room to meet with their nine lawyers, I got an email and our unemployment rate had peaked at 23%," Klann says."I got that email and I walked into that room, and I kept thinking, 'I better not screw this up.'"Klann and Forrester decided to outperform the other cities Vitesse was considering.They showed the company their small town could move at big-city speed, by responding to Vitesse's questions day and night."What we heard back is that other cities weren't doing that," Forrester says.Their strategy worked, and in 2010, Prineville finally learned who Vitesse actually was."They had the big finger with a thumb-up Facebook sign, and we all pressed the button and it lit up, et cetera," Mayor Betty Roppe says, recounting the new data centre's groundbreaking."That was the big announcement - it was Facebook."It was Facebook's first data centre of its own.Mark Zuckerberg was there, and Roppe had planned to give him a cowboy hat to show the city's pride in its cowboy culture."Cowboy hats are not cheap.They said, 'Do not get Mark Zuckerberg a cowboy hat.He does not want a cowboy hat.'OK.So, I got him a hoodie.He wears hoodies all the time," she says.When she presented the gift, Roppe gave Facebook's founder a kiss on the cheek."He just blushed like he wanted to have the floor open up and swallow him."Image copyright Rupa Shenoy Image caption Mayor Betty Roppe oversaw Prineville's transformation after data centres were built in the city Seven years later, Facebook has two more data centres in Prineville and six others across the world.Apple's moved into Prineville, too - it's built three data centres here.All of them sit high above Prineville's valley, in huge, long, flat buildings painted pale blue and grey so they blend in with the sky.About 500 employees work in the centres, most of them from Prineville.Security's tight, so few other people ever see inside.Despite their low profile, the data centres have had a profound impact.Roppe says the mills taught Prineville a lesson - not to rely on just one industry.So they're putting in things that appeal to lots of employers - like good roads, walking and biking paths, modern wastewater treatment, a new hospital and a state college outpost.But now that the city's successful, officials have a lot more to think about.Like, how do you slow success down?"We can keep the small-town feel.I'm sure of it," Roppe says."We don't want to be a big city."The cost of housing is up, so city officials know they have to build more affordable housing.And Mayor Roppe's own granddaughter, with a college degree, can't find a living wage job.So, they have to keep bringing in new employers.All city manager Forrester can do is calibrate the development carefully.He worries about Prineville changing too much, too."We are small-town people.We live the Western lifestyle," Forrester says."The quiet and peace of central Oregon is a beautiful, beautiful thing, and to be able to make a living here is tremendous."But Forrester says he's seen that central Oregon towns that don't adapt will die.And he knows they have to risk changing Prineville in order to save it.The World is a co-production of the BBC World Service, PRI and WGBH.This piece is part of the series 50 States: America's place in a shrinking world.
Are too many tourists visiting Iceland?:::::Image copyright Getty Images An explosion in tourism saved Iceland's economy.But in a country of just 300,000 people, how much tourism is too much?It's a cold, overcast and blustery day in Iceland, but that hasn't put off the busloads of tourists at the Blue Lagoon - one of the country's most popular attractions.The lagoon is a pool of geothermally heated water.It is rich in minerals and is said to be good for your skin.Its creation is something of an accident.Locals noticed the run-off from a local geothermal power plant was a strange shade of blue and started bathing in it.Located between Reykjavik and the airport, it's now become a "must-do"' on tourist itineraries."In our first year in 1994 we had about 50,000 guests, and this year we will be welcoming 1.3 million," says Grimur Smundsen, the Blue Lagoon's chief executive.That success reflects the astonishing growth of tourism in Iceland as a whole.Last year 1.7 million people visited Iceland - more than triple the number that came in 2010, when the small island nation of just 330,000 was still reeling from a catastrophic banking crisis and the eruption of Eyjafjallajkull - a volcano that grounded air traffic across Europe for a week.Image caption This year 1.3 million tourists will visit the Blue Lagoon, says Grimur Smundsen At the time the eruption was seen as a disaster for tourism, but that pessimism proved ill-founded."In the long term it had a tremendous positive effect because Eyjafjallajkull was one of the things that put Iceland on the map."Mr Smundsen says."Maybe tourists heard of Iceland for the first time in the various airports when they were stranded."The sudden interest from travellers could not have come at a better time.When Iceland's three major banks collapsed in 2008 at the height of the financial crisis, there were fears they would take the rest of the economy with them.Nine years later the economy is growing at more than 7% a year, unemployment is less than 3% and foreign currency is rolling in.The tourism boom is leading to a construction boom and the creation of tens of thousands of jobs."Tourism really helped us take off," says Gylfi Magnusson, a professor at University of Iceland and a former minister for economic affairs after the banking crisis."Certainly the recovery would have taken considerably longer if it hadn't been for this unexpected boom."But the sudden influx of foreign visitors has not come without problems.Some sites lack the infrastructure to cope with the rising numbers.Image caption "We don't have any neighbours anymore," says Reykjavik resident Benony Aegesson In summer Reykjavik's restaurants are filled to capacity.There is a shortage of hotel rooms, meaning that AirBnB has flourished, and Reykjavik's main shopping streets have been turned into a stream of tourist shops selling Icelandic wool jumpers and soft toy puffins."We don't have any neighbours anymore," says Benony Aegesson, who has lived in downtown Reykjavik since the 1970s.He says virtually all the flats around his home are now rented out to tourists."It was very fashionable for young people to live here, but the prices are getting so high that the young people can't afford it anymore."Speculators have come here and bought up apartments and stores and we're worried about its future as a residential area.If it's only old people and tourists here, there is a danger it will die."Is there a limit to the number of tourists a small nation like Iceland can accommodate?Inga Hln Plsdttir is the director of Visit Iceland, and has been in charge of promoting Iceland as a tourist destination for the past decade.She says the question is a difficult one to answer.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Areas outside the capital Reykjavik are looking for more travellers to come and visit, says Inga Hln Plsdttir "If you said there would be five million people coming to Iceland in five years and you told me they would all be coming to Reykjavik, i would really worry," she tells me."But we've been putting the focus on the other regions of Iceland.If you get numbers like that spreading around Iceland, visiting other communities then you have a completely different scenario."At this point I don't think we have an overflow - if you talk to someone just outside Reykjavik they're complaining that they want more travellers to come and visit them."I asked long-time Reykjavik resident Benony Aegesson if he would ask people not to come to Iceland on holiday."No, I wouldn't do that," he says: "We're not against tourists per se, but nobody wants to come to a ghost city.Of course they saved us from our financial crisis - that we are grateful for."
The flying drones that can scan packages night and day:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Pinc's flying drone scans warehouse packages Flying drones and robots now patrol distribution warehouses - they've become workhorses of the e-commerce era online that retailers can't do without.It is driving down costs but it is also putting people out of work: what price progress?It could be a scene from Blade Runner 2049; the flying drone hovers in the warehouse aisle, its spinning rotors filling the cavernous space with a buzzing whine.It edges close to the packages stacked on the shelf and scans them using onboard optical sensors, before whizzing off to its next assignment.But this is no sci-fi film, it's a warehouse in the US - one of around 250,000 throughout the country, many gargantuan in size: retail giant Walmart's smallest warehouse, for example, is larger than 17 football fields put together.And these automated drones are now doing the jobs humans - on foot, or operating fork-lift trucks and mechanical lifts - used to do: and they're doing them more cheaply and more accurately."Every year companies lose billions of dollars due to misplaced items and faulty inventory records in their warehouses," says Fadel Adib, an assistant professor of media, arts and sciences at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.Image copyright Hardis Group Image caption Hardis Group's EyeSee drone can fly autonomously "Today's inventory management requires workers to scan items manually, which is a very time consuming and error-prone process.It's impossible to keep track of all items in the warehouse."Two drones can do the work of 100 humans over the same time period, according to supply chain specialist, Argon Consulting.This means they can do several tours of a warehouse - even at night - compare results, identify discrepancies, and build up a much more accurate picture much more quickly.Drone makers claim scanning accuracy of close to 100%.Matt Yearling, chief executive of Pinc, one of the firms offering such aerial robots, says they can save warehousing and logistics companies millions of dollars."Nobody has 100% accuracy - including Walmart and Amazon," he says."For a warehouse that is 95% accurate, it means that 5% is ambiguous.So if the warehouse is storing $100m [75m] worth of inventory, then $5m is uncertain."Typically the retailer will have more than one warehouse.So, if you multiply the problem across the warehouse network you are talking big dollars."Pinc's drones use hydrogen fuel cells, enabling them to fly for up to two hours - four times as long as some battery-powered drones.More Technology of Business Image copyright Getty Images French firm Hardis Group has also launched an inventory-scanning drone - EyeSee - and emphasises how autonomous it is."Flight orders and flight plan execution are ensured by our Android application," says Stephane Cadenet, manager of the firm's drone programme."Our solution is simple to use: no installation, no infrastructure adaptation and no driver.The only thing to do is unpack the drone.The calculation of the flight plan is automatic."Other companies, such as Infinium Robotics, have also developed drone scanning systems.Of course, retailers have been using robots and automated systems in warehouses for some years.In 2012, fashion brand Net-A-Porter said its robot pickers were already 500% faster than humans, while online retailer Amazon's Kiva robots have almost become famous.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Instead of humans walking miles to pick goods, these robots take the shelves to the pickers "Innovators are working to make drones and robots an integral part of warehousing, inventory, and logistics," says JP Gownder, a principal analyst at research firm Forrester."Over the next 10 years, these technologies look set to revolutionise these spaces."But all this cost saving and efficiency comes at the expense of jobs for humans.The $2.3tn e-commerce industry is huge and growing, but almost 75% of e-commerce companies employ no more than four people.So it is no coincidence that in the US some 89,000 shop workers were laid off between October and April this year, while employment in New York City clothing stores has declined for three consecutive years.Forrester estimates that automation technologies, including artificial intelligence, will replace 17% of US jobs by 2027.And growth in new types of employment will not be enough to compensate."Automation does create opportunities for new jobs - equivalent to 10% of today's jobs," says Mr Gownder."But that still leads to a net 7% loss of jobs due to automation, which has to be made up by macro-economic growth, non-automation related jobs, and monetary policy."Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The Ocado warehouse run by robots Ryan Bax, industry analyst for mobility at research consultancy Frost & Sullivan, concedes that the use of drones and robotics in warehousing will lead to job losses, but believes growth elsewhere will compensate for this."As automation reduces the demand for lesser qualified jobs, the need for specialised skills within the logistics sector will grow," he maintains.And he thinks automation tech may even become mandatory once it has been shown to reduce accidents in the workplace."The use of automated technologies will permit warehouses to operate 24-hour days and improve stock management accuracy, but beyond this they will provide significant benefits to safety within the workplace."This will be small comfort for the thousands of warehouse workers displaced by drones and robots, but it is the inevitable consequence of our desire for online convenience, cheaper prices and faster deliveries.
What's behind the rise of Asia's stock markets:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Analysts believe the strong appetite for Asian stocks can continue Memory chips and China's economic muscle are among the factors that have put a rocket under Asian stocks this year, pushing markets to record or multi-year highs."Everyone hated Asia markets for a long time," says Josh Crabb, head of Asian equities at Old Mutual Global Investors."Now we've moved on from there".Moved on indeed: South Korea's Kospi sits at a record; Japan's Nikkei 225 index is above a two-decade high; Hong Kong's Hang Seng is around a 10-year peak, while markets in India, Taiwan and Indonesia are among the others scaling fresh heights.It's an unusual moment for equities in the region as strong corporate profits, economic stimulus and growth are overshadowing nearby political risks."Markets seem impervious to events," says CMC Markets analyst Michael McCarthy."Sabre-rattling from North Korea barely makes a dent".And some analysts argue that as long as US markets keep their cool, there's plenty of good times for investors in Asia still to come.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Many markets in Asia are trading at historic or multi-year highs Since the 2009 crash, global markets have been moving steadily higher - with a few stumbles en route.Regional growth Massive liquidity coupled with ultra-low interest rates has created a fertile environment for stocks to thrive.Asia has enjoyed a tailwind from record gains on Wall Street.At the same time, China's economy - aiming for 6.5% growth this year - has been underpinning the broader region for some time.The world's second largest economy has a big impact on the fortunes of other countries, even as its growth rate moderates.Take South Korea: It's seen double-digit export growth for the last 11 months, thanks largely to China, which buys about one-quarter of its products sold offshore."China's improving economic conditions can really be seen as a trigger for the equity run in Asia," says IG Markets analyst Jingyi Pan.Image copyright AFP Image caption Asia is home to two of the world's three largest economies, China and Japan Japan's economy is also gathering steam.Exports are climbing and strong domestic spending on devices like cameras and computers from China is driving growth.Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's re-election, and the likely continuation of his Abenomics policies, was met with cheers from investors.Ed Rogers, chief executive of Rogers Investment Advisors in Japan believes the benchmark Nikkei index can track even higher."Japan has a long way to go.There's $18tn in cash on the sidelines," he says, adding that most of that money is currently invested in low-yielding Japanese government bonds."There's a similar boat load of money that wants to get out of China," Mr Rogers says.Earnings bump That money could find plenty of homes in Asia where equities are cheap relative to other parts of the world.Companies in the region are strengthening, and well-received results this earnings season have given markets a boost.For South Korean firms, the outlook is even brighter.CLSA analyst Paul Choi says at the beginning of 2017, people were expecting 10% corporate earnings growth, now that forecast is around 50%.It's got a lot to do with memory chips.Higher prices for chips used in electronic devices have spurred index heavyweights like Samsung and SK Hynix, as well as the broader market.In fact, Mr Choi says that fluctuations in the value of memory chips is more threatening to South Korea's market than provocations from its northern neighbour.Which brings us back to North Korea.Image copyright AFP Image caption North Korea insists it needs a nuclear-weapons programme to ensure its survival Investors appear largely unshaken by displays of military aggression - missile tests and provocations against Japan - and analysts say markets have factored in the risk.Rogers Investment Advisors Mr Rogers describes the North Korea threat as "kind of overblown".That attitude will shift dramatically if threats turn to action.Until then, other risks to the Asian rally loom larger.'Unknown' threat Turning off the stimulus tap and the ratcheting up of interest rates will dampen enthusiasm, while analysts point to China's ballooning debt as another threat to the region.Mr Rogers says political risk and "unpredictability" hang over Asian markets and unexpected moves could stunt recent rallies.The threat of the "unknown" is a familiar refrain from market-watchers in the region."The most damaging risks are the ones we don't forecast," says CMC Markets' Mr McCarthy.A final recurring note of caution is the rush on Wall Street.Recent gains have been inspired by strong earnings, along with hopes of tax reform and business friendly policies under President Trump.But the chorus of concern about the market's sharp rise is growing on Wall Street.History shows a gradual climb-down from the record highs on US markets is unlikely, and a collapse could shock the world."If the US blows up, most things will come off.[Asia] won't be immune," says Josh Crabb of Old Mutual Global Investors."Markets tend to get euphoric and then they get fearful.Theoretically you shouldn't have boom and bust, but human behaviour drives stock markets more than logic."
The US and Iranian battle over the pistachio nut trade:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Relations between the US and Iran have an outsized impact on the global trade in pistachios There are lots of casualties in international conflicts but this one is nuts, you might say - although strictly speaking the pistachio is a seed.The international pistachio trade has faced unexpected headwinds due to the tensions between Iran and the US.The global pistachio industry is a multi-billion dollar a year sector that is continuing to grow in value as its popularity as a foodstuff grows.The US and Iran dominate the world's trade in pistachios - collectively controlling between 70% and 80% of yearly output for the last decade.Over the last forty years, Iran's growers have faced pressures from sanctions, tariffs and restrictions on their ability to access international financial tools.Although pistachios themselves were not on the list of sanctioned products, restrictions on global banking made trade difficult for Iranian farmers.All that changed in 2016 following the Iran nuclear deal, officially The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA).This agreement with the US and its allies removed sanctions.It wasn't just Iranian oil that came flowing back onto the international market, pistachio exports began gaining overseas markets.Trump's threat That progress could face challenges though.US President Donald Trump called the agreement created under his predecessor the "worst" deal the US has ever made.In October he decertified the agreement.The move passes responsibility to the US Congress to evaluate and determine whether it believes Iran is compliant with the terms and if the US should remain in the deal.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Over 90% of US pistachios are grown in California President Trump said in the speech announcing his decision that the agreement "threw Iran's dictatorship a political and economic lifeline," but had failed to prevent Iran's "sprint" towards nuclear weapon development.For Iran's pistachio industry the threat of losing the deal and reinstating sanctions could mean the return of what Hojat Hassani Sadi, deputy director of the Iran Pistachio Association calls "unfair and unequal competition".Ancient roots The pistachio industry in Iran dates back thousands of years.By contrast, pistachio farming in the US started in the 1930s with Persian seeds.The boom in commercial pistachio cultivation came after the US severed ties with Iran following the 1979 hostage crisis, after which the US and its allies placed sanctions on Iran.Over the next several decades, even in countries where Iranian pistachios were welcomed, restrictions on its companies' ability to access international financing made it hard for the industry to flourish.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Archaeological evidence suggests pistachios were first grown in what is now Iraq in 7,000BC During that time the US market expanded, with farmers - mainly across California - planting the crop.But in 2014. hot and dry weather conditions across the western US cost the industry nearly half its crop and cut profits for 2015 - the year those nuts were sold - by close to $1.4bn (1bn).Globally, pistachio prices rose, but for Iran's growers it was also an opportunity.Price competition The price of pistachios has been on the rise since 2002.Richard Matoian, executive director of the American Pistachio Growers (APG) trade association, attributes this to increased awareness of their health properties and global demand for healthy snacks."The industry has been pushing the products with advertising," he says, adding that middle-class demand in developing markets has also boosted exports.Global Trade More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade: Increased demand in China has been key to sector growth.Between 2008 and 2013 Chinese imports of US pistachios rose 146% according to APG.But the 2014 drought saw the price of California's nuts rocket from $3/lb (453g) to over $5/lb.By contrast Iran's pistachio yield that year was strong.In markets like China, they were able to undercut American prices by close to $0.20/lb.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Pistachio plants grow best in arid climates but that leave crops vulnerable to water shortages A strong growing year in 2016 has helped the US market recover and led to a moderation in price.But Iran has another advantage that helps it in global trade - its location."Iran has a transportation advantage.They can certainly take markets away and China is an example of that," says Mr Matoian.Uphill march The advantages and disadvantages for Iran are not only linked to sanctions.Iran claims its pistachios have a better taste, as do several large European distributors, though the US and Iran mainly grow the same strain.(Turkish pistachios, for example, are a different variety.)The US also imposes a 241% tariff on Iranian pistachios meaning even without sanctions the US market has been all but cut off for Iran.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Aging water infrastructure in Iran is a major difficultly for Iran's farmers Water shortages are another problem for Iran.According to Mr Sadi it is the "major obstacle to growth" for his industry.Iran's pistachio sector is second in the world following the strong 2016 season in the US.And with the two countries dominating so much of the global market, Iran isn't in dire need of a comeback.But for the growing number of pistachio fans around the world increased access to Iran's pistachio exports and decreasing prices would be a sweet outcome.
The 350 million people who don’t officially exist:::::Image copyright Getty Images Whenever any report has a "global" subject matter it's never long before there's a massive, global-size statistic, counting people by the millions and billions.News reports on global problems like to gesture to devastation and deprivation on an epic scale, counting out the suffering in numbers so big that they almost lose meaning.And maybe they actually do go astray.Because the annual monitoring report on education from the United Nations education agency, Unesco, makes the point that global figures on access to education could be out by a factor of 350 million.That's not a minor gap in the headcount.That's the equivalent of the combined populations of the UK, Germany, France, Italy and Spain.Undocumented and invisible These "invisible" people, below the demographic radar, are described as "the poorest of the poorest".These are families growing up in places where censuses and administrators do not reach.These are millions of unregistered lives in sprawling slums around some cities in the developing world, or in families living illegally and undocumented as migrants.Unesco's report says that the conventional means of gathering information - such as household surveys, censuses and records of birth and death - are only likely to be accurate for populations that are settled, visible and accessing services.Image copyright EPA Image caption How accurate are international figures on education targets?Shifting and excluded populations, even in their tens of millions, are harder to identify and can slip away from the spreadsheets and the data gatherers.Children living on the streets might not show up in the numbers not making it to school.They won't even count enough to be absences.The homeless or nomadic are missing from population studies going from house to house.Unwanted refugees driven over borders by political violence can be left uncounted and unrecognised by reluctant hosts.The UN agency estimates an undercount of 250 million in household surveys used in developing countries and says another 100 million are likely to be outside the reach of official statistics, including those living as illegal immigrants in wealthier countries.Taking account This year's education monitoring report focuses on accountability.But the Unesco study highlights that holding governments accountable for failing to deliver education services depends on knowing how many people need to be supported.More from Global education Ideas for the Global education series?Get in touch.International goals to cut illiteracy and increase access to school places need to recognise that some of the most disadvantaged are not even part of the target.Unesco says that it raises the question of who is responsible for people who don't even appear in national figures.Such discrepancies appear in the UN agency's own range of figures.Unesco says that its annual statistics for children without access to school include an estimate for those hard to reach communities.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption More pupils are getting access to school - but 264 million are still missing out But in comparisons for inequalities in access and public spending on education, Unesco says these "invisible" millions are not included.The UN agency makes the point that if the "mantra" of the current development goals is that "no one is left behind", for hundreds of millions, they never even get as far as being recognised as existing.As such, "no one is ultimately held to account for protecting their rights".Missing school This year's newly-released figures show 264 million young people without access to primary or secondary school.The report warns of six successive years in which education has received a declining share of aid budgets.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Undocumented migrants and the homeless can go below the radar of official figures And an international group of former education ministers, the Atlantis Group, including former UK education secretary Nicky Morgan and US education secretary Arne Duncan, has called for a greater commitment to aid for education.Last month, another UN agency, Unicef, reported there had been "nearly zero progress" in the past decade on improving access to school in the poorest countries.And earlier this month, Unesco's Institute for Statistics warned of a "staggering" problem in lack of quality in schools, with more than 600 million young people who have been to school but are lacking basic skills in literacy and numeracy.Counting in education and making education count remain a challenge.
Why businesses are saving the humble text message:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The firm that sends two billion text messages per year If you think that WhatsApp is killing the humble text message you may need to think again.A growing number of us are sending far fewer text messages than we used to.Armed with our fancy smartphones, in recent years we have instead switched to the likes of Facebook Messenger, Google Hangouts, Snapchat, and of course WhatsApp for our chats.As a result, the number of text (or SMS, as they are officially known) messages being sent per day around the world has now fallen far behind the more hi-tech rivals.At WhatsApp alone, 55 billion messages are now sent globally every day, more than twice the 22 billion figure for SMS messages.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption People are switching from texts to the likes of WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger Yet while the number of text messages being sent by people in the developed world has fallen since 2011, there continues to be one big growth area - notification SMS messages sent from businesses to customers.Most of us are now increasingly receiving such text messages on a regular basis, such as when you are being reminded of an opticians' appointment, when an engineer will come to repair your boiler, or when a delivery is going to arrive.One company at the forefront of this business text messaging industry is a small English firm Esendex, based in Nottingham, in the East Midlands.With just 200 employees, it now sends out two billion text messages per year, on behalf of 30,000 businesses and other organisations, up from 100 million texts in 2010.Image caption Businesses are now increasingly sending text messages to their customers Esendex is already the biggest player in the UK, France and Italy; it is growing strongly in Germany, Spain and Australia.And it is a lucrative business.Esendex has annual revenues of 23m a year, as firms pay it a fee for every text sent.Meanwhile, a report earlier this year predicted that the global business text message industry would be worth $70bn by 2020, up from $55bn in 2014, as more and more texts are sent out to customers.Geoff Love, Esendex's chief executive, says while friends may like to chat over Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp, there are a number of key reasons why businesses prefer to send out text messages instead."SMS is the only app that's on every phone in the world, so no matter who you are trying to communicate with, you know they can receive a text message."Test messaging facts SMS stands for Short Message Service The first text was sent in 1992 by British software engineer Neil Papworth.It read simply "Merry Christmas" 15.2 million texts are sent globally every minute Text messages are read, on average, within five minutes of being received Text messages are up to 160 characters in length Google is working on a new version of text messaging called RCS or Rich Communication Services, which aims to make it more similar to WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger "That's not the same with WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger or any of the other applications.SMS is simply ubiquitous," he says."SMS is also very powerful - people read text messages.95% of text messages are read within five seconds, so you know your message will get there quickly and cheaply."And with SMS we know that the text message has been delivered to the person's phone."Image caption Geoff Love says firms use SMS because it is on every mobile phone in the world Majority-owned by a private equity firm, Esendex is continuing to quickly expand overseas through a determined acquisitions policy.Given that the global marketplace is a crowded one, with a large number of firms touting to help businesses send out text messages to their customers, mobile phone industry expert Ben Wood, says Esendex is right to have wanted to grow quickly."It is a cutthroat business, down to fractions of a penny in terms of margins," says Mr Wood, who works for research group CCS Insight."So scale is all important, companies need to be growing in the space in order to make sure that they're able to buy messages at scale, and therefore compete when they're tendering for business."Image caption Esendex's head office is in Nottingham With its main overseas offices in Barcelona, Spain, and Melbourne, Australia, plus others in France and Italy, Mr Love says an attempt to break into the US market failed."Melbourne and Barcelona grew quickly, [but] things were tougher in America, and we ended up closing down our American operation."Not all of the [US] mobile telephone networks could communicate with each other, so you'd be in a situation where you might send a message and it wasn't received because the two networks didn't have any kind of agreement between them to receive messages, which was crazy."This is the second story in a new series called Connected Commerce, which every week highlights companies around the world that are successfully exporting, and trading beyond their home market.The first feature in the series, looked at a Canadian winemaker who has to battle winter temperatures of less than -25C."In Europe, whilst it appears to be more complicated because people speak different languages, in reality they are far more similar," says Mr Love.Yet there are some differences in Europe, he adds, with companies in Germany demanding far more stringent tests on the software and technology.Image caption The global mobile phone market is taking over the world Entering the Australian market also brought an unforeseen issue - due to the time difference it can't shut down its UK head office computer systems overnight for maintenance, because it is daytime in Australia."It forced us to become a 24/7 business," says Mr Love."That was quite hard to begin with because it meant changing the way we operated... but in the end it turned into quite an advantage because the companies we are working with are using us for mission-critical stuff 24/7 anyway."Our customers are in every single industry you can think of, it could be a very small business or a massive enterprise.But typically it's organisations who really need to communicate with a large number of people very quickly."
Could this 10-year-old fix Pakistan's waste problem?:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Zymal Umer has discovered there is money to be made in recycling "If people just thought for a moment before dumping their rubbish then maybe they wouldn't do it as it harms our environment."Zymal Umer, 10, sighs as she takes in the view of a makeshift rubbish dump on the outskirts of her hometown Sargodha in Punjab, Pakistan.But could the girl dubbed the country's "youngest social entrepreneur" by many have a solution?For now, there are colourful piles of plastic bags, metal and general waste as far as the eye can see.Wafts of smoke fill the air with a putrid and toxic stench as much of the refuse is set on fire.What's in front of Zymal is just the tip of the iceberg that is Pakistan's problem with waste.According to the country's environment protection department, 20m tonnes of solid waste is generated a year and the figure is growing by 2.4% annually.Landfill issues "This is a situation you can find across all of Pakistan - these bags are not biodegradable and people carelessly discard them.They don't really think about recycling," Zymal says.Image caption Zymal turns old newspapers into gift bags Proper solid waste management has never been practiced in the country; only half of the rubbish generated is collected by the government and there is a severe lack of adequate landfill sites.Dumping and burning remain the most common methods of disposal and much of the uncollected waste poses serious risks to public health.Beautiful bags Zeebags is Zymal's bid to try to reduce pollution and increase awareness about the environment.The schoolgirl turns old newspapers into bright and beautifully decorated gift bags which are then sold to family and friends and most of the profits distributed to various local charities.In the space of just three years she has gone from selling a few bags to selling hundreds - worth $4-5,000.Image caption Pakistan has a real problem with waste "I learnt to make the bags by watching YouTube."It is hard to balance my schoolwork with running Zeebags, so I make them at the weekend or during the holidays with my cousins."My father and grandfather pay for my raw materials and if they didn't help me, it would be very hard to keep my project going," she says.One charity Zymal's money goes to is called SOS Children's Villages, which helps orphaned and destitute children across Pakistan.Image caption Zymal has used the money she has raised to help other children "Through my income I've been able to pay for water coolers, washing machines, batteries and the type of things they need for daily life," Zymal explains."To see the happiness on their faces gives me a lot of satisfaction and motivation to carry on."Her innovative and charitable enterprise has attracted a fair bit of attention with TV and newspaper coverage labelling Zymal as "Pakistan's youngest social entrepreneur".Award winner Zeebags has also won a number of awards in Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and the USA."I was very excited to get some international recognition for my work and proud to get some positive exposure for my country and parents."Image caption Zymal believes her business has the potential to grow much larger Selling online has opened up her business to a new world of possibilities."In Pakistan it's thought girls cannot work independently but I haven't faced any difficulties and my aim is to continue my work."I want to become a businesswoman in the future and expand Zeebags through my website and showcase other people's products, too."The BBC's Innovators series reveals innovative solutions to major challenges across South Asia.Ever heard of the concept of "jugaad"?It's a Hindi term meaning cheap innovation.If you have created a life hack or innovation that you are proud of, or spotted one while out and about on your travels, then share your picture with us by emailing yourpics@bbc.co.uk, use the hashtags #Jugaad and #BBCInnovators and share your picture with @BBCWorldService, or upload your submission here.Learn more about BBC Innovators."My biggest ambition is to grow my project not just in Pakistan but also globally," she says.Kalsoom Lakhani is founder of Invest2Innovate, an organisation that helps start-up companies in Pakistan grow and attract funding.She says the country needs to think about the future for entrepreneurs."While we have this enormous potential we need to be always thinking, how we enable that potential and how we continue to not only allow young people to start a business but allow them to grow businesses."Pakistan has already begun to tackle its environmental problems through legislation, establishing government agencies and accepting technical help from international donors.But the response is still fragmented and not a particularly high priority in a country racked with more pressing security and political issues.Image caption Zymal has to balance her social enterprise with her schoolwork This gives Zymal's work even more urgency.She hopes her success will start to change people's minds about the seriousness of taking care of their environment."It is important so future generations can live in a clean and safe world," she says."I want to be able to say I've played my part but it's up to others to do something themselves, too."
How you could be Postman Pat for a day and earn extra cash:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Cartoon characters Postman Pat and Mr Plod represent a bygone era in deliveries A growing number of start-ups are trying to help retailers deliver goods to customers more quickly and at lower cost.But can they really compete with the big courier and postal firms?It was a road accident in the Norwegian mountains that inspired the idea for start-up delivery company Nimber.One of the founders was on his way to a ski-jumping competition near Lillehammer when he saw a postal truck had overturned on the road."No one was hurt, but all these cars were just passing by," says Nimber chief executive Ari Kestin, whose partner Knut Bjerke made the trip."He thought, why don't they stop and carry some of the parcels to their destinations?A light-bulb came on."Nimber was launched soon after, joining a wave of new apps aimed at shaking up the delivery market.The website connects people who want to send large, awkward-to-carry goods, with members of the public travelling in the same direction.These "crowdsourced couriers" name their own price, Mr Kestin says, but are usually cheaper than using a traditional courier service or postal firm, such as FedEx or Royal Mail.Image copyright Nimber Image caption Nimber's crowd-sourced couriers often transport large goods "If you're driving from London to Manchester anyway, you will probably accept a lower price to deliver a package than a big delivery firm would," he says."We are making use of spare capacity and allowing people to monetise their movements."The site, whose main markets are Norway and the UK, has more than 40,000 registered "bringers" and 80,000 senders.It handles hundreds of deliveries a day of things like bikes, car parts and furniture.So far it has focused on serving people selling second-hand goods on sites like e-Bay and Norway's finn.no, but it has just started working with several big retailers, including Norway's largest meat and eggs producer, Nortura."Nimber is a great choice because it is environmentally friendly and doesn't create more traffic or pollution," a Nortura spokeswoman tells the BBC.But using members of the public to deliver goods does have its drawbacks.Mr Kestin admits that his service may not be as economical as a traditional delivery service for smaller items.More Technology of Business Image copyright Getty Images Its crowdsourced couriers are not always available to handle deliveries, and, on occasion, pull out at the last minute - although "that's quite rare", he says.This isn't stopping other firms experimenting with the crowdsourcing model.Some, like Uber Rush, Deliveroo and Instacart are using crowdsourced couriers to deliver packages, groceries and hot food locally - often more cheaply and quickly than major couriers could.Belgium postal giant Bpost and DHL are among those to have experimented with crowdsourced couriers.And Amazon launched its "citizen delivery" service Flex in 2015.With global retail e-ecommerce sales forecast to rise 23% this year to $2.3tn (1.8tn), it's not surprising start-ups are trying to muscle in on a delivery market still dominated by national postal services and courier firms like UPS, DHL, FedEx, Blue Dart and PostNL.These account for more than 90% of e-commerce deliveries, not including food, estimates Alex le Roy, an analyst at consultancy Transport Intelligence."These start-ups are basically serving the needs that the larger delivery companies can't meet," he says."That's because typically, traditional postal companies can deliver packages more or less anywhere, but they can't do it quickly."And the big courier firms can deliver quickly, but charge much higher prices when they deliver to out-of-the-way places or carry awkwardly shaped goods."Nimbler start-ups can also help smaller retailers reach new markets.Image copyright Fetchr Image caption Idriss Al Rifai and Joy Ajlouny co-founded Middle East-based Fetchr Fetchr, for example, is a Dubai-based delivery company aiming to connect retailers with around four billion people worldwide who live in places without street names or house numbers."There is this huge demand for online shopping in emerging markets, but many big retailers are facing the same problem," says Fetchr co-founder Idriss Al Rifai."How can you grow if you can't deliver large numbers of parcels?"The firm uses a customer's smartphone GPS location as the address.As soon as one of Fetchr's couriers has picked up a package from a retailer, it notifies the customer, offering them a two-hour delivery slot.The customer then shares their location with Fetchr."Fifteen minutes before the firm delivers, we will ask the customer to share their location again - and if they have moved elsewhere, that's fine," Mr Al Rifai says."Even when there is an address, people don't want to be pinned down for hours to receive a package."The firm, which employs 2,000 of its own couriers, serves brands such as supermarket chain Carrefour and Gucci, in countries such as the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Saudi Arabia.It hopes to expand internationally, having raised $41m (31m) in investment in May, but will face competition from the likes of the UK's What3Words and South Africa's WumDrop, which are also addressing the "lack-of-address" issue.Image copyright Weengs Image caption Weengs collects retailers' goods, packs and delivers them Some start-ups, such as Red Stag Fulfilment in the US and UK-based Weengs, are offering one-stop-shop services aimed at taking the delivery hassle away from small businesses."Shipping companies expect you to have packed your items properly, have done an analysis of your shipping costs, and prepared your customs paperwork," explains Weengs co-founder Alex Christodoulou."But many small businesses don't have the expertise to do this efficiently - it costs time and money."Weengs manages the whole shipping process from end-to-end, collecting your items unboxed and packing them at its warehouse in Kings Cross, London."We then measure your item with a laser and create a box exactly fitting the dimensions of your goods," says Mr Christodoulou.This reduces costs because some delivery companies charge by volume, not weight, he says.Big retailers sending lots of parcels can often negotiate bulk discounts on delivery costs.Smaller retailers can't.So Weengs pools its customers' orders and shops around between 10 to 30 courier firms to bring down costs, says Mr Christodoulou.His firm has handled 200,000 orders since launch in 2015, but faces competition from more established comparison services, such as parcel2go.com."These firms are already re-distributing the share of delivery volume from traditional delivery companies to smaller ones and individuals," says e-commerce consultant Kunle Campbell."I think more delivery companies will adopt their approaches, and it could cut the costs of delivery across the board."That will be music to the ears of all e-commerce entrepreneurs.
Dolly Parton's nine-to-five approach to music:::::Image caption Dolly Parton is known as much for her business acumen as her song-writing skills Even when she's talking about cold, hard cash, Dolly Parton manages to seem down to earth.She's promoting her new children's album "I Believe in You" and is in top, self-deprecating form, talking to the BBC."It's hard for me to spend money on tonnes of stuff because I'm going to look the same, no matter what I wear.If I wear diamonds I'm still going to look like a rhinestone," she tells me.Still, if Dolly was inclined to buy diamonds, she could afford them.She's known as much for her business acumen as her song-writing skills.At the start of her career she took lessons from her dad, she says: "Even though he wasn't an educated man, he wasn't able to read and write, daddy had a great sense of business.Image caption Dolly Parton at Glastonbury - in the past year she's earned some $37m "He said, 'Don't let other people take advantage of you, keep your mind on your business.'So when I got into the music business I thought of it as a business."Early on she launched her own publishing company and hung on to the rights to her songs, and she says that other artists should do the same."As soon as you start making money, you should invest and get into other businesses that you can fall back on if you don't make it big, or if you make it big and you fall on hard times."That attitude has served her well over the years and continues to do so, according to Forbes magazine's Celebrity 100 list.It claims Dolly earned $37m (28m) in the year to June 2017, with most of this coming from her Pure and Simple concert tour and income from her Dollywood theme park in Tennessee.Image copyright Jason Davis Image caption Dolly visits Vanderbilt children's hospital in Tennessee Brian Warner, founder of website CelebrityNetworth.com, estimates her total fortune to be $500m (379m) but says this is conservative."We think that Dollywood alone is worth around $200m; $100m for the land itself and $100m for the brand - you could class it as an intangible asset."On top of that she makes a lot of money from touring and has had a 50-year career in which she's sold millions of records and has also written songs for other artists."Mr Warner says "I will always love you", a hit Dolly wrote and recorded in 1973, has made her more than $20m in total.He explains that although individual music contracts may vary, "as the writer of a song you might be keeping 50% of the revenue or more and as a writer and performer you could be getting 80%".Image copyright Wes Ramey for Dollywood Image caption The Barnstormer ride at Dollywood Dolly's own version of "I Will Always Love You" was a big commercial success, topping the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart twice, in 1974 and 1982.Whitney Houston made the song a hit all over again when she recorded a version for the 1992 film The Bodyguard.It was number one for 10 weeks in the UK charts and for 14 weeks in the US.The song had another resurgence in 2012 after Ms Houston's death.More The Boss features, which every week profile a different business leader from around the world: The proceeds from Dolly's latest album won't be adding to her fortune, though; instead they'll be going to the Imagination Library.Set up in 1995 it aims to improve child literacy by distributing free books to children in the US, Canada, the UK and Australia.Image copyright Keystone Image caption Dolly in London in 1977 Dolly says her own impoverished childhood in Tennessee inspired the library and has shaped her attitude to money in general."Being brought up poor means I don't take things for granted, and no matter how much money I make, I'll always count my blessings quicker and more often than I count my money.She has "always realised the value of a dollar", too."Even now if I go in a store it's hard for me to pay a huge amount of money for one item.I say 'good Lord', what could mummy and daddy have done with that!"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Dolly's Imagination Library scheme provides books for children At 71 years old, Dolly's career has spanned more than five decades and following her Glastonbury performance in 2014 she's reached a whole new audience.So what's the secret of her longevity?"I think a lot of people can relate to me, because of my upbringing and because I'm from a big family.I think people see me as an aunt, an older sister or a cousin.I've been around so long I'm part of their family."Dolly will be hoping that this loyal fan base will support ambitious plans to expand her empire.The DreamMore hotel at Dollywood, opened in 2015, is "doing well" and she is thinking of franchising it.She'd also like to do more kids projects and launch a line of wigs, cosmetics and clothes."I've still got a lot to do...I'm going to be an old lady before I get it done but at least I'm going to be working till I fall over dead!"Dolly Parton is a force of nature and a tremendously successful one at that; it's hard to imagine her ever stopping.
Is this the most influential work in the history of capitalism?:::::Image copyright Alamy Image caption Renaissance mathematician Luca Pacioli is seen as the father of double-entry bookkeeping In 1495 or thereabouts, Leonardo da Vinci himself, the genius's genius, noted down a list of things to do in one of his famous notebooks.These to-do lists, written in mirror-writing and interspersed with sketches, are magnificent."Find a master of hydraulics and get him to tell you how to repair a lock, canal and mill in the Lombard manner.""Draw Milan.""Learn multiplication from the root from Maestro Luca."Leonardo was a big fan of Maestro Luca, better known today as Luca Pacioli.Pacioli was, appropriately enough, a Renaissance Man: - educated for a life in commerce, but also a conjuror, a chess master, a lover of puzzles, a Franciscan Friar, and a professor of mathematics.Today he is celebrated as the most famous accountant who ever lived.50 Things That Made the Modern Economy highlights the inventions, ideas and innovations which have helped create the economic world in which we live.It is broadcast on the BBC World Service.You can find more information about the programme's sources and listen online or subscribe to the programme podcast.Pacioli is often called the father of double-entry bookkeeping, but he didn't invent it.The double-entry system - known in its day as "bookkeeping alla Veneziana," or "in the Venetian style" - was being used two centuries earlier, around 1300.The Venetians had abandoned as impractical the Roman system of writing numbers, and were instead embracing Arabic numerals.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Venice in the 1300s - when Marco Polo set off on his famous travels to the Far East - was already a sophisticated crossroads of trade and ideas They may have also taken the idea of double-entry book keeping from the Islamic world, or even from India, where there are tantalising hints that double-entry bookkeeping techniques date back thousands of years.Or it may have been a local Venetian invention, repurposing the new Arabic mathematics for commercial ends.Intricate transactions Before the Venetian style caught on, accounts were rather basic.Early medieval merchants were little more than travelling salesmen.They had no need to keep accounts - they could simply check whether their purse was full or empty.But as the commercial enterprises of the Italian city states grew larger, and became more dependent on financial instruments such as loans and currency trades, the need for a more careful reckoning became painfully clear.We have a remarkable record of the business affairs of Francesco di Marco Datini, a merchant from Prato, near Florence, who kept accounts for nearly half a century, from 1366 to 1410.They begin as little more than a financial diary, but as his business grew more complex, he needed something more sophisticated.Image copyright Alamy Image caption We can see how Datini tracked his increasingly intricate financial transactions Late in 1394, Datini orders wool from Mallorca.Six months later the sheep are shorn.Several months after that, 29 sacks of wool arrive in Pisa, via Barcelona.The wool is coiled into 39 bales.Of these, 21 go to a customer in Florence and 18 go to Datini's warehouse, arriving in 1396, over a year after the initial order.They are then processed by more than 100 separate subcontractors.Eventually, six long cloths go back to Mallorca via Venice, but don't sell, so are hawked in Valencia and North Africa instead.The last cloth is sold in 1398, nearly four years after Datini's original order.Fortunately, he had been using bookkeeping alla Veneziana for more than a decade, so was able to keep track of this extraordinarily intricate web of transactions.Enormous influence So what, a century later, did the much lauded Luca Pacioli add to the discipline of bookkeeping?Quite simply, in 1494, he wrote the book."Summa de Arithmetica, Geometria, Proportioni et Proportionalita" was an enormous survey of everything that was known about mathematics - 615 large and densely typeset pages.Image copyright Stockholm University Library Amidst this colossal textbook, Pacioli included 27 pages that are regarded by many as the most influential work in the history of capitalism.It was the first description of double-entry bookkeeping to be set out clearly, in detail and with plenty of examples.Pacioli's book was sped on its way by a new technology: half a century after Gutenberg developed the movable type printing press, Venice was a centre of the printing industry.Symmetry and balance His book enjoyed a long print run of 2,000 copies, and was widely translated, copied, and plagiarised across Europe.Double-entry bookkeeping was slow to catch on, perhaps because it was technically demanding and unnecessary for simple businesses.But after Pacioli it was always regarded as the pinnacle of the art.Image copyright Alamy Image caption This 1585 woodcut shows a German merchant's accountant doing double-entry bookkeeping As the industrial revolution unfolded, the ideas that Pacioli had set out came to be seen as fundamental to business life.The system used across the world today is essentially the one that Pacioli described.Pacioli's system has two key elements.First, he describes a method for taking an inventory, and then keeping on top of day-to-day transactions using two books - a rough memorandum and a tidier, more organised journal.Then he uses a third book - the ledger - as the foundation of the system, the double-entries themselves.Every transaction was recorded twice in the ledger.If you sell cloth for a ducat, you must account for both the cloth and the ducat.The double-entry system helps to catch errors, because every entry should be balanced by a counterpart, a divine-like symmetry which appealed to a Renaissance Man.Practical tool It was during the industrial revolution that double-entry bookkeeping became seen not just as an exercise for mathematical perfectionists, but as a tool to guide practical business decisions.One of the first to see this was Josiah Wedgwood, the pottery entrepreneur.At first, Wedgwood, flush with success and fat margins, didn't bother with detailed accounts.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Josiah Wedgwood used the insight gleaned from detailed accounts to weather a severe recession But in 1772, Europe faced a severe recession and demand for Wedgwood's ornate crockery collapsed.His warehouses began to fill with unsold stock and workers stood idle.Wedgwood turned to double-entry bookkeeping to understand where in his business the profits were, and how to expand them.He realised how much each piece of work was costing him - a deceptively simple-sounding question - and calculated that he should actually expand production and cut prices to boost business.Others followed, and the discipline of "management accounting" was born - an ever-growing system of metrics and benchmarks and targets, that has led us inexorably to the modern world.More from Tim Harford: How the invention of paper changed the world The warrior monks who invented banking How the world's first accountants counted on cuneiform What tally sticks tell us about how money works But in that modern world, accounting does have another role.It's about ensuring that shareholders in a business receive a fair share of corporate profits - when only the accountants can say what those profits really are.Here the track record is not encouraging.Image copyright AFP Image caption Enron's collapse in 2001 was the biggest in US corporate history A string of 21st century scandals - Enron, Worldcom, Parmalat, and the financial crisis of 2008 - have shown us that audited accounts do not completely protect investors.A business may, through fraud or mismanagement, be on the verge of collapse.Yet we cannot guarantee that the accounts will warn us of this.Complacency Accounting fraud is not a new game.The first companies to require major capital investment were the British railways of the 1830s and 1840s, which needed vast upfront investment before they could earn anything from customers.Investors poured in, and when railway magnates could not pay the dividends that the investors expected, they simply faked their accounts.The entire railway bubble had collapsed in ignominy by 1850.Perhaps the railway investors should have read up on their Geoffrey Chaucer, writing around the same time as Francesco Datini, the merchant of Prato.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Accountancy did not protect Chaucer's Shipman character from an audacious con In Chaucer's Shipman's Tale, a rich merchant is too tied up with his accounts to notice his wife being wooed by a clergyman.Nor do those accounts rescue him from an audacious con.The clergyman borrows the merchant's money, gives it to the merchant's wife - buying his way into her bed with her own husband's cash - and then tells the merchant he's repaid the debt, and to ask his wife where the money is.Accountancy is a powerful financial technology - but it does not protect us from outright fraud, and it may well lure us into complacency.As the neglected wife tells her rich husband, his nose buried in his accounts: "the devil take all such reckonings!"Tim Harford writes the Financial Times's Undercover Economist column.50 Things That Made the Modern Economy is broadcast on the BBC World Service.You can find more information about the programme's sources and listen online or subscribe to the programme podcast.
Will Australia's 'miracle economy' keep on winning?:::::Image copyright Getty Images It was the year Australia went to war in the Gulf, when Monica Seles and Boris Becker won tennis grand slams in Melbourne, and The Simpsons was first shown on Aussie television, while a swooning Bryan Adams was a hit with love-struck teenagers ("Look into your heart, baby").It was 1991, and the last time Australia tasted the bitter economic taste of recession, defined in these parts, at least, as two or more back-to-back quarters of negative growth in real gross domestic product, or the value of all services and goods.Since then, Australia has sidestepped the worst effects of the Asian financial crisis in 1997 and its more destructive big brother that hammered global markets a decade or so later.Australia's economy - the "wonder down under" - has somehow dodged the unstoppable forces that sent other wealthy countries tumbling into reverse.For this, a nation of 24 million people must thank not only sound judgement by those in charge but also good fortune, according to Shane Oliver, chief economist at financial services company AMP in Sydney."I certainly don't see Australia as being a miracle," he says."It has had a bit of good luck and good management, but it would be dangerous to assume that it is never going to have a recession again."Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Coal production helped the Australian economy stay afloat The economy is growing by about 1.9% per year, according to the Reserve Bank.In 2012, that figure was 3.7%.Weaker growth means that pay packets are shrinking for many workers when adjusted for the rising cost of living, and near-record levels of underemployment are stifling wage increases.In August, retail sales posted their biggest retreat in about four-and-a-half years, falling by 0.6%, with cafes and restaurants reporting declining turnovers.Period of transition?Rocks, coal and demand from China insulated this country from the global financial meltdown in 2008, as a red-hot mining industry delivered unprecedented wealth.Surging commodity prices fuelled the bonanza in Western Australia and Queensland, which propped up under-performing states in the south-east, where most Australians live.Shane Oliver says the situation has now "been turned on its head" and Australia is once again in transition.The mining boom has faded, but areas that once struggled have bounced back in part because of record low interest rates that have unleashed a frenzy into the housing market.Image copyright Getty Images Meanwhile, eye-watering wads of public money have poured into infrastructure projects, which are redefining parts of New South Wales, the most populous state.There was another critical factor that helped Australia to largely avoid the ravages of the global financial crisis - unprecedented spending by the Labor government that boosted public expenditure by a whopping 13% in an attempt to stimulate growth.It was a classic Keynesian economic manoeuvre to use billions of dollars to sustain household spending, demand and employment.Australia loves to win.Here international cricket matches are akin to "wars" and Olympic gold medals - or a lack thereof - are greeted with congratulatory back-slapping - or hand-wringing.If there was a podium for economic success, this is a country that would be bending forward to accept the award.More than 25 years of uninterrupted growth is a remarkable achievement, although there is debate about the competition.Some commentators believe the recent economic prosperity enjoyed by the Netherlands lasted for (only) 22 years, putting it firmly into silver medal position behind the Aussies.Right place, right time Tim Harcourt, an economics fellow at the University of New South Wales, believes Australia deserves the plaudits."This time the 'lucky country' made its own luck."The Hawke-Keating [government] reforms of the 1980s and 1990s - the currency float, tariff changes, and embrace of Asia - set up us up for a quarter of a century of growth."Australia found itself in the right place at the right time and embraced the Asia century," he argues.Image copyright Getty Images But as the economy has soared, some Australians have been left behind.At almost 13%, youth unemployment is more than twice the national average.Labouring work had left 21-year-old Mohammad Al-Khafaji, the son of an Iranian refugee, with endless back pain and homelessness soon followed."I was just trying to apply for jobs online, and then people were just putting me down saying 'you are never going to get that job', so I just stopped trying," he says.'Muddling along' Mohammad is now employed by a hire car company in Sydney, and has ambitions to one day be the boss.He works with Shiv Dhingra, an Indian migrant from Punjab.They are proof that much of Australia's economic might is down to immigration."I am the only one working in my family," Shiv explained."I am the main financial support they have.I am working seven days a week for the last year.I've got plans for my own business."Image copyright Charity Bounce Image caption Charity Bounce runs sessions in partnership with professional athletes Both young men were helped by Charity Bounce, a Sydney-based non-profit organisation that uses basketball to reach out to the disadvantaged and long-term unemployed, who, according to chief executive, Ian Heininger, also deserve a slice of Australia's prosperity."We find a lot of the young people are desperate to find work," he says, "desperate to find an opportunity that is going to get them into a place where they are contributing back to the world."But will they be part of an ever-expanding economy?Mr Oliver thinks Australia's luck will eventually run out, but not for a while."The Aussie economy is probably going to continue muddling along, not fantastically strong as housing slows and consumer spending remains a bit weak," he predicts."We are probably going to go for at least another few years before we have that recession some people say is inevitable."
How can you help your local online business go global?:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Online shopping has become a $2.3tn global business In 1995, someone sold a broken laser pen for $14 on a site called AuctionWeb.This was the rather inauspicious start for online shopping, an activity that now generates a colossal $2.3tn (1.75tn) in global sales.But these days, shoppers want to pay in any number of ways and this can cause headaches for retailers wanting to expand abroad; so what should they do?Nigel Whiteoak is the co-founder of LoveCrafts, a virtual hub for knitting and crochet enthusiasts to share their creations and buy supplies.Having a website rather than a bricks-and-mortar shop meant the team could sell their wares to the world.But taking payments for these international sales wasn't proving straightforward."One of the biggest realisations we had when looking to expand was that credit card penetration is generally much lower in most markets outside the UK and US," he explains."In Germany, open invoices are very common where you process the payment using a third party, deliver the goods directly to the customer, and then they pay that third party once we have delivered their crafts.Image copyright LoveCrafts Image caption LoveCrafts founder Nigel Whiteoak says selling abroad has significantly boosted sales "Whereas in Brazil and Turkey they tend to use local credit cards and pay in instalments."These regional quirks were difficult to cater for.But then he came across a Dutch payment company, Adyen, whose payment processing platform harnesses machine learning to customise the payment method depending on which country the buyer is in.Adyen's clients include heavyweights such as Netflix, Uber and Spotify, so Mr Whiteoak was surprised to find out how affordable its service was, with a minimum monthly invoice of $100 (75) and transparent per-transaction processing and commission charges."Before we started selling outside of the UK we had a turnover of around 6.5m," he says."Last year we posted 10.9 million, and with the bulk of our sales coming from overseas, this growth is directly linked to our ability to offer local payment methods."Sales have grown 125% over the last three years, he says, proving that knitting and crochet is big business.Image copyright LoveCrafts Image caption LoveCrafts has found that people in different countries like to pay in different ways Payment difficulties contribute to about 15% of online shoppers abandoning their virtual shopping baskets before completing the purchase, research suggests.That and difficult-to-navigate, fiddly websites.Research from Barclaycard finds that while customers demand faster, more innovative and mobile-friendly ways to pay, the reality is one of declined cards, verification delays and annoying hidden transaction fees."Remove the need for consumers to set up an account first," advises Greg Liset, Barclaycard's head of small business, "and partner with suppliers that have reliable payment systems that work first time."Also, with online cross-border sales expected to soar over the next few years, being able to offer multiple currencies is essential."Knowing what payment options locals prefer is crucial to e-commerce success.Research from 2Checkout finds that in the US, Visa, MasterCard, PayPal and American Express still dominate the payments landscape.But in other countries different favourite payment methods have emerged.For example, in China Alipay now accounts for 54% of online sales.In the Netherlands the iDEAL payment system is used for 44% of sales.In Japan, JCB and Konbini are popular.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Shoppers in different countries have their own favourite ways of paying But in India many shoppers still prefer paying in cash.So Indian start-up BookMyTrain is aiming to simplify the online purchase of rail tickets by offering a cash-on-delivery payment option with its app, as many people in India don't have payment cards.It is also using chatbots to take customers through the booking process one step at a time.Simon Johnson, general manager at software provider Freshworks, the firm providing the chatbots for BookMyTrain, says: "Most customers today use messaging apps such as WhatsApp or Facebook Messenger because they like how you can keep a conversation going with whatever device they are using."You don't have to be a massive company to personalise the experience more effectively and [smaller] retailers need to have that personal touch to compete with big e-commerce players."Other payment platforms besides Adyen helping online retailers sell globally with tailored experiences include 2Checkout (formerly Avangate), PayU, PayPal, Stripe and Braintree.More Technology of Business Image copyright Getty Images Costs are usually transparent and related to sales volume.With PayPal, for example, retailers can expect to pay 2.9 % of the transaction value plus about 23p per order.Similarly, Stripe doesn't charge extra for accommodating different cards or currencies with a flat rate of 1.4% plus 20p per transaction.But selling abroad isn't just about offering flexibility over ways to pay and support for multiple currencies, it's also about understanding local customs and cultures, argues Nir Debbi, co-founder of e-commerce platform Global-e. "A common pitfall for businesses marketing themselves abroad is a lack of awareness of the different cultural phenomena," says Mr Debbi.Planning for international shopping events such as Singles Day in China or Japan's "lucky shopping bags" at New Year "can improve international conversion rates dramatically", he says, "but you need the insight, local knowledge and access to these sales peaks to be able to plan and apply an appropriate strategy."Later in this e-commerce series we'll explore the best ways for online businesses to market themselves.
Milwaukee Bucks aim to bounce back on and off NBA court:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The Milwaukee Bucks' Giannis Antetokounmpo is an emerging star in the NBA What has historically made Milwaukee famous has been its beer and its motorcycles, but now NBA basketball side, the Bucks, is also hoping to fly the flag for the US city.Although the team situated on the western shore of Lake Michigan has picked up just one NBA national title, in 1971, in its 50th season it is now hoping to transform its fortunes.The club has wealthy owners in the shape of New York hedge fund billionaires, and has one of the top young players in Giannis Antetokounmpo.It has also signed a groundbreaking shirt sponsorship deal with Harley-Davidson, and as the current regular season gets under way it is moving into a new stadium.As well as being specifically designed for basketball and offering a better fan experience, the Wisconsin Entertainment and Sports Center stadium will also host music and entertainment events.And the playing season has got off to a bright start, with victory in the opening game over Boston Celtics.Championship dream "Our aims are sporting and financial," Bucks president Peter Feigin, who has previously worked in the theme park and executive jet industries, tells me.Image copyright Milwaukee Bucks Image caption The Wisconsin Entertainment and Sports Center stadium is due to open in August 2018 "Our owners are very motivated about the team winning on the court, and also about growing the business to be one of the best in US sport."At present the club is closer to breaking-even financially rather than making a profit, but it is hoped playing success can bring wider brand exposure and enhanced commercial revenues.Meanwhile, the new venue where the club will be the main leaseholder will also bring in increased match day income through executive boxes and improved catering.The team has high hopes for the season ahead.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The Milwaukee Bucks (green) won their opening match against the Boston Celtics 108-100 "There are four rounds of play-offs, we got to the first round last year and the expectation is to go at least one round better this time," says Mr Feigin, a former head of marketing for the New York Knicks NBA team."It is achievable - we are in the Eastern Division, which is not as strong as the Western Division, and if we are healthy for the season and have no injuries we will do great."He adds: "We are in these games to win a championship; it is all directed towards ultimately winning a championship."'International appeal' Central to any playing success is up-and-coming star Giannis Antetokounmpo, a 22-year-old born in Athens to Nigerian immigrant parents."We have the most-emerging star in the NBA, he is already in the top seven of uniform sales, and had tens of millions of video views," says Mr Feigin."He has gone from 'recognised' to superstar in less than 12 months.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Giannis Antetokounmpo sports a shirt with the fans' chant: Fear the deer "We have been able to grow our European appeal and our Asian appeal via Giannis."And the potentially exciting nature of the team has seen the Bucks double the number of live TV games they will be involved in this season, from nine to 18."That will be big for us not only on viewing impressions, but big for the brand too," adds Mr Feigin, who prior to joining the Bucks three years ago worked for Six Flags Theme Parks in the US.He was also previously president and chief operating officer of Marquis Jet, where he was the driving force behind Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway's NetJets acquisition of Marquis in 2010.Image copyright Milwaukee Bucks Image caption NBA rules allow teams to sign shirt sponsors for three years Mr Feigin says Milwaukee as at a city is at an "inflection point" between its industrial heritage past and a newly-modernised future, something which also applies to its shirt sponsors for the next three years - local motorbike brand Harley-Davidson."Harley are trying to reposition themselves for the next generations, and the NBA can help them do that," he says."They want to reach a young, diverse, more international market."Public funding Mr Feigin has been in London this month meeting to publicise the new stadium, pitching it as "a must-play for sports and entertainment" which will host 200 major events a year.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Post-industrial Milwaukee is in the midst of regeneration The $524m (395m) arena is a public-private partnership, with just over half the cash coming from hedge-fund club owners Marc Lasry, Wes Edens and Jamie Dinan, as well as $250m in public funding."It was very challenging to get this approved; especially at at time when there have been questions about the economy, and debates around healthcare and education," admits Mr Feigin."But a professional sports team can bring in much more than the stadium outlay, through income tax and sales tax."Image copyright Alamy Image caption Kareem Abdul-Jabbar led Milwaukee to their only title success in 1971 He says in return for that $250m outlay, the venue will help bring in more than $1bn over 15 years for the state."The stadium will also create a ripple effect in increasing nearby commercial and residential values," he adds.Bucks season-ticket holders and members will be offered deals on entertainment tickets.Conversely, it's hoped music fans will enjoy the stadium experience enough to come back for a Bucks game.Naming rights Building work began on the new stadium last June, with the club due to move into its new home on Labor Day weekend next year - the first weekend of September."The current venue was not built around basketball as the lead sport, but for ice hockey," says Raj Saha, the arena's general manager, and formerly on the management team of the O2 in London.Image caption Mr Feigin and Mr Saha have been in London to get support for the new stadium "The viewing sight lines where we currently play are not ideal for basketball," says Mr Saha, with only one third of the seats close to the action.The club is looking for six to eight long-term founding commercial partners for the new stadium, paying around $2m a year.Those who have signed up include multi-industrial firm Johnson Controls and bank BMO Harris.The search is on for a stadium naming rights partner, which would pay about $7m a year for 20 years."We are still looking for a naming rights partner.We would have loved to have finalised it by now but are in negotiations with a number of potential partners," says Mr Saha.Image copyright Populous Image caption The new stadium will host a variety of non-basketball entertainment As well as music acts, the arena will also host attractions such as UFC martial arts, boxing, Disney on Ice, and other events."We have an idea of how the first four weeks will look," says Mr Saha."Opening night is important and we'll go big for that, but the first 100 days will also be very important, too, to creating a success story."
The Chinese blockage in the global waste disposal system:::::Image copyright European Photopress Agency Image caption In Hong Kong, 2,500 tonnes of waste paper are piling up at its docks every day Imagine the world as a global waste disposal system.Now imagine it with a blockage.And what if that waste is backing up around the world, reappearing in places where you really don't want it to be.That blockage is about to happen in China and the flood is going to start seeping out into waste disposal operations around the world.Three months ago, China decided to ban 24 different grades of rubbish as part of its "National Sword" campaign against foreign garbage.Until now China has been importing millions of tonnes of the world's waste every year to feed its recycling industry.The Bureau of International Recycling China estimates that China last year imported 7.3 million tonnes of plastic scrap from Europe, Japan and USA, and 27 million tonnes of waste paper.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption China's action in halting various categories of waste imports will hit recycling around the world Robin Wiener, president of the US-based Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries, said: "More than 155,000 direct jobs are supported by the US industry's export activities, earning an average wage of almost $76,000 and contributing more than $3bn to federal, state, and local taxes."A ban on imports of scrap commodities into China would be catastrophic to the recycling industry."The new restrictions have yet to be agreed by the World Trade Organisation (WTO) and China could still change its mind, but the waste is already starting to back up.In Hong Kong, 2,500 tonnes of waste paper are piling up at its docks every day.Easy option For China the problem is simply one of pollution.Its submission to the WTO reads: "We found that large amounts of dirty wastes or even hazardous wastes are mixed in the solid waste that can be used as raw materials.This polluted China's environment seriously."Image copyright Jamie Robertson Image caption Mike Baxter says sending waste overseas was the easy option Western recyclers admit that China has been a cheap and easy waste bin for their industry.In theory the rubbish from your recycling rubbish bin is meant to be treated or sorted before it goes in the container overseas, but the rules have too often been ignored and rarely enforced.Mike Baxter, external affairs director at the recycler RPC Group, says: "The easiest option for years has been put it into a container and send it overseas where the labour is cheaper and it can be sorted by hand."But with the ban expected to come into full effect by the new year, if not before, the UK industry has written urging the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs to help with the expected overflow.Even so, Robin Latchem, editor of the recycling industry magazine MRW believes the recyclers are not spelling out the problems loudly enough, and says: "Why no mention of growing domestic stockpiles of waste and the danger of more fires or incidents of waste crime?"I don't think it is scare-mongering to set out such fears, along with concern that public perception of the recycling industry in its widest sense will be heavily scarred by greater fly-tipping, larger-scale dumping and more plumes of heavy black smoke crossing housing estates."Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Western recyclers admit that China has been a cheap and easy waste bin for their industry No minister from Defra was available for comment, but a spokesman told the BBC: "We are aware of this situation and are looking into the potential implications."Opportunities But there is flip side to the problem - an opportunity for the recycling industry.In the UK for example, a lot of the waste is high quality, such as off-cuts from plastic manufacturing and plastic bottles that have failed quality tests but can be reprocessed.That presents "a great opportunity", says David Wilson commercial manager of Vanden Recycling, a Hong Kong-based company with a new plastics recycling operation in Peterborough, in the UK."China has voluntarily given up a six million tonne a year industry.We'll be selective about it and we'll go for materials we understand and markets we understand, but some of that lost capacity will be rebuilt here," he says.Image copyright Jamie Robertson Image caption Vanden Recycling's David Wilson says the China ban creates new opportunities Low quality waste is a different matter, however, and it requires some drastic rethinking of the whole supply chain.As waste begins to back up through the system, like any commodity in oversupply, it loses value.In the UK, for example, local authorities have been able to generate useful income from selling that waste on to the recyclers.That income is going to fall sharply.Andrew Bird, chairman of the UK's Local Authority Recycling Advisory Committee (LARAC) says as demand from China disappears, other markets are emerging, especially in India and wider Asia.Nevertheless, "there is going to be a little bit of pinch point, to say the least, and that will have an effect on price - that's the biggest risk for local authorities".New technologies One answer to tackling the global oversupply of low quality waste is the development of new technologies.Recycling Technologies has developed a method of recycling the most unappetising mix of dirty plastic into something it calls Plaxx, a fuel oil which can be used for myriad applications, including as a source for new recycled plastic.Image copyright Jamie Robertson Image caption Adopting new technologies is one long-term solution, says Adrian Griffiths Adrian Griffiths, the company's chief executive, admits there's no shortage of "feedstock" - the term for all the raw material that feeds the process."We chemically recycle plastic.We take it back to the original material so it can become more plastic again: plastic, back to oil, and back to plastic again.Anything that goes to landfill currently is feedstock for us, and since the recycling figures are so low the vast majority of the plastic we want is not in recycling use anyway."Global Trade More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade: But tackling the global back-up of waste after China's changes will require investment.Surprisingly, it is waste paper recycling that can cost the most.A plastics recycling plant could require a 5m ($6.5m) investment to get it up and running, says Simon Ellin, chief executive of the Recycling Association.But a paper mill could cost up to 500m.However, RCP's Mr Baxter says investors are not going to step in unless there is a market for recycled goods, and he believes governments have a role to play."It's not just a case of recycling the material.It's having markets for the recyclates that are produced, and this is where government could come in."In the UK, he would like to see the government push local authorities and all government institutions to purchase recycled products.For Mr Bird, from LARAC, responsibility for tackling the long term problems of waste must lie throughout the global product supply chain, but especially with manufacturers.And he says one particular change could have a dramatic effect - the widespread adoption of Extended Producers' Responsibility."It means producers having to pay to ensure the products they are manufacturing can be dealt with in an effective, and environmentally cost-effective way."Meanwhile, the waste is piling up and the clock is ticking.Listen to Jamie Robertson's report on China's ban on waste imports here on BBC World Service's World Business Report programme.
The winemaker who battles temperatures as low as -25C:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption How the wines of Canadian winemaker Norman Hardie are winning fans around the world.With winter temperatures regularly dipping below -25C at his vineyard, winemaker Norman Hardie definitely didn't choose an easy place to grow his grapes."Minus 25 is the absolute death knell for vitis vinifera [the common grape vine], we actually have to bury our vines in the winter [to protect them].It's a huge job," says the 51-year-old."And then we can get snap spring frosts that can quickly ruin a crop.We lost more than 80% in 2015."While most of us associate winemaking with warm countries, Mr Hardie has since 2004 been making wine in Canada.Image copyright Johnny C Y Lam Image caption Norman Hardie Winery is currently continuing with its 2017 harvest Based in picturesque Prince Edward County, Ontario, a two-hour drive east of Toronto alongside Lake Ontario, the summers are more often glorious.The winters, on the other hand, are harsh, which means that the team at Norman Hardie Winery face a race against the cold weather every November."I have 80,000 plants today, so that is almost a quarter of a million canes [the vine's branches] that we have to tie down by hand, and then cover with a mound of earth," says Norman."Before we then carefully open up and untie in the spring."If that wasn't labour intensive enough, come April and May Norman and his team have to light fires and position wind turbines to try to drive away late frosts.But sometimes, such as in 2015, they just aren't that successful.Image copyright Johnny C Y Lam Image caption Norman Hardie says that Canada's cool weather helps him to make excellent wine Up against such challenges, you might question why Norman ever chose to plant vineyards and build a winery in Ontario.He says that despite the challenges, the combination of cool weather and the clay and limestone soil of Prince Edward County allow him to make world class wines."The great wines are always made on the edge, and we're certainly on the edge," says South African-born Norman, who prior to going into winemaking had been a sommelier (wine waiter) in Toronto."I'd rather be here than anywhere else in the world because the flavours we get out of these soils are unique."Image copyright Norman Hardie Winery Image caption While many wine regions around the world have cold winters, they aren't as cold as Canada's Primarily making white wines from chardonnay and red wines from pinot noir, Norman Hardie's wines now have a cult following in Canada, and are even said to be the favourite tipples of Canadian Prime Minster Justin Trudeau.But from day one, Norman - who studied winemaking in Burgundy, Oregon, California, South Africa, and New Zealand prior to establishing his own winery - wanted his wines to be sold internationally.This brought his next big challenge - how to persuade a sceptical world to take Canadian wine seriously, when even Norman admits that 30 years ago the country made "terrible wine".Image caption Canadian wine production remains a drop in the global ocean Norman's solution was to turn himself into a travelling salesman, and build up his wine's global reputation "one top sommelier one top buyer, and one top wine journalist, at a time flying around the world, pounding the pavement, speaking to people, changing people's ideas about Canada".So attending wine fairs, visiting wine importers, and knocking on the doors of Michelin-star restaurants, he started to slowly build up export orders.This is the first feature of a new 20-week series called Connected Commerce, which highlights companies around the world that are successfully exporting, and trading beyond their home market.Focusing particularly on the UK and New York, Norman says his personal, face-to-face approach enabled him to let some of the most influential people in the global wine world "understand what we're doing, why we're doing it, and how we are doing it".He adds: "You can only do that with face time, and once you have them they are your evangelists."From selling 6,000 bottles in 2004, Norman Hardy Winery produced 240,000 in 2016.From that 6,804 bottles were exported across eight countries - China, Denmark, Japan, New Zealand, Sweden, Taiwan, the UK, and the US.And he still is regularly overseas promoting his wines, including spending five to six days every year in the UK.Back at the winery, there are now six year-round employees, rising to 50 in the busy summer months and at harvest time in late September and October.The business now has annual revenues of 4.1m Canadian dollars ($3.3m; 2.5m).John Downes, a London-based wine expert, who has the top master of wine qualification, says that Norman was right to recognise the fact that as Canada is such a little known wine region he had to do a lot of marketing work to "stand out" on the global stage.Image caption Prince Edward County is now home to 40 wineries Mr Downes adds: "A lot of people in wine don't tell stories, they say 'here's my wine what do you think about it?'."But they don't tell the story behind the wine, and that gives the picture of the wine to the consumer.Norman does that very well."While exporting wine is not without its challenges, such as the need to produce different labels for each country, Norman says that building up a vibrant export business has also boosted his sales in Canada.Now preparing to bury the vines for another winter, Norman says: "That credibility, that international credibility, says you're doing something right."
The human cost of China's economic reforms:::::Image copyright AFP Luo Yanli is worried about the bad smell from the electric car factory over the road and what the fumes might be doing to her baby and toddler.Mr Yu is worried that millions of workers the Chinese government plans to lay off from failing state owned companies will be "abandoned" like he says he was 15 years ago.Mark Weinberger is worried about China's mountain of national debt, the possibility of bankruptcies and - ultimately - what it might mean for the thousands his multinational firm employs in China.All three tell me they support reforms to overhaul China's mammoth economy; but their stories, from three very different parts of China, reveal the consequences and anxieties associated with the changes.Health fears Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption What has China's president achieved so far?The early autumn nights are still warm and humid in Shenzhen where Yanli lives in the south of China.But she doesn't open the windows in her apartment because of the strong smell from the sprawling BYD electric car factory."Before we bought the apartment the developer told us the plant would move elsewhere" she says."After we moved here little seems to have changed."The factory was inspected last year after protests.Airtight seals were installed to contain the fumes.When we visited locals told us some production had been moved to another site.With her baby boy on her lap and her daughter playing with a plastic fork beside her, Yanli says: "The smell is very strong and it has severely affected out lives".They don't know if it's dangerous but, like most of their neighbours, they have plants in their apartment in the hope they'll absorb the smell seeping in.Image caption Luo Yanli has concerns about fumes from a local factory The complex is home to the world's biggest manufacturer of electric cars.BYD is a global leader in a technology that China hopes it can dominate; electric vehicles, and specifically the batteries that power them.The big push towards electric isn't just about industrial strategy, it's about trying to tackle China's immense pollution problems - the most obvious of which is dirty air.With incentives for infrastructure and aggressive quota demands for, mostly foreign, manufacturers, this is part and parcel of Beijing's effort to make China's economy less focused on government investment and cheap exports - and instead to one that is technologically advanced, with a sustainable base and driven by consumer spending.So is a bad smell and worries about fumes a price worth paying for this progress, I ask Yanli?Yes it is, she intimates.The windows are firmly shut, though.Survival of the fittest Almost 3,000km (1,800 miles) away in Shenyang, taxi driver Mr Yu points to where the lead smelting plant used to stand, where he worked.It's long gone, replaced by car dealerships and apartment blocks.You can buy a Cadillac where he used to walk through the now demolished main gate.It's 15 years since he was laid off in the wave of liberalising economic reforms with compensation of just over a year's salary - about $5,000 (3,700).Despite the years he gets visibly emotional when I ask if there's any part of the city that's still recognisable from his time as a steel worker.He says he was "abandoned" by the government.There was no training for a new job, no support aside from the pay-off.But two children and a taxi licence later he's a believer in reforms that bring competition to the market place.Image caption Mr Yu was laid off from his job as a worker and now drives a taxi "I think the rule 'survival of the fittest' should apply", he says as we drive around, "baggage should be cast aside" he adds.But there is also this, "isn't it true that the people should be properly settled?"They know a lot about "settling" workers in Shenyang.It's the capital city in China's weakest performing province.Liaoning was once the manufacturing heartland.Now it's trying to rescue the towns and cities around the coal mines and steel plants that help make up this country's "rust belt" and is about to get its first privately owned bank, called the "revitalisation" bank.Away from car dealerships and the mega malls we go to Linsheng on Shenyang's outskirts.Food and rubbish is dumped in piles on its main street.One ground floor apartment in a housing estate has a home-made pigeon coop in a bay window.Parts of the building are decaying.It's home for the workers at the nearby coal mine.As China tries to tackle chronic over-capacity in its traditional industries it's also moving away from dirty coal to heat homes and power its economy.Many mines are being mothballed.A bus driver outside Linsheng's pink-painted community hospital tells me he used to do 17 trips to the mine every day, now it's just seven."A lot of people have retired but the company is not able to hire new employees - nobody wants to come because the salary is low."Image copyright AFP Image caption A construction site in Shenyang, the capital of China's weakest performing economic province As the sun goes down a woman who runs a fruit stall says her business had taken a 30% hit in the last two years, which she puts down to workers' salaries falling.The market boss claims people are buying pork and making it last for two or three days instead of buying daily.A retired miner, who like most of the people we talk to in Linsheng doesn't want to go in front of a microphone, says income for some is down 50%.Still growing So what of taxi driver Mr Yu's call for "survival of the fittest"?President Xi Jinping shows little sign of going that far.It looks like his government's early pledge to enhance market forces - giving them a "decisive role" has remained just that, a pledge.Thousands of factories have been closed but that's as much about their polluting effect than their productive inefficiency.There have been consolidations in various sectors of the myriad state-owned enterprises.The (almost all state-owned) banks have come in with debt for equity deals - something close to a bail out - for the most troubled companies.But there hasn't been a wave of bankruptcies.Preserving social stability is likely to be the main reason for this.A wave of concentrated unemployment could see protests that could threaten order.Indeed 2016 actually saw increased cheap credit and a boost in government spending.Rather than an assault on inefficient state-owned entities, many going, only with increased - and cheaper - debt.Still, the world's second largest economy continues to grow, at rates many in the developed world would envy; 6.7% last year, but the rate of growth is slowing, a plateau is approaching.Debt bubble?Debt and risk are the two things that some think will combine to produce an economic catastrophe in China - but not Mark Weinberger, the CEO of EY, one of the big four accountancy firms."I don't see an impending catastrophe," he says, when we met in Shanghai: "The growth is still there to be able to pay off debt".Such optimism is perhaps not surprising from a man who advises the mayor of China's second city.But Mr Weinberger warns nobody should be complacent: "When the debt gets so large it crowds out growth because of the cost of that debt - that becomes a problem".And China's debt is huge; it is currently about 260% of annual economic output and is predicted to rise.What makes it particularly worrisome is that the bulk of this is held by state-owned corporate entities.Risky practice has been growing too, particularly around the so called "shadow banking" sector.So much so that Beijing cracked down on the insurance market in particular, and went after some of China's best known private firms who were deemed too risky in the way they raised money.Image caption EY chief executive Mark Weinberger says he doesn't see "an impending catastrophe" Firms who owned or had stakes in New York's Waldorf Astoria, Deutsche Bank, Club Med and Wolves FC were all targeted.It's steadied the boat, but that appears all.Other far more significant reforms have not yet happened; financial market reforms, substantial rural land reform, changes to the internal passport-like hukou welfare system.One thing that is happening though is a deepening of the role of "the party" at the top of China's state firms.There were reports this summer that foreign owned firms or joint ventures have been asked to give the Communist Party equal say over their major corporate decisions.Xi Jinping faces a multitude of challenges in his country's economy as he embarks on his second term at the top.Strengthening the party's hold on the means of production is one of Beijing's responses.
From torture victim to human rights student:::::Image caption Noura Al Jizawi has come to study in Toronto after escaping Syria's civil war Noura Al Jizawi has survived more than a decade of extreme risk.Now she's going back to her interrupted life as a student.Growing up in Homs in Syria, the 29 year old has been a student activist, experienced imprisonment and exile and has been a leader in Syria's opposition.Now eight months pregnant, she has gone back to her studies, beginning a master's degree at the University of Toronto's Munk School of Global Affairs.Noura's first awareness of human rights - and of their absence - came early: "I remember when I was just a kid, I was angry because we couldn't choose our notebooks."We could have only one type of notebook - one with a photo of Assad's father on it."Missing persons She soon learned that other, much worse things were wrong with her country.Image copyright Reuters Image caption Homs this summer showing the damage of war "Many of the students, a couple of years older than me, were mentioning their missing fathers.I became aware we had missing persons in Syria."While I was growing up, I remember hearing mothers supporting each other... they were the mothers of missing persons."Those guys were the detainees arrested by Assad's father in the 1980s.Some of them are still until this moment missing there were no bodies, there was nothing, just silence."Activism and arrests Noura came up against the regime as an undergraduate at the University of Homs - and reading books such as George Orwell's Animal Farm chimed deeply with her own experience.More from Global education Ideas for the Global education series?Get in touch.Noura's increasing activism, her work as a blogger, publishing imaginative allegorical fiction, and her readiness to speak out, led to two early arrests.Nevertheless she continued this dangerous work, accessing forbidden websites to distribute anti-regime articles, disseminating ideas of democracy and non-violent protest."We never believed there would be a real revolution in our lifetimes," she said.And then, in December 2010, the Arab Spring began in Tunisia, and spread rapidly, arriving in Syria with a demonstration in Damascus in March 2011.Image copyright Reuters Image caption A mother in Homs with a locket of her lost son "For me it was like a dream.We have a revolution."Noura was still in Homs, but was in touch with activists around the country, and abroad.She became an organiser of demonstrations and an advocate for the rapidly rising numbers of detainees.Social media In the response that followed, many of her friends were killed, many others imprisoned and tortured."To be honest we were not shocked, we knew too well that this regime would not allow people to demand their rights."They were more shocked, she said, by the lack of any effective response from the international community."We were saying, back in the 70s and 80s, when there were great massacres in Syria, there was no internet, there no media channels."But we thought, now we have the social media channels, hopefully this would protect us.But it did not protect us."Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Noura's young life has been against a background of war: A fighter in Homs Noura moved from city to city, organising, motivating, dodging the authorities - until in May 2012, she was ordered off a bus in Damascus by armed men and bundled into a car."It was not an arrest, it was abduction, a kidnapping," she said.Tortured in prison Noura emerged seven months later.During that time she was detained in some of Syria's most notorious prisons, and said she had been tortured with electric shocks and beatings.She plays this down, saying that so many have endured - and are still enduring - far worse.For her the hardest experience to bear was hearing the sounds of her fellow-prisoners being tortured.Her captors realised this psychological torture would be more effective in her case - but still she remained silent.Noura explained how she survived: "I was not afraid for myself, I didn't care about myself...I cared only about the revolution I cared about the people who were still continuing this revolution outside."Image copyright Reuters Image caption Homs this summer showing the damage of war "We were still a non-violent movement on the ground... and I kept thinking about them...I wanted to make sure that in the questioning I would not speak about any one of those activists.I would pray to my body not to break down."Noura was released late in 2012, and believes that an international campaign played a part in this: "For sure, all of those activities protected me.That is why we need this advocacy, all the time, for all detainees and for missing persons."For Noura, the torment continued, as her younger sister, Alaa, had also been imprisoned and was suffering even worse: "They tortured her harder than me, many times, because of me."Alaa was released in a terrible physical state; the family decided they had to leave Syria, and fled to Turkey to get urgent medical treatment."She was my only reason to leave Syria," said Noura."Otherwise I would still be there."Image caption Noura became a representative in peace talks in Geneva In four years of exile in Turkey, she joined the coalition of Syrian opposition forces, (SNC) and became its vice-president in 2014, as well as being elected to sit on its negotiation panel in Geneva.She joined because she realised this much-criticised group of mainly male, middle-aged "hotel revolutionaries" needed "the blood of youth" and also a strong female voice.Geneva was a real challenge for Noura: "I felt I had to be calm and clever, I had do everything I could do, to interact."She worked hard to get an agreement to break the two-year siege of Homs.Many of its surviving citizens were dying of starvation.'Scholars at risk' Noura resigned from the coalition in 2016, but continued working for an NGO she had created, Start Point, which provides advocacy and psychological support to Syrian women who have suffered torture and sexual violence in detention.She had also met her husband in Turkey, another Syrian activist in exile, who was one of a network of cyber-security experts working for the Munk School's Citizen Lab; hence the Toronto connection.Noura came to Canada as one of 24 international students with scholarships in the university's "scholars at risk" programme.With her daughter due to be born next month, Noura is aware of how this might change her activism.But she's determined not to give up the fight.She sees the master's degree as another step to help her continue her work to bring democracy to Syria."I feel also that being a mother makes me closer to the future... this baby is the future, and maybe will not have to live as our generation live."
From sweets to furniture: The secrets of selling online:::::Image copyright Geoff Pugh Image caption Lavinia Davolio says selling her luxury sweets on Amazon Marketplace has been good for business What are the best ways to sell online?And how do you make sure you have a website that really works?Part one in our eight-part series exploring all things e-commerce.Lavinia Davolio makes luxury handmade sweets inspired by her Italian heritage.She says her business received a boost when she opened a store on Amazon's Marketplace."It's easy for clients to discover something unique and handmade if it's available through such a trusted online platform," she says."And it means we can offer convenient next day delivery at a competitive price and give our boutique confectionary an incredible reach and visibility."Lavinia is one of thousands of small businesses who've decided to set up shop on an e-commerce marketplace - Amazon, eBay, Etsy, Alibaba's Taobao, Rakuten to name some of the largest - rather than go through the hassles of setting up their own websites.Amazon charges retailers a 15% commission, but in return even the very smallest entrepreneurs can get a slice of the retail titan's global pulling power just by uploading images and descriptions of their products and then setting their pricing.For an additional fee, Amazon will store and dispatch your goods - the kind of one-stop convenience that is ideal for newbies, suggests Alan Braithwaite, a visiting professor at Cranfield School of Management.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Despite the convenience of online shopping, people still love the physical store "Something like Amazon Marketplace is a no-brainer," he says."Entry costs are very low and straightaway you have a very wide marketplace at your fingertips."When you're starting out with your own website you're having to attract the traffic, which means a lot of search engine optimisation [SEO].This can be complicated and mean extra costs if you need outside help."Some e-tailers want more creative control over their online shops, however -

Can these beads stop 'history's biggest mass poisoning'?:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption A handful of these resin beads can save lives The beads of resin may not look like much but they could save hundreds of thousands of at-risk people in Bangladesh and parts of India.Human Rights Watch says up to 20 million people are at risk from arsenic poisoning in Bangladesh.Millions have already suffered from what the World Health Organisation calls "the biggest mass poisoning in human history".Millions of "tube-wells" have been dug across Bangladesh since the 1940s.The simple pumps were rolled out across the country by the government and NGOs from the 1970s onwards as a way of delivering cost-effective bacteria-free water.However during the 1980s cases of arsenic poisoning began to emerge.Arsenic can not be seen or smelt; the first signs of its impact are skin lesions which only emerge once the poisoning has taken place.The poisoning can set off a range of heart diseases and cancer and the external symptoms look a lot like leprosy, which can lead to victims and their families being shunned by the local community.A heavy price Image caption Siaton Nessa says arsenic poisoning has ruined her life and affected her family as well Siaton Nessa Meherpur has lesions on her skin from arsenic poisoning.She's in her mid-50s and she says the disease has blighted her entire family."Because of this well my whole skin is filled with black patches," she says."I am worried about my children because no one is prepared to marry them."While the government has made efforts to replace the wells, in many rural areas they are still the primary source of water especially as many families have dug their own tube wells.Human Rights Watch estimate 43,000 people die each year in Bangladesh from illnesses caused by arsenic poisoning.New solutions Image caption Minhaj Chowdhury's Drinkwell is offering an "entrepreneurial solution" to the water crisis Minhaj Chowdhury, 28, was raised in the United States but visited family in Bangladesh during school holidays."It shocked and deeply saddened me to think how we never had to worry about water being fatal in the US but here in Bangladesh one in every five deaths was associated with unsafe drinking water," Mr Chowdhury says.After his grandfather died due to a disease linked to water he decided to take action.The BBC's Innovators series reveals innovative solutions to major challenges across South Asia.Ever heard of the concept of "jugaad"?It's a Hindi term meaning cheap innovation.If you have created a life hack or innovation that you are proud of, or spotted one while out and about on your travels, then share your picture with us by emailing yourpics@bbc.co.uk, use the hashtags #Jugaad and #BBCInnovators and share your picture with @BBCWorldService, or upload your submission here.Learn more about BBC Innovators.In 2013 he founded Drinkwell, in partnership with Dr Arup K SenGupta who invented a particular type of resin technology and had already been active in implementing it in India.The resin removes arsenic and other harmful substances from water and once it has been used Drinkwell filters the water through a series of other tanks to take out other harmful substances.The water is sold locally by "Drinkwell" entrepreneurs and the money raised is used to maintain the system.The pricing is set depending on location but a monthly subscription costs anywhere between $0.05 (4p) and $0.12 for 20 litres (4.4 gallons) a day.Entrepreneurial opportunity According to the United Nations, 30% to 50% of all water projects fail after huge investments because of a failure to maintain the facilities.Image caption Drinkwell entrepreneur Habibur Rehman's plant in Manikganj, Bangladesh sells 150,000 litres a day Dr Khairul Islam, the country director for the charity Water Aid in Bangladesh' believes that social entrepreneurs have a role to play in tackling the arsenic poisoning.Dr Islam told the BBC that the main problem so far has been operation and maintenance.Because Drinkwell includes operational and maintenance costs at the centre of its model he says it is the kind of model "this country needs".The first Drinkwell plant began dispensing water in the Manikganj district in 2015.Today that one plant alone has 750 daily customers and dispenses 150,000 litres a day.The network has grown across the country, often by going into schools to deliver safe drinking water for students' meals, from there the word spreads across communities.There are now 30 Drinkwell filtration plants in India and Bangladesh serving more than 100,000 people.Mr Chowdhury believes this is just the start for Drinkwell.He hopes to eventually reach hundreds of millions of people across Asia.He is already talking to the Bangladesh government about rolling out the technology across the country.By involving the communities in the maintenance through their entrepreneur network Mr Chowdhury believes the system can provide clean water "forever".
The 'working class boy' who built a £1bn business:::::Image copyright RationalFX Image caption Mr Davdra's wife recently treated him to a new Harley Davidson Paresh Davdra is thrilled about the brand new Harley Davidson waiting for him in a friend's garage.It's not a sign of a mid-life crisis, he insists, but a wedding present from his wife who he married in August.He just has one more test to pass to get his motorcycle licence, then he can hop on the bike and whizz around London for meetings.The boss and co-founder of money exchange firm Rational FX, which reported revenues of more than 1bn ($1.3bn) last year, has a life that's worlds apart from his parents and grandparents.They were forced to flee Uganda in 1972 when dictator Idi Amin gave the Asian population just 90 days to leave the country."They came to the UK with just 50 between them," says the softly-spoken Mr Davdra."My grandfather had his own tailoring shop, but they had to leave everything behind."His family pulled together and bought a house in Harrow, north London, with his dad securing a job as clerk, and later as a financial controller, at a foreign exchange broker.Image copyright RationalFX Image caption Paresh Davdra co-founded RationalFX in 2005 Their fighting spirit rubbed off on the younger Davdra."We were never really given anything - if I wanted something, I had to earn it."From the age of 16, he spent the school holidays holding jobs in a mobile phone shop and in telesales, while out of term at Middlesex University, he worked at his dad's firm, taking up roles from filing to working in compliance.He studied marketing and computer science at university, but tells me that technology does not come naturally to him."If you told my team I had this degree, they wouldn't believe you.I'm always the one calling IT to connect the laptop to the printer," he laughs.As soon as Mr Davdra graduated, in 2003, he joined his dad's company as a foreign exchange dealer, helping clients to buy and sell large quantities of foreign currencies.He was in the role for just over a year, working with Indian-born Rajesh Agrawal, a friend of his father's who had arrived in the UK in 2001.But two factors would spur him to quit."I'd tried to buy a property with my dad but the bank rejected the mortgage application," Mr Davdra says."It deflated me."Image copyright RationalFX Image caption RationalFX is based in Canary Wharf, London At the same time, Mr Agrawal resigned from his IT manager role."When he decided to quit, I badgered him.I asked him to tell me what he was doing," Mr Davdra says.The two met for coffee and quickly agreed they wanted to set up a company together.The idea was to support customers buying property abroad with their currency needs."Everything we were doing at the old firm was manual, but we thought we could offer the same service online," Mr Davdra says.However, the duo faced a serious challenge: money.Mr Davdra was only a year out of university and had already taken out a personal loan to buy a BMW.When Mr Agrawal took their business plan to the bank and asked to borrow 10,000, he was swiftly rejected.But he returned a few days later and asked for 20,000 to buy a car.The bank said yes."I then sold my BMW and we were set," says 37-year-old Mr Davdra, who also moved into Mr Agrawal's home to save on rent.Image copyright RationalFX Image caption Mr Davdra's grandfather had to flee Uganda in 1972 With just 32,000 between them, the pair launched their foreign exchange brokerage, RationalFX, in 2005.Like many start-ups, the next difficult task was signing up customers."We got on the phones and started pitching to estate agents and attended every property industry event there was," recalls Mr Davdra."We'd be in the office all day from 8am, then we'd just be at it in the evenings."Their big breakthrough came when they signed a number of estate agents who were selling properties in Dubai.However, just two years after launching, the financial crisis hit.Mr Davdra reflects candidly on how it changed his young mindset.More The Boss features, which every week profile a different business leader from around the world: "I was 27 at the time and the business was doing great guns, and I was well on my way to being rich.That's all I thought about it."It wasn't really about building a business - that comes with time and maturity.But the crash brought that along.It was a good learning curve."Rational FX also felt the fall-out from the crash, with its growth slowing.But it weathered the storm and went on to diversify.Today, its clients range from high-net worth individuals, either buying property or making investments, to medium-sized businesses, such as firms exporting cars or importing textiles.Image copyright RationalFX Image caption RationalFX employs 110 people It reported revenues of 1.3bn in 2016, up from 1.1bn the year before, and pre-tax profits of 2.3m - largely because the firm reinvested heavily in its business, Mr Davdra says.After enjoying success with Rational FX, the founders had an idea for an offshoot company - an online money transfer platform aimed at individuals sending lower sums to family overseas."We felt that Rational FX was driving revenues, but Xendpay [the new company] was more of a social initiative, to try and bring the costs of remittance down for people working hard to bring their families out of poverty."Xendpay has a "pay what you want" model, although it does suggest a minimum commission of 0.3-0.4% of the transaction.Mr Davdra says that more than 70% of users pay the suggested fee, 10% hand over more, and the rest pay nothing.The platform isn't profitable yet, although Mr Davdra expects it to break even next year."It was a bit of gamble but a risk we were willing to take."'Still growing' Last year Mr Agrawal stepped down from the firm after he was appointed Deputy Mayor of London for Business.He still owns 70% of the business, and is a non-executive director, while Mr Davdra holds the remaining shares.Mr Davdra says he "misses him"."Apart from business, over the last 12 years we have developed a good relationship.He's a very very close friend."For now, there are no plans to sell RationalFX, although private equity firms approach the firm "an average of twice a day"."Our brands are still growing and are quite young.It's all about the right opportunity," Mr Davdra says.Headquartered at Canary Wharf, RationalFX and Xendpay together employ 110 members of staff.Despite his penchant for expensive bikes and cars, Mr Davdra - who still lives in Harrow - has his feet firmly on the ground."I think we're pretty humble.We're working class, and we just do normal stuff.It's the way we've been brought up."
How the humble S-bend made modern toilets possible:::::Image copyright Alamy "Gentility of speech is at an end," thundered an editorial in London's City Press, in 1858."It stinks!"The stink in question was partly metaphorical: politicians were failing to tackle an obvious problem.As its population grew, London's system for disposing of human waste became woefully inadequate.To relieve pressure on cess pits - which were prone to leaking, overflowing, and belching explosive methane - the authorities had instead started encouraging sewage into gullies.However, this created a different issue: the gullies were originally intended for only rainwater, and emptied directly into the River Thames.That was the literal stink - the Thames became an open sewer.Image copyright Alamy Cholera was rife.One outbreak killed 14,000 Londoners - nearly one in every 100.Civil engineer Joseph Bazalgette drew up plans for new, closed sewers to pump the waste far from the city.It was this project that politicians came under pressure to approve.The sweltering-hot summer of 1858 had made London's malodorous river impossible to politely ignore, or to discuss obliquely with "gentility of speech".The heatwave became popularly known as the "Great Stink".Unlikely figure If you live in a city with modern sanitation, it's hard to imagine daily life being permeated with the suffocating stench of human excrement.For that, we have a number of people to thank - but perhaps none more so than the unlikely figure of Alexander Cumming.50 Things That Made the Modern Economy highlights the inventions, ideas and innovations that helped create the economic world.It is broadcast on the BBC World Service.You can find more information about the programme's sources and listen online or subscribe to the programme podcast.A watchmaker in London a century before the Great Stink, Cumming won renown for his mastery of intricate mechanics.King George III commissioned him to make an elaborate instrument for recording atmospheric pressure, and he pioneered the microtome, a device for cutting ultra-fine slivers of wood for microscopic analysis.Image copyright Alamy Image caption Alexander Cumming's S-bend was crucial in the development of the flushing toilet But Cumming's world-changing invention owed nothing to precision engineering.It was a bit of pipe with a curve in it.In 1775, Cumming patented the S-bend.This became the missing ingredient to create the flushing toilet - and, with it, public sanitation as we know it.Simplicity Flushing toilets had previously foundered on the problem of smell: the pipe that connects the toilet to the sewer, allowing urine and faeces to be flushed away, will also also let sewer odours waft back up - unless you can create some kind of airtight seal.Cumming's solution was simplicity itself: bend the pipe.Water settles in the dip, stopping smells coming up; flushing the toilet replenishes the water.While we've moved on alphabetically from the S-bend to the U-bend, flushing toilets still deploy the same insight.Image copyright Alamy Rollout, however, came slowly: by 1851, flushing toilets remained novel enough in London to cause mass excitement when introduced at the Great Exhibition in Crystal Palace.Use of the facilities cost one penny, giving the English language one of its enduring euphemisms for emptying one's bladder, "to spend a penny".Hundreds of thousands of Londoners queued for the opportunity to relieve themselves while marvelling at the miracles of modern plumbing.If the Great Exhibition gave Londoners a vision of how public sanitation could be - clean, and smell-free - no doubt that added to the weight of popular discontent as politicians dragged their heels over finding the funds for Joseph Bazalgette's planned sewers.More than 170 years later, about two-thirds of the world's people have access to what's called "improved sanitation", according to the World Health Organization, up from about a quarter in 1980.That's a big step forward.Economic cost But that still means two and a half billion people don't have access to it, and "improved sanitation" itself is a relatively low bar.It "hygienically separates human excreta from human contact", but it doesn't necessarily treat the sewage itself.Fewer than half the world's people have access to sanitation systems that do that.More from Tim Harford: What the dynamo reveals about technological revolution Battery bonanza: From frogs' legs to mobiles and electric cars How the lift transformed the shape of our cities How air conditioning changed the world The economic costs of this ongoing failure to roll out proper sanitation are many and varied, from health care for diarrhoeal diseases to foregone revenue from hygiene-conscious tourists.The World Bank's Economics of Sanitation Initiative has tried to tot up the price tag.Across various African countries, for example, it reckons inadequate sanitation lops one or two percentage points off gross domestic product (GDP), in India and Bangladesh over 6%, and in Cambodia 7%.That soon adds up.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Open sewers are a common sight in Kibera, in Nairobi, Kenya The challenge is that public sanitation isn't something the market necessarily provides.Toilets cost money, but defecating in the street is free.'Positive externality' If I install a toilet, I bear all the costs, while the benefits of the cleaner street are felt by everyone.In economic parlance, that's a "positive externality" - and goods that have positive externalities tend to be bought at a slower pace than society, as a whole, would prefer.The most striking example is the "flying toilet" system of Kibera, in Nairobi, Kenya.The flying toilet works like this: you defecate into a plastic bag, and then in the middle of the night, whirl the bag around your head and hurl it as far away as possible.Replacing a flying toilet with a flushing toilet provides benefits to the toilet owner - but you can bet that the neighbours would appreciate it, too.Contrast, say, the mobile phone.That also costs money, but its benefits accrue largely to me.That's one reason why, although the S-bend has been around for 10 times as long as the mobile phone, many more people already own a mobile phone than a flushing toilet.If you want to buy a flushing toilet, it also helps if there's a system of sewers to plumb it into, and creating one is a major undertaking - financially and logistically.Image copyright Otto Herschan Image caption Joseph Bazalgette, standing top right, views the Northern Outfall sewer being built below the Abbey Mills pumping station in 1862 When Joseph Bazalgette finally got the cash to build London's sewers, they took 10 years to complete and necessitated digging up 2.5 million cubic metres (88 million cubic ft) of earth.Because of the externality problem, such a project might not appeal to private investors: it tends to require determined politicians, willing taxpayers and well-functioning municipal governments.And those, it seems, are in short supply.According to a study published in 2011, just 6% of India's towns and cities have succeeded in building even a partial network of sewers.The capacity for delay seems almost unlimited.Geographical quirk London's lawmakers likewise procrastinated- but when they finally acted, they didn't hang about.As Stephen Halliday recounts in his book The Great Stink of London, it took just 18 days to rush through the necessary legislation for Bazalgette's plans.What explains this sudden, impressive alacrity?Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The Houses of Parliament, photographed in 1858, the year of the Great Stink A quirk of geography: London's Parliament building is located right next to the River Thames.Officials tried to shield lawmakers from the Great Stink, soaking the curtains in chloride of lime in a bid to mask the stench.But it was no use.Try as they might, the politicians couldn't ignore it.The Times described, with a note of grim satisfaction, how MPs had been seen abandoning the building's library, "each gentleman with a handkerchief to his nose".If only concentrating politicians' minds was always that easy.Tim Harford writes the Financial Times's Undercover Economist column.50 Things That Made the Modern Economy is broadcast on the BBC World Service.You can find more information about the programme's sources and listen online or subscribe to the programme podcast.
What is happening with Japan Inc?:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Japan's reputation for precision manufacturing is coming under more pressure Japan has long been held up as a shining example of integrity, assured quality and reliable products.But the deepening scandal at Kobe Steel over falsified figures could further tarnish the Made in Japan brand.Kobe's troubles started when it admitted last weekend to faking data about the quality, strength and durability of some of the materials it delivered to more than 200 companies including Boeing, Nissan and Toyota.On Friday it said the number of firms involved had risen to 500.The news has wiped out about $1.8bn (1.3bn) off Kobe Steel's market value this week.But with at least half a dozen major Japanese companies admitting to fraud and misconduct in as many years, questions are being raised over why this keeps happening and if there's a systemic problem in Japan.'Cutting corners' Experts say the long term slowdown in economic growth from the 1990s onwards has been a major contributing factor.It has forced Japanese firms to change their business models, and this appears to have taken its toll."Large corporations used to live in a stable, predictable and growing market, but things have changed and some companies may have resorted to cutting corners," says Takuji Okubo, managing director and chief economist of Japan Macro Advisors, in Tokyo.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Kobe Steel's Hiroya Kawasaki apologised for the "tremendous trouble" the firm had caused Until two decades ago, Japanese firms were focussed on growth strategies but the realisation that their economy would no longer grow as strongly anymore meant companies had to concentrate on restructuring, cost-cutting and extreme efficiency.Speaking to the BBC, Martin Schulz, senior research fellow at Fujitsu Research Institute in Tokyo says these painful adjustments have seen some companies struggle "to adjust to the new rules of the game".The push to improve efficiencies made management desperate to show positive results, sometimes even testing the limits of quality control, he says.Mr Schulz adds core-employees and managers have been stretched to the limit, which in some cases, resulted in overwork and misconduct.But the need to open up new markets overseas to boost profits has created other problems for Japanese firms, especially at their subsidiaries abroad.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Kobe Steel is Japan's third largest steelmaker Florian Kohlbacher, director of the Economist Corporate Network for North Asia, says some companies tried to grow too quickly by expanding overseas without having enough experienced managers to supervise operations.Detecting fraud The misconduct at Kobe Steel follows scandals at carmakers Nissan Motor and Mitsubishi Motors, as well as car airbag-maker Takata Corp, which filed for bankruptcy in June after a global recall sparked by 16 deaths and many injuries.Just two weeks ago, Nissan Motor recalled 1.2m vehicles that had been certified by unauthorised technicians.And the electronics giant Toshiba Corporation is still reeling from the consequences of an accounting scandal in which its profits were inflated.Despite the prevalence of such high profile cases, experts say quality and compliance remain paramount in Japan.But they still expect more scandals involving fraud and misconduct to be uncovered in future.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Manufacturers of cars, trains and planes are checking if they used sub-standard Kobe Steel materials Mr Kohlbacher says this is partly because new technology such as the internet of things and sensors have made it easier to detect wrongdoing, errors and fraud, while digitisation has helped to spread information about problems and improve transparency.While it is still unclear how the data tampering at Kobe Steel was uncovered, "in a more transparent corporate environment, companies have to come clean on mistakes and misconduct much earlier," says Mr Schulz.Expect more scandals Furthermore, more fraud and misconduct scandals are also expected to be uncovered as a result of laws to protect whistleblowers that came into effect in 2006.The most explosive case came to light five years later when Michael Woodford, the British president of Olympus, became the most senior corporate figure in history to blow the whistle on his own company.His revelations uncovered a $1.4bn (880m) accounting fraud scandal in which the Japanese medical and equipment firm hid investment losses dating back to the 1990s.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Quality control questions at Kobe Steel could further erode trust in Japanese firms Mr Kohlbacher says more people have reported wrongdoings since the laws were enacted but it is difficult to confirm exactly how many people have been able to use the legislation to raise the alarm about wrongdoing in their companies.And debate still rages in Japan on whether whistleblowers are adequately protected because the laws do not provide for penalties against companies that punish staff by dismissing or demoting them.Some argue there are further safeguards from wrongdoing provided by Japan's Consumer Affairs Agency, which opened in 2009.Image copyright Reuters Image caption The news has wiped out about $1.8bn off Kobe Steel's market value It was created following several accidents caused by substandard products and a number of food poisoning scandals including a case involving Chinese dumplings."Any manufacturer that had a defective product would once have been dealt with by a government ministry but the Consumer Affairs Agency took over these responsibilities," says Keith Henry from the consultancy firm Asia Strategy.Mr Henry adds that the new reporting system focuses much more on the consumer rather than the manufacturer, with regulatory authorities willing to investigate and prosecute cases of misconduct.Rebuilding the brand Some people believe the unwanted spotlight on Japanese firms could actually have a positive effect."There seems to be wide agreement now that just focusing on costs and increasing profitability won't be sufficient as future strategies," says Mr Schulz.Mr Kohlbacher says he now expects "companies to have a close look at their operations and make sure they amend any problems before they turn into something major".But some warn tougher penalties are needed for companies that fail to meet government standards because self-regulation does not always appear to work.Citing the recent Dentsu case last week in which the Japanese advertising giant was only fined 500,000 yen (US$4,400; 3,321) for breaching labour regulations, Mr Okubo says "I think there's something very wrong here."But rather than highlighting a systemic problem in Japan, Mr Okubo says the prevalence of misconduct cases was evidence that "corporate governance in Japan is working" because firms are reporting internal problems so that they can be dealt with.As for companies that want to distance themselves from the fraud and misconduct, he says: "It is about time that each manufacturer stops branding itself as 'Japanese' and instead starts to build their own brand".
Formula One teams' costs rocket after rules changes:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Lewis Hamilton during the Japan F1 Grand Prix Next weekend Britain's Lewis Hamilton could secure his fourth Formula One title at the United States Grand Prix.His Mercedes team is a staggering 145 points ahead of arch-rivals Ferrari despite the sport introducing rules this year which aimed to put the brakes on the dominance of a single outfit.They came at a hefty cost.The new regulations were designed to make for closer racing by increasing aerodynamic and mechanical grip through the introduction of wider tyres and wings.According to one of the teams it has "rewritten" the rulebook and the impact is just as noticeable off track as on it.But if some had hoped the rules might stop Mercedes from running away with the F1 championship they will have been disappointed.Ironically, they have also forced up its rivals' costs.Only the frontrunners have had the resources to foot the bill from their cashflow whilst one of the outfits lower down the grid even had to get a driver to cover the cost.Research has revealed that new regulations fuelled a 167.6m increase in the F1 teams' costs in 2016.They rose 14.5% to hit a combined 1.3bn - the highest-ever total recorded in the sport.F1 cars are designed the year before they race so the bulk of the investment in them is paid for then, too.It means that the cost of this year's campaign is reflected in the teams' 2016 accounts and the final one of them was filed last week.Eight of F1's ten teams have to file publicly-available accounts - the only exceptions are Ferrari as its outfit is run by the car manufacturer itself, and Swiss-based Sauber where firms don't have to release their finances.The costs of the teams' operating companies came to an average of 165.9m in 2016, topped by Northamptonshire-based Mercedes which spent 274.9m excluding the investment in its engines.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption F1 teams' costs rose 14.5% to hit 1.3bn last year It is the highest ever total recorded on the accounts of a British F1 team and even eclipses the turbocharged spending levels before the 2008 economic crash which drove Toyota and Honda out of the sport.At the other end of the spectrum is last year's new entrant Haas F1 which spent a third as much as the championship leaders.Haas has managed to keep its costs down by taking advantage of a new rule allowing teams to buy in more parts than before.Haas uses a Ferrari engine with a chassis created by Italian manufacturer Dallara which also makes the cars for the F2 junior series.Relying on suppliers reduces research and development expenditure which, along with staffing and engine costs, is one of their biggest costs - it rose across the board in 2016 as teams had to design cars to meet the new regulations.They were introduced by F1's governing body the Federation Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) to address criticism that the outcome of races was clear before they started due to the dominance of Mercedes.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Haas has kept costs down by buying in more parts than before With Hamilton at the wheel it has won both the constructors' and the drivers' championship for the past three years running.This year is set to be no different but there has been a far higher price to pay.Writing in the introduction to its accounts Mercedes' team boss Toto Wolff notes that there has been "an increase of 27.9m in operating costs mainly due to the impact of technical regulation changes and movement in foreign exchange rates".The 2016 accounts for Force India, also based in Northamptonshire, give more insight into the effort required to meet the new rules.It says that combined with the change in tyre-sizes "our traditional method of retaining 50% of the previous season's car and updating the remaining 50% is not possible for 2017".Over 90% of Force India's car this year is completely new.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Force India has helped cover its increased costs with cash from driver Nikita Mazepin The team planned to cover its increased costs with income from an unlikely source: a driver contract signed with Russian youngster, Nikita Mazepin, "secured a cash injection ahead of significant regulation changes ahead of the 2017 season", said Force India.Mazepin was just 16 when he signed up last year and he has tested for the team twice since then, most recently in July after the Hungarian Grand Prix.He has ample resources to pay as his father Dmitry became a billionaire through owning the mineral fertiliser producer Uralchem.Despite this, Force India still chalked up a net loss of 11.6m - the largest of any team in 2016.The regulation changes even dented the bottom line of British manufacturing giant McLaren.Its went from a net 3.4m profit in 2015 to an after-tax loss of 3.2m the following year.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption For F1 teams, victory on the track is more important than making a profit Overall the teams made a combined net loss of 2m last year.Perhaps surprisingly this is nothing new as unlike most businesses, profit is not the barometer of success in F1.Instead teams judge their performance on racing results and tend to spend all of their income on this in a bid for victory.Some even pump in more than they make, with additional funds usually coming from owners' pockets or debt.The theory is that it is better to win and make no profit than make money and finish low in the standings.Victory on track increases a team's ability to bring in more sponsorship,, as brands are prepared to pay more to be associated with a winner.The teams' revenue generally comes from three sources with two providing the lion's share.They are fuelled by F1's huge television audience (390m viewers last year).The first key revenue source is sponsorship which comprises around a third of the teams' revenue, Another third comes from prize money.F1's parent company, which is owned by American investment firm Liberty Media, pays the teams around 66% of its annual profits as prize money and it came to $985.5m (742m) in 2016.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Despite numerous failed attempts there are new proposals to introduce a budget cap for F1 teams Payments from owners represent around half of the teams' remaining revenue and the marketing benefit from the exposure on TV compensates for this investment.If costs increase these payments often rise to compensate and last year Red Bull poured in four times more money into its flagship team.Its investment into Red Bull Racing hit 40.6m as costs surged 9.2% to 197m.As its owner has deep pockets Red Bull Racing doesn't need to rely on drivers who pay but income from them is the remaining source of revenue for F1 teams.They are a hallmark of teams at the bottom of the grid but their days could be numbered.Despite numerous failed attempts F1 hasn't given up on introducing a budget cap and recent reports suggest that Liberty Media will shortly present plans to the teams for introduction in 2021 when their current race contracts expire.But it will be the sport's governing body, the FIA, that will ultimately decide on any changes A limit of 114m has been suggested and this would level the playing field as the smallest teams are already below this whilst the frontrunners would have to scale back.Although it may seem like a logical direction for the sport to go in it would make the recent boost in spending seem all the more pointless.
