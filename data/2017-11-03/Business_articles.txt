As the global economy picks up, inflation is oddly quiescent:::::A FEW years ago, the news about the euro-zone economy was uniformly bad to the point of tedium.These days, it is the humdrum diet of benign data that prompts a yawn.Figures this week show that GDP rose by 0.6% in the three months to the end of September (an annualised rate of 2.4%).The European Commissions economic-sentiment index rose to its highest level in almost 17 years.Yet when the European Central Banks governing council gathered on October 26th, it decided to keep interest rates unchanged, at close to zero, and to extend its bond-buying programme (known as quantitative easing, or QE) for a further nine months.The central bank said it would slow down the pace of bond purchases each month, to 30bn ($35bn) from January.But Mario Draghi, the banks boss, declined to set an end-date for QE.A hefty dose of easy money will be necessary, he argued, until inflation durably converges on the ECBs target of just below 2%.It shows few signs of doing so, despite the economys strength.Underlying, or core, inflation, which excludes the volatile prices of food and energy, fell from 1.1% to 0.9% in October, according to data published a few days after the ECB meeting.The euro zones miseries of 2010-12 were unique.But in its present, happier state of vigorous activity, low inflation and easy monetary policy, it is like many other big economies (see chart).After a decade of interest rates at record lows, those central banks that are inclined to tighten policy naturally attract attention.The Bank of Englands monetary-policy committee raised its benchmark interest rate from 0.25% to 0.5% on November 2nd, the first increase since 2007.On the same day, the Czech National Bank raised interest rates for the second time this year.The Federal Reserve kept interest rates unchanged this week, having raised them in March and June, but a further increase is expected in December.In Turkey, perhaps the only big economy that is obviously overheating, the central bankwhich has been browbeaten by the president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who believes high interest rates cause inflationopted on October 26th to keep interest rates on hold.Yet in most biggish economies, underlying inflation is below target (see chart) and monetary policy is being relaxed.Brazils central bank cut interest rates on October 25th from 8.25% to 7.5%.Two days later, Russias central bank trimmed its main interest rate, to 8.25%.This week the Bank of Japan voted to keep rates unchanged and to continue buying assets at a pace of around 80trn ($700bn) a year.These economies are gathering strength.It is a puzzle that, in such circumstances, global inflation is stubbornly low.To figure out why, consider the model that modern central banks use to explain inflation.It has three elements: the price of imports; the publics expectations; and capacity pressures (or slack) in the domestic economy.Start with imported inflation, which is determined by the balance of supply and demand in globally traded goods, such as commodities, as well as shifts in exchange rates.Commodity prices have picked up smartly from their nadir in early 2016.The oil price, which fell below $30 a barrel then, has risen above $60.This has put upward pressure on headline inflation: in the euro zone it is 1.4%, half a percentage point higher than the core rate.Where inflation is noticeably high, it is generally in countries, such as Argentina (where it is 24%) or Egypt (32%), that have withdrawn costly price subsidies and whose currencies have fallen sharply in value, making imported goods dearer.In Britain, rising import prices linked to a weaker pound have added around 0.75 percentage points to inflation, which is 3%.A second influence on inflation is the publics expectations.Businesses will be more inclined to push up their prices and employees to bid for fatter pay packets if they believe inflation will rise.How these expectations are formed is not well understood.The measures that are available are broadly consistent with the central banks inflation target in most rich economies.Japan is something of an outlier.It has struggled to meet its 2% inflation target in large part because firms and employees have become conditioned to expect a lower rate of inflation.Japans prime minister, Shinzo Abe, recently called for companies to raise wages by 3% in next springs wage round to kick-start inflation.Leave aside the transient effects of import prices, and inflation becomes a tug-of-war between expectations and a third big influence, the amount of slack in the economy.The unemployment rate, a measure of labour-market slack, is the most-used gauge.As the economy approaches full employment, the scarcity of workers ought to put upward pressure on wages, which companies then pass on in higher prices.On some measures, Japans labour market is as tight as it has been since the 1970s.Americas jobless rate, at 4.2%, is the lowest for over 16 years.Inflation has nevertheless been surprisingly weak.In other words, the trade-off between unemployment and inflation, known as the Phillips curve, has become less steep.A paper last year by Olivier Blanchard, of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, found that a drop in the unemployment rate in America has less than a third as much power to raise inflation as it did in the mid-1970s.The central banks that see a need for tighter monetary policy are worried about diminishing slack.There are tentative signs of stronger pay pressures in Britain and America, and firm evidence of them in the Czech Republic, where wage growth is above 7%.Even so, with inflation expectations so steady, the flatter Phillips curve suggests that the cost for central banks in higher inflation of delaying interest-rate rises is rather low.The ECB is quite a way from such considerations.The unemployment rate is falling quickly, but remains high, at 8.9%.There is still room for the euro-zone economy to grow quickly without stoking inflation.The dull routine of good news is likely to continue.
Japanese cars enjoy an afterlife in Myanmar, but not for much longer:::::THE Japanese make cars that last but replace them relatively quickly.The average car in Japan is three years younger than in America.This combination of durable manufacturing and dutiful consumption of a prized national product works out well for the rest of the world; many countries import older Japanese cars in bulk.Secondhand vehicles fill vast parking lots in Japans port cities, awaiting shipment to New Zealand, the United Arab Emirates and elsewhere.The third-most-popular destination is Myanmar, which imported over 80,000 used Japanese vehicles in the first nine months of this year, according to Japans International Auto Trade Association.Drivers believe that Toyotas, Hondas and Nissans can stand up to the countrys pockmarked roads, a faith not yet shown in South Korean and Chinese cars.There is only one problem, which is that Japan drives on the left, Myanmar on the right.As a consequence, most of Myanmars drivers sit on the wrong side of the car, where it is harder to see oncoming traffic.Settle into the passenger seat of a Honda taxi on a narrow rural road and you may be called upon to perform unexpected duties like telling your driver when it is safe to overtake a slow-moving lorry, without hitting a scooter, gaggle of children or bonnet-less jalopy travelling in the other direction.Not everyone executes these responsibilities successfully.Myanmar has the highest rate of deaths per vehicle among the ten members of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN), according to the World Health Organisation.Evidence of accidents litters the roadside outside Yangon: a silver Toyota that has lost everything in front of its windscreen and a red Suzuki hatchback that also now has a hatchfront.Myanmars government periodically tightens the import rules to keep older and less safe cars off the countrys roads.In October it said it will allow individuals to import only cars built in 2016 or after.And after this year, it will no longer grant import permits for right-hand-drive cars.The tighter policy may encourage local car assembly.Suzuki will open a new factory for left-hand-drive cars outside Yangon next year, adding to its existing plant in the citys east.But the change will oblige drivers to buy cars that are either more expensive or less authentically Japanese.The new left-hand-drive Corolla on display in the Toyota Mingalar dealership in Yangon, for example, was made in Thailand and is listed at $33,900, over 26 times the countrys national income per person.One other constituency may also come to regret the altered rules.Many poorer residents of Yangon, where motorcycles are banned, ride bicycles or sit in three-wheeled trishaws, trundling alongside the kerb.As more of Myanmars drivers shift to the left seat, oncoming traffic will be easier to spot; but these kerbside pedal pushers will be more exposed than ever.
A merger between CVS Health and Aetna could be what the doctor ordered:::::STANLEY and Sidney Goldstein would scarcely recognise their creation.In 1963 the brothers opened a humble storefront in Lowell, Massachusetts, selling health and beauty products.Determined to put customers first, they named their enterprise Consumer Value Stores.Today the Goldsteins startup, soon afterwards sold to a bigger firm, is nothing short of a health-care Goliath.Revenues at CVS Health reached $177bn last year, riches which come from 9,700 retail pharmacies and from its operations in mail-order drugs and sales of more expensive speciality medicines.The firm commands nearly a quarter of the American market for prescription drug sales (see chart).It is also the biggest pharmacy-benefit manager (PBM) in America, a type of middleman that negotiates bulk discounts on drugs with large pharmaceutical firms on behalf of employers and insurers.Yet even that formidable position is not enough.CVS is reported to have made a bid for Aetna, a big American health insurer (both firms have refused to comment publicly).Aetna, which had revenues last year of about $63bn, is in a different business, serving mainly corporate clients by providing health insurance for their employees.The two companies already have a relationship, however, since CVS has a contract to serve as Aetnas PBM.If consummated, the transaction would be one of the biggest ever in American health care (and a tie-up between the two would doubtless encourage other transactions of a similar nature).That raises two questions.Why would the two be contemplating a deal?And crucially, given the tendency of prior mergers to fatten profit margins rather than lower prices, would such consolidation yield benefits to consumers?Start with the reasons for a deal.Health care is becoming increasingly unaffordable for American consumers.Since 2014, total health-care cost inflation has been 6-7%, owing to growth in the cost of everything from doctors and hospitals to medical devices and drugs.Such large rises cannot continue indefinitely.Drug retailers in particular fear the prospect of Amazon entering their business.The e-commerce titan was recently reported to have sought regulatory approval to distribute pharmaceutical products in a dozen or so states.That news, which broke in October, prompted sharp falls in the shares of several firms in the pharmaceutical supply chain.Selling drugs would be harder for Amazon than out-competing department stores, in part because consumers do not typically pay much of the cost of drugs (insurers do).If it has serious ambitions in health care, it might even be forced to build or buy a PBM.Even so, history suggests that the firms relentless focus on consumers and willingness to forgo profits for years make it a huge potential threat to incumbent pharmacies.PBMs, once seen as cash cows, also face an uncertain future.These middlemen took off in the 2000s by promising to cut drug prices through aggregating demand and negotiating discounts with Big Pharma.Pembroke, an industry consultancy, estimates that the total value of drug rebates and discounts soared from $39bn in 2008 to $125bn in 2015.Some PBMs used questionable practices, including secret rebates (in addition to the discounts negotiated upfront on drug prices, that were passed on to PBM customers), which allowed them to pocket much of the savings rather than pass them on to insurers and employers and in turn, to consumers.Anthem, a big health insurer, sued Express Scripts, which it fired as its PBM, for $15bn last year, alleging that the latter firm had withheld savings and overcharged it by huge sums (Express Scripts denies the allegations).In October Anthem unveiled plans to launch its own in-house PBM with help from CVS.UnitedHealth, another giant health insurer, acquired Catamaran, a big PBM, in 2015, and merged it into OptumRx, its in-house PBM.Greater transparency in pricing is coming, argues Viren Mehta of Mehta Partners, an industry consultancy, be that through vertical integration (as in the purported deal between CVS and Aetna) or via the entry of a titan like Amazon.If opacity is reduced, the PBMs lose market power and profits, he says.This combination of forces explains why a CVS-Aetna merger might make sense: to make CVS a more formidable competitor against possible new entrants, such as Amazon, into the bit of the business started by the Goldsteins, and to extract efficiencies by cutting out the middlemen in the health-care supply chain.Other such deals are easy to imagine.Analysts reckon that insurance firms including WellCare, Centene and Humana are potential targets for acquisition.As the biggest stand-alone PBM, Express Scripts is thought to be a potential target, too.Anthem, which may lose CVS as a partner if antitrust authorities prise the two firms apart as a condition of approving a CVS-Aetna deal, may soon be shopping for a new PBM.The specific nature of these sorts of tie-up offers some reason to hope that the answer to the second questionwhether consolidation will benefit consumerswill turn out to be positive.In the past, firms have typically joined horizontally within a market segment.This has generally led to oligopolies that enjoy fat profits but do little to lower prices and lift quality for patients.Such horizontal mergers have been increasingly frowned upon by regulators in recent years.Up and down, not across The CVS-Aetna deal is an effort at vertical integration, which by removing rent-seeking middlemen can, in theory at least, lead to more choice, better health outcomes and lower prices for consumers.If this seems far-fetched, consider the example of Uniteds pioneering use of data analytics and artificial intelligence at its in-house PBM.As costs spiral upwards, insurers interest in ensuring the good health of consumers deepens.Because United can now analyse both a patients medical files and her pharmacy records, it can track how medications are taken and whether or not they work well.A small group of integrated health-care systems in America, such as Kaiser Permanente, Intermountain and the Mayo Clinic, has been shown to have delivered better care and lower costs.By creating a much more integrated firm, the CVS-Aetna deal could do the same.CVS already has more than a thousand MinuteClinics (cheap and cheerful health centres) at its pharmacies offering affordable medical care seven days a week.The combined firm would offer everything from basic health services to diagnostics to drug-infusion centres.It would have a strong incentive to make sure that customers have good access to primary care, including vaccinations, medical information, prescriptions, and follow-ups.Consumers would save through lower premiums, lower out-of-pocket spending at preferred CVS outlets, or both, reckons Adam Fein of Pembroke.Moreover, the accumulation of data on what interventions work best in similar patients would speed the personalisation of medicine.In truth, no one knows how a CVS-Aetna deal would affect consumers of health care, as this structure of transaction, at this scale, has not been tried.The concern for patientsand for trustbustersis what would happen if customers of a combined firm wanted to receive care from other clinics or buy drugs from other pharmacies, perhaps because it was restricting choice or increasing co-payments.The reason for hope is that this vertical deal could become a template for a new sort of health-care firm, which offers a lower-cost ecosystem of quality health care.That could be a boon to consumers; it would have pleased the Goldstein brothers, too.
Smoking rooms are disappearing from hotels:::::TO THE list of endangered travel facilitieswhich includes pay phones, communal aeroplane screens and concierges there is one more to add: smoking rooms.Even a few years ago, guests were routinely asked whether they would prefer a smoking room or not.But today fewer hotels are offering smoking rooms and those that do have a vanishingly small supply.According to the latest report from the American Hotel and Lodging Association, a trade group, the share of hotel rooms that are non-smoking has steadily risen from 74% to 97% over the last decade.And the proportion of hotels that only offer non-smoking rooms has jumped from 38% in 2008 to 85% last year.For a business traveller with a tobacco habit, then, there are few options.Those seeking a dash of glamour will struggle, as 97% of luxury hotels do not have smoking rooms.Only among budget-hotel categorythe lowest price segment of five listed in the surveydo the majority of establishments have any smoking rooms on offer.Small hotels are more likely to have smoking rooms than larger ones.And older hotels are a slightly better bet than new ones.Non-smokers may want to avoid these cheaper, older haunts.Even if they land a non-smoking room in a hotel with smoking options, they are still subject to second-hand smoke.A study in 2013 found that the levels of tobacco air pollutants in non-smoking rooms were five times as high as in non-smoking hotels.And levels of surface pollution, such as cigarette ash, were 25 times higher.Smokers can, of course, stay in non-smoking rooms and use a variety of strategies to get their fix.The most obvious of which is to brave the elements for a puff outside.But many opt for more devious approaches.Internet forums are full of advice for people who want to smoke in non-smoking rooms (and dodge the often-hefty fines for the hotel to decontaminate the room).The least obnoxious of these is to upgrade to a room with a balcony.More egregious options include smoking out the window, exhaling into the bathroom vents, turning on a hot shower so that the steam can absorb the smell and putting a wet towel under the door.But travellers who indulge in tobacco should recognise the way that the winds are blowing.In America, none of the hotels owned by Marriott International allow smoking, nor do Wyndham Hotel Groups lifestyle and full-service brands.Two new Hilton brands, Canopy and Tru, will not allow smoking in any of their hotels in the world.Outside of America, there are usually more smoking options, although Europe is also increasingly going smoke-free.Smokers who do not want to mess around with wet towels and steam baths, should prepare for a future in which having a cigarette in a hotel room is no longer an option.
Catalonia and the perils of fiscal redistribution:::::POPULISM is the weapon not just of the downtrodden.As the crisis in Catalonia demonstrates, the rich have economic anxieties of their own.Catalonia has an identity distinct, in important ways, from that of the rest of Spain.But the recent drive for independence has been energised by anger over the flow of fiscal redistribution from rich Catalans to their countrymen: people seen, in parts of the restless north-east, as thankless and lazy as well as alien.Paradoxically, globalisation has inflamed separatism around the world by raising the question Catalans now confront: to whom, exactly, do we owe a sense of social responsibility?Every country or restive region has its own idiosyncratic history.Yet over the long run national borders are surprisingly malleable.Some circumstances offer better prospects for the small and newly independent than others.The smaller the country, the more easily its government can satisfy its peoples political preferences.A broadly satisfying compromise is easier among 300,000 people than 300m.But as Alberto Alesina and Enrico Spolaore note in their book, The Size of Nations, smaller countries also face hardships.They sacrifice economies of scalethey need, for example, to operate their own state agencies, rather than spread the expense of government across a larger population.Borders are bound to add to trading costs, leaving countries with smaller internal markets at an economic disadvantage.At times of foreign-policy tension, smaller countries, with correspondingly constrained armies and defence budgets, are easier to bully.So the world is more likely to sprout new countries when it is relatively peaceful, and when technology and global co-operation reduce international barriers to trade.Although moves towards independence in East Timor, Kosovo and South Sudan were accompanied by appalling bloodshed, it is no coincidence that over the past half-century the number of sovereign states has increased in tandem with a decline in global violence and an increase in trade.For Catalonias residents, membership of the Kingdom of Spain brings sacrifices, like the need to share decision-making on some matters with millions of other Spaniards.Were Catalonia able to secede from Spain yet keep its existing trade relationships, leaving would look quite attractive.Smaller regions motives for seeking independence are not always high-minded.In rich economies, the better-off subsidise the poor through an array of welfare programmes.That means richer regions support poorer ones financially.Geographical redistribution is not always a source of tension.Residents of Massachusetts rarely moan about the flow of their federal-tax dollars to Mississippi.Wealth divisions that coincide with stark cultural differences, however, can be more contentious.The financial crisis and its aftermath, by swelling the ranks of the unemployed (and thus of those dependent on government help), was ammunition for politicians in regions keen to cut ties with their national economies.Catalans bridle at the fiscal drag placed on them by the rest of Spain, but they are not alone; just last month, Italians in the richer north also voted to demand greater autonomy.Fearing dismemberment, national governments often use fiscal decentralisation to reduce separatist pressures.Nationalist sentiment lies along a spectrum, and giving unhappy regions more say over their taxing and spending can deflect moderates from a pro-secession stance.Decentralisation has been a part of Britains (so far successful) strategy for managing Scottish separatism, for example.Delegating greater authority to regions, however, brings risks.As the capacity of regional governments grows, citizens might become more confident in their prospects as truly independent countries.So governments will sometimes instead tighten the screws on the disgruntled region in order to limit its ability to govern itself.Madrid has used such tactics at times, most recently in 2010, when Spains right-leaning Popular Party succeeded in rolling back rights previously granted to Catalonia.Similarly, the EU has said that seceding regions will have to reapply for membershipimplying a damaging period of economic impairment.Decentralisation is not a costless concession by the national government.In the short run, it clearly exacerbates inequality within the affected country, since fewer resources flow to poorer people and places.Some economists, like Jason Sorens of Dartmouth College, argue that, over longer periods, by encouraging regional competition for mobile people and capital, decentralisation leads to better economic performance.But if rich places tend to stay rich, because productive firms and people benefit from proximity to other such firms and people, then decentralisation can create lasting hardship for poorer places.Rich regions can support high-quality public goods at low cost because a larger tax base can be tapped to manage fewer of the social ills associated with poverty.In poorer ones the reverse is true, as more health, education and other needs must be met from a smaller tax base.It is just that the alternativethe abrupt, possibly extra-legal secession of the unhappy regionoften looks worse.Closer and closer For liberals, it is hard to know how to view separatism.Democratic self-determination seems a laudable principle.The threat of secession may even act as a check on the temptation among a poorer majority to saddle a richer minority with economically stifling levels of taxation.But cultural identity is a fuzzy, mutable thing.When it becomes an excuse for dodging responsibilities while enjoying the benefits of open markets, it endangers both social harmony and openness.The geographical scope of redistribution will inevitably be limited by popular ideas about who truly belongs within the national fold.But it is better for everyone if that circle expands over time, rather than shrinks.
Asian households binge on debt:::::ONE of the more persistent beliefs about the global economy is that Asians are more frugal than others.Explanations have drawn on culture (the self-discipline of Confucianism), history (memories of privation) and public policy (flimsy social safety-nets forcing people to save).For Lee Kuan Yew, the founding father of Singapore, and other theorists of Asian values, thrift was one of them.Whatever the true reason, data long supported the basic claim that Asian households were indeed careful with their cash.But over the past few years consumers across the region have done their best to prove that prudence was perhaps just a passing phase.Household debt in advanced economies has generally declined as a percentage of GDP since the 2008 global financial crisis, according to the Bank for International Settlements.In a number of Asian countries, however, it has been going in the opposite direction (see chart).The biggest increase has been in China, where households have borrowed about $4.5trn over the past decade.But Chinese households were starting from an extremely low base.Relative to income levels, South Korea, Thailand and Malaysia have reached much loftier heights.Over the same period, consumer borrowing has also risen in Hong Kong and Singapore.The increase in debt is, to a certain extent, healthy.An oft-heard criticism of Asian economies is that, in terms of global growth, they have been punching below their weight.They produce lots of stuff but rely on profligate Westerners to buy it.The rise in debt has, so far at least, helped change that dynamic, fuelling more consumption.Retail spending in Asia, excluding Japan, has grown by about 10% a year over the past half-decade.Greater access to credit has made it easier to buy homes, cars and clothes.But debt can also be dangerous.A recent paper by the IMF observed that, in the short term, an increase in household borrowing props up economic growth and keeps unemployment down.After a while, though, these gains are reversed.The IMF study found that a five-percentage-point increase in the household debt-to-GDP ratio over three years tends to result in a 1.25-percentage-point decline in real growth three years in the future.And an increase of a single percentage point in household debt increases the likelihood of a banking crisis by a similar percentage.In Asia financial fragility is not the main worry.Even if households have been indulging themselves more freely, most regulators have remained prudent.In South Korea they mandate that mortgages cannot exceed 70% of a propertys value.Singaporean homebuyers who borrow from banks must make downpayments of at least 20%and potentially much more if they already have outstanding loans.Asian banks are also reluctant to pursue the kind of subprime lending that made consumer debt so toxic in America a decade ago.The bigger risk in Asia is interest rates, says Frederic Neumann, co-head of Asian economic research at HSBC.He notes that fixed long-term rates are rare in the region.Most consumer loans have shorter durations, so if central banks start to increase rates, debt-servicing costs for households will quickly rise.That will eat into incomes and act as a drag on consumption.It is already possible to detect headwinds.Mortgage payments in China have reached about 4.5% of total annual household income, up from 3.6% in 2015, according to Ernan Cui of Gavekal Dragonomics, a research firm.That, in turn, is beginning to weigh on consumption.For the government this entails a trade-off.The increase in mortgages has helped reduce a glut of unsold homes, which posed a graver danger to the economy than does consumer debt.There is also an uglier side to the rise in household borrowing.As in other parts of the world, unscrupulous lenders prey on the most vulnerable.In South Korea the share of low-income households struggling under heavy debt burdens has been creeping up.Choi Pae-kun, an economist at Konkuk University in Seoul, points out that poorer people may have no choice other than to borrow to cover living and medical costs.In China online lenders have been involved in a series of scandals.Some have demanded exorbitant interest rates and, in a number of cases, forced students to post as collateral naked selfies, with the threat they could be distributed if dues are not paid.Debt can undermine Asian values in more ways than one.
October 30th marked the 70th birthday of the WTO’s precursor:::::SUPERLATIVES surrounded the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) when it was signed on October 30th 1947.A press release heralded it as the most far-reaching negotiation[s] ever undertaken in the history of world trade.The Economist grumbled it was one of the longest and most complicated public documents ever issuedand one of the hardest to comprehend.The Daily Express , a British newspaper, growled: The big bad bargain is sealed.The agreements complexity matched the tangle of global trade affairs.In the preceding decades a thicket of protectionism had strangled commerce and slowed recovery from the Depression of the 1930s.The GATTs length matched its scope.It included both tariff cuts and promises to forswear new duties.Covering 23 countries responsible for 70% of world trade, it came to embody the rules-based multilateral system.After 48 years as a provisional arrangement, the GATT has since 1995 been the World Trade Organisation (WTO).But, 70 years on, some of the GATTs original challenges still loom large.The first is the trade-off between ambition and practicality.In 1947 American negotiators had a grand vision for a bigger International Trade Organisation, with more members and more areas of regulation.Eventually that plan collapsed under the weight of its own ambition.Today, given the challenge of getting consensus among 164 signatories, WTO members are increasingly turning to narrower, plurilateral agreements.A second trade-off is between control and co-operation.Today British Brexiteers want to take back control and President Donald Trump thinks past deals have not put America first.While the GATT was brewing, John Maynard Keynes, an influential economist, doubted that Britain should spurn the option of using tariffs to control the level of employmentthough he did accept that the benefits of everyone forgoing tariffs could outweigh the costs.Some trials are new.Today, as the WTO gears up for its 11th ministerial conference, American leadership is absent.Instead, the Trump administration is obsessed with promoting exports.Will Clayton, an American negotiator in 1947, was similarly preoccupied with getting a good deal for American producers.He proposed walking away from talks with the British after they refused to give up lower tariffs for their dominions and colonies.But his political masters stopped him, and compromised.They saw the wider benefits of the GATT, including its effect on European reconstruction and Americas geopolitical alliances.They could see that trade deals are about much more than tariff lines.
Increasingly, hunting money-launderers is automated:::::KEEN, no doubt, to stay alive, drug traffickers tend to be prompter payers than most.For software firms, this is just one of many clues that may hint at the laundering of ill-gotten money.Anti-money-laundering (AML) software, as it is called, monitors financial transactions and produces lists of the people most likely to be transferring the proceeds of crime.Spending on this software is soaring.Celent, a research company, estimates that financial firms have spent roughly $825m on it so far this year, up from $675m last year.Technavio, another research firm, reckons the market is even bigger and will grow at more than 11% annually in coming years.This is partly because authorities are increasingly quick to punish institutions that let down their guard.Deutsche Bank, for example, has been hit with fines worth at least $827m this year alone.Governments, eager to appear tough on crime, are urging prosecutors to go after not just institutions, but also their employees.The number of anti-laundering regulations is climbing yearlyby nearly 10% in America, Canada and the EU, and by roughly 15% in Australia, Hong Kong, Malaysia and Singapore, says Neil Katkov, a regulatory analyst at Celent.Even the red-tape-slashing administration of President Donald Trump is unlikely to cut regulation in this area.David Stewart, head of anti-money-laundering systems at SAS, a software giant based in North Carolina, reckons that efforts to abide by such rules now take from a half to about 70% of most banks entire spending on compliance.A survey this year by Duff & Phelps, an advisory group, found that financial firms typically spend about 4% of revenue on compliance, a figure expected to reach 10% in 2022.Many clues that lead software to block a transaction, or to flag it for a human to investigate, are straightforward.Round sums are more suspect than jagged ones.Spikes in transaction volumes and amounts are suspicious.So is cash deposited in an account via multiple branches.An areas culture also matters.Sasi Mudigonda, of Oracle, says its software considers transactions linked to eastern Ukraine riskier than the west of the country, where Russian influence is weaker.Even age countscrooks who move money disproportionately steal the identities of old people and young adults, says Michael Kent, chief executive of Azimo, a remittances firm.Software also hunts for clues that someone on one of hundreds of watch lists has concocted a fake identitythe giveaway could be the opening of an account with a password or phone number once used by a corrupt official.ComplyAdvantage, a firm based in London, licenses software that generates long lists of suspected criminals by sifting through hundreds of millions of articles, including those in The Economist , and then determines which transactions may benefit one of them.Moving the proceeds of big-ticket crime conventionally involves disguising them as legitimate trade payments.Software from a Singaporean firm, AML360, is designed to flag instances of this.Daniel Rogers, the companys boss, says it monitors a jigsaw puzzle of factors such as ship itineraries, the locations of commodity producers and fluctuations in their prices.The software notices if a firm imports expensive stainless steel when a cheaper source of the material is closer at hand, say, or if an importers spending on copper rises as its price falls.The next step for AML software is a big leap in the amount and types of data it crunches.Last year SAS launched Visual Investigator, developed at a cost of about $1bn.It links financial transactions with text and even imagery in reams of social media.This could reveal, for example, that a restaurants cash deposits appear too large for the amount of online buzz the business generates; or that a payment recipient skis with a kleptocrat.With SAS software, rather more than half of flagged transactions lead to the filing of a suspicious-activity report (SAR) with authorities.Monique Melis, head of regulatory consulting at Duff & Phelps in London, argues that, to reduce false positives further, regulators should begin systematically to disclose the SARs that lead to a discovery of crime.Software could then be better calibrated to withstand a growing problem highlighted by Sophie Lagouanelle of FircoSoft, a Paris developer of AML technology: savvy launderers are learning how the software works to slip past it.Should human analysts fear for their jobs?Probably not.They will still be needed to follow up on many flagged transactions.Business has not slowed for Berlin Risk, a German consultancy that discreetly investigates the nature of a persons character and earnings by talking to as many as 20 people who know him.As its senior partner, Carsten Giersch, puts it, You will never see a robot interviewing sources.Or is that the next step?
Jerome Powell is poised to be named chairman of the Fed:::::YOU could forgive Janet Yellen, the chair of the Federal Reserve, for feeling peeved.With unemployment at just 4.2%, and inflation at 1.6%, she is close to achieving the Feds two goals of curbing joblessness and pinning price rises at 2%.Ms Yellen is a Democrat appointed by Barack Obama in 2014.The tenures of past three Fed chairs were all extended by presidents from the other party.Yet as we went to press, President Donald Trump was expected to nominate Jerome Powell, a Republican on the Feds board, to replace Ms Yellen.If picked, Mr Powellalso an Obama appointeewould stand out from recent incumbents.He would be the first Fed chairman since William Miller, who left office in 1979, with no formal economics training; and, according to the Washington Post , the richest since the 1940s.Mr Powell, who is 64, is a lawyer-turned-banker.His first role in Washington was at the Treasury during the presidency of George Bush senior.He had responsibility for financial institutions and helped deal with the collapse of the Bank of New England, then the third-largest bank failure in American history.On leaving government, Mr Powell joined the Carlyle Group, a private-equity firm, before starting his own business.From 2010 to 2012 he worked for the Bipartisan Policy Centre, a centrist think-tank.There, he made a name by warning Republicans about their threats not to raise the limit on government borrowing.At the Fed, Mr Powell has occasionally sided with hawks.But recently, his views on monetary policy have hewed close to Ms Yellens.In June he stressed the need to tighten monetary policy only slowly.He also mounted a robust defence of the Feds loose monetary policy after the financial crisis.Mr Powell has, however, recently suggested that there is some room to improve the financial regulations imposed after the crisis.Critics of the Feds recent monetary policy include rivals for the chairmanship, such as John Taylor, an economist at Stanford University.The question is whether Mr Trump might appoint hawks like Mr Taylor to other open seats on the Feds board, of which there are three, including that of vice-chair.One more slot would open should Ms Yellen resign from the board, as is normal but not required for departing chairs.The balance of the committee will give a clearer idea of how much a Powell Fed would differ from the Yellen one.
In Japan, the move from cash to plastic goes slowly:::::BIC CAMERA, a Japanese electronics retailer, accepts payments in so many ways that the list nearly obscures the till: credit, debit and pre-paid cards; mobile wallets; ApplePay and Alipay; and, in some stores since April, bitcoin too.Efforts are under way to wean Japan off genkin , or cash.Handling notes and coins is expensive for businesses; many operate on tight margins because a persistent lack of inflation has inhibited price rises.The government reckons more cashless payments could help the economy, too, encouraging people, including a growing number of tourists, to spend more.(And help it collect more tax.)Entrepreneurs think the data that come with cashless methods could promote new business.Yet cash still dominates.Thank a preponderance of ATMs in ubiquitous konbini (convenience stores), safe cities where people are happy to carry wads of cash, and wariness about handing over personal data.Last year cash accounted for 62% of consumer transactions by value, according to Euromonitor, a market-research firm.That is down from 65% in 2015, but compares with just 22% in Britain, 34% in America, 10% in South Korea and 50% in China.Of the other methods, pre-paid cards are increasingly popular.They covered 12% more transactions by value in 2016 than the year before, despite mainly being used for payments under 3,000 ($26).Retailers small and large, such as Rakuten, a giant of e-commerce, have launched their own cards.Transport companies cards are widely used, too.Tsuneharu Miyake, head of financial research at Mizuho Research Institute, argues that this proliferation of plastic can in large part be attributed to companies wanting to keep their customers.Most cards offer bonus schemes.But because they cannot be used in every outlet, this trend means the slow shift from cash has not brought the convenience and lower costs that were hoped for.Ryosuke Izumida, author of a book on the future of banking, says it is a real hassle for businesses to have to fork out for hardware for each system or risk losing customers.Consumers may benefit from this competition for their custom.But there are drawbacks for them, too.Some complain that their favoured card is not accepted universally and, says Mr Miyake, the cost of installing multiple devices is passed on to them.Meanwhile many businesses still refuse credit cards.That is a problem for touristsand for the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo.In McDonalds fast-food outlets in Japan, for example, 13 different pre-paid cards are accepted, but not Visa or MasterCard.(It is planning to change that this winter.)The fragmentation of the payments market may get worse as Japan continues to move away from cash.Companies outside the financial sector, such as social-media apps, may launch payment arms, as Tencents WeChat has done in China.Foreign companies are coming in, too.Some shops accept Alipay, a Chinese e-payment system that can be used by a retailer who simply downloads an app.Reports suggest it will launch a Japanese version next year.Banks, fearful of losing out to newcomers, are also working on e-payments.A consortium (including Mr Miyakes parent company, Mizuho Financial Group) is developing JCoin, a digital currency.It hopes to have the scale needed to squeeze others out.If the government is to fulfil its aim of doubling cashless payments in the next decade, it may have to regulate to curb the use of cash.Back in Bic Camera, that goal seems a long way off, as customers rifle through their purses and wallets for hard-copy yen.
IKEA undertakes some home improvements:::::ON A Sunday afternoon, just beyond Londons M25 ring road, shoppers participate in the ritual that is a trip to IKEA.Fuelled by a lunch of Swedish meatballs, they negotiate their way around the 400,000-square-foot maze of a store, past children playing hide and seek and couples arguing over the merits of a PAX over a HEMNES wardrobe.Hours later, they emerge, wearily pushing trolleys loaded with flat-pack furniture and far more tea lights than they had intended to buy.The joy of assembly still awaits them.This experience has changed remarkably little since the late 1950s, when IKEA, which is still privately owned, set up its first store in southern Sweden and found that people would travel long distances for low-cost, self-assembled goods.IKEA has become the worlds largest seller of furniture, with over 400 shops around the world and 38bn ($42bn) of revenue.But now it is acknowledging that customers might want to shop in new ways.In what Torbjrn Lf, chief executive of Inter IKEA, which owns the brand, has described as its biggest change in interacting with customers since the IKEA concept was founded, it has said it will experiment with selling furniture on third-party online platforms (it already sells items on its own site).It is not yet known whether it will sell on Amazon or Chinas Alibaba, the biggest names in e-commerce.The firm also recognises that DIY labour does not always make people fonder of their purchases.In September IKEA Group, which runs most of the retail outlets, announced its acquisition of TaskRabbit, an app that, among other things, connects handymen to customers with odd jobs to be done.Taken together with other changes introduced in recent yearssuch as a handful of click-and-collect sites in some city centres, home delivery and a new augmented-reality app for smartphones to help customers visualise furniture in their homesit is clear that the company is keen to create alternatives to its vast suburban outlets.Such steps seem overdue.According to a survey of 29 countries by PwC, a consulting firm, around 30% of respondents would rather buy furniture on the internet than in shops.Although footfall at individual IKEA stores has been falling since 2015, the number of visits to the groups website has increased by over a fifth (see chart).Yet in 2016 online sales accounted for only 4% of the firms total revenue.IKEA has doubtless noticed that an American competitor, Ashley Furniture, successfully sells its goods on Amazon, and that Alibaba, too, carries several ranges of furniture.The new strategy carries the usual risks faced by firms going online.Customers are not shifting entirely to e-commerce, notes Marc-Andr Kamel of Bain & Company, a consulting firm, but wish to mix and match channels.Mr Lf therefore has little choice but to offer customers both physical and digital options, which could raise costs.IKEA is still planning bricks-and-mortar expansion both in established markets, such as Britain, and in new ones, such as India next year and South America and South-East Asia in the future.Its plan to experiment with using big third-party online sellers such as Amazon is surprising, says Mr Kamel, because it would need to cede some control over its branding.Being on Amazon or Alibaba would also invite direct comparison with other furniture manufacturers on price and quality.The Swedish giant is betting that it can win new customers online who would never trek to its superstores.But if it simply substitutes offline demand for online sales it could lose out, because it would have to hand over a big chunk of its profit margin to third parties (at least there is plenty to go round; IKEA Groups gross profit margin averaged 40% between 2012 and 2016).Another risk comes from the demands of a new type of customer.IKEA is used to people who are willing to spend time on assembly in return for low prices, but will now try to appeal to online buyers who demand cheap, quick delivery.Keeping them happy will be hard.Online reviews of IKEAs new-style click-and-collect store in London complain of long lead times and slow service.Constructing a sturdy new sales model, rather like a flat-pack cupboard, could turn out to be trickier than IKEA claims.
After hurricanes, more than 250K jobs created in October:::::Solid job growth returned in October after getting buffeted a month earlier by hurricanes.US employers added 261,000 jobs in October led by 106,000 new hospitality- and leisure-industry workers returning to their jobs, the Labor Department said Friday.While the number of new jobs fell short of the 310,000 expected by Wall Street, investors cheered the news and Dow Jones industrial average futures turned up, standing at a positive 37 points.In addition, the unemployment rate slipped to 4.1 percent from 4.2 percent in September.Meanwhile, Labor revised the employment number for September to a gain of 18,000 from a loss of 33,000.In 2008, the US economy and the jobs picture took months to recover from Hurricane Katrina in stark contrast to the quick recovery from the devastating storms that swept through Texas and Florida this year.With the robust jobs recovery, the Federal Reserve is expected to stay on course heading for a likely rate rise following its December meeting, markets watchers said.Janet Yellens Fed, after its two-day meeting ended on Wednesday, said the labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has been rising at a solid rate despite hurricane-related disruptions.On the down side, wage growth, evidence in the past several months, stalled in October, Labor said.Average hourly earnings slipped by one cent, leaving them unchanged in percentage terms.That lowered the year-on-year increase to 2.4 percent, which was the smallest annual increase since February 2016.They shot up 0.5 percent in September, lifting the annual increase in that month to 2.9 percent.Economists, however, remain optimistic that wage growth will accelerate with the labor market near full employment.Last months one-tenth percentage point drop in the unemployment rate took it to its lowest reading since December 2000.The decline, however, reflected a drop in the labor force.The jobless rate is now below the Feds median forecast for 2017.With Post wires
Senior-care startup taps former Apple exec as first president:::::New York City-based senior-care startup Hometeam has named a former Apple executive as its first president.Matt Marcotte, who served as managing director of retail in North America at Apple from 2005 to 2010, joined Hometeam early last month.Marcotte has also served as an executive at Tory Burch and Gap.While at Apple, Marcotte doubled the tech giants retail presence in North America and oversaw the growth of its retail team from 10,000 employees to 25,000.As I thought about what the next chapter was going to be for me, I wanted to make sure it was something that was incredibly meaningful, Marcotte told The Post.Hometeam, which was founded by CEO Josh Bruno in 2014, has set out to revolutionize the in-home caregiving industry by using technology to help foster more productive relationships between caretakers and patients.Health care is a very different industry than retail, Marcotte said.But at the heart of it is really being a company that is customer-obsessed and employee-obsessed.Thats what were really working on.Hometeam also said it has brought on Julie Stern as chief technology officer.
Nestle aims to use only cage-free eggs by 2020:::::ZURICH Nestle, the worlds largest packaged foods company, said it aims to use only eggs from hens that live outside of cages, becoming the latest foodmaker to react to concerns about animal welfare.The Swiss company, whose products including ice cream, mayonnaise and pastries all use eggs, said it wants to make the change by 2020 in Europe and the United States and by 2025 elsewhere.A company spokesman said tens of millions of chickens would be positively affected by the change.Nestles rivals that have already made similar pledges include Kraft Heinz, Conagra and Mondelez International as well as chains like McDonalds, Wal-Mart and 7-Eleven.French food services company Sodexo, which provides catering at retirement homes and military bases, in August said it would beat its goal to source only cage-free eggs worldwide by 2025.Some governments are considering laws aimed at protecting laying hens by giving them more room to roam.In California, rules require that hens, pigs and calves must be able to stand up and lie down in quarters where they can fully extend their limbs.This year, the Humane Society of the United States, an animal rights group, introduced a new measure in the state that would require all eggs come from cage-free birds.
Herbalife is doing worse than originally thought:::::Herbalife reported weaker than expected results on Thursday, sending its shares tumbling 6 percent in after-hours trading.see also Bill Ackman is finally cutting his losses on Herbalife After nearly five years of punishing paper losses and mockery...The nutritional shake maker said North American sales fell 17 percent in the third quarter taking down total sales by 4 percent.During this year of transition, we believe our performance has now stabilized and we are seeing improvements in trends, Herbalife Chief Executive Rich Goudis said in a statement.Last summer, the Federal Trade Commission concluded a two-year investigation into Herbalife and demanded the company change the way it does business in the US.The Los Angeles company has implemented many of the FTC terms.Herbalife posted adjusted earnings of 82 cents a share 4 cents lower than Wall Street projections.The company also narrowed its full-year adjusted guidance to a range of $4.42 to $4.62 shaving 8 cents from the top part of the range.Despite Thursdays after-hours drop, Herbalife shares are up 46 percent this year.On Wednesday, longtime Herbalife nemesis Bill Ackman announced that he converted his losing short position in the company into a put options.The move limits his losses but allows him to reap all the benefits if Herbalifes stock falls to zero as he has so far, incorrectly predicted.
Republican tax plan takes aim at corporate rate:::::The tax overhaul proposed by House Republicans on Thursday would slash the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 20 percent a move backers said would free up cash for companies to create jobs.President Trump praised the proposed cuts as the rocket fuel our economy needs, saying it would also encourage businesses to move operations and overseas profits back to the United States.We are just getting started, and there is much work left to do.The special interests will distort the facts, the lobbyists will try to save their special deals, and some in the media will unfairly report on our efforts, Trump said.But my administration will work tirelessly to make good on our promise ...and deliver historic tax cuts and reforms, the rocket fuel our economy needs to soar higher than ever before.The plan, which still must be approved by the full House and Senate, would: Lower the top rate for noncorporate pass-through businesses from 39.6 percent to 25 percent.Preserve the research and development tax credit to encourage businesses to develop innovative products and services, creating jobs in the process.Make it easier and far less costly for American businesses to bring home foreign earnings to invest in creating jobs.Prevent jobs, company headquarters and research operations from moving overseas by eliminating incentives that reward them for doing so.Republicans argue that cutting tax rates for businesses improves economic competitiveness and puts the US corporate tax rate in line with that of other countries.Under the proposal, businesses would not be allowed to deduct some executive compensation above $1 million, which they can do now for performance-based pay, the Wall Street Journal reported.And while the plan sets a top 25 percent rate for pass-through businesses like family-owned businesses or partnerships, it includes safeguards that would prevent people from turning wage income taxed at up to 39.6 percent into business income taxed at the lower rate.The new one-time tax on overseas profits would be set at 12 percent for cash and 5 percent for nonliquid holdings, a provision meant to force companies to bring overseas profits back to the US.While major corporations have backed an overhaul, the National Association of Realtors and the National Association of Home Builders have criticized the bill for its proposed changes to tax provisions dealing with the real estate industry.And the top lobbyist for small businesses, the National Federation of Independent Business, says the plan leaves too many small businesses behind.Too many small businesses taxed at individual rates up to the top 39.6 percent wont benefit from the new 25 percent top tax rate because of the GOPs safeguards, the group argues.David French, the National Retail Federations chief lobbyist, praised the plan, saying it would put more money into the hands of middle-class shoppers and that retailers would benefit from the new 20 percent business rate.The Ways and Means Committee got it almost perfect in terms of middle-class and corporate tax reform, French told Bloomberg News.Were going to encourage members to enthusiastically support this bill.There would also be a new 1.4 percent tax on public and private endowments, a provision sure to cause controversy because of its effect on colleges and other institutions.With Post wires
Wendy Williams gets free mattress after dramatic fainting spell:::::Wendy Williams fainting spell on Halloween became a marketing opportunity for one bold start-up.see also Wendy Williams faints on live TV After taking a break, Williams returned to finish hosting her... Nectar Sleep, a year-old mattress-in-a-box company, shipped off one of its king-size beds to the talk show host, who is expected to post an Instagram video about it on Friday.Williams, dressed up as the Statue of Liberty, passed out on live TV.She said she got overheated and dizzy.We are manufacturing a mattress that gets a lot of attention for being therapeutic, said co-founder Craig Schmeizer, When we heard what happened to Wendy, we thought we could help.It doesnt hurt that Nectars public relations company, 5W, also represents Williams.Last week, the publicist got Victorias Secret model Nina Agdal to make a video of herself bouncing on a Nectar bed.Agdal is a former girlfriend of Leonardo DiCaprio, who is an investor in Nectars rival Casper.Agdal and Williams are not formally shilling for Nectar, Schmeizer said, but they did get free mattresses.
Leon Black’s Apollo Global eyeing Qdoba:::::Leon Black has his eye on some Mexican food like the entire 720-store Qdoba Mexican Eats chain, The Post has learned.Blacks Apollo Global Management is in late-stage bidding for the Jack in the Box-owned chain, two sources close to the situation said.San Diego-based Jack in the Box is a few weeks away from taking final bids on the countrys No.2 Mexican eatery, sources said.A handful of private equity firms, including Apollo, are kicking the tires although theyre all unwilling to pay a big multiple of the chains less than $50 million in Ebitda, sources said.Qdoba had revenue of $350 million in the nine months ended July 9 and is expected to sell for $250 million to $500 million, a source said.Apollo has had a big appetite in recent years for restaurants.It bought CEC Entertainment (parent of Chuck E. Cheeses), which it still owns, and CKE Inc. (parent of Carls Jr. and Hardees), which it sold.There is a possibility that Apollo, if it ends up with the Qdoba chain, could eventually combine it with its CEC platform in preparation for taking CEC public.Jack in the Box, a hamburger chain with 2,200 locations, could choose a buyer before Nov. 20 when it reports full-year results.The company announced in May it was exploring strategic alternatives for Qdoba, and since has said it will not comment further until a specific transaction is reached or the evaluation process is concluded.Goldman said in an analyst report it assumes Jack in the Box will use proceeds from a Qdoba sale to buy back shares.Cowen & Co., in an Oct. 16 report, forecast that Jacks same-store sales hurt by stiff competition from a rejuvenated McDonalds would fall 1.6 percent in the fourth quarter.Jack in the Box shares have slipped 9.3 percent this year, to $101.21 at Thursdays close.Apollo declined to comment, and Jack in the Box did not return calls.

TripAdvisor, the embattled travel and restaurant site, will soon begin gathering police and news reports about rape, theft and assault at resorts listed on its Web site but its too late for some unfortunate travelers.Within the next several weeks, the Needham, Mass., company will be adding safety, health and discrimination alerts about the hotels, restaurants and other businesses on its Web site, said spokesman Brian Hoyt.We have a few properties we are discussing now that might get these alerts [or badges, as TripAdvisor is calling them], before the end of the year, Hoyt told The Post.The company was slammed in a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel story for deleting reports of rape at hotels on their site.
Trump nominates Jerome Powell as Fed chair:::::President Trump nominated Jerome Powell as the next chairman of the Federal Reserve.He is strong.He is committed.He is smart, Trump said of Powell during an announcement in the White House Rose Garden on Thursday.Based on his record, I am confident that Jay has the wisdom and leadership to guide our economy through any challenges that our great economy will face, the president said.Trump selected Powell, a member of the Feds board of governors and a former Treasury undersecretary in President George W. Bushs administration, instead of appointing Janet Yellen to a second term.The president praised her as a wonderful woman who has done a terrific job.Powell ticked off how the economy has become stronger and more resilient since the 2008 crisis.Im committed to making decisions with objectivity in [the Feds] long-standing tradition of monetary policy independence, Powell said.
GoPro shares tumble after its new model forces big discounts:::::Shares of GoPro plummeted 14 percent after the action-camera maker gave a disappointing outlook despite reporting its first quarterly profit in two years.CFO Brian McGee attributed the not-so-bright outlook to the launch of the Hero6 camera, which he said cannibalized the sales of the Hero5.GoPro will need to slash prices on the Hero5, which had already struggled with production delays, to move backed-up inventory during the holiday season.GoPro stock was recently down 13.9 percent in mid-day trading, to $9.18.The San Mateo, Calif., tech firm reported earnings per share of 15 cents, handily beating Wall Streets 2 cent expectation.GoPro reported revenue of $330 million, surpassing expectations of $313.8 million, and representing year-over-year growth of 37 percent.However, GoPro also admitted it now expects fourth-quarter earnings between 37 and 47 cents a share well below the 57 cents a share Wall Street was expecting.GoPro also said it expects fourth-quarter revenue of $470 million, well short of the $521.2 million analysts had forecast.GoPro is determined to stay relevant, even as companies like Google roll out their own cameras that step into GoPros once-secure territory.GoPro recently released an $800 camera-equipped drone, and will be releasing its first 360-degree camera later this month.
Billionaire Trump backer leaves helm of hedge fund, insists he’s not racist:::::Billionaire Trump backer Robert Mercer said he will step down as co-CEO of Renaissance Technologies, griping that he has wrongly been branded a racist because of his ties to Steve Bannon and Breitbart News.The controversial computer scientist said Thursday he will also relinquish his role on the secretive, $50 billion quantitative hedge funds board in January, and sell his stake in Breitbart News to his daughters.During the past year, I have been the object of a great deal of scrutiny in the press, Mercer, a prominent supporter of President Trump, began in a wide-ranging letter that was distributed to colleagues Thursday.Portraying himself as a conservative who advocates small government, Mercer complained that the media has intimated that my politics marches in lockstep with Steve Bannons, although he added that he has great respect for the former Trump adviser.Of the many mischaracterizations made of me by the press, the most repugnant to me have been the intimations that I am a white supremacist or a member of some other noxious group, Mercer wrote.Discrimination on the basis of race, ethnicity, gender, creed, or anything of that sort is abhorrent to me, Mercer added.But more than that, it is ignorant.Mercer also said hes withdrawing his previous support for former Breitbart editor Milo Yiannopoulos, who drew scorn for seemingly condoning pedophilia earlier this year.Mercer said he had believed Yiannopoulos would be able to promote open debate and freedom of thought.I was mistaken to have supported him, and for several weeks have been in the process of severing all ties with him, Mercer wrote.Last month, Buzzfeed reported that the Mercer family expressed interest in funding Yiannopouloss next venture, following the provocateurs February ouster from Breitbart.The Mercer family also backs Cambridge Analytica, a data-crunching firm that worked with the Trump campaign.The firm is being investigated as part of a wider probe into Russian interference into the election, according to multiple reports citing unnamed sources.The reports havent specifically linked the Mercer family to the probes.Elsewhere in his Thursday letter, Mercer didnt give a specific reason for leaving the helm of RenTech and the funds board, saying only that he will continue as a member of its technical staff, which researches complex math formulas to make stock trades.Peter Brown, who had been serving as co-CEO to Mercer, will be sole CEO.I am 71 years old, the same age that Jim Simons was when he retired, Mercer wrote, referring to RenTechs co-founder, a former mathematics professor and Cold War code breaker who stepped down as CEO in 2009.Mercers announcement he will step down on Jan. 1 comes one week after Simons a major Democratic donor delivered anti-Trump remarks at a breakfast hosted by IESE Business School in New York.I think its basically terrible that we have a president remotely like our current president.Weve had some doozies but never of that caliber, Simons said.
Is Jerry Jones behind Papa John’s Goodell takedown?:::::Is this the pizza phase of Jerry Jones plan?There are rumblings that the Cowboys owner is behind the CEO of Papa Johns calling out NFL leadership Wednesday, when John Schnatter blamed declining Papa Johns stock on the NFLs national anthem protests.Pro Football Talk, in a juicy (saucy?)story, reported the whispers in league circles about whether Jones had put Schnatter up to the Roger Goodell hit job during the companys third-quarter earnings conference call.Papa Johns has been the official pizza sponsor of the NFL since 2010 and has strong ties to the Cowboys, having been the official pizza sponsor of the team since 2004.Jones owns more than 100 Papa Johns franchises in Texas, according to D Magazine, and has appeared in a truly awful rap commercial for the chain.Schnatters comments surely would seem pleasing to Jones, who is campaigning against the leagues commissioner.Leadership starts at the top, and this is an example of poor leadership, Schnatter said.NFL leadership has hurt Papa Johns shareholders.If anything can get the owners attention, its lost funds, and Schnatter tried to inspire fear.The company said it has dropped the NFL shield or official sponsor designation, according to ESPN, from its commercials, frightful of a league whose likability is waning.Jones, meanwhile, has been on the warpath against Goodell.He has been trying to halt a contract extension for the 12th-year commissioner, whose new deal seemed imminent months ago but remains unsigned.Last week the Cowboys owner led a 17-owner conference call discussing how to block the contract, and Jones has long maintained that Goodell is overpaid.Jones and Goodell differ over the anthem protests, with Jones threatening his team to stand and Goodell not mandating a league-wide rule.The fact that Goodell suspended Dallas star Ezekiel Elliott for six games over a domestic violence case would seem to only further provoke Jones.The league would need 24 owners to approve of Goodells firing, which still seems a long shot but one that Jones may feel he kneads to take.
AT&T, Time Warner trying to save merger:::::AT&T executives on Thursday were trying to find a remedy to rescue the telecoms $86 billion purchase of Time Warner, The Post has learned.But a remedy might not be so easy to find, sources said.The long-reviewed mega-merger was thrown into chaos when Justice Department antitrust lawyers were said to be weighing suing the companies to block the deal.The possible suit, first reported by The Wall Street Journal, sent Time Warner shares down 3.8 percent, to $94.70.AT&T shares hit a 52-week low before settling at $33.17, down 1.1 percent.There is now a 7 percent spread on the cash and stock deal, based on the closing stock prices.The market is saying there is a 75 percent chance the merger is cleared, a hedge fund analyst said.Others werent so optimistic.The issue gumming up the deal is that the Trump administration does not like to clear mergers through behavioral remedies.Behavioral remedies are promises by the acquiring company to act in a certain manner.Such remedies are hard to enforce.In the AT&T merger, the telecom, which owns DirecTV, would likely need to agree it would make Time Warner content from its HBO, Turner, TBS, TNT, Cartoon Network and CNN units available on a fair and reasonable basis to cable providers, instead of simply on its own services.Washington got burned on a recent merger cleared on a promise of behavioral remedies.Comcast bought NBCUniversal in 2009, and critics argue it has not lived up to all its behavioral conditions.Folks in the Trump administration say they have learned lessons from prior remedies, a DC source said.AT&T in a statement said, For over 40 years, vertical mergers like this one have always been approved because they benefit consumers without removing any competitors from the market.
Bitcoin crosses $7,000 for the first time:::::Digital currency bitcoin rocketed above $7,000 for the first time ever on Thursday, after a more than sevenfold increase in its value since the start of the year.Bitcoin has seen eye-watering gains in recent months and has more than doubled in value in the past seven weeks alone.It hit as high as $7,066.44 on the Luxembourg-based Bitstamp exchange on Thursday.The latest rally was driven by news earlier this week that the worlds largest derivatives exchange operator CME Group is to launch bitcoin futures.The price move takes bitcoins aggregate value, or market cap its price multiplied by the number of bitcoins released into circulation to more than $117 billion, according to industry website Coinmarketcap.The aggregate value of all cryptocurrencies is now at a record high of over $190 billion, the website said.
Hedge fund sues Google for info on scamming WSJ imposter:::::Months after Muddy Waters Capital, a San Francisco hedge fund, shorted shares of a French retailer, a man posing as a Wall Street Journal reporter tried to obtain tactical insight from the funds founder, Carson Block, a shocking new lawsuit claims.The suit seeks to unmask the unidentified fake reporter by forcing Google to reveal the name of the owner of the Gmail account used by the man.The impostors efforts included more than a dozen emails to Blocks p.r.firm, but it was one sent last weekend that finally enabled the short seller to call the bluff, agreeing to meet the reporter, according to the suit.Then, in a dramatic face-off in a restaurant inside the posh Pierre Hotel on Oct. 30, Block confronted the fake newsperson who promptly ran from the eatery and the hotel, it is alleged.It took the imposter all of two or three minutes to confess to the scam, Block told The Post.He said: If I didnt say I was with WSJ, you wouldnt have talked to me, Block said in a phone interview.Apparently, someone has been impersonating a Wall Street Journal reporter.Our reporter did not make these inquiries, a WSJ spokesperson told The Post.Both the WSJ and The Post are owned by News Corp.It was, perhaps, the strangest short-selling investment made by Blocks hedge fund.Muddy Waters Capital initiated a short bet on Casino Guichard-Perrachon in December 2015, and alleged in reports over a three-month period that the retailer was dangerously leveraged.The companys stock soon fell 23 percent and its credit rating was lowered to junk.A second Gmail account targeting Muddy Waters assumed the identity of a personal assistant to a French banker in an attempt to get details about Blocks schedule, according to the suit.Block thinks the retailer was in some way involved with the Gmail accounts, given that requests focused on Muddy Waters Casino-related research and his schedule in Paris, the hedgie told The Post.Reps from Casino and Google did not immediately respond to requests to comment.
Why the next chair of the Fed will be facing a big problem:::::The Federal Reserve announced on Wednesday that it wasnt raising interest rates at least, not yet.But in what could be one of Fed Chair Janet Yellens last meetings, the policymaking committee got a little more giddy about the strength of the economy.(That view, of course, could quickly change if Fridays job figure isnt up to snuff.)The way it looks right now is that Yellen will spearhead another small rate hike in December.Her term expires in January, and President Trump could reappoint her.But right now, it seems unlikely.By late Wednesday, at least one unnamed White House source was saying that Jerome Powell who is currently a Fed governor and typically votes the same way Yellen does had already been informed he was the choice.But if theres one thing we know about the president, its that any decision can be reversed anytime.So its worth mentioning that John Taylor, now a professor at Stanford University and a onetime Fed member, is still in contention for the job.Taylor is known for research linking economic conditions with interest rates, and many consider him perfect for the position, especially since he once served on President George H.W.Bushs economic team.But Taylor is considered a monetary hawk meaning, hed likely raise interest rates faster than Yellen or Powell.So Taylor wouldnt be a favorite of Wall Street right now, and that would reduce his chances with Trump, who wouldnt want to do anything that might upset stocks.No matter who is appointed, the next Fed chairman has a problem.Right now, the economy is looking healthy.The stock market is booming.Consumer confidence is high.Home prices are soaring.And some economic indicators seem to say, Happy days are here again.Just Wednesday, for instance, the Atlanta Federal Reserve raised its forecast for economic growth in the fourth quarter to a booming 4.5 percent annual rate.The nations gross domestic product, the standard for measuring economic growth, rose at a healthy 3 percent annual rate in the third quarter.That 3 percent figure was puzzling because hurricanes should have stunted growth, which means that number might be revised downward once better-quality statistics come in.Or it could mean that growth is darn good, despite the weather.Nevertheless, the 4.5 percent estimate for the fourth quarter on top of the 3 percent growth in the July to September quarter is going to force whoever ends up running the Fed to seriously consider raising interest rates faster than usual.But thats where it gets tricky.Once rates increase, the economy could slow because borrowing costs will rise for both consumers and companies.When the cost of borrowing money increases, people and companies tend to cut back on spending.But theres another possible twist that could complicate the job of the next Fed boss even more.The relatively impressive growth in the third-quarter GDP and the even better performance in the fourth quarter could turn out to be another fake-out.The GDP, for instance, rose by a 4.6 percent annual rate in the second quarter of 2014 and by a 5.2 percent rate in the third quarter of that year, only to collapse back to subpar growth in the next eight quarters.Also, the New York Fed, which is more influential, doesnt agree with the Atlanta Fed.It had current GDP at closer to 3 percent.With all thats going on, why would anyone want the Fed job?
Calypso St. Barth faces vendor petitions in bankruptcy court:::::The once-hot resort-wear retailer, Calypso St. Barth, is headed to a decidedly unfashionable destination: bankruptcy court.About a half-dozen vendors on Wednesday filed an involuntary Chapter 7 petition against the private equity-owned chain, claiming the chain hasnt paid some bills in a year and that it was stonewalling them when they reached out to try and get some cash, papers filed in a New Jersey Bankruptcy Court reveal.Creditors have been trying to get paid for the longest time, Kenneth Rosen, of Lowenstein Sandler, a lawyer for the creditors, told The Post.The retailer, where a simple frock goes for as much as $850 and T-shirts start at $95, also may have been behind on payments to landlords, as Sandler claimed some landlords have taken to locking out Calypso workers.The French clothing chain, founded in 1992 by designer Christiane Celle, once had 35 stores in Paris, Palm Beach, New York City and Santa Monica, among other tony locations.It was a favorite among the bold-faced name set, like Gwyneth Paltrow and Cameron Diaz, according to reports.A note posted on one shuttered outlet read: We apologize for the store closing, it wasnt in our control.In fact, our company Solera Capital failed to pay their people, down from vendors, charities, UPS, the light company even the stores rent, etc.Big Apple-based Solera Capital invested in Calypso in 2007, becoming its majority shareholder.The firm could not be reached for comment.Michael Bloombergs gal pal, Diana Taylor, is a vice chairman of Solera.
SoftBank ‘definitely’ in talks with Charter about merger:::::SoftBank Group in recent days has spoken to Charter Communications about a merger, a source close to the situation told The Post.They definitely are talking, the source added.The talks to merge with Charter, whose biggest shareholder is cable magnate John Malone, may not yet be advanced, the source said, adding that they did include high-level executives.Charter was reapproached by Masa at SoftBank, a second source said, referring to Masayoshi Son, SoftBanks chief executive.SoftBank-owned Sprint in recent days halted its merger talks with T-Mobile and is now considering other options, the source noted.An internet and telecom company, SoftBank as recently as July made an offer to buy Charter, according to Bloomberg.Charter rejected the offer, saying on July 30, We understand why a deal is attractive for SoftBank, but Charter has no interest in acquiring Sprint.We have a very good [mobile] relationship with Verizon and intend to launch wireless services to cable customers next year.Charter, Americas No.2 cable company, saw its shares close up 1.2 percent, to $338.22, on Wednesday.On Sept. 12, at a Goldman Sachs conference, Charter CEO Tom Rutledge said he was focused on executing his strategy and not interested in selling the business.However, Charter reported last week that it lost 105,000 subscribers in the third quarter.Its shares are down 17 percent from their 52-week high.Meanwhile, Verizon, which roughly a year ago bid $350 to $400 a share for Charter, on Wednesday held its scheduled monthly board meeting.Whether the topic of merging with Charter was raised during the meeting could not be learned.While Rutledge has said he is not interested in selling, there has been plenty of consolidation in the pay-TV sector and suitors are always circling.To be sure, cable operator Altice could be interested in buying Charter, sources said.Altice, the Europe-based cable operator that bought Cablevision in 2016, was in the early stages, of conversations to acquire Charter in August, sources told The Post.Keep in mind that the tax basis [Malones] Liberty has in its Charter positions are very low, thus for any deal to be considered, it would have to be for equity in something, not cash, to avoid any tax hit to Liberty, a source familiar with the situation said.Spokespersons at Charter, Verizon and Altice each declined to comment.SoftBank did not return calls.
Don’t get too excited for October’s job report:::::Tomorrows employment report for October is expected to be a blockbuster.But dont start blowing the party horns just yet.The September report was an absolute disaster literally as hurricanes caused companies to underreport the number of new jobs that were created.The consensus of experts is that 325,000 new jobs popped up in October.But remember, there was a loss of 33,000 jobs in September putting the average for the two months at a very modest gain of 146,000 jobs.Im not brave enough to guess what the October number is going to be.Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, and to a lesser extent Maria, are likely to foul up the economic data for a number of months.But, as Ive written before, it can be interesting to take a look at what happened to the employment reports that followed Hurricane Katrina in August 2005.There was a loss of 35,000 jobs in September after Katrina devastated New Orleans and other parts of Louisiana before making its way inland.That 35,000-job loss is very close to the 33,000-job loss reported this past September.If the 2005 pattern holds, the experts may be much too optimistic with their 325,000 figure for tomorrows report.Thats because only 56,000 new jobs were created in October 2005, two months after Katrina.It wasnt until November that the US economy recovered from Katrina.Even then, only 215,000 new positions were reported.And the economy back then before the Great Recession was far more resilient than it is today.There is a possibility that the Labor Department might make some adjustment if it feels that the October figures are being unreasonably affected by companies still having a problem with the paperwork needed to report employment figures.Will Fridays figure live up to the experts expectations?I think its a toss-up
Tesla shares plummet amid Model 3 production issues:::::Tesla shares tumbled as much as 4.9 percent in after-hours trading Wednesday after the company admitted it would not meet aggressive 2017 production goals for its super-important Model 3 sedan.Chief executive Elon Musk said the goal of 5,000 Model 3s a week would not be met until late in the first quarter of 2018.The deadline pushback and a whopping $619 million loss in the third quarter dented Tesla shares dropping them more than 21 percent below their 2017 high, putting them firmly in bear market territory.Musk attributed the missed production goals for the Model 3 to battery assembly problems at Teslas Gigafactory in Sparks, Nev. A subcontractor dropped the ball and we did not know the degree to which the ball was dropped, he said.see also Tesla slashes orders for Model 3 parts in production bottleneck Tesla plans to slash by 40 percent its orders for...The production problems helped produce a net loss of $3.70 per share in the quarter 62 percent greater than the anticipated loss of $2.28.Tesla beat top-line expectations, however, reporting revenue of $2.98 billion, slightly ahead of analysts consensus of $2.95 billion.Musk, perhaps irritated over the production troubles, dressed down journalists during a Wednesday conference call for writing ridiculous stories about Tesla firing hundreds of workers last month as part of the electronic vehicle makers annual performance review.The little guy better have a lot more skill, the Tesla CEO, plagued by a persistent cough, said during the call.Thats why our standards are so high.The 700 workers canned from Tesla were from a workforce of 33,000.Yet no journalist bothered to put the 2 percent dismissal rate in context, he said.
Stephen Curry puzzled over mention in GOP tax proposal:::::Golden State Warriors superstar Stephen Curry doesn't know how he became the only person named in the House GOP's tax plan."It was weird, that's about it," Curry said following Golden State's 112-92 win over San Antonio."There's a lot of people wondering why I was called out, whatever the case may be, but mama, I made it."Curry was the first NBA player to sign a super-max contract in July following a restructuring of the league's collective bargaining agreement.Perhaps that's why he was named an example for individual wage income in a promotional document that accompanied the 429-page proposal on Thursday."The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act includes specific safeguards to prevent tax avoidance and help ensure taxpayers of all income levels play by the rules under this new fairer, simpler tax system," the document stated."Our legislation will ensure this much-needed tax relief goes to the local job creators it's designed to help by distinguishing between the individual wage income of NBA All-Star Stephen Curry and the pass-through business income of Steve's Bike Shop."Curry learned about his place in the plan Thursday and had a question."I wonder if Steve's Bike Shop is hiring..." Curry tweeted.Curry has been singled out by Washington Republicans before.The top one, in fact.In September, President Donald Trump criticized the Warriors for saying they may not visit the White House.Championship teams have traditionally visited the president, but the Warriors were wavering because of their disapproval of Trump.Warriors coach Steve Kerr has roundly criticized Trump, as has Curry.But it was the two-time NBA MVP that drew Trump's ire."Going to the White House is considered a great honor for a championship team," Trump tweeted."Stephen Curry is hesitating, therefore invitation is withdrawn!"House Republicans did not explain why Curry was the only person named in the tax proposal.
Singapore state fund takes £120 million stake in UK bank OakNorth:::::British challenger bank OakNorth said Friday that Singaporean sovereign wealth fund GIC would take a 10 percent stake in the firm.The state-owned investor has poured 90 million ($120 million) into the financial technology (fintech) company.Combined with another investment the lender scored last month, a total of 244 million ($318 million) has been raised."If you aggregate the two announcements about the primary and secondary rounds, it is the largest U.K. fintech financing to date," OakNorth Chief Executive Rishi Khosla, told CNBC Friday.On Thursday, another U.K. fintech firm, Transferwise, said it had raised $280 million from asset management firm Old Mutual and Silicon Valley venture capital firm IVP.Collectively, Transferwise and OakNorth's investments saw $400 million injected into the U.K.'s fintech sector in just two days.OakNorth said the latest investment would enable it to boost lending in the U.K. by an additional 1.5 billion ($2 billion).The firm plans to roll out its ACORN lending platform which helps banks originate, underwrite, monitor and book transactions faster to markets across the globe.Khosla said: "What this financing round does is help us continue building the business in the U.K. but also taking the model to other markets around the world."Khosla added that OakNorth would look into partnering with a more established bank further down the line, "as we look at other markets."
Pandora loses a quarter of its value after abysmal revenue forecast:::::Pandora Media stock plunged as much as 26 percent on Friday as things went from bad to worse after its third quarter earnings report.The company revised its fourth quarter revenue forecast downward, to a range of $365 million to $380 million, Pandora CFO Naveen Chopra revealed on a conference call with investors Thursday evening.That is well below the consensus estimate of $413 million before the report, according to FactSet.Pandora also reported weak revenue for the third quarter and announced plans to sell about 62 million shares of common stock after Thursday's close.Four firms downgraded the company's stock in response, lowering expectations for the company from "buy" to "hold."The shares were down 25 percent to $5.52 at 10 a.m.ET in New York after falling as low as $5.42 shortly after the open of trading."We have been trying to stick with Pandora through its multiple management changes and multi-year turnaround process," J.P. Morgan analyst Doug Anmuth wrote in a note."However, near-term advertising trends are deteriorating and we believe it will take time for the company to realize the benefits of its ad tech investments."SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Stifel Nicolaus and FBR joined J.P. Morgan in revising ratings of Pandora's stock lower."We are a bit taken back as the company appears much further behind in its ad tech product map than we have appreciated and the company's deficiencies appear more severe," SunTrust analyst Matthew Thornton wrote in a note.Pandora's revenue in the last quarter was $379 million, below Wall Street's expectations of $380.6 million, according to Thomson Reuters.Advertising revenue, which accounts for the bulk of Pandora's overall revenue, grew 1 percent year over year but missed analyst expectations.Pandora reported $275.7 million in advertising revenue, which also came in below analyst expectations of $289.3 million, according to StreetAccount."There's no silver bullet that's going to come in and solve these problems," CEO Roger Lynch said in a conference call with investors.He said investments in ad targeting and reporting technology would start to have an effect throughout 2018.The stock was already struggling this year, falling 43 percent for 2017 through Thursday's close, according to FactSet.
Actress Gwyneth Paltrow on starting her lifestyle brand business Goop:::::Hollywood star Gwyneth Paltrow may have made a name for herself in the business world over the last decade, but that doesn't mean the nerves didn't kick in when she first set foot on her entrepreneurial journey.In 2008, the Oscar-winning actress launched Goop, a "lifestyle brand" which started off as a weekly newsletter, aimed at providing information related to food, health and travel."I think that I had a lot of trepidation about planting this little flag and saying like 'I want to do this, but I don't know if this could be a business' or how I could execute the business; but it was scary for me to do it," she told CNBC's "Trailblazers.""Immediately, there was a lot of 'Why is she doing this?'I remember once I also had a movie coming out around the same time and there was a huge article in the New York Times about why am I doing this?And I thought, this seems extreme, like I'm just writing banana nut muffin recipes!"
Gwyneth Paltrow on keeping yourself grounded, and other advice for new careers:::::My father was really the rudder to the ship of my life: Paltrow 5 Hours Ago | 01:09 It's hard for anyone not to be caught up and mesmerized by the glitz and glamor of Hollywood.For Academy Award-winner Gwyneth Paltrow however, she learned the importance of staying down-to-earth from a young age taking note from someone who'd had his own success in the entertainment industry: her father."My father was really the rudder to the ship of my life," Paltrow told CNBC during an episode of "Trailblazers" when discussing her relationship with her late father, U.S. television and film director and producer Bruce Paltrow."He was very pragmatic, very funny.Scrappy, really hardworking guy.He did not grow up with money and so he was very insistent on kind of instilling us with values and work ethic and having us understand how lucky we were, and that it wasn't by accident.That you have to work really, really hard in life."As Paltrow grew older, she began to garner a greater understanding about being independent and working hard for what she truly wanted.Back before starring in such blockbuster hits as "Iron Man" and "Shakespeare in Love," the actress however was working everyday jobs to make ends meet.
Amazon to end Fresh grocery delivery service in some areas:::::AmazonFresh deliveries will stop for some people after Nov. 30, according to messages sent to customers in suburban Pennsylvania and New Jersey, seen by Reuters.Amazon customers in Maryland and California posted on Twitter that they were losing the service as well.The news comes after the online retailer's $13.7 billion acquisition of Whole Foods Market, which is expected to play a key role in Amazon's grocery delivery going forward.Amazon did not immediately comment if the delivery change stemmed from the Whole Foods deal.
Heart stents may be useless for many in treating chest pain, according to researchers:::::New research suggests a popular treatment for chest pain may be useless for many people, The New York Times reported today.Citing a Wednesday study published in The Lancet, the Times wrote that new research raised "questions about whether [heart] stents should be used so often or at all to treat chest pain."Heart stents are small tubes, generally made from metal or fabric, that are used to restore blood flow through narrow or blocked arteries.They became popular in the 1990s as an alternative to the more invasive option of bypass surgery, according to the Times.Inserting a stent costs between $11,000 and $41,000, the Times said."All cardiology guidelines should be revised," Dr. David L. Brown of Washington University School of Medicine and Dr. Rita F. Redberg of the University of California, San Francisco, wrote in an editorial published with the new study, according to the Times.Other research has sought to examine whether heart stents are as effective in treating heart attacks as is commonly thought.Click here to read the original story from The New York Times.
Pandora Media shares slip after earnings release:::::Pandora Media on Thursday reported mixed quarterly results.Here's how the company did compared with what Wall Street expected: Loss per share: 6 cents vs. 8 cents expected, according to Thomson Reuters Revenue: $379 million vs. $380.6 million expected, according to Thomson Reuters Active listeners: 73.7 million vs. 74.6 million expected, according to StreetAccount Listener hours: 5.15 billion vs. 5.16 billion expected, according to StreetAccount In the year-ago quarter, the company reported an adjusted loss per share of 7 cents on revenue of $351.9 million.Advertising revenue, which accounts for the bulk of Pandora's overall revenue, grew 1 percent year over year but missed analyst expectations.Pandora reported $275.7 million in advertising revenue, which came in below analyst expectations of $289.3 million, according to StreetAccount.Pandora said that despite an increase in its average price per ad, it sold fewer ads in the quarter.In a conference call with investors following the earnings release, CFO Naveen Chopra said the company expected the headwinds affecting Pandora's advertising revenue in the third quarter, such as limitations in its ad technology, to continue in the fourth quarter."There's no silver bullet that's going to come in and solve these problems," CEO Roger Lynch said.He said investments in ad targeting and reporting technology would start to have an effect throughout 2018.The company reported 73.7 million active listeners in the third quarter, down from 77.9 million in the same period a year ago, a decrease for the third straight quarter.Listener hours were reported as 5.15 billion, down from 5.4 billion reported in the year-ago quarter.The stock fell more than 6 percent in after-hours trade.The stock has struggled this year, falling more than 44 percent so far.The company reported that total subscribers reached 5.19 million in the quarter, representing 29 percent year-over-year growth.Wall Street had expected the company to report 5.04 million subscribers, according to StreetAccount.In October, premium subscribers crossed 1 million.A recent survey by consumer marketing firm Fluent found that Pandora is the second-most-popular audio streaming service in the United States after YouTube.About two-thirds of respondents who listen to streaming audio use Pandora, the survey said.Yet the music streaming market has become increasingly competitive.The Oakland, California-based company has to fend off digital music companies such as Spotify and Deezer, as well as giants such as Apple, Google and Amazon.Amid this competition, Pandora has struggled to monetize its user base.In March, the company launched a premium service for $9.99 a month.This offering lets users search for specific tracks and albums directly, allowing the company to better compete with those offered by Spotify and its competitors.In June, the music provider announced a $480 million investment from SiriusXM after rebuffing an offer to buy the company outright.In the same month, the company's co-founder and CEO Tim Westergren announced his plans to step down.WATCH: Pandora names Roger Lynch CEO
Proposed tax plan could lead to housing recession, says home builders association CEO:::::The tax plan unveiled today by Republicans in the House of Representatives could lead to a housing recession, according to National Association of Home Builders CEO Jerry Howard.Howard said his members were "irate" about a proposed plan to slice the mortgage interest deduction in half, to a maximum of $500,000."There are seven million homes on the market right now that are more than $500,000.Those houses are automatically going to be devalued," he said."What we've seen is that when house values start to go down, it spreads to the next market after that, and another market, and the next thing you know you have a housing recession."
PG&E guides lower after wildfires; 'Premature to discuss any potential liability,' says CEO:::::Facing costs from the recent Northern California wildfires, PG&E on Thursday trimmed this year's earnings forecast and said it is continuing to cooperate with agencies investigating the fires.PG&E, the San Francisco-based electric utility, has already been sued in connection with last month's deadly wildfires in complaints that allege negligence and violations of various utility and safety codes.The wildfires, which started Oct. 8, damaged or destroyed more than 14,700 homes across several counties in Northern California and resulted in the loss of 43 lives."It is premature to discuss any potential liability for the recent wildfires given that there has been no determination of the causes of any of the fires," PG&E CEO and President Geisha Williams said during the company's earnings conference call Thursday.PG&E trimmed its 2017 forecast for GAAP earnings per share to a range of $3.54 to $3.79, from a prior range of $3.36 to $3.56.It left the non-GAAP range of $3.55 to 3.75 per share unchanged, and that compares with the Street's forecast for earnings of $3.67 per share, according to Thomson Reuters.PG&E said the change in guidance was "primarily due to the reinstatement of the company's liability insurance following the Northern California wildfires, as well as an increase in the expected third-party claims associated with the [2015] Butte fire."Jason Wells, chief financial officer of PG&E, said during the conference call that the company's current forecast for costs related to restoration and repairs following the recent Northern California wildfires ranges from $160 million to $200 million.The company plans to seek recovery for its restoration activities through the California Public Utilities Commission, which regulates utilities in the state.However, the CFO refused on the call to speculate on any potential timing for liability recognition in the wildfire catastrophe, citing an ongoing state probe.Indeed, the cause of the Northern California wildfires remain under investigation by Cal Fire, a spokesman for the state agency told CNBC on Thursday.The official didn't have an estimate of how long the probe will take although previous wildfire investigations sometimes have taken more than six months.PG&E said Thursday it was "fully cooperating with Cal Fire and the CPUC in their investigations of these fires."Also, it said in those instances where fire investigators or the utility "identified a site potentially involving our facilities," the company submitted incident reports to the CPUC but added that these reports were "factual in nature and do not reflect a finding of cause."Previously, PG&E had acknowledged in an Oct. 13 regulatory filing with the SEC it was being investigated by Cal Fire, indicating that the probe includes "the possible role of power lines and other facilities" of its utility subsidiary.Some previous California wildfires have been blamed on fallen trees sparking electrical lines, or down power lines.During the call, Williams said the utility's service area "experienced a wind event without precedent, with some recorded wind gusts exceeding 75 miles per hour."She also said the area in the wildfire region had "trees weakened by years of drought and other environmental factors."That said, the CEO added: "This was an extraordinary confluence of events, and right now is simply too early to make an assumption about liability."An attorney specializing in wildfire lawsuits said last month PG&E could potentially be on the hook for up to $6 billion in damages if found liable for the deadly Northern California wildfires.That's partly because utilities in California face liability under what's known as inverse condemnation as well as for negligence claims for wildfire and other damaging incidents caused by such things as power lines or other utility equipment."California is one of the only states in the country where the courts have applied inverse condemnation liability to events caused by utility equipment," Williams said on the call.Added the CEO, "We don't believe that inverse condemnation is an appropriate doctrine, nor do we think it is appropriately applied to regulated utilities.We would challenge its application, if that were to be the case in these events."The utility has previously indicated it has about $800 million in liability insurance for potential losses in connection with the wildfires.PG&E's general counsel, John Simon, told analysts Thursday at least nine lawsuits have been filed against the company in connection with the recent wildfires."There may be others to come," he said.Earlier this year, a California judge ordered PG&E to pay damages in connection with the 70,000-acre Butte fire, a 2015 incident that burned more than 920 structures and caused two fatalites.Cal Fire investigators found the 2015 blaze got "sparked by a tree that came into contact with a Pacific Gas & Electric Company powerline."More than 2,000 plaintiffs have sued PG&E in connection with the Butte fire.Earlier Thursday, PG&E said it earned $1.12 a share in the third quarter on a non-GAAP basis.That was better than the 91 cents per share analysts were expecting, according to Thomson Reuters.The company earned 94 cents a share, excluding items, in the year-ago period.However, PG&E's operating revenue fell to $4.52 billion, lower than both the Street's forecast for $4.82 billion and its year-ago revenue of $4.81 billion.In trading, PG&E stock was down fractionally in light trading, but it has lost 17 percent since the wildfires.
Mall owners look to shuttered department stores as big opportunities:::::As the year comes to a close and the holidays approach, mall owners are talking redevelopments, and particularly those of vacated Sears stores.The timely discussion has been a reoccurring theme on many third-quarter retail real estate investment trust, or REIT, conference calls.Analysts and investors want to know: "What are you going to do with that big box?"As Sears and other department store chains announce plans to shutter some locations, that leaves a mall landlord looking for a replacement or a slew of smaller-scale replacements and quick.Many mall REITs have exposure to the Illinois-headquartered chain, including General Growth Properties, Simon Property Group, Macerich, Pennsylvania REIT and Seritage a 2015 real estate spinoff from Sears Holdings."One of the key tenets of our business plan is capitalizing on the embedded opportunity with our portfolio to redevelop anchor boxes," GGP CEO Sandeep Mathrani said on a conference call earlier this week.In October alone, GGP acquired two Sears locations one in Pennsylvania and another in Louisiana.To date, GGP has invested more than $2 billion in redeveloping 115 of its properties, reaping "very attractive returns," Mathrani added.The mall owner is bringing in fresh faces to retail, such as Forever 21's Riley Rose, Indochino and Untuckit.GGP also just signed an agreement with residential REIT AvalonBay to add living spaces to one of its malls in Seattle.AvalonBay is notably one of those landlords said to be working with Amazon to bring lockers to its residences."This represents our belief that high-quality retail centers can be densified with other users, given the location and market demand," Mathrani explained, saying similar projects could develop over time."We like that GGP is methodically addressing the contraction of department stores," RBC Capital Markets analyst Wes Golladay wrote in a note to clients.As retail REITs face headwinds from retailers' woes, "favorable financing activity and aggressive buyback activity" could help GGP longer term, Golladay added.Pennsylvania REIT, another mall player with high department store exposure, announced on Wednesday plans to redevelop a dark Macy's store, replacing it with two off-price retailers."The Macy's redevelopment offers an opportunity to bring highly sought after, first-to-market retailers to a vibrant market enabling us to further distinguish the property," CEO Joe Coradino said.Over the past year, Pennsylvania REIT has been filling vacated department store boxes with retailers including Field & Stream, HomeGoods, Burlington and Dick's Sporting Goods.Like GGP, Coradino and his team expect the incoming retailers to pay higher rents and amass more sales per square foot.Just last week and ahead of reporting third-quarter earnings, Seritage unveiled plans to take one of its more than 200 Sears and Kmart locations, turning a portion of the store into a massive AMC Theatre."The partnership builds on our strategy to deliver a multi-tenant retail destination that provides an elevated shopping and entertainment experience for our customers," James Bry, executive vice president of development and construction at Seritage, said about the project.Following the renovations, Sears will have a "consolidated" store on the lower level of the property, Seritage said.The mall operator has also noted in the past that former Sears stores perform better after being redeveloped, or leased to new tenants altogether.Simon, the largest mall owner in the U.S., boasts more than 30 redevelopment projects, totaling $1.3 billion in expenses, ongoing.The REIT has been particularly keen of late to add more restaurants and food options to its properties, while experimenting with pop-up concepts."The issue with [retail] bankruptcies is you're at the whim of the court," Chief Executive David Simon said last week on a conference call with analysts and investors."They can cancel [a contract] at a moment's notice, and it does take time to lease."That being said, Simon continues to build out its assets in unique ways, as some anchors flee.One example of this is seen at Simon's King of Prussia property, in Pennsylvania, which recently lost a J.C. Penney.Simon said plans are in the works for mixed uses such as hotels, apartments, office buildings and play space."The dot com era didn't kill the mall and the current retail headwinds won't kill off SPG's 'A' malls either," Boenning & Scattergood analyst Floris van Dijkum wrote in a recent note to clients."We believe that SPG has significant room to grow ... through the selective redevelopment of anchor boxes."2017 has so far brought more than a dozen retail bankruptcies, with countless specialty brands announcing plans to close stores as part of their restructuring efforts.While mall owners hope less of that activity might happen in 2018, nobody knows for certain.Next week department stores Nordstrom, Macy's, Kohl's and Penney's are set to report third-quarter earnings, which should offer some insight into retail's future, ahead of the all-important holiday season.
Small-business group NFIB opposes tax bill 'in current form':::::The National Federation of Independent Business said Thursday it opposes the tax plan proposed by Republicans in the House of Representatives."This bill leaves too many small businesses behind," CEO Juanita Duggan said in a statement."We are concerned that the pass-through provision does not help most small businesses.Small business is the engine of the economy.We believe that tax reform should provide substantial relief to all small businesses, so they can reinvest their money, grow, and create jobs."Meanwhile, Todd McCracken, CEO of the National Small Business Association, said in a phone call with CNBC that he was still unsure whether his organization would support the bill.The nonpartisan Small Business & Entrepreneurship Council said in a statement that it sees the legislation as an opportunity to modernize the tax code.The group said it supports certain provisions in the proposal, such as the repeal of the estate tax and its expensing provisions.The group's chief economist, Ray Keating, noted that they are still reviewing some areas of the legislation where the organization has concerns.The groups have all been pushing hard for tax reform.The House bill, titled the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, would slash the number of income tax brackets from seven to four: 12 percent, 25 percent, 35 percent and 39.6 percent.The bill is also expected to raise the child tax credit to $1,600 from its current maximum of $1,000.It's also expected to preserve popular retirement savings plans, such as 401(k)s and Individual Retirement Accounts.Business Roundtable said Thursday it would support the plan."If we are serious about growing the economy, creating jobs and increasing wages for all Americans, this country needs a modernized tax code.It is that simple," said Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JP Morgan Chase and chairman of Business Roundtable.
Forget your checked luggage. This airline is weighing passengers:::::Finnair is asking for a few volunteers, not to take a later flight, but to step on a scale before boarding the plane.The Finnish airline told CNBC that it has asked about 180 passengers to weigh in before flights from Helsinki Airport this week and it needs about 2,000 travelers to get an accurate read on passenger weights and their carry-on bags.The study will continue through spring 2018, Finnair said, because it wants to collect data when travelers are carrying heavy winter coats and when they are traveling lighter in warmer weather.The information will be kept anonymous, the airline said.The aim of the weigh-ins, which might be more familiar to travelers who have flown on small planes, is to update nearly decade-old data on average passenger weights as it expands its route network and needs to accurately forecast payloads and how much fuel it requires."We have a strong safety culture at Finnair, and are also a very data-driven organization, so we want to ensure we have the best possible data in use in aircraft performance and loading calculations," Finnair said.The airline said it, like other carriers, is using European Aviation Safety Agency data from 2009, which lists the standard weight, including carry-on luggage, for a male passenger at 88 kilograms (194 pounds), 70 kilograms (154 pounds) for a female passenger and 35 kilograms (77 pounds) for a child."Now we feel it is time to update the data, as our traffic has developed and grown a lot," Finnair said."We have a very international customer base, as many of our customers transfer with us between Europe and Asia, and then we have our domestic traffic as well."At least you can leave your shoes on.
Here are the 29 business leaders headed to China with Donald Trump:::::Dozens of CEOs and other corporate leaders are tagging along with President Donald Trump when he heads to China next week, including a number of corporate big-wigs, mega-donors and Republican leaders.A few of those attending include Lloyd Blankfein of Goldman Sachs, Steve Mollenkopf of Qualcomm, Shane Tedjarati of Honeywell, Andrew Liveris of DowDuPont, and Kevin McAllister of Boeing, according to a list obtained by CNBC.Alaska Gov.Bill Walker will also be joining the president.The president, who ascended to office based on his experience in the private sector, has made efforts to leverage the corporate world while in office.A council of top business executives disbanded over the summer after the president appeared to equate torch-bearing white nationalists with protesters demonstrating against them.The head of that council was Andrew Liveris, who will be joining the president in China.The president will be touring Asia from Nov. 5 to Nov. 14, including stops in Japan, South Korea, China, Vietnam and the Philippines.A priority of Trump's Asia tour will be bolstering trade with some of the United States' top business partners.The visit will take him to an ASEAN summit in the Philippines and an APEC summit in Vietnam.Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross told reporters in September that the administration is "looking forward to a very good session including a lot of American CEOs and we hope there will be some very good deliverables."Here is the full list of CEOs and other leaders joining the president in China:
DOJ reportedly considers antitrust suit to block AT&T's $85 billion acquisition of Time Warner:::::Time Warner shares fell Thursday after a newspaper reported that the Department of Justice is considering an antitrust lawsuit to block AT&T's acquisition of the media company.Time Warner share price was down 4.1 percent after The Wall Street Journal reported that the department's antitrust division is preparing for litigation in case it decides to sue to block the deal.AT&T's stock was down 1.2 percent.At the same time, the department and the companies are discussing possible terms that would allow the deal to receive the government's approval, the Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter.AT&T representatives have met with Justice officials in recent weeks, and the department hasn't made a final decision, but the two sides aren't close to an agreement, the Journal's sources said."When the DOJ reviews any transaction, it is common and expected for both sides to prepare for all possible scenarios," AT&T said in a statement."For over 40 years, vertical mergers like this one have always been approved because they benefit consumers without removing any competitors from the market.While we won't comment on our discussions with DOJ, we see no reason in the law or the facts why this transaction should be an exception."Time Warner and the Department of Justice declined comment.AT&T reached an agreement tobuy Time Warner for more than $85 billion last October.In July, sources told CNBC the deal could close in as soon as 60 days.Read the full Wall Street Journal story here.
Teva plunges 18% after drugmaker lowers 2017 outlook again:::::Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, the world's biggest generic medicine maker, warned on 2017 earnings on Thursday after reporting a fall in third-quarter profit hurt by competition in the U.S. market.Shares plunged nearly 18 percent on Thursday morning.A day earlier U.S. shareholder Allergan announced it would begin selling down its 10 percent stake in the Israeli company, whose new chief executive, Kare Schultz, took the reins this week.His predecessor stepped down in February after sharp criticism for a string of expensive acquisitions and delayed drug launches.Schultz needs to convince investors that Teva can boost growth and reduce a debt load acquired mostly from financing its $40.5 billion purchase of generics business Actavis, part of Allergan, last year.In September, it announced it would sell the remaining businesses in its specialty women's health business for $1.38 billion.EPS tumbles Teva reported third-quarter earnings per share (EPS) excluding one-time items of $1.00, down from $1.31 a year earlier, on revenue up 1 percent at $5.6 billion.Generic drug profits fell to $619 million from $982 million a year earlier on sales of $3.01 billion, down from $3.26 billion.It said it was being hurt by a lower-than-expected contribution from new generic launches in the United States as well as by increased price erosion.Sales of its branded multiple sclerosis drug Copaxone fell 7 percent to $987 million.The earlier-than-expected launch of a generic competitor to Copaxone in October will have an expected impact on EPS of 30 cents this year, Teva said.The quarterly results were broadly in line with analyst forecasts of $1.02 EPS ex-items on revenue of $5.6 billion, Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S data showed.However, Teva lowered its full-year forecasts.It cut its EPS ex-items forecast to $3.77-$3.87 from $4.30-$4.50.It cut its revenue forecast to $22.2-$22.3 billion from $22.8-$23.2 billion.Analysts had been expecting a full-year EPS of $4.19 on revenue of $22.6 billion, Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S data showed."We now project approximately $400 million of revenues from new product launches in the year, compared to the previous projection of $500 million," it said.Teva shares were down 11 percent at 44 shekels as of 1235 GMT.Teva will pay a quarterly dividend of 8.5 cents a share, unchanged from the second quarter when it cut its payout by 75 percent.
Telecoms giant Orange has launched its own mobile-based bank:::::Telecommunications corporation Orange has launched its own bank, it was announced Thursday.Orange said its mobile-based retail bank is available in France and offers customers current accounts, bank cards, overdraft lending, a free insurance package and a savings account."With Orange Bank, this is an important new chapter in our history: Orange is now also a bank.A 100 percent mobile-based bank that is dedicated to providing an incomparable user experience," Stphane Richard, chairman and chief executive of Orange, said in a statement Thursday.Richard said the Orange Bank would combine "the best innovations available on the market today."Orange's bank is the latest in a long line of challenger banks to provide a digital alternative to traditional offerings from larger lenders.A number of challengers have been set up, such as Britain's Starling Bank and Germany's N26.Orange Bank will provide real-time balances, mobile payments and a virtual adviser, the telecoms giant said.Customers will also be able to visit Orange's stores to set up an account or fix any issues they are having.The firm said it is also looking to introduce personal loans and mortgages.
Men's shirt maker Untuckit launches a line for kids as retailer grows offline:::::Untuckit, the retail brand known for its signature men's shirts, is rolling out a line for children."We started with shirts and then started getting requests for new products," Founder and Executive Chairman Chris Riccobono told CNBC."What we realized is we were growing into a brand, and people wanted to buy from Untuckit."People were coming into Untuckit stores saying, "This [shirt] would be perfect for my son," Riccobono added."Kids has been in the works for a really long time, but we wanted to do it at the right time."The children's polo shirts and button downs, in sizes 2 to 14, will retail from $35 to $48.The line is available in stores and online starting Thursday."This is perfect for our demographic," co-founder and CEO Aaron Sanandres told CNBC."Our customers either have kids, are having kids, or have grandkids."Untuckit launched online in 2011.Riccobono said he was struggling to find a dress shirt that wasn't too big or too baggy.Riccobono later ran into Sanandres, who shared a similar retail vision, while pursuing his MBA at Columbia Business School.The two opted to pursue creating a men's shirt that's designed to be worn untucked.The brand's offerings now include performance wear, shoes and a women's line, which just launched this spring.After kids apparel, it plans to roll out a pants line later this month."All of our ventures are meant to be profitable," Sanandres said.Untuckit, which opened a brick-and-mortar store in 2015, is building key relationships with folks within the real estate industry.Untuckit is opening stores at a rapid clip, and plans to have 50 by the end of next year.The company has said it aims to open 100 stores over the next five years, and is in discussions with such mall developers as Simon Property Group, Macerich and Taubman Centers regarding those plans."One thing e-commerce companies struggle with is not having a physical place to go to create a strong bond between the online business and the consumer," Sanandres said about opening new stores."We started to see our stores were extremely profitable, and the stores also offer a lift to the online business."Eyeglass company Warby Parker and clothing rental service Rent the Runway have made similar moves from digital to brick and mortar."There is a need for retail," Riccobono said."Men were saying they wouldn't buy our shirts without touching and trying [it] on."In June, venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins invested $30 million in the company's first major round of fundraising.The transaction reportedly valued Untuckit at around $200 million at the time.Untuckit said it is using the funding to launch new product lines with its materials and to open stores around the countries.
Kohl's holiday sales come early this year:::::Kohl's is bringing out the sales for shoppers even earlier this holiday season.The department store retailer on Wednesday unveiled its holiday strategy, which includes more ways for shoppers to earn Kohl's Cash, in-store deals on Cyber Monday and heavier Black Friday promotions starting this week.On the same day it introduced its holiday plans, Kohl's for one day only was offering shoppers $15 in Kohl's Cash for every $50 spent in stores and online.The company said it's using the day to set the tone for the holiday shopping season "in a big way."Kohl's won't be alone in offering shoppers big promotions in the coming weeks.Industry watchers are expecting retailers to rely heavily on discounts to draw in shoppers this holiday season.One key risk, however, will be if retailers cut prices too much.It's been a rough ride for U.S. department stores already this year, and they don't have much room for additional expenses, which could drag profits down further.But the hope is the strategy will drive shoppers to the store.Kohl's Cash is one way to keep consumers coming back since it can be redeemed at Kohl's locations at a later date, and is treated just like regular cash.In past years, Kohl's only ran the "$15 for $50" promotions on Black Friday weekend, which it will also continue this year from Nov. 20 through Nov. 25."We're issuing more Kohl's Cash than ever before," Chief Merchandising and Customer Officer Michelle Gass said.Meantime, Kohl's is beefing up its product assortment on sale this season, highlighting key categories the company believes will sell better than others.Athleisure is a particular "bright spot" for Kohl's business, according to Gass.2017 notably marks the first holiday season Wisconsin-based Kohl's will have Under Armour merchandise on its shelves.And Kohl's said the partnership is proving successful, thus far.Additionally in the active department, Kohl's has its own private-label lines and sells from Nike and Adidas.In the home goods category this Christmas, the company is promoting national brands like KitchenAid, Keurig and Instant Pot.For women's apparel, Kohl's has an exclusive line with designer Vera Wang.This year, Kohl's will open its doors on Thanksgiving at 5 p.m., an hour earlier than last year.Also new to this holiday season, Kohl's will offer a slew of unique deals in its stores on Cyber Monday, which is traditionally a day for shopping online.Kohl's marketing will strengthen throughout early November, according to Greg Revelle, Kohl's chief marketing officer.The department store chain is ramping up its holiday advertising campaign ahead of past years, and spending more money on media and digital, Revelle said.Kohl's and Twitter, for example, are teaming up to create a Kohl's Cash emoji when a user tweets "#KohlsCash."Kohl's also has partnerships this year with the National Football League and ABC's Freeform television network to promote Kohl's in coveted commercial slots.WATCH: For November, retail a good place to be
TSA Administrator: No need for airport-like security for rail travel:::::Airport-like security screenings are not necessary for Amtrak or other rail travel, the new head of the Transportation Security Administration said Wednesday, speaking a day after eight people were killed in a truck attack in Lower Manhattan."We don't intend to roll out anything like what we have in the airports," TSA Administrator David Pekoske told reporters at Grand Central Terminal."We are satisfied at his point."Random checks of passengers, police and security officers and canines at rail terminals are among measures currently sufficient to protect those areas, without having to screen every passenger, like at an airport, he said.Pekoske said one priority is ensuring that there is a "continuous vetting process" of the more than 5 million people enrolled in the TSA's PreCheck program, which provides access to speedier security lanes and less invasive screening at airports in exchange for $85 and a background check."It's not just a check on your background" when you enroll, he said.Pekoske, who took the reins of the Department of Homeland Security arm in August, was in New York City for a previously planned meeting with officials from the Metropolitan Transit Authority and Amtrak.New security rules went into effect last week for air travelers on U.S.-bound flights.Targets for attacks in recent years, however, have included areas that are far less protected than those beyond the security checkpoints.For example, the attacks in the Brussels Airport occurred in a departure hall in March 2016 and there was a shooting at the baggage claim area at Fort Lauderdale's main airport in January.
Gap is selling subscription boxes for kids through Old Navy, after a successful run with baby clothes:::::Gap Inc. is launching another subscription box service this time through its less-expensive Old Navy nameplate.Just last month, Gap's baby division was seen ramping up its own subscription offering, but only for a limited time.Now, right in time for the holidays, Old Navy is selling a subscription box for kids, called Superbox.Similar to babyGap's Outfit Box, the Old Navy Superbox is a quarterly subscription for kids ages 5 through 12.The boxes include six items and retail for $69.99, with more than $100 worth of clothes, according to Gap.The service is being marketed as a giftable option for shoppers, where customers are able to personalize the boxes without making too many selections.After choosing a size and gender, for example, shoppers simply pick a style options include "preppy," "sporty," "cool" or "classic."From there, Gap does the curating.Shoppers can also select a "surprise me" option, which Gap said has been highly popular among shoppers of its baby division.It adds a fun and mysterious element like opening presents on Christmas Day to the process.In the early testing of babyGap's Outfit Box, Gap found low average return rates, a draw of new customers to the brand, and high customer retention from the first to the second box, a spokeswoman for the company told CNBC.From here, Gap said it will continue to glean insights about its customers from future product launches.Subscription boxes offer companies like Gap a treasure trove of data on consumer shopping behavior, likes and dislikes.The business model also offers companies a predictable source of revenue, granted shoppers don't cancel their subscriptions."We have entered a new world of retail where the traditional leaders are faced with unconventional channel competition, and subscription services are the newest player," Marshal Cohen, an analyst with NPD Group, said in an industry report earlier this year."There is a great deal of room to grow within the subscription model, and the competitive field will continue to expand as online retailers develop subscription services and options for auto-replenishment of fashion basics," he added.NPD Group estimated that 35 percent of consumers "don't even know" what subscription services are.Only 15 percent of consumers have ordered subscription boxes, while another 14 percent haven't yet ordered them but plan to, the firm found.Just last month, Stitch Fix, a pioneer of the apparel subscription business, filed for its initial public offering.The IPO will test investors' reception to a new breed of online shopping companies.Meantime, Amazon is working on its own subscription box service although not exclusively for kids, like Gap's called Prime Wardrobe.
The US economy is strong, and it's about to get even stronger, Atlanta Fed model shows:::::You may not have noticed, but the U.S. economy is on a tear.Or at least that's what an economic model at the Atlanta Federal Reserve is showing.Based on recent economic data, the gross domestic product is headed for a 4.5 percent annualized growth pace in the fourth quarter, according to the Atlanta Fed's model, called GDP Now.That would be a sharp pickup from the third quarter, which the government's initial estimate pegged at a 3 percent growth rate.The Atlanta Fed model looks at multiple, current measures of economic activity and uses them to forecast where the overall economy is headed.The latest estimate for fourth-quarter GDP growth is much faster than the 2.9 percent rate the model showed Monday, the Atlanta Fed said.The improved outlook came even as data on U.S. factory output eased off a 13-year high in October.The GDP Now forecast has roughly tracked the government's initial estimate of the U.S. economy.The Bureau of Economic Analysis will publish its next "advance" estimate on Jan. 27 for the last three months of this year.
Strength in numbers could help California in massive rebuilding effort after wildfire disaster:::::Thousands of homes lost to last month's devastating wildfires in Northern California could be rebuilt faster and more efficiently using production-scale techniques, according to industry experts.Indeed, a proposal is being floated to pull together construction and crew resources to rebuild whole communities or streets lost in the wine country wildfire disaster.This mass-building approach could become particularly important as contractors say they are already being inundated with calls for rebuilding requests and some worry about shortages in skilled labor and materials."Because we have such a large situation, we have to think beyond our own property lines," said Julia Donoho, an architect and attorney in the Santa Rosa area.Backers of the approach say pooling together resources could allow for strength in numbers and increase overall efficiencies in the use of skilled crews, site supervisors, equipment as well as the purchase of construction materials.It also might be a way to get fire victims back into their homes faster.Overall, last month's wildfires damaged or destroyed more than 14,700 homes across several counties in Northern California.Sonoma County bore the brunt of the disaster but there also was destruction in Napa, Mendocino, Lake and a few other counties.Sonoma County lost about 5,000 homes, and Santa Rosa the largest city in the county had 3,000 homes destroyed and entire neighborhoods wiped out.The homes lost in Santa Rosa represent roughly 5 percent of its housing stock.In addition to the property losses, there also were at least 43 fatalities linked to the Northern California fires, with 23 in Sonoma County.Donoho said she's working on a project to rebuild all of Santa Rosa's Coffey Park neighborhood and talking to homeowners about what they'd like to see in the rebuilt community.About 1,300 homes were lost in Coffey Park, a middle-class neighborhood.There also were higher-end neighborhoods lost that might not lend themselves to production-style rebuilding since there may be too many customized features, industry executives say.In any event, some believe the rebuilding process could take 3 to 5 years to complete and note that the current priority is a government-led hazardous and toxic waste cleanup at burned homesites.State officials have said they expect the rebuilding to start in earnest in the springtime."Some of the homeowners want to be back in so quickly that we should just rebuild with the plans with modern standards that they already had, and that would give them the fastest permit," said Donoho."Other people have ideas about redesign.So we need to find the right balance."Added Donoho, "We don't just want a few houses back, we want our whole neighborhood back.If you get your house back, but you don't have a neighborhood of houses around you and you're surrounded by 10 years of construction."Jeff Okrepkie, an insurance agent in Santa Rosa who lost his home in the wildfires, said grouping together homes to rebuild sounds "great but it's hard to get this whole process figured out right now."In fact, there is still an ongoing process of fire victims going over losses with insurance adjusters to see how much in proceeds they will get.Some also are dealing with banks who hold the mortgages to homes."It's a bleak and scary future that we're looking into, and we have to find a way to wade through those murky waters," he said.Okrepkie said even before the wildfires there was a "massive labor shortage and a lot of that has to do with the rental and home market up here.Pretty much everybody who could swing a hammer who was reliable already had a job.It will get worse because we just lost that many residential structures."In Sonoma County, there's also believed to be fewer than six major homebuilders that can construct multiple homes or residential developments."When you start looking at the numbers, we're going to need people from somewhere else to help do it," said Okrepkie.At the same time, there are concerns the new construction crews coming to the area will only exacerbate the region's housing shortage.Even so, pooling together resources might attract more interest from established builders and contractors from outside the Northern California region.A large production-scale rebuilding approach was utilized previously in California wildfires, including in 2003, 2007 and 2008.The biggest of those was in San Diego's Scripps Ranch community after the 2003 Cedar fire, a deadly blaze that destroyed a total of more than 2,300 residential properties in the region.A handful of builders were responsible for rebuilding hundreds of the homes lost in Scripps Ranch.That effort took several years and some of those same firms already have shown an interest in participating in the rebuilding."With 6,000 homes and the devastation that we're seeing, we think we could offer a helping hand," said Jeff Pack, an executive with Stonefield Companies, a San Diego-area homebuilder that helped rebuild homes after the Cedar fire and wildfires in Southern California.Added Pack, "They are going to need a lot of help up there in rebuilding.It's going to be a massive effort with the amount of homes that have been lost."Stonefield already has made inquiries to see about the availability of its subcontractor pool to assist in Northern California.The company could use its playbook from the Scripps Ranch fires to keep the costs down."Our blueprint down there allowed the homeowners to team up together and that allowed the cost spreading to occur from architectural plans to contractor superintendent onsite to site supplies to different tractors that the subcontractors needed to use," said Pack.Residential insured losses from the recent wildfires totaled more than $3 billion, with the claims total expected to go up, California's insurance commissioner announced Tuesday.The insured losses in Sonoma County exceeded $2.6 billion."Doing a group rebuild is a way to lower price so people can afford to rebuild," said Kenneth Klein, a California Western School of Law professor and expert on natural disasters.He said insurance industry data shows about 80 percent of the homes in America are at least 20 percent under-insured, meaning they do not have enough insurance proceeds to replace their homes to the state it was prior to the destructive incident.Klein, who lost his Scripps Ranch home to the Cedar fire, said almost all of his neighbors decided to do a group rebuild after the 2003 disaster "because it was the obvious way to deal with the gap in insurance proceeds and rebuilding your home."That said, Klein notes he had "full insurance" to cover all his home's losses but still ended up building in tandem with a neighbor.
Sears is putting 'the whole store on sale' to avoid the Black Friday crunch:::::Sears is putting 'the whole store on sale' to avoid the Black Friday crunch 10:57 AM ET Wed, 1 Nov 2017 | 00:52 Everything at Sears and Kmart stores is going on sale ahead of the holidays.Everything.The troubled department store chain on Wednesday kicked off a promotional event that promises "first-of-their-kind" discounts ranging from 10 to 50 percent at Sears stores, and 10 to 40 percent at Kmart.Appliances at Sears will be as much as 40 percent off, one flyer reviewed by CNBC shows.Tools, recliners and work boots made by DieHard are being marked down up to 50 percent.And family outerwear at Kmart will see markdowns around 40 percent.This season will be crucial for Sears, which has been struggling with some of its vendors to keep merchandise in stock.Just last month, the company tapped CEO Eddie Lampert's hedge fund three times for additional financing.During its latest quarter, Sears posted a double-digit decline in same-store sales, a metric closely watched by Wall Street.The deals will run through the Saturday of Thanksgiving weekend.Sears said it wanted to get a jump on the season to help customers avoid a "Black Friday crunch.""We will have deals in every nook and cranny of the store," Kelly Cook, chief marketing officer of Sears and Kmart, told CNBC."Our shoppers said they wanted four things for the holidays," Cook said.That consisted of: extra time, added customer service, more freebies, and "the whole store on sale."In addition to the steep discounts at stores through the season, Sears will offer shoppers curbside pickup, free Sears "cash" in Shop Your Way points to spend on items, the return of the iconic Sears catalog, and Kmart's Bluelight Specials.Cook described the new strategy as the biggest holiday push Sears has ever done.In years past, promotions at Sears and Kmart stores have been more sporadic throughout November and December.But Cook and her team said they were finding "the holiday shopping period is growing beyond Black Friday, seeping into the beginning parts of November."When asked about the retailer's margins being hurt by more promotions, Cook said Sears tested a similar "blowout" event at a select Kmart store earlier this summer, to monitor the economics of the idea.Results showed Kmart shoppers were buying more during the month, and coming in more frequently, she said."It was viable economically."As October came to an end, America's department stores were already under fire for their holiday strategies.This year, Amazon's encroaching retail presence is on the minds of many.In turn, each retailer has its own way of trying to win sales.Kohl's, for example, has signed a deal with Amazon to sell some of Amazon's tech products and accept Amazon returns in a handful of Kohl's stores, heading into the holidays.Nordstrom, which has fared better on the stock market than all of its peers this year except for Kohl's, is betting bigger on its off-price Rack division and testing a smaller store format without inventory.Stocks of retail rivals Macy's and J.C. Penney were downgraded by Citi on Monday, to sell from neutral ratings.Citi analyst Paul Lejuez is calling for "another promotional holiday season" ahead for the already-challenged department store industry.
It's looking like China's getting really excited about the iPhone X:::::Here are the top 5 features of the new Apple iPhone X 6:02 AM ET Tue, 31 Oct 2017 | 01:33 Chinese consumers are getting very excited about the iPhone X.But for Apple, which has struggled to keep up with the onslaught of competition in China's smartphone market, an upturn in fortunes may not yet be on the cards.Already, Chinese buyers are rushing to get their pre-orders before the official product launch on Friday.JD.com, the country's second-largest e-commerce site after Alibaba's Tmall, received over 2.5 million pre-orders.Other sellers have tallied about another 3 million of such orders.For perspective, Apple sold 44.9 million iPhone units in China in 2016, according to research by intelligence firm IDC.Social media platforms in China are also seeing lively activity about Apple's latest offering, with the term #iPhoneX being read 400 million times thus far.
Wal-Mart will hold parties — yes, parties — in its stores this holiday season:::::Wal-Mart will hold parties - yes, parties - in its stores this holiday season 10:57 AM ET Wed, 1 Nov 2017 | 01:03 Wal-Mart is gearing up for the holiday season this year with plans to invest even more in the in-store shopping experience.For Wal-Mart, that means parties.The big-box retailer plans to hold more than 20,000 parties at its stores over the next two months, with the first event, called "Toys That Rock," taking place nationwide this Saturday.Wal-Mart's other events will include "Parties That Rock" and "Gifts That Rock," where attendees can receive curated gift guides and toy catalogs.Its overarching holiday marketing campaign this year is dubbed "Rock This Christmas," the company announced Wednesday."While we're shipping a whole lot of advertising to the omnichannel experience, we don't want to let the store experience get lost in that," Tony Rogers, chief marketing officer of Wal-Mart U.S., said on a call with members of the media."We are investing in [stores] this year more than we ever have," Rogers said."It's the most we've done in stores."Wal-Mart made a significant push in 2016 to make its supercenters easier and more festive to shop in, bringing in "holiday helpers" for the first time and upping its amount of live toy demonstrations for kids and their parents.This year, Wal-Mart is adding more holiday helpers, which guide shoppers to checkout lines, open additional registers during busy hours and fetch items from around the stores.The retailer will also increase the number of toy demos in stores to 165,000, and bring Santa Claus in again for selfies.In another push, Arkansas-based Wal-Mart is expanding the number of items on sale this holiday season, both in stores and online.The company will triple its online assortment, according to Scott Hilton, chief revenue officer of Wal-Mart's U.S. e-commerce division.And more Wal-Mart shoppers are expected to ring up purchases online prior to picking them up in stores, Hilton said.Wal-Mart this year will sell items from national brands that were not previously available, like Cuisinart, KitchenAid, Yankee Candle, and Bose in select stores and on Walmart.com.The company is calling for "more exclusives than ever before.""This is our first holiday season with [free] two-day shipping [on orders over $35], and an expanded online grocery assortment," said Steve Bratspies, chief merchandising officer of Wal-Mart's U.S. team."It's the biggest and best year, yet, when it comes to merchandise."Retail rival Target announced its holiday plans last month, which include rolling out a "GiftNow" option online, Weekend Deals, 1,400 new and exclusive toys, and free shipping running from Nov. 1 to Dec. 23.Best Buy will also remove its free-shipping threshold of $35 through the holidays, as the electronics retailer expands same-day delivery to more markets.Wal-Mart, though, is sticking to its $35 minimum for free shipping on online orders.The world's largest retailer also sat out of such a promotion ditching a threshold, like Target and Best Buy last year.In turn, Wal-Mart expects shoppers to either meet the $35 requirement, or make use of order online, pickup in store.Wal-Mart has what it calls a Pickup Discount, which encourages customers with savings to shop online-only items, shipping them to a Wal-Mart store for free pickup.
GoPro plunges after disappointing guidance, despite earnings beat:::::GoPro shares plunged after reporting disappointing fourth-quarter guidance, despite posting earnings that topped Wall Street expectations.The fourth quarter includes the holiday shopping season.The company said it expects fourth-quarter earnings between 37 cents and 47 cents per share on $470 million in revenue.Analysts had projected earnings per share of 57 cents on revenue of $521.2 million, according to Thomson Reuters consensus estimates.The stock fell more than 10 percent in after-hours trade.Here's how the company did compared with what Wall Street expected: EPS: 15 cents vs. 2 cents expected according to Thomson Reuters Revenue: $330 million vs. $313.8 million expected according to Thomson Reuters In the year-ago quarter, GoPro reported an adjusted loss per share of 60 cents on revenue of $240.6 million.GoPro on Wednesday reported year-over-year revenue growth of 37 percent.While the stock has gained more than 20 percent so far in 2017, it has fallen more than 15 percent in the past 12 months.GoPro shares have seen a lot of volatility as the company cuts costs as part of its plan to return to profitability.The company has attempted to shift focus away from its core wearable camera products toward drones and newer markets, such as virtual reality.But investors are still looking for signs that the progress GoPro has made is stable.In October, GoPro shares initially fell after Google announced camera improvements for its smartphones as well as an artificial intelligence clip-on camera.Shares pared losses after analysts said the market was overreacting and overestimating the potential threat from Alphabet's product.On a conference call Wednesday, CEO Nick Woodman spun Google's device as a business booster."It is encouraging to see that other companies are raising awareness that differentiated form of capture to smartphones exists," he said."That can raise interest level among consumers."GoPro's own product launch weakened fourth-quarter guidance.GoPro's goal of reducing inventory before the first quarter of 2018 includes holiday promotions that will likely reduce their products' average selling price.Executives said remaining inventory consists mostly of Hero5 Black cameras, which lost popularity after the November launch of the Hero6 Black model."It's not that we have a bunch if inventory and are trying to clear it all.There was a bit of softness in Hero5 sell-through, post Hero6 launch," Woodman said on the conference call."The launch was totally dedicated to Hero6, and it stole Hero5's thunder."But Woodman also said extra inventory hurt the company at the start of 2017.Since GoPro plans to launch a series of new products next year, executives would rather unload extra inventory in the fourth quarter than have it damage selling price in 2018.Despite promotions that GoPro will market for existing inventory, the company hopes to generate demand for full-price products as it enters the holiday season.
This UK fintech is taking on big banks with business loans — and one key EU law is driving it:::::A digital invoice finance platform in the U.K. will provide business loans to its customers for the first time, it was announced Wednesday.Financial technology company MarketInvoice enables businesses to sell their unpaid invoices to provide working capital.The firm said it would expand into the business lending market, pitting it against established players such as U.S. listed peer-to-peer lender LendingClub and Britain's Funding Circle.The latter raised 82 million ($100 million) in funding from venture capital investors earlier this year.Peer-to-peer lenders connect lenders to borrowers through an online platform.Businesses apply for a loan and are matched with an investor.They then repay the loan to the peer-to-peer platform, which is then distributed to the investors.CEO and co-founder Anil Stocker told CNBC that MarketInvoice will take advantage of an incoming European Union regulation called the Second Payment Services Directive (PSD2), which forces banks to open up data about their customers to third party companies."PSD2 is a regulatory change that is going to be a real catalyst for us because we're able to get access to SME (small to medium-sized enterprise) customer information," Stocker said in a phone interview Tuesday."We can use things like machine learning and artificial intelligence to build better credit scores with this data.I think the banks are starting to realize that this world they've had guarded around customer data for so long, now it's starting to open up."
Claims losses from California's wildfires top $3 billion; state says some insurers may exit:::::Insured losses from this month's wildfire disaster in Northern California topped $3.3 billion, the state Department of Insurance said Tuesday.The claims for insured losses on residences, businesses and vehicles represents a three-fold jump from figures released two weeks by the state agency.Data was based on losses as reported to the state by 15 major insurers."Behind each and every one of these claims, and behind the over $3 billion in insured losses claims, are ordinary people," Insurance Commissioner Dave Jones said in a call with reporters."Tens of thousands lost everything in what has proven to be the deadliest and one of the most costly set of wildfires in our state's history."Jones also said there's a chance insurance companies now may take a second look at areas once considered low wildfire risk and be hesitant to issue policies given the devastation seen in this month's deadly fire disaster."We may also see, unfortunately, insurance companies updating their models of risk associated with these fires," he said."And that may mean in some cases some insurers will decide to write less insurance in some areas that had traditionally had been viewed as lower risk."The fires were in at least eight Northern California counties of the state.
In the wake of NYC terrorist attack, Trump says he's ordered increased 'Extreme Vetting':::::US intelligence officials are treating Manhattan incident as terror attack 5:21 PM ET Tue, 31 Oct 2017 | 00:45 President Donald Trump has requested for a heightened vetting program following Tuesday's terrorist attack in New York.Trump signed an executive order in January that imposed tighter screening on foreigners entering the U.S., known as extreme vetting.At the time, he called the measure a safeguard against terrorism.Recently, he attempted to enforce an open-ended ban on citizens from eight countries, including Iran, Libya, Syria, and Yemen.Many of the president's actions regarding travel and immigration including three attempts to ban travelers from certain countries have been met with legal resistance and unfavorable court rulings.His remarks on Tuesday came after a motorist struck several people earlier in the day, leaving at least eight people dead and a dozen injured.NBC News reported the attacker's name is Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov, an Uzbek national who entered the U.S. in 2010.After being shot in the abdomen by a police officer, the suspect was taken to a hospital, where he refused to answer an initial round of questions, according to NBC News.Tuesday's incident was done for ISIS, according to a note law enforcement officials found, WNBC reported.New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said authorities are treating the incident as a terrorist attack.New York Gov.Andrew Cuomo said there's no evidence to suggest there's a wider threat or plot, warning that people will still see more security forces out of caution.In a separate tweet, the president referred to the suspect as a "sick and deranged person."Later, the president also expressed his condolences for the victims and their families.First lady Melania Trump tweeted, "My heart breaks for #NYC today.Thoughts & prayers as we monitor the situation."In an official statement released by the White House, Trump said his administration "will provide its full support to the New York City Police Department," including a joint investigation with the FBI, for the "cowardly attack."CNBC's Angelica Lavito contributed to this report.
U.S. Added 261,000 Jobs in October; Unemployment at 4.1%:::::With Fridays revision to Septembers figures, the economy has now added jobs for 85 consecutive months, a record.The bigger picture here is that the labor markets fine, said Brett Ryan, an economist at Deutsche Bank in New York.Now that the storms have passed, the focus can return to the central question for the United States job market: With unemployment low, when will wage growth accelerate?Average hourly earnings have been rising at an annual rate of about 2.5 percent in recent months faster than inflation but below the level most economists would expect with the unemployment rate below 4.5 percent.Fridays report offered little encouragement on that front, as hourly wages fell slightly from September and the year-over-year rate of growth slowed.Its certainly trending the right way, but its surely still unexciting even unacceptable wage growth at this point, said Dan North, chief economist at Euler Hermes North America.Fridays numbers are preliminary and will be revised at least twice in coming months.They are also subject to large margins of error so consider the numbers, especially the month-to-month changes, with caution.The Storm Effect Photo The Bureau of Labor Statistics initially estimated that the United States lost 33,000 jobs in September, the first net decline in payrolls in seven years.(Those figures were revised Friday morning to show a gain of 18,000.)But those figures were heavily skewed by the hurricanes, which kept some 1.5 million workers off the job.Most economists expected a strong recovery in October, as displaced employees returned to work and as the rebuilding effort generated even more demand for labor.The storms effects are clearest in the leisure and hospitality sector, which is highly weather-dependent.The industry saw employment fall by 102,000 jobs in September, then gained them all back and more 106,000 jobs in October.2015 2016 2017 thousand +100 50 0 -50 -100 106,000 jobs gained in October 102,000 jobs lost in September Hospitality Jobs 2015 2016 2017 thousand +100 50 0 -50 -100 106,000 jobs gained in October 102,000 jobs lost in September Hospitality Jobs As a result, its probably best not to pay too much attention to either September or Octobers figures, at least not on their own.Rather, most economists recommend focusing on the broader trend.Before the hurricanes, employers were hiring at the pace of about 170,000 jobs per month this year.Thats down from an average of about 190,000 in 2016 and nearly 230,000 in 2015, but it still represents a solid pace of growth, and should be enough to keep pushing the unemployment rate down and drawing new people into the work force.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Waiting on Wages Average earnings rose 12 cents an hour in September, according to the governments preliminary estimate.That jump, one of the biggest one-month gains on record, may have been at least partly a result of the hurricanes with many low-wage restaurant and hospitality workers pushed out of the work force, at least temporarily, the average wage was nudged higher.The average fell by 1 cent an hour in October, and return of those workers may have helped bring the figure down.Even accounting for the hurricanes, however, Fridays report was a disappointment.Many economists expected slower wage growth in October, but few expected an outright drop.And while the month-to-month figures are volatile, the annual rate of growth also slowed.Over the longer run, wages have been rising faster than inflation, but slowly by historical standards.That wasnt a surprise early in the recovery, when there were millions of unemployed workers clamoring for jobs and giving employers little incentive to raise pay.But the unemployment rate hit 4.2 percent in September, lower than it ever got during the previous economic expansion.Standard economic models suggest that should lead to faster wage growth.Weve been lamenting for a year about how weve had this great, really low unemployment rate and yet the wage growth is not coming up to what wed expect historically at these levels, said Catherine Barrera, chief economist at ZipRecruiter, an online job site.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.There are reasons for optimism.Wage growth has been picking up in recent months, albeit gradually.The Employment Cost Index, a more sophisticated measure of compensation that considers benefits as well as cash pay, was up 2.5 percent in the third quarter from a year earlier, its fastest pace in two and a half years.The Labor Force The September report may have been disappointing when it came to job growth, but another key measure of labor market health was much more encouraging: The unemployment rate fell to 4.2 percent, the lowest it has been since 2001.Even better, the labor force grew, a sign that strong hiring and faster wage growth have been tempting people back into the job market.The October report was more mixed.The unemployment rate fell further, to 4.1 percent.The labor force, however, fell by 765,000.The labor force is fighting against a strong demographic headwind: the retirement of the baby boom generation.The participation rate the share of adults who are either working or actively looking for work is near multi-decade lows, largely because of the aging population.In recent months, however, the participation rate had begun to edge back up, as the strong job market drew idle workers off the sidelines.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Ryan said Fridays report suggested that there simply arent many workers left to attract.With jobless claims at 45-year lows, theres really not a lot left on the sidelines, Mr. Ryan said.Were at full employment.A Construction Shortage?The hurricanes created a demand for workers to rebuild homes, roads and other structures damaged by the storms.That led some economists to expect a surge in storm-related hiring.But Fridays report showed little evidence of that the construction sector added a modest 11,000 jobs in October, the same as September.One possible reason for the misfire: a shortage of workers in the industry, something companies have long complained about.The issue is especially acute in skilled trades, where training requirements make it hard to fill jobs quickly.Ive heard some anecdotal evidence that construction companies are having difficulty finding enough labor, Ms. Barrera said.Certainly the demand is there.The question is, is there enough supply of people working in construction?There isnt much evidence in workers paychecks that points to a shortage, however.If companies are struggling to find workers, economists would expect them to be increasing wages to attract and retain employees.But pay for construction workers actually declined slightly in October.The Retail Slump Retailers cut 8,000 jobs in October, the eighth time in nine months that employment has declined in the sector.(Revisions did turn what was initially reported as a September job cut into a modest gain.)Retailers are struggling despite a consumer economy that is humming as the holiday shopping season approaches.Retail sales posted a big gain in September, and consumer confidence hit a nearly 17-year high earlier this week.But brick-and-mortar retailers are struggling in the face of competition from Amazon and other online sellers.The issue is really the structure of the industry, said James Sweeney, chief economist for Credit Suisse in New York.The problem is certain business models are becoming obsolete as the world changes.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The Economic Context Not only is the job market fundamentally healthy, theres no sign that the broader recovery is losing steam.If anything, it seems to be gaining strength.Last week, the government reported that gross domestic product rose at a 3 percent annual rate in the third quarter, the second straight quarter of solid growth.Consumer spending, the dominant driver of economic growth in recent years, has stayed strong.But consumers are no longer alone in driving the economy forward.Stronger global growth has led to higher demand for American goods and services in recent months, aiding the manufacturing sector and boosting exports.Its finally feeling like the economy is starting to fire on multiple cylinders rather than relying solely on consumers, Mr. Ryan said.The strong economic data is part of what will most likely give the Federal Reserve the confidence to raise interest rates at its December meeting.Even a weak jobs report, Mr. Ryan said, was unlikely to lead the Fed to hold off on a rate increase.
Russia Investigation Has Tech Giants Shying From ‘Social’ Label:::::Tim Cook, Apples chief executive and an outspoken critic of the data-collection practices of his companys technological rivals, said Wednesday that he was concerned that social networks could be weaponized against the people who use them.The bigger issue is that some of these tools are used to divide people, to manipulate people, to get fake news to people in broad numbers, and so to influence their thinking, said Mr. Cook in an interview with NBC News.Frank Shaw, head of communications at Apples longtime rival, Microsoft, praised Mr. Cooks comments in a Twitter post, saying that Mr. Cook had framed the issue perfectly.Last year, Microsoft did purchase LinkedIn, a career-oriented social network, for $26.2 billion, but that site appears to have played little role in Russias influence efforts.With the emergence of Facebook, Twitter and their ilk over the last decade, social became a key Silicon Valley buzzword as companies crammed social network-like features into new products.Even Apple, despite the tens of billions of dollars it has earned making computing devices, has tried its hand at a social network focused on music.But as social media has become increasingly connected to unpleasant bickering, race-baiting and Russian propaganda, the must-have social label has become an albatross, said Joseph Bayer, an assistant professor at Ohio State University who focuses on social networks.The mere fact that a tech company is trying to minimize its overall influence is a telling signal of the moment were in, said Mr. Bayer.Google, which operates under the parent company Alphabet, can offer a distinction between its business and how social networks operate largely because its attempts to build a social network have not been very successful.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The company spent millions of dollars creating Google+, a social site built specifically to take on Facebook.The company tied Google+ into nearly every one of its properties, describing it as the social spine of Google in public statements at the time.There also were short-lived efforts like Google Buzz and Google Wave, or geographically specific sites like Orkut popular in Brazil but ignored elsewhere.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Google+ continues to exist but it is considered a disappointment.Google said it had found no political posts from state-linked actors on Google+.Google has often tried to fashion YouTube, its sprawling video service, into something more like a social network in hopes of keeping visitors interested.Last year, YouTube added what it called its Community product, essentially features intended to inspire users to interact more with one another.Google said accounts believed to have ties to the Kremlin had uploaded more than 1,100 videos to YouTube on racial, religious and political topics.Those videos were viewed 309,000 times.Many of those videos had only a small number of views, though they were frequently posted to other social media platforms, Richard Salgado, Googles senior counsel in law enforcement and information security, told a Senate subcommittee on Tuesday.Facebook, to offer a comparison, estimated that 150 million users of Facebook and its subsidiary, Instagram, had been exposed to 80,000 posts that came from the Russian influence campaign.Twitter said it had discovered more than 2,700 accounts that were linked to Russias Internet Research Agency, a company tied to the Kremlin, between September 2016 and November 2016.Those accounts posted roughly 131,000 tweets over that period.Twitter identified an additional 36,000 automated accounts that had posted 1.4 million election-related tweets linked to Russia over that same period.The tweets received about 288 million views.Now youre seeing all the attention from Congress go to Facebook and Twitter, because theyre the linchpin of the Russian information operations, said Ms. DiResta, the security researcher.In his testimony on Capitol Hill, Mr. Walker, Googles general counsel, sought to draw a bright line separating his companys services from social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter, which has been an occasional subject of Google acquisition rumors.Advertisement Continue reading the main story He also played down what Google knows about its users, a surprising conceit for a company that makes more money than anybody from selling advertising based on the online interests of users.Were somewhat differently positioned because were not primarily a social network, Mr. Walker said in response to a question regarding whether Google should notify users who are exposed to propaganda or divisive content from a foreign government.Many users are not logged in when they access content, so its difficult to know who sees what.Still, social media remains a compelling proposition for internet companies, even Google, because it keeps people coming back and creates a place for them to spend their time, said Jan Dawson, an analyst at the technology data firm Jackdaw Research.Take the example of Facebook.Despite having been assailed for weeks about the role it played in the 2016 election, Facebook reported another blockbuster financial quarter on Wednesday, shattering analysts expectations with more than $4.7 billion in profit in the third quarter.That was a 79 percent increase from the same period one year ago.If you gave Google the choice of having a social network, even with everything thats happened, said Mr. Dawson.I think it would still like to have one.
Iraqi Kurds’ Independence Vote Exposed Risks to Energy Strategy:::::Marginalized and brutally oppressed under Saddam, Kurdistan has sought a piece of the global oil action.The energy consultants Wood Mackenzie peg total potential oil and gas holdings in the region at about 13 billion barrels, and Kurdish officials have worked to attract investment from international oil companies.They offered advantageous revenue-sharing agreements to foreign firms, a stark contrast to the low-margin fixed-fee deals offered by Baghdad.To some global companies, the rewards were attractive.Kurdistan offered easily extractable oil in a politically friendly environment, without the huge costs and environmental risks of drilling in the Arctic or mining the tar sands in Canada.Energy giants like Chevron and Exxon Mobil shrugged off the threats of legal action by the Iraqi government and the displeasure of Washington by signing contracts with the Kurdish region at a time when oil prices were significantly higher than they are now.The energy companies wanted to see whether large troves of oil lurked below the hills of Kurdistan, as exist elsewhere in Iraq and in neighboring Iran.But the luster of those prospects has since faded.Drilling has not produced the large finds they had hoped for, leading companies to back off.Chevron said recently that it was suspending operations in Kurdistan.Total of France relinquished its exploration blocks last year, taking a $200 million write-down.Analysts say the poor exploration results, combined with world oil prices that have fallen off from their peak above $100 a barrel, raise doubts about the value of continuing to invest in Kurdistan.Photo It is not a play that is working for the majors, said Ian Thom, head of Middle East analysis at Wood Mackenzie.They have bigger fish to fry.Some of the smaller companies that originally opened up Kurdistan to exploratory drilling have also struggled.Genel Energy the London-listed company co-founded and led until 2015 by the former BP chief executive Tony Hayward has in the past two years sharply downgraded its estimates of the volumes in Taq Taq field, one of its two Kurdish mainstays.Output from the field has plummeted to about 14,000 barrels a day compared with 128,000 barrels a day in early 2015.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The region now finds itself exporting around 250,000 barrels of oil a day, just a quarter of what it optimistically estimated a few years ago, according to Ruba Husari, managing director of the consulting firm Iraq Insight.These disappointments were largely masked by the giant oil fields seized in recent years by Kurdish fighters, known as the pesh merga.As Iraq reeled from the Islamic States onslaught in 2014, the pesh merga took control of some of the energy producing areas near Kirkuk.Holding those fields allowed Kurdistan to increase exports to about 550,000 barrels a day, with roughly half of it coming from Kirkuk, according to Ms. Husari.Those advances, however, have largely been reversed.Beyond the short-term issues resulting from the independence vote, longer-term problems persist.For one, Massoud Barzani, Kurdistans longtime regional president, has said he will leave his post.That could create a power vacuum, threatening the regions domestic stability and complicating talks with the federal government and neighbors like Turkey.The landlocked region remains dependent on good relations with Ankara, and probably still with Baghdad, to move its oil and gas to market.The Kurds and the federal government have also never agreed on how to share oil revenue, or how to handle oil concessions in Kurdistan or even what territory constitutes the Kurdish region.With Kurdistans attraction fading as an energy bet, those concerns may loom larger in industry calculations.Such issues pose a threat to the Kurdish independence bid.The regional government is struggling to pay Civil Service salaries and manage its debts to oil companies.And Iraq could take legal action against buyers of crude from Kurdistan.Kurdistan has lost its revenue lifeline and its far from certain it can continue its independence push in these circumstances, said Bill Farren-Price, president of Petroleum Policy Intelligence, a market research firm.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.How far Baghdad will go is not yet clear.but it is not standing pat.About 15 percent of Iraqs oil sales are transported via a pipeline that runs through parts of Kurdistan.With some of the oil from the fields around Kirkuk shut in, the federal government is ramping up exports from its southern oil terminals.Baghdad also wants BP, which helped to develop the Kirkuk fields and had been providing technical assistance there until 2015, to assist in rejuvenating them.David Nicholas, a BP spokesman, acknowledged that the company met with Iraqs oil minister just after Iraq retook Kirkuk to discuss several issues, including the oil field and BPs potential support.BP might be able to coax more oil from the Kirkuk fields.If so, both Baghdad and the Kurds, who are constitutionally entitled to a slice of the nations oil revenue, might benefit.The Kirkuk field is an amazing resource, but has not been managed to its full potential, said Rob West, an analyst at the market research firm Redburn.Thats an incentive for Kurdistan and Baghdad to cooperate.
$1.5 Billion I.P.O. for Firm Controlled by Putin Ally Tied to Manafort:::::LONDON The Russian energy and aluminum company EN+, which is controlled by a member of President Vladimir V.

China Deflects Blame for Opioid Crisis as Trump Visit Nears:::::Mr. Trump has pointed to China as the drugs main source, saying it is either shipped into the United States or smuggled across the southern border by drug traffickers.Last year in the United States, about 64,000 people died of drug overdoses.A congressional commission in the United States has also found fault with China.China is the main supplier of fentanyl to the United States, Mexico, and Canada, the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission said in a report in February, citing law enforcement and drug investigators.The Chinese authorities place little emphasis on controlling its production and export, according to the report.Analysts say the countrys poorly regulated chemicals industry has helped fuel a booming trade in fentanyl.Under pressure from the United States, Beijing has banned the manufacture and sale of 23 variations of the synthetic drug, including four types this year, which a spokesman for the American Drug Enforcement Administration called a potential game-changer in February.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.China takes a strict stance on narcotics domestically, remembering how the country was ravaged by opium addiction in the 19th century, a factor in the Opium Wars.Chinese officials say that they are trying hard to combat fentanyl exporters but that doing so is a cat-and-mouse game, with drugmakers easily modifying their products to avoid detection.Mr. Wei criticized the Department of Justices public announcement last month of indictments against two major Chinese drug traffickers a case that both Beijing and Washington were working on.Last week the department highlighted the indictments against Yan Xiaobing and Jian Zhang, who are living in China, as a sign that the United States was making its fight against opioids a global one.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Saying it would hinder the investigation, Mr. Wei said, China regrets that the U.S. chose to unilaterally hold a news conference to announce the hunt for these fugitives.China has no extradition treaty with the United States, and Mr. Wei said a decision on extraditing the two men would be dependent on evidence that the Americans could provide or the Chinese could unearth.Saying that fentanyl abuse does not exist in China, Mr. Wei said the authorities had nonetheless responded forcefully to the crisis in the United States by banning more fentanyl analogues than those on a United Nations drug bodys list of controlled substances.He stressed that the Chinese government takes into full account the concerns of the international community, including the United States, and has continued to take legislative measures and actions to control the flow of illicit drugs.Once China controls a substance, it has a dramatic effect on the United States in terms of lives saved, Lance Ho, the Beijing-based country attach for the Drug Enforcement Administration, said at the news conference.
Sina, an Internet Pioneer in China, Wards Off U.S. Activist:::::More than three-quarters of investors voted to keep Yichen Zhang, a board member who was seeking re-election, Sina said in a statement.Charles Chao, Sinas chairman and chief executive, said he was grateful for shareholders support, input and participation and pleased that shareholders recognize the transformative growth and the unique value of the company.Still, Robert H. Lynch Jr., a partner at Aristeia, said shareholders have sent a strong message to the company that change is needed and that the status quo is unsustainable and unacceptable.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.The proxy fight came to an end on Friday afternoon, after a group of about 20 shareholders and company executives gathered in a conference room on the 42nd floor of a high-rise in Hong Kong.During the 25-minute meeting, a representative for Aristeia was given the opportunity to make a statement, according to two people who were present but who asked not to be named because they were not authorized to speak publicly.Sina which controls Weibo, one of Chinas biggest social media platforms seemed an unlikely target for an activist campaign.It has seen its share price soar over the past year as investors piled into technology stocks hoping to get a piece of Chinas internet growth.But the New York-traded internet company found itself in the cross hairs of Aristeia earlier this year when the shareholder accused Sina of failing to hold itself to the standards expected of U.S.-listed public company boards.Aristeia pushed Sina to consider a sale or merger of Sina or Weibo.Sinas operations include online entertainment and news.But its most valuable asset is a 46 percent controlling stake in Weibo, which is listed separately.The separate listing helped to trigger the proxy fight.Even as Sinas shares jumped by nearly three-quarters this year, Weibos shares have more than doubled.Weibo is now more than twice as valuable as Sina.The campaign was seen as a rare test of the power that American shareholders have in Chinese companies that are listed in the United States.It also touched a nerve for some investors who have complained about fewer shareholder rights in Chinese companies that are incorporated in business-friendly countries like the Cayman Islands.These investors have expressed frustration that some companies appear to be managed for the sole benefit of top executives.The bottom line is that Sinas poor corporate governance, lack of substantive engagement with its shareholders and substantial valuation discount need to be addressed, Mr. Lynch said, adding that Aristeia would continue to pursue all avenues to further the goals of maximizing shareholder value and enhancing corporate governance.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Responding to this criticism, Mr. Chao said on Friday, We will continue engaging constructively with our shareholders toward our common goal of long-term value creation.
A Tax Cut That Lifts the Economy? Opinions Are Split:::::Its hard to see the stimulative benefit on the economy, said Lawrence H. Summers, a Treasury secretary under President Bill Clinton.Most of the benefits as best I can tell will go to wealthy people.The idea that youre going to get a huge spur to growth is delusional.Such dismissiveness failed to deter fans of the twin pillars of the House bill: lowering the top nominal tax rate on corporations to 20 percent from 35 percent, and changing the way global profits are taxed.This will make the United States a better place to invest and a better place to be headquartered in, said Mihir A. Desai, an economist at Harvard Business School who has at times complained about the White Houses economic claims.Under the current system, multinational corporations have been shopping around the globe for countries with low tax rates where they can locate their profits and sometimes their operations.Those global profits are taxed by the United States, but only after they are booked at home.The result is that companies warehouse trillions of dollars offshore, indefinitely postponing the payment of United States taxes.Tax rates dont single-handedly drive investment decisions, and even now deductions and tax credits often shove the rate paid by corporations far below the 35 percent maximum.Still, many economists argue that matching or undercutting the top rate in other advanced industrialized countries particularly in Western Europe should encourage investment and productivity.Slashing the rate to 20 percent is a pretty dramatic change in the attractiveness of the United States relative to other countries, said Alan Viard, a tax specialist at the conservative American Enterprise Institute.Companies were noncommittal on how the plan might actually change their tax practices like those of Corning, the glass and ceramics manufacturer, which had $3.2 billion of cash and cash equivalents outside the country on March 31.Given the complexity of our U.S. taxation system, a spokesman said Thursday, the devil will lie in the details of any new legislation.Follow the Money The tax code has rewarded companies for warehousing profits abroad.These 30 companies

abroad.Most other nations have embraced some version of this approach, known as a territorial system.Advertisement Continue reading the main story But economists are split on whether that will reduce or worsen global tax avoidance.The bill proposes a global minimum tax of 10 percent to ensure that companies will have to pay something no matter where they have their headquarters.If they pay a lower rate in a foreign country, they would have to remit the difference to the United States.What could bite even harder is a proposal to tack a 20 percent excise tax on transactions between multinationals and their foreign affiliates to deter them from stripping profits out of the United States tax base.No safeguards are foolproof, supporters concede, but they argue thats the price of admission.The reality is, base-erosion rules will always be messy and imperfect, said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a conservative economist and a former director of the Congressional Budget Office.If you want a territorial

tax code, it also creates new ones.Congress has, in effect, set aside $1.5 trillion over the next 10 years to pay for revisions to the tax code, but to keep the cost of the plan to that limit, the Republican leadership is relying on financing gimmicks to phase in some provisions, or put time limits on others.A proposal that allows companies to immediately deduct business expenses rather than stretching them over a number of years potentially has the most impact on smaller companies that need money to build up or expand their business.Indeed a hefty chunk of the administrations growth estimates is based on the extra investing it is supposed to cause.But the proposal has a five-year time limit.If expensing goes away at the end of 2022, they should not expect any permanent growth effect, said Mr. Viard of the American Enterprise Institute.For businesses, predictability about the tax code is as important as any specific alteration.And temporary measures that obscure the costs deter long-term investment.New low rates and breaks will not be sustainable over the long term if they do not provide enough money to run the government.If they want to claim credit for the growth effect, Mr. Viard said, then they have to claim responsibility for the revenue loss.All would-be tax reformers juggle varying goals.They want to entice domestic and foreign companies to invest in the United States, which should, in turn, produce more jobs and stockholder returns.Advertisement Continue reading the main story They want to create a system that is widely judged as fair.And they need to collect enough revenue to keep the lights on.That includes having the money to cover Social Security payments, antiterrorism measures and disaster relief, as well as maintaining or upgrading the

shrift.The corporate rate cuts are a windfall immediately for stockholders, and not workers, said Steven M. Rosenthal, a tax lawyer and senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center.And because 35 percent of United States stocks are foreign-owned, he calculated that $70 billion a year of the tax benefits would go to people in other countries.As for working people, he labeled the supposed benefits a sideshow because they come so far down the road and are so speculative.As economists can attest, American competitiveness can be an elusive concept.Business folks wont describe it like this, but I think the best way to describe what it means to be more competitive is to describe it in terms of increasing the standard of living of the American people, said Michael J. Graetz, a professor of tax law at Columbia Law School.If it doesnt do that, then why do we care?
India’s Top Payments App Adds Chatting, Challenging WhatsApp:::::Paytm was founded in 2010 as a simple app for paying mobile phone bills.It has grown exponentially since Prime Minister Narendra Modi shocked India last November with an edict declaring all large bank notes invalid.That so-called demonetization forced Indians to exchange their cash for new bank notes, a tortuous process that prompted many people to look for digital alternatives to pay bills and buy daily necessities.With nearly $2 billion in financing from Alibaba, Chinas leading e-commerce company, and SoftBank, the Japanese investment giant, Paytm jumped in.It marketed itself to small merchants and consumers as an easy way to make all sorts of payments with a few taps on a smartphone.The company now offers a wide range of products, from gold by the gram to airline and movie tickets, and it said 100 million Indians visited its service at least once a month.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Interested in All Things Tech?The Bits newsletter will keep you updated on the latest from Silicon Valley and the technology industry.WhatsApp, which claims more than 200 million monthly active users in India and 1.3 billion worldwide, has eyed business services and person-to-person payments as a potential way to generate revenue from what has been a free service.Facebook paid $22 billion in cash and stock for WhatsApp in 2014.The messaging service has already begun experimenting with verified business accounts in India, which companies use to communicate with customers.The payments feature will let Indian users send immediate payments to one another via a chat message.Neeraj Arora, head of business at WhatsApp, said in an October interview that his team was studying opportunities created by Indias demonetization and the governments broader campaign to push more business and services online.They are trying to digitize every part of society, said Mr. Arora, who also sits on the board of Paytm.We play right in the middle of it.Its natural for us to think about improving the experience.WhatsApps overall popularity could give its new payments service a leg up, but Mr. Abbot said it would also raise awareness for all digital payment services, including Paytm.Advertisement Continue reading the main story WhatsApp, like another new service from Google, Tez, will probably be limited to transferring funds from one persons bank account to anothers because of complex Indian banking regulations.Paytm has cast itself as a broader financial player, handling payments made by credit and debit cards, the governments electronic transfer system, and digital wallets.A Paytm banking affiliate is exploring how to offer loans too small to interest a normal bank, with creditworthiness assessed by examining a borrowers transactions on the service.And a Paytm digital mall is selling physical products.Messaging is just Paytms latest brand extension.Mr. Abbot said other plans for the chat service included a personalized news feed of special offers based on each users history in the app.Eventually it might become the main screen for Paytm, he said.Paytm is at heart a payments company.
Why It’s Too Soon to Predict What the Tax Changes Will Mean for You:::::Even if it passes, the final bill will be different.The Senate will offer its own legislation, and then the haggling will begin in earnest.The debate over deducting state and local taxes for individual taxpayers is almost certainly not over, as lawmakers from high-tax states will put up more of a fight.As of now, those deductions would disappear, though you would still get to deduct up to $10,000 in property taxes.And any changes that affect the bills overall math will require countervailing alterations elsewhere.Sacred cows are hard to slay.A hearty congratulations to the Save Our Savings coalition, a financial services industry lobbying group that worked to keep the tax benefits for retirement savings (and the ever-increasing balances in members accounts) as they are.Despite all the chatter about reducing the amount you could put in 401(k) accounts and other workplace savings plans before paying income taxes, no lowered cap emerged after all.Thats not surprising when you consider recent history.When President Barack Obama tried to place some limits on 529 college savings accounts, the blowback was so severe that he backed down within days.It turns out that Americans dont like to be punished for doing the right thing, financially, for themselves and their families.Hence the lowered cap on the mortgage interest deduction that also emerged Thursday, which should still encourage some people to buy real estate and use mortgage payments as a forced savings vehicle.The deduction would remain intact for current homeowners.For people buying in the future (which the bill defines as Nov. 2, 2017, or later), mortgage interest deductions would be allowed only on loans up to $500,000, down from the current cap of $1 million.Moreover, only debt from primary residences would count toward that limit, and you could not include any interest from home equity loans or lines of credit that you took out on that new home.But how hard will the real estate sales and home builder lobbies push back, and will they succeed?Our own behavior.Advertisement Continue reading the main story While we cannot be sure exactly how much more or less money we might all have without redoing our taxes once a bill, if any, becomes law, it would be a mistake to try to predict how well all react once we do know.In the wake of the last big tax reform effort in 1986, the rules changed on the deductibility of credit-card interest.That didnt keep card companies from devising all sorts of clever ways to induce people to spend and borrow much, much more.Photo Outside actors may have an impact on us, too.If state and local taxes become more expensive because of federal changes in their deductibility, state legislatures might then come under pressure to lower taxes.Our own changing lives.The biggest question mark for any of us comes from the unknowable future.Will we change jobs?Earn more?Have kids?Help our adult children?Retire early because of our own choice, or choices made by employers who no longer want us around?These things matter so much more than any tax rules.Depending on how our lives change, any tax changes may help or hurt.Changing tax rates over time.When all of Washington is occupied with todays proposed tax changes, its easy to forget that weve been here before and will be here again.Nearly every recent president has taken his shot at revising the system.And while the proposals here are potentially farther reaching, future politicians will make changes, too.In the back of my mind, I dont anticipate taxes staying low for a long period of time, said Julie Welch, an accountant and financial planner in Leawood, Kan. After all, were adding to the national debt here in the hopes of stoking growth.If that doesnt work, it wont change the fact that Medicare and Medicaid will cost ever more money as the population ages.Something will have to give, and because Medicare is one of the most sacred cows of all, were more likely to raise taxes again than to make older people pay more for their health care.Changing tax rules over time.Our retirement accounts seem safe for now, though it wouldnt be surprising to see the tax rules for 401(k)s and similar workplace savings accounts back on the table next week or next year.Advertisement Continue reading the main story In the meantime, consider the possibilities.If more people keep saving in Roth retirement accounts of various sorts, where you dont get a tax break when you put aside the money but it comes out free of income taxes after decades of appreciation, the balances will one day dwarf what sits in them today.And as they grow, legislators will be tempted to cap their size or to tax withdrawals.This possibility has to be on the mind of any prudent financial planner working with younger clients who have the most time to save, given how often wholesale changes to Roth accounts have already come under consideration.Its disconcerting to me that planning based on the promise of certain rules and taxation levels is actually being second-guessed after clients had put money into that vehicle, said Katie Brewer, a financial planner in Garland, Tex., whose clients tend to be in their late 30s.But that is just how things are going to go with this and so many other tax rules, whether 529 accounts or mortgage interest.So what is there to do in the absence of any certainty?Avoid rash or unnecessary decisions, and remember that maximizing flexibility is always the best strategy.Be wary of home purchases that depend on tax laws staying the same.Invest in enrichment for your kids for the pure fun and joy of learning, but also so they might someday earn scholarships in case your savings plan doesnt work out perfectly.And when it comes to retirement, this is an excellent moment to be reacquainting ourselves with what the accountants and financial planners refer to as tax diversification.In the same way that its smart to have a mix of investments that might perform differently at different times, its best to divide money among various tax-favored accounts.If you have money in a 401(k) or I.R.A., a Roth account and a normal taxable brokerage account (where youd tally up your long-term capital gains when you withdraw money, under an entirely different set of tax rules), you should have at least some choices come retirement time.At that point, you can make the withdrawal from the account that serves your tax goals at that moment.There is one thing we do know for sure in all of this tax talk: Reformers come, and reformers go.We, however, must persist for six or seven decades of adult living and financial planning, and the only way to do that while staying sane is to give ourselves as much room to maneuver as possible.
The Tax Bill’s Fine Print: Tuition, Medical Expenses and Alimony:::::Fires, Floods and Thieves House burned down?Storm destroyed it?Or did a burglar steal many valuable items?You can deduct your losses, at least for now.If the bill passes, you will generally not be able to do this anymore starting in 2018, though future one-off legislation for big natural disasters might provide one-time relief.Selling Your Home The bill would make it harder for people who bought and flipped homes for a profit to qualify for tax breaks, starting next year.Currently, a married couple filing their taxes jointly can exclude up to $500,000 in capital gains on the sale of a home, as long as theyve used it as a primary residence for two of the past five years.Under the proposed bill, however, taxpayers would need to have lived in the home for five out of the previous eight years and the tax break could be used only once every five years, down from once every two years.The tax break would begin to phase out for taxpayers whose adjusted gross income exceeded $250,000 (or $500,000 for joint filers).Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Employer-Paid Tuition At the moment, when employers pay your tuition for continuing education, the amount they pay is not taxable income for you as long as it meets certain conditions and amounts to no more than $5,250 per year.If the tax bill passes as written, these tuition payments will count as taxable income starting in 2018.Moving Expenses Relocating for a new job?Moving costs would no longer be a deductible expense in 2018.As it stands, taxpayers can deduct moving expenses even if they do not itemize their tax returns as long as the new workplace is at least 50 miles farther from the old home than the old job location was from the old home.(If you had no workplace, the new job must be at least 50 miles from your old home.)Medical Expenses For the moment, you can deduct out-of-pocket medical expenses that exceed 10 percent of your adjusted gross income (but not the expenses that amount to the first 10 percent).This is particularly useful for elderly people and others with lower incomes who need regular assistance and care.The tax bill would do away with the deduction in 2018.Adoption Families seeking to adopt a child would lose on two fronts if the bill became law.First, if an employer provides financial assistance to a worker adopting a child, that money would be taxed as income starting next year.In 2017, when an employer pays for up to $13,570 in qualified adoption expenses for an employee, the employee pays no taxes on that assistance.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The bill would also repeal the baseline adoption credit, which generally provides taxpayers with a credit of up to $13,570 per eligible child in 2017.Under the current rules, the credit would be phased out for taxpayers with adjusted gross income between $203,540 and $243,540.Alimony Payments Divorce would become a bit more burdensome for the ex-spouse who paid alimony because it would no longer be a deductible expense.But the party receiving the payments would no longer need to pay tax on the income received.The change would take effect for divorce and separation agreements (and any changes to current agreements) executed after 2017.Tax Preparation Taxpayers who itemize their returns would no longer be able to deduct the amount that their tax preparation specialist billed them or any similar expenses.Since the tax bill aims to reduce the number of taxpayers who itemize, in theory fewer people should require professional tax help (with the exception of wealthier people, who can afford to lose this break).Electric Cars Buyers of qualifying plug-in electric vehicles, like the Chevrolet Bolt or Volt and Teslas cars, can sometimes get a tax credit for up to $7,500.The bill would do away with this credit.
Trump Announces Jerome Powell as New Fed Chairman:::::The nominee offered little hint of his thinking during brief remarks in the Rose Garden.He said the nations economy has made substantial progress toward full recovery since the financial crisis and that banks are in far better shape.I will continue to work with my colleagues to ensure that the Federal Reserve remains vigilant and prepared to respond to changes in markets and evolving risks, he said.Mr. Powell is a Republican with strong roots in the partys establishment and in the financial industry, a lawyer by training and investment banker by trade.As Fed chair, a position some consider the second most powerful post in government, he would be the voice of an institution that is charged with keeping the economy on track by adjusting interest rates that influence the decisions of millions of Americans.In replacing Ms. Yellen, Mr. Trump is breaking with precedent.The previous three Fed chairs were reappointed, in each case by a president of the opposite political party.Mr. Trump said that he respected Ms. Yellen and on Thursday called her a wonderful woman who has done a terrific job.In a statement, Ms. Yellen congratulated her chosen successor and said she was confident in his deep commitment to carrying out the vital public mission of the Federal Reserve.The Fed under Ms. Yellens leadership has sharply reduced unemployment while maintaining control of inflation, coming as close to achieving its congressional mandate as at any time in its history.Her prospects to be renominated momentarily lifted making when the president agreed to meet with her on Oct. 19 at the urging of Gary D. Cohn, Mr. Trumps national economics adviser who himself was once a top candidate.Mr. Trump came away genuinely impressed with Ms. Yellen, according to a person briefed on the process, but a speech she gave in Jackson Hole, Wyo., in favor of financial regulation damaged her chances given the White House agenda of cutting red tape and freeing up financial firms.Advertisement Continue reading the main story White House officials said Mr. Trump was impressed with Mr. Powells combination of government and private sector experience.Ultimately, Mr. Trump, who as a real estate developer benefited from cheap credit, came down for Mr. Powell, whom he hopes will deliver lower interest rates.The position requires Senate confirmation, but Mr. Powell is likely to attract broad support from the Republican majority.He won some Democratic votes when he was confirmed as a Fed governor in 2012, and when he was confirmed again in 2014.The Federal Reserve has embarked on a path of gradually raising its interest rate from ultralow levels meant to stimulate the economy after the financial crisis.The Fed is expected to raise its benchmark interest rate again in December, likely Ms. Yellens final act as chair.Under Mr. Powells leadership, the Fed will presumably continue on its projected path of raising its interest rate three more times next year, as well as continuing to pare back its massive balance sheet of Treasury notes and bonds.Mr. Powell remains a centrist voice in the Feds internal debates, arguing for the Fed to end its stimulus campaign at a slow and steady pace.Over the last year, that has placed him solidly among the majority led by Ms. Yellen.Photo Our view is Powell is the G.O.P.version of Yellen, with the added kicker of wanting to reduce regulation, said Tom Porcelli, chief United States economist at RBC Capital Markets.But some argue that there is more uncertainty surrounding Mr. Powells approach than for other recent Fed chairs.Lewis Alexander, chief United States economist at Nomura Securities, said it was unclear how aggressive Mr. Powell would be in responding to an economic slowdown.I dont think its right to think of Powell as a Yellen clone, Mr. Alexander said.In terms of the core issues of monetary policy, we just dont have much of a baseline for him.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Mr. Powell would be the first Fed chair in four decades who does not have a degree in economics meaning his opinions may not be as fully formed as some of his predecessors.He also lacks a body of academic work analysts could parse for his views.Ms. Yellens work on the labor market and former Fed chair Ben Bernankes focus on financial crises both gave insight into their leadership at the Fed, said Sarah Binder, a political scientist at George Washington University.But beyond Mr. Powells performance as a loyal lieutenant to Mr. Bernanke and Ms. Yellen, we dont know all that much about any existing priors Powell has about monetary policy, she said.Advertisement Continue reading the main story As a member of the Feds board of governors, Mr. Powell raised concerns in 2013 that the Fed was trying too hard to revive economic growth with its massive bond-buying program calling into question whether he would be as willing as Mr. Bernanke and Ms. Yellen to use such tools again.The Fed announced in September 2012 that it would launch a third round of bond buying, purchasing $85 billion a month in Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities until economic conditions improved to its satisfaction.The program was backed by Mr. Bernanke, then Fed chair, and Ms. Yellen, then the vice chairwoman, who argued the Fed had not done enough to reduce unemployment.A group of three Fed governors, including Mr. Powell, pressed Mr. Bernanke to clarify the Feds goals, establishing what Mr. Powell called an off-ramp for the program.Mr. Trump will have the opportunity to reshape the Fed further through appointments in the coming months, which could help consolidate or complicate Mr. Powells task of forging consensus.The president has three more open seats on the board of governors, and may have a fourth if Ms. Yellen decides to step down from her position on the board as she departs as chair.One addition may be John Taylor, a Stanford economist who is among the Feds most vocal critics, and who was a top choice for Fed chief along with Mr. Powell.Mr. Powell may diverge from his predecessor on financial regulation.In a June appearance before the Senate Banking Committee, Mr. Powell said that the Feds current rules showed opportunities for improvement, although he made clear that he did not fully embrace the Trump administrations plans for significant reductions in regulation, released a few weeks earlier.There are some ideas in the report that make sense, maybe not as expressed there, but it would enable us to reduce the cost of regulation without affecting safety and soundness, he said, adding, There are some ideas that I would not support.Mr. Powell has expressed support for legislation that would require financial regulators to apply cost-benefit analysis to proposed rules.He pushed back against proposals to allow large banks to borrow more of their funding, saying that requiring them to raise capital from investors had strengthened the financial system.Mr. Powell, 64, is a Washington native.He studied politics at Princeton, then earned a law degree from Georgetown and embarked on a career in investment banking.Advertisement Continue reading the main story In 1990, he returned to Washington to work for Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady and was named under secretary for finance.When Salomon Brothers was caught trying to manipulate the market in Treasuries, Mr. Powell spent an August weekend making phone calls from Cape Cod, arranging for the companys top managers to resign and for Warren Buffett, a major investor, to become chairman of the companys board.Under pressure to account for the shortcomings in regulation that had allowed Salomons misconduct, Mr. Powell told Congress, There is no question that it can be improved, and improve it we will.Mr. Powell joined the private equity firm Carlyle Group in 1997.Over the next eight years, he solidified his fortune.His 2016 financial disclosure form showed a net worth of as much as $55 million.In 2005, he left the firm to focus on public policy as a scholar at the Bipartisan Policy Center.He attracted the attention of the Obama

Brady, had been chairman of Dillon Read.Mr. Powell was responsible for policy on financial institutions and the Treasury debt market.After Bill Clinton took office in 1993, Mr. Powell joined Bankers Trust, but decided to leave a couple of years later after several clients suffered large losses as a result of derivative deals they did with the bank.In 1997, Mr. Powell became a partner at the Carlyle Group, the asset management firm, where he built his fortune; his 2016 financial disclosure form showed a net worth of as much as $55 million.In late 2011, President Barack Obama nominated him to fill an unexpired term on the Feds Board of Governors, and the Senate confirmed him the following May.Two years later, he was renominated and sworn to a full term.Photo A Centrist, Behind-the-Scenes Voice at the Fed Mr. Powell, a Republican, is a centrist voice in the Feds internal debates, often raising his concerns in private conversation rather than in public speeches.He has voted for every policy decision since joining the Fed, including four interest rate increases, and supported the Feds decision to unwind the bond-buying program put in place during and after the 2008 financial crisis.In September 2012, when Ben S. Bernanke, the Fed chairman at the time, announced a third round of bond buying as part of that program, Mr. Powell pressed for a clarification of the Feds goals, establishing what Mr. Powell called an offramp for the program.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Powells recent comments on monetary policy are basically interchangeable with recent comments by Janet L.

Robert Mercer, Bannon Patron, Is Leaving Helm of $50 Billion Hedge Fund:::::Mr. Mercer, 71, sought in his letter to employees to distance himself from Mr. Bannon, who has gone back to running Breitbart News, the divisive media outlet and hub for nationalist and far-right activism.He said he was selling his investment in Breitbart to his daughters, who also are active in conservative politics.I have great respect for Mr. Bannon, and from time to time I do discuss politics with him, Mr. Mercer wrote.However, I make my own decisions with respect to whom I support politically.Those decisions do not always align with Mr. Bannons.His departure is not likely to fundamentally alter either Renaissances status as one of the most profitable hedge funds or Mr. Mercers status as one of the most sought-after financiers in the conservative ecosystem.In fact, the firm took on $1 billion of new funds in the past month.But it illustrates how the worlds of politics and business are colliding in the Donald Trump era.President Trump has tried to surround himself with corporate executives, but the presidents actions and rhetoric have left some of these leaders facing angry customers and employees.A number of presidential advisory councils, for example, disbanded this summer as chief executives resigned in protest over Mr. Trumps lukewarm denunciations of white supremacists.Mr. Mercer followed an unusual route to become arguably the most powerful person in the right-wing movement that thrust Mr. Trump into the White House.A shy computer coder and model-train aficionado, he spent years at I.B.M.before joining Renaissance in 1993.He helped build the hedge fund into one of the industrys most successful firms.Beyond donating to political campaigns, Mr. Mercer became a large financial backer of Cambridge Analytica, a voter-data firm that worked closely with the presidential campaign of Mr. Trump.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Lawmakers in Washington are scrutinizing Cambridge Analytica in connection with investigations into Russian meddling in the presidential election; the company has turned over documents to the House intelligence committee.Mr. Mercer and his daughter Rebekah were instrumental in Breitbarts rise into a powerful force in conservative politics.That backing has become controversial, partly because of the sites connections to white nationalists.One especially inflammatory Breitbart personality, Milo Yiannopoulos, reportedly has received financial support from the Mercers.Mr. Mercer on Thursday distanced himself from Breitbart, Mr. Bannon and Mr. Yiannopoulos, who resigned from Breitbart earlier this year.Actions of and statements by Mr. Yiannopoulos have caused pain and divisiveness undermining the open and productive discourse that I had hoped to facilitate, Mr. Mercer wrote.I was mistaken to have supported him, and for several weeks have been in the process of severing all ties with him.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Mr. Yiannopoulos said in a statement: I am grateful for Bobs help in getting me this far in my career.I wish him and the family all the best.Activist groups recently have pressured university investment funds to pull their money from Renaissance.The college Democratic organization at Michigan State University, for example, recently began calling on the universitys endowment to withdraw its roughly $50 million investment.This week, students at the State University of New York at Stony Brook on Long Island voiced concern about donations to the university from Mr. Mercer and Renaissance.Mr. Randall of the Baltimore retirement fund compared the decision to redeem money from Renaissance to the decision of whether to invest in a tobacco company or gun manufacturer.He said Renaissance is one of the funds best performing investments.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Not all investors were bothered by the controversy surrounding Mr. Mercer.The endowment for Michigan State has no plans to withdraw its money despite the campus protests, said Jason Cody, a university spokesman.We hire investment managers based on their long-term expected performance and fit for the overall portfolio, Mr. Cody said.We do not consider the personal political opinions and private activities of individual employees when making decisions.Steve Yoakum, executive director for Public School Retirement System of Missouri, another Renaissance investor, said the furor over Mr. Mercer was a manufactured issue.He said performance trumped anything else.Renaissance has made its investors lots of money.Its three main funds that are open to outside investors are up more than 10 percent through October this year.So far this year, the hedge fund has attracted about $10 billion in new assets.The combination of Renaissances consistently strong performances, its secretive nature and its leaders idiosyncratic personalities have created an aura of mystique around the firm.Mr. Mercers pivotal and prominent support for Mr. Trump shoved Renaissance into the spotlight.For example Mr. Mercer hosts a well-known holiday costume party at his Long Island estate.Last year, the president-elect and a coterie of his top advisers were among the guests.Mercer is now such a controversial figure, that must cause all kinds of difficulties for the company, said Nick Patterson, a computational biologist at the Broad Institute, who hired Mr. Mercer at Renaissance.He said Mr. Mercers prominence could make it harder for Renaissance to hire the best people.Even as he steps down from Renaissance, Mr. Mercer is likely to accelerate his political giving in the future, according to people with knowledge of Mr. Mercers thinking who were not authorized to speak publicly.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Without a day-to-day role in Renaissance management, these people said, Mr. Mercer would have more freedom and time to devote to his philanthropy and other activities, including an effort to recruit and support conservative candidates who want to replace the current Republican leadership in Congress.Mr. Mercers departure could stem investor defections from Renaissance.Mr. Randall said that with Mr. Mercer leaving, the Baltimore pension fund could reconsider its request to withdraw the $33 million.My professional position is I dont think this will be the last discussion concerning Renaissance, he said.
Metaphor for G.E.’s Ills: A Corporate Jet With No Passengers:::::Mr. Immelt told The Journal he wasnt aware of the practice and wouldnt have allowed it.When I inquired about it this week, he acknowledged, through a spokesman, that he first became aware that it was happening in 2014, after a whistle-blower complained about it and the boards audit committee ordered it stopped.He said he didnt know the practice had continued after that.Mr. Immelt elaborated in a letter he sent this week to John J. Brennan, the chairman and chief executive of Vanguard and currently G.E.s lead director.A copy of the letter was made available to The New York Times.Given my responsibilities as C.E.O.of a 300,000-employee global company, I just did not have time to personally direct the day-to-day operations of the corporate air team, Mr. Immelt wrote.I had every right to expect that it was professionally run.Other than to say Hello, I never spoke to the leader of corporate air in 16 years.He continued: They decided to deploy a backup plane when I traveled on complicated, multi-stop trips or when we were traveling to areas with security concerns.This practice was brought to my attention and stopped three years ago.Let me reiterate, when I was in China or Pakistan or Turkey or Angola, the administration of our planes was never something I thought about, talked about or considered in any way.A G.E.spokeswoman told The Journal that the use of the chase plane had drawn understandable criticism but did not fairly reflect Mr. Immelts dedicated service over 30 years.(In his letter, Mr. Immelt said he worked 100-hour weeks with more than 60 percent of my time on the road.)Mr. Davis of Melius Research sharply disagreed, saying Mr. Immelt was the imperial C.E.O.Not even heads of state get that kind of treatment, Mr. Davis said.You hear about this and you have to wonder what else they were spending money on.You really you have to question the financial oversight and controls and internal audit.You have to question the entire organization.Charles Elson, a professor and director of the John L. Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware, agreed.This isnt a minor issue, he said.This may be why G.E.is in such trouble these days.Its representative of an old-style C.E.O.culture that hasnt helped G.E.Professor Elson added, My students were discussing this in class today.Advertisement Continue reading the main story That G.E.is in trouble is beyond question.The companys shares have taken a beating as the impact of Mr. Immelts long tenure as C.E.O.have come into sharper focus since G.E.announced in June that he would depart as chief executive.Even with the stock market in record territory, G.E.shares have dropped more than 36 percent this year, earning the company the dubious distinction of having the worst-performing stock in the Dow Jones industrial average.This week G.E.shares were barely trading above $20.The chase-plane affair, and the companys handling of it, has hardly inspired investor confidence.G.E.was a great American company and now its reputation is tarnished and the brand is damaged, Mr. Davis said.It also hasnt helped, Professor Elson said, that G.E.s explanations have only given rise to more questions, starting with how much the practice cost shareholders.Photo Start with the ostensible reason for the second plane: to provide additional security and to have a spare in case of a breakdown, according to G.E.No one I spoke to in the field of corporate security said that made any sense, especially in the instance when the second plane stayed in Anchorage while Mr. Immelt traveled to Asia.There are plenty of planes there that could be chartered in case of emergency, not to mention commercial flights with first-class cabins and ample security.Robert Strang, a corporate security expert and the chief executive of the Investigative Management Group, told me he has been conducting security audits for chief executives for 29 years and could think of no similar example.If a destination is so dangerous that it requires a backup plane, then a C.E.O.shouldnt be going in the first place, he said.And its not as if Mr. Immelt was traveling to war-torn Syria or Afghanistan.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Mr. Strang said that dispatching a second plane in case of mechanical breakdown would seem excessive, given that airplanes in other places could be used in case of emergency.I dont understand the logic of a second airplane, he said.G.E.has acknowledged that the use of a chase plane was the subject of a whistle-blower complaint that led to a board-level review and directive to end the practice in 2014.The companys corporate-travel department, which oversaw the two-plane arrangement, reported to John Lynch, the human resources leader, until 2013, when Susan Peters succeeded him.G.E.said that Ms. Peters and the general counsel at the time, Brackett Denniston, participated in the audit committee review that resulted in the directive to stop using the chase plane.A G.E.spokeswoman said that Ms. Peters was not available for comment.Mr. Denniston declined to comment, and Mr. Lynch could not be reached for comment.Advertisement Continue reading the main story G.E.has declined to say, who, exactly, in the corporate-travel department came up with the chase-plane idea or acted on it; who kept it going after the audit committee ordered it stopped; or whether anyone was disciplined as a consequence.Mr. Immelt wrote in his letter: I am aware, that in the course of the last 10 years, we have had four managers of corporate air.For a time, it was clear that G.E.had a difficult time keeping its planes flying, even though the company is a supplier of jet engines to the worlds major plane manufacturers.That Mr. Immelt didnt know about the use of the chase plane, and failed to stop it after he learned about it, raises more questions and concerns, Professor Elson said.If something of that significance wasnt brought to his attention, then thats a serious reporting and management failure, he said.(Professor Elson said he was a longtime G.E.shareholder.)A G.E.spokeswoman, Jennifer Erickson, declined to comment beyond the companys previous statements.The companys new chief executive, John L. Flannery, has grounded the planes and plans to sell G.E.s corporate fleet to cut costs (company executives will now fly on commercial flights or charter jets).He is under mounting pressure to restore investor confidence and stop the stock slide.An activist investor, Nelson Peltzs Trian Fund Management, got a seat on G.E.s board last month.Investors are especially concerned about the fate of the companys rich dividend; the stock currently yields well over 4 percent.G.E.is scheduled to hold an investor conference on Nov. 13, where Mr. Flannery is expected to unveil the results of a strategic review, which includes his restructuring plans and revised financial targets.That may be his best chance to turn a new leaf on Mr. Immelts troubled tenure.But until G.E.makes a clean breast of the chase jet affair, Mr. Flannery may be dogged by the many still-unanswered questions about it.Flannery is saying the right things, Mr. Davis said.But, he added, there needs to be a formal investigation and full disclosure.After so many years covering industrial companies, he said, I thought Id seen it all, until this.Millions of dollars were recklessly wasted, and shareholders deserve an accounting and assurance this wont happen again.

Clarifying a Butter Shortage:::::But there was enough for a good story, the kind that uses news from abroad to inform our readers about a foreign countrys specific cultural traits here, Frances extraordinary fondness for butter.According to the figures and statistics I found, it seemed France consumed more butter per person than any other country in the world.Still, awareness of the shortages was uneven across France, depending on how closely one followed the news or whether ones local supermarket was hit.My wife, who is French, mentioned that my in-laws, still unaware of the growing worries about butter scarcity, had been puzzled by her grandfathers insistence that they stock up.Of course, those in the industry dairy farmers, butter producers, pastry makers had been tracking the rising butter prices and growing tensions between producers and retailers for months.They knew what was coming, and told me so when I started making calls.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Annabelle Cantin, the head of marketing and communications at La Trinitaine, a food company in Brittany that makes buttery treats, told me that consumers and the media were only noticing now because of empty shelves in supermarkets.From a professional standpoint, she said, it has been visible for much longer.The Federation of Bakery Companies, another industry organization I reached out to, had even put out a statement in May, warning that many companies will be struggling in the coming months, amidst relative indifference.I also recruited the help of our intern in the Paris bureau, Eloise Stark, who went to bakeries and supermarkets in Paris to see what shoppers and pastry makers had to say.One bakery told her that it had slightly increased prices, but only on the more fancy butter-based pastries, not on the sacrosanct croissant.To get a better understanding of butters place in French culture and cooking, I reached out to Jean-Robert Pitte, a geographer and gastronomy specialist at the Sorbonne.He explained that France had long been divided in half, between a butter-using north and an olive oil-consuming south.I later got confirmation from an impeccable source: my 89-year-old French grandmother, a Parisian whose family is originally from northern France but who married a southerner from the Hautes-Alpes region, where olive oil is more prominent.In my family, we bought groundnut oil for salads, but all the cooking was done with butter, she said on the phone.I had reached her in the midst of her grocery shopping (she had got her hands on some butter, but not the renowned Beurre dIsigny that she usually bought).My grandmother also confirmed that there was something of a butter craze after the Second World War, which Professor Pitte had mentioned in our interview.At the beginning of the war we didnt have ration cards yet and I had to wait in line for two hours just to get an eighth of butter, she said, recalling how her father and uncle would travel to Normandy to get some directly from dairy farmers.Because it was illegal, they had pockets made on the insides of their jackets and hid the butter in there.Advertisement Continue reading the main story So you can bet that after the war, people splurged, she said, laughing.Years ago, my wife introduced me to semi-salted butter, and Ive never looked back.Its simple and delicious when spread on a fresh baguette.Regular butter now tastes, well, boring.Luckily, we havent run out ourselves.The last time I went shopping at the supermarket, there was some butter left on the shelves, right next to the margarine and other substitutes that previous shoppers had spurned.Im still monitoring the situation, and it is unclear how long the shortages will linger.Lets hope they subside, because the holiday season in France yule logs for Christmas, King cakes in January, crepes in February is when the butter really gets going.
Six Myths About Choosing a College Major:::::Take the median lifetime earnings of business majors, the most popular undergraduate degree.The typical graduate earns $2.86 million over a lifetime.When you put business graduates side by side with those who graduated with what are considered low-paying majors, youll see that those who are slightly above the median salary in their fields are not that far behind the business grads.For example, an English major in the 60th percentile makes $2.76 million in a lifetime, a major in psychology $2.57 million and a history major $2.64 million.Myth 2: Women want to have it all.Women are now the clear majority on college campuses, making up 56 percent of students enrolled this fall.They are also more likely than men to graduate.But when it comes to selecting a major, what women choose tends to segregate them into lower paying fields, such as education and social services, according to a report that Georgetown Universitys Center on Education and the Workforce will publish later this year.Just look at some of the highest paying fields and the proportion of women who major in them: business economics (31 percent), chemical engineering (28 percent), computer science (20 percent), electrical engineering (10 percent), mechanical engineering (8 percent).Women cant win even as they dominate at every level of higher education, said Anthony P. Carnevale, director of the Georgetown center.Dr. Carnevale wouldnt speculate as to why women make their choices.But he notes that if the proportion of women in fields where men dominate increased by just 10 percent, the gender pay gap would narrow considerably: from 78 cents paid to women for every dollar men receive to 90 cents for every dollar men receive.Myth 3: Choice of major matters more than choice of college.Not so.In seven states Arkansas, Colorado, Minnesota, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia and Washington students can search public databases for early earnings of graduates of institutions within the state.And those databases show that students who graduate from more selective schools tend to make more money.After all, the better the college, the better the professional network opportunities, through alumni, parents of classmates and eventually classmates themselves.These undergraduates are more able to pursue majors in lower paying fields because their networks help them land good jobs.Arts, humanities and social science majors are more prevalent on elite campuses than at second-tier colleges, where students tend to pick vocational majors like business, education and health.In all, more than half of students at less selective schools major in career-focused subjects; at elite schools, less than a quarter do, according to an analysis by the website FiveThirtyEight of the 78 most selective schools in Barrons rankings, compared with 1,800 less selective schools.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Students at selective colleges are allowed to explore their intellectual curiosity as undergraduates because they will get their job training in graduate school or have access to a network that gets them top jobs, regardless of their undergraduate major, Dr. Carnevale said.They are also more likely to have two majors than students at second-tier colleges, who tend to be more financially needy and have to work, affording less time to double major.One tip: Complementary majors with overlapping requirements are easier to juggle, but two unrelated majors probably yield bigger gains in the job market, said Richard N. Pitt, an associate professor of sociology at Vanderbilt University who has studied the rise of the double major.It increases your breadth of knowledge, he said.Myth 4: Liberal arts majors are unemployable.The liberal arts is a favorite target of politicians, with the latest salvo coming from the governor of Kentucky, Matt Bevin.If youre studying interpretive dance, God bless you, but theres not a lot of jobs right now in America looking for people with that as a skill set, Governor Bevin said in a speech in September.Interpretive dance may not be in demand, but the competencies that liberal arts majors emphasize writing, synthesis, problem solving are sought after by employers.A 2017 study by David J. Deming, an associate professor of education and economics at Harvard, found jobs requiring both the so-called soft skills and thinking skills have seen the largest growth in employment and pay in the last three decades.One knock on the liberal arts is that its difficult to find a first job.But a study by Burning Glass Technologies, a Boston-based company that analyzes job-market trends, concluded that if liberal arts graduates gain proficiency in one of eight technical skills, such as social media or data analysis, their prospects of landing entry-level jobs increase substantially.The long-held belief by parents and students that liberal arts graduates are unemployable ignores the reality of the modern economy, where jobs require a mix of skills not easily packaged in a college major, said George Anders, author of You Can Do Anything: The Surprising Power of a Useless Liberal Arts Education.In his book, Mr. Anders profiles graduates with degrees in philosophy, sociology and linguistics in jobs as diverse as sales, finance and market research.Once C.E.O.s see liberal arts graduates in action, Mr. Anders said, they come aboard to the idea that they need more of them.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Myth 5: Its important to choose a major early.Why settle on a field of study before experiencing the smorgasbord college has to offer, be it study abroad, a club activity or a surprising elective?Of students who said they felt committed to their major when they arrived on campus, 20 percent had selected a new major by the end of their first year, according to a national survey by the University of California, Los Angeles.Changing majors can cost you a semester or two, especially if you switch to one unrelated to your first choice.To reduce that risk, several schools, including Arizona State University, Georgia State University and Lehman College in the Bronx, have created meta-majors, which group majors under a larger academic umbrella.We have moved away from trying to get students to choose their majors as they enter, said Timothy Renick, Georgia States vice provost and vice president for enrollment management and student success.Instead, all incoming students choose from one of seven meta-majors, representing large academic and work force fields, such as business, education and STEM.First semester, students gather in learning communities and register for a block of general-education courses within that meta-major.Programming is designed so that students get to know the differences between majors within the field.Students in our business meta-major get to understand the difference between finance, accounting, management and marketing so they can choose their major from an informed perspective, Dr. Renick said.They usually do by the end of their first year.Myth 6: You need a major.A handful of colleges, including Indiana University and Evergreen State College, offer the option to ignore the official list of majors and design a course of study.Will Shortz, the crossword puzzle editor for The Times, designed his at Indiana enigmatology.Majors are artificial and restrictive, said Christine Ortiz, a dean at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology on leave to design a new nonprofit university that will have no majors, and also no lectures or classrooms.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Majors result from the academic structure of the university, tied to the classic academic disciplines.There is no reason they need to be boxed up like that.They dont take into account emerging fields that cross disciplines.Majors tend to lag behind changes in the workplace.No wonder fewer than a third of college graduates work in jobs related to their majors.And picking one based on todays in-demand jobs is risky, said Dr. Webber of Temple, especially if the occupation is threatened by automation.I would argue against majoring in accounting, he said, or anything that a computer can be programmed to do.
As a Debt Deadline Looms for Venezuela, Maduro Is Defiant:::::Given the sanctions, however, it remained unclear how Mr. Maduro intended to restructure the governments debt.Theres no way to restructure under existing U.S. sanctions, but the government may be hoping that bond holders now pressure the Trump administration to create an exemption to the sanctions, said Risa Grais-Targow, director for Latin America at Eurasia Group, a political risk analysis firm.In a challenge to the Trump administration, Mr. Maduro also named Vice President Tareck El Aisamm to lead the efforts.Mr. El Aisamm has been sanctioned by the United States over allegations that he is a narcotics trafficker, which blocks Americans from doing business with him.There was no grace period for the loan payment due on Thursday, and it remained unclear how investors would react to the failure of the state oil company, Petrleos de Venezuela, or Pdvsa, to make the payment on time.But Diego Ferro, co-chief investment officer at Greylock Capital Management, a New York hedge fund that invests in distressed high-yield bonds, said the restructuring announcement could buy Mr. Maduro some time with bondholders and the Venezuelan people.People were expecting the payment late anyway, he said.As of now they have at least a few months to come up with an offer to put off litigation in the United States.It will depend on what they offer in terms of payments of principal and interest.Photo Mr. Maduro has sought to avoid a default, which could trigger years of international legal battles among creditors for control of Pdvsa assets outside Venezuela, including its American refinery subsidiary Citgo and tankers that deliver oil around the world.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Venezuela will not default strategically, said Miguel Angel Santos, a senior research fellow at the Center for International Development at Harvard.If it defaults, its because they have really run out of dimes and nickels.In a default, Venezuelan petroleum exports would be interrupted, forcing the government to cultivate new ways of getting the nations oil into the international marketplace, perhaps including an increasing dependence on the Russian oil company Rosneft, according to analysts.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.During a similar debt crunch in April, Rosneft provided a $1 billion advance payment for oil, which was crucial for Pdvsa to make nearly $3 billion in bond payments.Last week, senior Russian officials said they were ready to restructure some debts to suspend hundreds of millions in payments until 2020 or later.Rosneft has a 49.9 percent stake in Citgo, Pdvsas refining and gasoline station subsidiary in the United States, as collateral for a $1.5 billion loan to the Venezuelan oil company.Rosneft and Pdvsa are in negotiations to swap Rosnefts Citgo holdings for oil fields in Venezuela out of concern that the United States government could eventually place sanctions on Citgo.International bond experts and the markets had been optimistic that the Venezuelan state oil company would make the $1.2 billion payment on time on Thursday.But in recent years, Pdvsa has increasingly left investors and the market guessing up to the last minute on whether it would make its debt payments.With the company facing a deadline last week on a separate bond payment, the markets were particularly jittery amid conflicting signals from the government about its preparedness to pay.On Friday, the company announced it had started to make the payment before the deadline, though bondholders did not start seeing the payments until a few days later.The Venezuelan government and Pdvsa have been skipping interest payments over the last four weeks, taking advantage of grace periods to delay more than $700 million in payouts.Theyre living day by day essentially, said Daniel Lansberg-Rodriguez, an adjunct lecturer of finance at the Kellogg School of Management.Theres a sense that at the liquidity level, theres a scramble, theres always a scramble.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Venezuela has a $140 billion external debt, most of which was borrowed in recent years when oil prices were more than $100 a barrel.The collapse of oil prices three years ago forced Venezuela into a crisis, and experts have been predicting that a default is nearly certain unless oil prices recover quickly to over $75 a barrel well above current levels.With more debt payments due in the coming months, the government and Pdvsa are offering leasing deals to Russian and Chinese companies to transfer operational control of one or two major refineries, according to Argus, an energy and commodity news service.But energy experts say that Venezuelas refineries would be risky investments for any foreign oil company given that they are in poor working condition and that the domestic gasoline and diesel market is highly subsidized so returns are low.
TripAdvisor Apologizes for Deleting Review Detailing Rape at Mexican Resort:::::The company said her post was deleted in 2010 because its previous comment guidelines required that all language needed to be G-rated.Since that policy changed a few years ago, reviews mentioning rapes and assaults have remained on the site, the company said.We believe any firsthand experience should be posted to our site as a means to communicate to other consumers looking for information on where they should travel, TripAdvisor said.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.Iberostar Hotels and Resorts, which is based in Spain and also has hotels in the United States and Europe, said it takes all allegations by guests seriously.The company said workers at the Iberostar Paraiso told Ms. Love to file a report with the police but she refused.Just as it would in the United States, the failure to have an official complaint on file with the authorities hampers the ability to investigate a claim, the company said in a statement.Ms. Love, who could not be reached for comment on Thursday evening, told The Journal Sentinel that the hotel staff members refused to help her after she reported the rape to them.After she returned to Dallas, the hotel told her it had no report of her episode, stopped returning her phone calls and threatened to sue her, she said.A few weeks after the attack, she returned to Mexico and filed a police report but the hotel would not cooperate with the authorities, she told The Journal Sentinel.TripAdvisor wields significant influence in the travel industry, and its reviews for hotels and restaurants typically rank near the top in online search listings.Because of its power and popularity, businesses covet positive reviews from travelers and fret about negative comments.Advertisement Continue reading the main story In its statement, TripAdvisor said that since its founding in 2000, it had enforced a strict separation between its reviews and commerce initiatives.Its business listings allow travelers to read reviews and book reservations on the same page.But the investigation by The Journal Sentinel found other instances in which negative reviews, including comments that warned about assaults and deaths, had been deleted without explanation.It said its reporting began in July after the death of a 20-year-old Wisconsin college student at a resort in Mexico who was found unconscious after drinking what her family believed was contaminated alcohol.TripAdvisor said it was also introducing a notification badge on its business listings to warn travelers if there had been health and safety or discrimination issues reported at the business.
Tax Plan Would Scrap Electric-Car Credit, Dampening Market:::::Despite the small numbers, other automakers, such as Ford, Volkswagen and BMW, are gearing up to introduce their first mass-market electric vehicles.Cutting the federal tax credit, however, is likely to dampen expectations for the segments expansion.Tax credits are an important customer benefit that can help accelerate the acceptance of electric vehicles, G.M.said in a statement on Thursday.Because General Motors believes in an all-electric future, we will work with Congress to explore ways to maintain this incentive.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.There was no comment from Tesla, which is preparing to introduce its first mass-market entry, the Model 3 sedan, next year at a base price of $35,000 before any tax credit is applied.The loss of the tax credit may cause Tesla to lose some interest among the hundreds of thousands of prospective Model 3 buyers who have put down $1,000 deposits to reserve their cars.Its shares were down almost 7 percent on Thursday, though the companys financial performance and production delays also weighed on the stock.The tax credit was among the measures the Obama administration took to drive innovation and sales of cleaner vehicles, in the aftermath of the government bailout of General Motors and the former Chrysler in 2009.Companies were allotted 200,000 tax credits to distribute among customers, yet no company has come close to using up its credits because of the low demand.Environmental groups, as expected, were sharply critical of the elimination of the credits.Electric vehicles are a new industry, and the electric vehicle purchase incentive has been a vital part of getting it off the ground, said Michelle Robinson, director of the clean-vehicle program at the Union of Concerned Scientists.Dropping the credit would throw the market for electrified vehicles into disarray, and possibly stall broader efforts to build more zero-emission vehicles, Ms. Robinson said.Advertisement Continue reading the main story These changes would increase pollution and undermine Americas leadership in energy innovation, she said.Wed squander the progress we have made.
Republicans’ Mistakes on Writing, and Selling, Tax Plan Could Cost Them:::::Photo Republicans botched pitch for tax cuts could cost them dearly.Their revised plan, disclosed on Thursday, deals only partly with earlier criticism that it benefits the rich.And the chief lieutenants responsible for selling it to the public for the White House, Gary Cohn and Steven Mnuchin, have fumbled their way through their own script.G.O.P.House leaders have, at least, ditched the idea of scrapping the top rate of tax of nearly 40 percent, for the highest earners.But theyre cutting to 25 percent the rate for so-called pass-through entities like limited-liability companies and partnerships.Many wealthy people, including President Trump and some members of his cabinet, have made liberal use of these.And theyre doubling the estate tax exemption and then repealing the tax over the next six years.In September, Mr. Trump claimed this so-called death tax would protect millions of small businesses and the American farmer.Yet it affects only about 0.2 percent of the population ultra-wealthy families, in other words.Its repeal would save Trumps family and the offspring of rich cabinet members billions of dollars, Democrats argue.Comments made by Trump administration officials are not helping.Mr. Cohn, Trumps top economic adviser, claimed in September that the typical American family earns $100,000 a year.Hes vastly overstating it: The median annual American household income in 2016 was about $59,000.The Pew Research Center tallies an annual middle-class income as low as $40,000, depending on where you live.Mr. Cohn, former president of Goldman Sachs, listed at least $250 million in assets in his financial disclosure.Mr. Mnuchin, another Goldman alumnus, has also garbled his tax message.After saying for months that the wealthy would not get a tax cut, he recently changed his tune.He told the website Politico that it was difficult to avoid giving a break to the rich because the top 20 percent pay 95 percent of the taxes.Its actually more like the top 50 percent of earners.His own wealth presents a conflict of interest, too: He reported about $500 million in assets in financial disclosures.Such abysmal marketing is already falling flat with voters: Only 25 percent of Americans like the plan and just 14 percent believe they will get a tax cut, according to an NBC News-Wall Street Journal poll.If that translates into problems pushing the cuts through Congress, it will put the Trump administrations goals of sustained 3 percent economic growth and rising wages in jeopardy.That would be a dismal failure going into an election year.
Apple Report Expects New iPhones to Jump-Start Growth:::::Photo SAN FRANCISCO Ten years after Apple unveiled the iPhone and embarked on an era of supercharged growth, the company lifted investor hopes on Thursday that the iPhone X would be its next blockbuster product.As Apple reported revenue and profit increases that beat Wall Street expectations for its fiscal fourth quarter, the company said it was also seeing strong demand for the iPhone X, as well as for the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus models, which it unveiled in September.Apple said it expected revenue for the holiday quarter, which is typically its most robust, to come in at between $84 billion and $87 billion.That forecast was well above the $78.4 billion that Apple generated during last years holiday quarter, which was an all-time high for quarterly revenue, and reflected confidence that people want new iPhones.Timothy D. Cook, Apples chief executive, said during the earnings call that the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus had been the most popular iPhones every week since they went on sale.And in an interview, Luca Maestri, Apples chief financial officer, said that iPhone X production was going well and that the company could not provide such strong revenue guidance if we didnt have strong iPhone X demand.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The iPhone X, which arrives in stores on Friday, is Apples most expensive iPhone ever, starting at $999.Its new features include a way to unlock the phone using facial recognition technology.The device is the centerpiece of a lineup of new iPhones for the holiday season.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Interested in All Things Tech?The Bits newsletter will keep you updated on the latest from Silicon Valley and the technology industry.Strong demand for the devices could give a shot in the arm to Apple, which could become the first publicly traded company to reach a $1 trillion market value but has faced more questions about its growth in recent quarters.While the iPhone once fueled Apples growth its popularity underpinning other offerings like sales of services and software more people around the world now own smartphones, and iPhone sales growth has flattened.New products, including the Apple Watch, have not been as widely adopted as the iPhone.
Tax Change on Mortgages Could Shake Up the Housing Market:::::The proposed bill has no phase-in period; people who bought homes before Thursday could continue claiming the deduction on a mortgage up to $1 million, but after that, the ceiling is lowered by half.This will raise the overall cost of buying a home, and discourage existing homeowners from moving.This is one more problem for a real estate business that has seen the homeownership rate fall to about 64 percent from its pre-recession peak of around 69 percent.Home sales have been sluggish of late, in part because homeowners who capitalized on rock-bottom interest rates are staying put, reducing the number of available homes for sale.The whittling away of the mortgage interest deduction gives homeowners one more reason to stay put, said Svenja Gudell, chief economist at Zillow.On Thursday morning, hours after the proposal was unveiled, Redfin, a national real estate brokerage firm based in Seattle, started drafting a memo to its more than 1,000 real estate agents instructing them to ensure that prospective home buyers can still afford homes in their desired price range.There are people writing offers on homes today who have spent the past few days trying to figure out if they can afford a home, and we need to put them on notice that that might change, said Glenn Kelman, Redfins chief executive.Might is the operative word here.Many economists from both parties have complained that the mortgage interest deduction is wasteful and unfair.It favors homeowners over renters, rich over poor, and distorts the housing market and even migration patterns by encouraging people to leave smaller urban quarters for bigger and more tax-advantaged homes in the suburbs.Even Mr. Kelman a man whose fortunes are directly tied to commissions on homes bought and sold said it could be hard to see the usefulness of a deduction that so forcefully favors one group over another.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.The current tax code favors people who are buying a home versus the rest of America, he said.As a captain of industry, I would prefer more tax breaks to help people buy houses, but as a citizen, I realize someone has to pay.Nevertheless, the powerful real estate lobby has consistently beat back attempts to reduce or eliminate the mortgage interest deduction.On Thursday, William E. Brown, president of the National Association of Realtors, issued a statement signaling that lawmakers could expect a fight.Advertisement Continue reading the main story We are currently reviewing the details of the tax proposal released today, but at first glance it appears to confirm many of our biggest concerns about the tax plans making their way through Congress, the statement said.Eliminating or nullifying the tax incentives for homeownership puts home values and middle-class homeowners at risk, and from a cursory examination this legislation appears to do just that.Edward Glaeser, a Harvard economist who has long been in favor of reducing the mortgage interest deduction, liked parts of the plan.His main concern was that by retaining the existing deduction for current homeowners, the bill would further reduce the propensity of Americans to move not just to a better or more expensive home, but also to cities or states where job opportunities might be brighter.This effectively becomes a tax on selling a home, he said.To be sure, the tax proposal has a lot of variables that make it hard to determine exactly how it would affect any particular familys tax bill.For instance, the standard deduction would double, a factor that would partly offset the loss of the mortgage interest deduction.But the deductibility of property taxes would be capped at $10,000, another provision that could weigh on the construction and resale of more expensive homes.In any case, between the loss of the mortgage interest deduction and a separate measure to eliminate the deduction of state and local income taxes something that would also disproportionately affect the higher-cost cities and states the biggest losers will be most heavily concentrated on the coasts.
New Netflix Ratings Confirm ‘Stranger Things’ Is a Hit:::::Photo Nielsens new Netflix ratings service has its first public results, and they confirm what a lot of people in the TV industry felt but didnt know for sure: Stranger Things is a hit.On Thursday, Nielsen released ratings for all nine episodes of the second season of the spooky thriller, which was made available on Netflix on Oct. 27.According to the data, the first episode of Stranger Things was watched by 15.8 million people within the first three days.How does that compare to three-day ratings for other top shows?Well, 15 million people watched the premiere episode of the most recent season of The Walking Dead, the biggest hit on cable; the first episode of NBCs This Is Us was watched by 17.8 million people; and the premiere episode of the latest season of The Big Bang Theory was watched by 22 million people.The season finale of HBOs Game of Thrones had 14.8 million viewers within three days of its broadcast; the premium cable network said that more than 30 million people watched each episode this past season once streaming numbers were factored in.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Netflix has always kept its streaming numbers private and has long rejected the thought of third-party measurement data.A spokesman for the company said last month that Nielsens numbers are not accurate, not even close.

DNAinfo and Gothamist Are Shut Down After Vote to Unionize:::::But in the financially daunting era of digital journalism, there has been no tougher nut to crack than making local news profitable, a lesson Mr. Ricketts, who lost money every month of DNAinfos existence, is just the latest to learn.In New York City, the nations biggest media market, established organizations such as The Village Voice, The Wall Street Journal and The Daily News have slashed staff or withdrawn from street-level reporting.The Voice stopped publishing its print edition in September.For DNAinfo and Gothamist, the staffs vote to join the Writers Guild of America East was just part of the decision to close the company.A spokeswoman for DNAinfo said in a statement, The decision by the editorial team to unionize is simply another competitive obstacle making it harder for the business to be financially successful.The decision puts 115 people out of work, both at the New York operations that unionized and at those in Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Washington that did not.They are getting three months of paid administrative leave at full salary, plus four weeks of severance, DNAinfo said.The news took the newsroom by surprise.David Colon, a reporter for Gothamist, said that a lawyer for DNAinfo was present when the staff was told, but that he didnt really take questions.Very classy, Mr. Colon said.I yelled a lot and somebody told me to stop.Now were all trying to figure out what to do.Merging DNAinfo and Gothamist was intended to ease some of the financial strain.But the two sites were an odd mix.DNAinfo specialized in street-level reporting on neighborhood issues not covered in other media, including real estate developments and crime.Gothamist brought a puckish attitude to articles that were sometimes original, sometimes based on news published elsewhere.Photo Ben Fractenberg, who joined DNAinfo in 2010, said that the hope was that as local newspapers around the country foundered, DNAinfo would create a new business model for local news.We were all united on that, Mr. Fractenberg said.And that never wavered.Advertisement Continue reading the main story But the profits never materialized.Journalism in general has become less profitable as print advertising, which commanded high prices, has crashed, and revenues from digital advertising have not replaced it.Local newspapers and sites, which deliver smaller audiences for advertisers, have been particularly pressed.The New York Times has also cut back on its local coverage of New York City, closing regional bureaus, for example.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Patch, a network of hyperlocal news sites that started two years before DNAinfo in 2007, is one relatively bright spot on the local-news landscape.It says it is now profitable, after cutting more than three-quarters of its staff in 2014 and deciding to duplicate much of its content across more than 1,000 local sites.The city also has its share of locally owned neighborhood sites, including West Side Rag and Tribeca Citizen in Manhattan, Bklyner in Brooklyn and The Queens Post.The founder of West Side Rag said their site was profitable.When the DNAinfo and Gothamist New York newsrooms first moved to join the union in April, management warned that there might be dire consequences.DNAinfos chief operating officer sent the staff an email wondering if a union might be the final straw that caused the business to close.Around the same time, Mr. Ricketts, whose family owns the Chicago Cubs, wrote, As long as its my money thats paying for everything, I intend to be the one making the decisions about the direction of the business.In September, Mr. Ricketts, a conservative who supported President Trump in last years election, raised the ante with a post on his blog titled Why Im Against Unions At Businesses I Create, in which he argued that unions promote a corrosive us-against-them dynamic that destroys the esprit de corps businesses need to succeed.But reporters at many digital news sites make only a fraction of what staffers made in the heyday of print newspapers.And in joining the Writers Guild of America East, which has organized staffs at some larger digital organizations, including Vice and HuffPost, the DNAinfo and Gothamist staffers hoped for stability and recognition.Emma Whitford, a Gothamist reporter, said that organizers from the union assured the workers that threats to shut the sites down were just textbook union-busting tactics.The union said in a statement: It is no secret that threats were made to these workers during the organizing drive.The Guild will be looking at all of our potential areas of recourse and we will aggressively pursue our new members rights.After last weeks vote, one DNAinfo reporter, Katie Honan, said, If this is the future of journalism, it should be a career for people, not a postcollege hobby.Advertisement Continue reading the main story When the email from Mr. Ricketts landed, it hit the newsroom like a thunderclap, said Scott Heins, a Gothamist reporter.At

Trump Team to Promote Fossil Fuels and Nuclear Power at Bonn Climate Talks:::::According to new figures put out by the U.S. Energy Information Administration, coal production has risen since President Trump took office a fact Mr. Trump highlighted late Tuesday in a tweet.President Trump has vowed to withdraw from the Paris agreement, calling it a deal that punishes the United States.But under the rules of the deal, the United States cannot actually withdraw until 2020.Until then, the administration has said, it will continue to work toward bringing the Paris agreement into force.Photo Barry K. Worthington, executive director of the United States Energy Association, who will speak on the panel, said he hoped to deliver a dose of reality about the future of fossil fuels at a forum dominated by activists demanding the end of coal, oil and gas.He argued no credible projection shows fossil fuels meeting less than 40 percent of global energy demand by midcentury.Mr. Worthington said he expected that delivering that message before climate change activists would be a horrible experience but it is important for many to hear.The reality of it is the world is going to continue to use fossil fuels, he said, and if I can throw myself on the hand grenade to help people realize that, Im willing to do it.George David Banks, special assistant to President Trump for international energy and environment, will give introductory remarks and Francis Brooke, an aide to Vice President Mike Pence, will moderate the discussion among industry executives.This discussion is a follow-up to the Administrations success at the G20, where the United States expressed its support for helping countries meet their climate objectives through the use of cleaner and more efficient fossil fuels and other clean energy sources and technologies, a White House spokesman, Raj Shah, said in a statement.It is undeniable that fossil fuels will be used for the foreseeable future, and it is in everyones interest that they be efficient and clean.Through innovation, the United States continues to be a global leader in cutting carbon emissions.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The administrations emphasis on fossil fuels represents a sharp break from the Obama administration, which focused almost exclusively on ways America can promote renewable energy abroad.Critics called it a poke in the eye of the international community.Its embarrassing, said Senator Brian Schatz of Hawaii, a Democrat.After forfeiting international leadership on climate, the Trump White House is compounding their error with a silly stunt.Fossil fuel companies are not clean energy companies, and no amount of spin will change that.Saleemul Huq, director of the International Centre for Climate Change and Development in Bangladesh, who helps advise the least developed countries in the United Nations climate talks, said fossil fuels were hurting, not helping, the worlds poorest nations.Any country or company continuing to champion further exploration for and mining of coal and even other fossil fuels from now on would be willfully carrying out a crime against humanity, and they would be held accountable, he said.
Stocks Indexes Close Largely Unchanged After Tax Plan Is Unveiled:::::Stocks on Wall Street closed mainly unchanged on Thursday as the financial markets digested new details of an ambitious Republican plan to cut taxes.Major stock indexes initially plunged as lawmakers circulated a set of talking points covering the Houses highly anticipated $1.51 trillion package on Thursday morning.Although the markets recovered by midday, investors reacted to proposed caps on the popular mortgage-interest deduction by sending shares in home-building companies lower.Lennar ended the day 3.3 percent lower, and PulteGroup lost 1.1 percent.The tax plan would crunch the number of individual tax brackets to three from seven and slash the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent.Homeowners are now able to deduct mortgage interest on loans up to $1 million.Under the proposal announced on Thursday, that cap would drop to $500,000 for new mortgages.The Standard & Poors 500-stock index, which fell as much as 0.5 percent when the tax details were first released, ended the session unchanged, at 2,579.85.The Dow Jones industrial average gained 0.4 percent, at 23,516.26.The Nasdaq composite was flat, at 6,714.94.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Under their tax plan, House Republicans also want to end a program that offers buyers of electric-powered vehicles a tax credit of up to $7,500.Shares of the electric-car maker Tesla, which tumbled in after-hours trading on Wednesday after the company announced a larger loss than expected for the third quarter, fell further after details of the tax plan were released on Thursday.Tesla shares closed 6.8 percent lower.
Joan Tisch, Patron of the Arts and AIDS Fight, Dies at 90:::::Joan Tischs son Jonathan is co-chairman of the company, treasurer of the Giants and chief executive of Loews hotels.Laurences son Andrew is also a co-chairman of the Loews Corporation; Andrews brother James is the president and chief executive.Mrs. Tisch lived in the Loews Regency Hotel on Park Avenue, which Jonathan and his father made famous as the home of so-called power breakfasts among New Yorks movers and shakers.Mrs. Tisch paid the company about $75,000 a month for her apartment, according to its proxy statement.While Mrs. Tisch was often referred to as a socialite, she was also a fervent benefactor for causes like the AIDS crisis.Im Joan and Id like to volunteer, she announced when she showed up in the mid-1980s at the tiny office of the Gay Mens Health Crisis after several of her friends had contracted AIDS.Without identifying herself further, she went to work stuffing envelopes and working the switchboard.For the first time in years of volunteering, I had become emotionally involved, she was quoted as saying in Fighting for Our Lives: New Yorks AIDS Community and the Politics of Disease, by Susan Maizel Chambre (2006).I witnessed the signifying of wills of men younger than my children.I saw people with Kaposis sarcoma try in vain to hide lesions with makeup.I listened to cases of harassment at work or by landlords.Advertisement Continue reading the main story When the offices only photocopier broke down, her son Jonathan wrote in The Power of We: Succeeding Through Partnerships (2004, with Karl Weber), she suggested buying a new one.No money, the office manager replied forlornly.My mom promptly wrote a check for $475 and handed it to the manager, Mr. Tisch wrote.He looked very dubious.How do I know this check wont bounce?he asked her.She replied, Trust me, it wont bounce.Joan Lila Hyman was born on July 14, 1927, in Manhattan to N. Howard Hyman, a dentist, and the former Merle Brayer.After graduating from a private high school in New Jersey, she attended the University of Michigan, where she earned a bachelors degree in English and met her husband, a fellow student.When friends ask me about going to football games every Sunday, Mrs. Tisch told The New York Times in 1997, after Bob Tisch had bought his half interest in the Giants, I tell them I have been going to football games every weekend since 1946.They graduated and married in 1948.Mr. Tisch helped bring the Democratic National Convention to New York in 1976 and 1980, lobbied on New Yorks behalf in Washington during the citys fiscal crisis in the mid-1970s, generated support for what became the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center on Manhattans West Side, and was a good-will ambassador for the city.He died in 2005.In addition to their son Jonathan, who is also a philanthropist, with a gallery named after him and his wife, Lizzie, at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Mrs. Tisch is survived by their other children, Steve, a film producer and chairman of the Giants, and Laurie, a philanthropist and president of the Laurie M. Tisch Illumination Fund, as well as 10 grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.In her memory, the Giants will wear a decal with her initials, J. H. T., on their helmets this weekend when they play the Los Angeles Rams at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mrs. Tisch was a board member of the 92nd Street Y, where the family endowed the Tisch Center for the Arts.She underwrote the Gay Mens Health Crisiss purchase of a new headquarters on West 33rd Street, enabled New York University to develop programs in the arts and humanities, and helped finance the building of the universitys Tisch Hospital, in the East 30s near the East River, and the renovation of the Childrens Zoo in Central Park.Jonathan Tisch once described his mother as an independent opinionated person.While she was seriously committed to social causes, those who knew her say she never took herself too seriously.In 1990, after The Times wrote about socialites auditioning for roles as socialites for the film version of Tom Wolfes novel The Bonfire of the Vanities, Mrs. Tisch jokingly sent a handwritten note to Mark Canton, a Warner Bros. executive and close friend of her son Steves.Shed read about the auditions with great interest and thought she could play one of the small parts, Julie Salamon wrote in The Devils Candy (1991), her book about the making of the film.The auditions were for a scene involving a gala party at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.To bolster her case, Ms. Salamon reported, she assured Canton that Warner Bros. wouldnt have to provide hotel accommodations, as I have my own (the Regency), or air transportation, as I have my own.Tisch added that the movie wouldnt even have to give her space at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, as I have my own wing.
Watch Brands Are Thinking Twice About Going to the Fair:::::Showrooms like Watches of Switzerlands three-story Regent Street flagship, one of the largest watch stores in Europe, have become magnets for buyers.(The Regent Street location produced 50 million pounds, or $66 million, of the 565 million in sales that Watches of Switzerlands parent company Aurum Holdings listed in its most recent annual report.)Many of these emporiums have shop-in-shop brand boutiques, which effectively are permanent exhibition spaces, an economical alternative to the cost of designing, building and staffing a watch fair booth that will be dismantled in a matter of days.Watch brands also are sinking millions into boutiques in London.This month, Tag Heuer and Panerai (another former Salon QP exhibitor) will become the latest brands to open stores in central London.Big-name brands without a London shop, such as Audemars Piguet, are now a minority.Brands report a focus on retail activities as a significant factor in withdrawing from Salon QP.The British managing director of a Swiss watch brand, who declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the topic, described a lot of visitors to the London event as tire kickers, adding that customers who are really interested in buying will go to a quality third-party retailer or a brand boutique.Photo Industry experts say that large brands also are unhappy that they get little measurable return on the investment required to participate in a regional fair, and that their presence actually helps provide a platform for small independent watchmakers.The Swiss brands managing director said small brands do need such events to reach customers.But we have so many other tools at our disposal, he added.Its not high on our list of things to do.Salon QP has transformed the fortunes of a number of independents.The British brand Garrick was introduced at the 2015 show.We specifically wait for Salon QP to come along before launching any new pieces, David Brailsford, the Garrick founder, said.Its the perfect place to meet potential clients.Last year, we generated 65,000 in sales, and 45,000 the previous year.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Salon QP is not the only watch fair seeing brands take their spending power elsewhere.According to industry experts, Baselworld, the worlds largest watch and jewelry fair, had 200 fewer exhibitors in 2017 than it had in 2016, with many of the withdrawals blamed on the market slump and the shows costly participation fees.One of the no-shows was the British brand Bremont, which decided to have its own event in a London townhouse.Once a Salon QP regular, Bremont also will not be at the 2018 show.The Baselworld organizers have acknowledged the diminishing participation, and announced that the 2018 show would run just five days, March 22 to 27, rather than the seven days it had scheduled in the past.Photo Some other shows also have been making changes.The Salon International de la Haute Horlogerie a showcase for Richemont brands such as Cartier, IWC and Roger Dubuis opened the 2017 shows final day to the public.We had 2,500 public visitors, said Fabienne Lupo, president and managing director of the Fondation de la Haute Horlogerie, the Swiss watch organization that organizes the event in Geneva each January.In the future, fairs will not be sufficient.They will have to evolve and find new ways of organizing themselves.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.But not all regional fairs are struggling.Dubai Watch Week, which is supported by the foundation, has grown to more than 30 exhibiting brands from the 10 that participated in its inaugural event in 2014.This year the fair, scheduled for Nov. 16 to 20, expects to attract more than 4,000 visitors; it drew 500 three years ago.Its organizers say they are focusing on a young audience.Consumer habits have evolved and we have noticed that purchasing power has become much younger and more sporadic, said Melika Yazdjerdi, director of Dubai Watch Week.The market over all has had to adapt to a diverse, younger demographic, and we have been catering to a more interactive and dynamic audience through our programs.If we only target existing collectors or consumers, it would leave no room to showcase new and exciting projects or encourage a younger audience to attend the show, she said.Ms. Lupo, however, struck a cautious note: The answer is probably that there is not a place for fairs everywhere, as the sponsors are very often the same.
The Strategy at Girard-Perregaux is on Time:::::I think the problem with Girard-Perregaux in the recent past was that it had fantastic people but only creativity, and no strategy for its product or distribution, he said.It also faced the external challenges of the watch industry at large, including the slowdown in Chinese demand and the complex aftereffects of terrorist attacks in many parts of the world.Photo Raised in Neuchtel, Switzerland, to Italian parents who immigrated there after World War II, Mr. Calce has a Swiss penchant for precision and practicality along with an Italian passion for watchmaking and the heritage and craftsmanship that surround it.For me, the watch is a piece of art, he said.You cannot imagine how many skills that go into it.For the dial, you need more than 40 different skills; to make a case, you need more than 80.Instilling a sense of excitement among luxury spenders, he said, is crucial to the survival of the entire watch industry.Its current problems are not related to a lack of people with money to spend, but rather about persuading them to spend it on something for their wrists.Mr. Calce referred to a 2016 report by Bain & Company, the management group, that said sales of luxury goods, including watches, remained flat at 249 billion euros ($289.1 billion).This was in spite of an increase in overall luxury spending, to an estimated 1.08 trillion in retail sales, with experiences such as travel and gastronomy being the only bright spots.Our goal is to promote our work to the end consumer and convince them to spend their money on watches, not just luxury experiences, Mr. Calce said.The money is there, we just have to rethink how we take care of our heritage.Creating excitement, he said, includes developing a clear strategy focused on a brands heritage and strengths, rather than one that relies on the latest trend for the biggest or the slimmest or the most complicated timepiece.You have to be innovative and move with the times but you have to do it authentically, he said.To succeed in luxury, you need quality, brand identity and a recognizable product.Photo At Girard-Perregaux, this meant dipping into its past to select the most iconic and the most successful collections for new attention.Advertisement Continue reading the main story First was the Laureato, a thin, elegant sports watch introduced in 1975.Girard-Perregauxs response to the quartz crisis (the rise of electronic watches and corresponding decline in demand for traditional mechanical timepieces), it was one of the first quartz watches made by a Swiss watchmaker.The design has been produced in many forms, including the introduction of a mechanical Laureato in 1995.But in January, at the Salon International de la Haute Horlogerie in Geneva, Mr. Calce introduced the first family of Laureato timepieces, 36 references for both men and women, in four sizes from 34 millimeters to 45 millimeters.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.The 150th anniversary of the Three Gold Bridges also provided an opportunity to introduce the Neo Bridges model, with a starting price of less than $25,000.(If not cheap, it at least was less expensive then its 2014 incarnation, the $150,000-plus Neo Tourbillon.)Broadening the collections price range was one of Mr. Calces first decisions at the company.I said, We have such an incredible signature, we cant just have one tourbillon at 200,000 Swiss francs.We really have to extend this offer, especially because its so recognizable as a Girard-Perregaux piece.Pricing, he said, is another thorny issue all brands face today.Value for money is more crucial than ever in the watch industry, Mr. Calce said.If you analyze haute horlogerie, more than 50 percent of business is in the price segment 5,000 to 12,000 Swiss francs ($5,001 to $12,001).If youre not in that segment, its difficult.Photo Thanks to the Laureato designs and a steel version of its 1966 model, we have the opportunity to be really present in this segment now, he said.Its crucial for Girard-Perregauxs future.The final part of Mr. Calces plan is honing the companys distribution for better alignment with its market position.This is not a push brand, its a pull brand.We have to create the demand, he said.This is why in the U.S., for example, in the near future we will close around 14 doors because I really want to create a sense of exclusivity around Girard-Perregaux.To some, fewer doors may sound like fewer sales (although this is a strategy other Swiss brands, including Patek Philippe, have taken), but Mr. Calce said it was a question of quality, not quantity.Advertisement Continue reading the main story With fewer stores representing the brand, more time can be spent building good relationships with those stores and educating their sales staff.We dont sell potatoes, we sell high-end watches, he said.Almost three years into carrying out his turnaround strategy, Mr. Calce said he was very happy with the results so far.Kering does not disclose performance results for its watch brands, although its report for the third quarter of 2017 noted that they had enjoyed very encouraging growth over the quarter.Mr. Calces next challenge?He wants to further improve brand awareness, which, along with all the other factors, he hopes will ensure Girard-Perregauxs long-term success.I always say, I have a piece of gold in my hand and I have to take care of it, Mr. Calce said.If I dont apply the right strategy, if I dont hire the right people, if I dont boost the R & D department with new skills, what will happen in 10 or 20 years?That is the reality.
In the Secretive World of Watches, Zenith Decides to Share:::::Photo The watchmaking industry is known for its secrecy, the tradition of keeping advances well hidden from other brands.But the Swiss watchmaker Zenith now is offering to sell the technology used to create its new Defy Lab watch to competitors.Zenith said the Defy Lab, introduced in September, advanced mechanical watchmaking principles that have been in use since the 17th century and was accurate to 3/10th of a second a day, which would make it the worlds most accurate mechanical watch.Sharing information is a 21st-century concept, said Jean-Claude Biver, the president of the Watches Division at LVMH Mot Hennessy Louis Vuitton, which includes Zenith, Hublot and Tag Heuer.But it is also part of Zenith, which has sold movements to other brands for years, he added.For example, Zeniths El Primero caliber, introduced in 1969, has appeared in watches made by Rolex and Tag Heuer.Advertisement Continue reading the main story While conventional watch regulating systems have more than 30 parts, the new Defy Lab system has only one, and it is made of silicon.Zenith said both advances would deliver a number of benefits in addition to improved accuracy: freedom from the effects of magnetism, improved resistance to the effects of temperature and gravity, and, because the new system requires no oil, creates no friction and therefore does not wear, there is zero maintenance.
Roger Dubuis, a Master Watchmaker, Dies at 79:::::In the late 1980s Mr. Dubuis was working with Jean-Marc Wiederrecht, the well-known movement designer, on the Bi-Retrograde Perpetual Calendar Watch commissioned by Harry Winston.Roger and I shared a passion for beautiful horology, Mr. Wiederrecht said.He was schooled at Patek Philippe at a time when so much of the work was still done by hand.He made some of the stunning Pateks that we see in auctions today.It was during that period that Mr. Dubuis met Carlos Dias, a businessman and watch designer.By 1995, he had convinced Mr. Dubuis to found the Socit Genevoise des Montres, later renamed Manufacture Roger Dubuis.Photo Industry experts say Mr. Dubuiss understated manner and old-school craftsmanship complemented Mr. Diass exuberant style.Together, they produced some of the watch worlds most distinctive timepieces, recognizable by their signature oversized cases, transparent backs, imposing crowns, Roman numerals and Celtic cross-styled tourbillon carriages, all of which are certified for their provenance and quality with the Poinon de Genve, or Geneva Seal.The company generally produced small editions, often limited to 28, 88 or 288 pieces variations of 208, Mr. Dubuiss registration number at the cole dHorlogerie de Genve.Its first two collections, Sympathie and Hommage, were followed by collections like Much More and Too Much and, later, Excalibur.In 2008, just as the watch market was feeling the financial crisis, Mr. Dias sold his 60 percent stake in Roger Dubuis to the Swiss luxury giant Richemont, which acquired the rest of the company in 2016.Under the Richemont umbrella, the company has opened 28 boutiques around the world and multiplied its collaborations, such as the Pirelli partnership to make watch straps from the tires of Formula One cars.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Some watch fans say that Mr. Dubuis, who did not retain a stake in the brand, was unhappy with the direction that the company had taken.Roger Dubuis was one of the last master watchmakers who left a brand in his name but whose destiny, like a Greek tragedy, had slipped through his gold fingers, Gregory Pons, the editor of the newsletter Business Montres & Joaillerie, said in a telephone interview from Geneva.He felt that the brand had taken his tools to do something that was more about design and less about his vision of watchmaking.In the end, he said, Roger Dubuis, the brand, had very little to do with the man.Mr. Pontrou disagreed.Roger understood that the classic watch segment was saturated and that watchmaking tradition needed to evolve, he said.He was proud of what we had done with the brand and its international expansion was proof that his reputation was on the rise.As the watch industry took note of his death, many referred to Mr. Dubuis as a consummate craftsman and one of the last masters of Swiss watchmaking.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Roger was a remarkable human being with an extraordinary talent, Mr. Wiederrecht said.That is what must be said about him.
A Watch Revival Becomes a Labor of Love:::::The cases are manufactured and both models are assembled in Lugano, Switzerland, near Lonvilles headquarters.I didnt want to recreate or reissue something Lonville did in the past because there are lots of reissues, Mr. Vreeswijk said.I thought it would be better to be original and create something fresh.A watch collector since his university graduation in the Netherlands, Mr. Vreeswijk stumbled across the Lonville brand during an online auction, where he bought a gold-plated Lonville pocket watch from the early 1900s.JOOST VREESWIJK I loved the fact that the last watch was in the 50s, he said, as I love the 50s and 60s because of the glamour, the music and some of the most beautiful watches were made then.(His collection includes Jaeger-LeCoultre Memovoxes, a gold-plated IWC dress watch and others from the era.)My dream for a while was to start my own watch company, Mr. Vreeswijk said.And the timing was right, too, as he had his own business consulting company so no one could tell me what to do.(He sold it to Ernst & Young in 2010, when he became a company partner.)The transition from watch collector to company owner was difficult.Most doors in the first two years were slammed in my face, he said.What is interesting is that you show up with a half-decent job in your day-to-day life and the supplier of cases is looking at you thinking, Im not going to waste my time with this guy.So they are very contradictory worlds.Among his friends and acquaintances, he found seven investors from backgrounds such as retailing, yachting and video production to take 1 percent each of the company.They bring, Mr. Vreeswijk said, experience, expertise and networks to the effort.And one is the companys full-time general manager, Matt Faoro.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Vreeswijk acknowledges that he will need more money to develop the company, so he is selling more shares to the current investors and looking for new ones.I dont like the idea that someone else has a say in the brand, so I am trying to delay as long as possible, he said.And I dont want to go below 51 percent as it is my baby.And I dont want anyone to tell me what to do with my baby.Photo Adapting business know-how from other industries has helped the company, Mr. Vreeswijk said.For example, he reduced costs by having some components made in volume and by getting the customer to pay me before Ive even made the watch, he said, I can use my cash to keep the boat floating.What Ive done is different from what you see happening in the watch world right now, he continued.You have the Kickstarter model, which is a flurry of start-ups which makes one model that is a cheap version of classics, and the classic large watchmakers.I am trying to make a niche business that deals directly with the customer, cuts out working capital and develops a group of like-minded people.Lonville watches are sold online, but Mr. Vreeswijk also holds events for about 50 guests each in cities such as London and Amsterdam.And his preference for such personal interaction with potential buyers is what prompted him to bring what we have so far, as he described the selection, to the independents room at Salon QP.I dont want to be in a big market square shouting louder than the person next to me because this isnt the right feeling of buying a beautiful watch, he said.Lots of watch companies are working to create communities of owners these days but few have Lonvilles flair.Photo Two days after Mr. Vreeswijk met with a reporter in the art-filled Ernst & Young London overlooking the Tower of London, he headed to Inverness, Scotland, and the seventh annual Lonville Classic car rally.He and his blue 1969 Jaguar E-Type sports car were joined by 22 watch owners and car enthusiasts in their 14 vintage cars for a four-day run through the city and the Highlands: Whiskey, Wheels and Watches, as the poster promised.And the 2018 event, from St. Moritz to the Italian coast of Liguria, already is planned.It started as a thing I liked as I couldnt find anything like this, and its created a real experience of having fun with friends, even though we might not know each other beforehand, Mr. Vreeswijk said.Advertisement Continue reading the main story (Coincidentally, on this particular day he was wearing the Fuel Tank watch.Its the Lonville he wears most often, he said, because its car related, the first one I made and coming from an engineering as well as business background, I love the mechanical idea that you can see how far the watch is wound.For Lonvilles next models, Mr. Vreeswijk is planning to collaborate with designers from other industries, like speedboat designers, as they come to it a little bit differently, like me, he said.For his own future, Will I ever live on Lonville or retire on it?I dont know, he said.Maybe I have an unfair advantage in that I am genuinely into this, to make a cool watch, and thats harder if you are corporate and have shareholders breathing down your neck.So for now, he said, I think its fun and interesting to do something where I feel theres a real appeal to it and see what happens.
Republican Plan Delivers Permanent Corporate Tax Cut:::::Americans will still be able to make both traditional, pretax contributions and Roth contributions in the way that works best for them, Republican lawmakers said in their talking points.But the legislation includes several land mines that could complicate its passage, including limits on the popular mortgage interest deduction and caps on the state and local tax deduction, as well as its overall cost.Several Republicans from the high-tax states of New York and New Jersey said the bill would need to change to gain their support, while powerful trade groups representing the real estate industry and small businesses blasted the bill as ineffective and harmful to Americans.Contrary to their assertions, the Republicans are picking winners and losers, Jerry Howard, the chief executive of the National Association of Homebuilders, said in an interview.They are picking rich Americans and corporations over small businesses and the middle class.Meanwhile, Senate Republicans are working on their own tax bill, and on Thursday, Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee, lobbed a grenade into the House plan over its cost.As I have made clear from the beginning of this debate, it is my hope that the final legislation while allowing for current policy assumptions and reasonable dynamic scoring will not add to the deficit, sets rates that are permanent in nature and closes a minimum of $4 trillion in loopholes and special interest deductions, Mr. Corker said.Representative Kevin Brady, Republican of Texas and the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said that the House plan had the full support of Mr. Trump and predicted that it would be on the presidents desk this year.Anticipating the resistance from industry groups, Mr. Brady said, Were going to prove them wrong once and for all.Representative Peter Roskam, Republican of Illinois and a member of the Ways and Means Committee, said he was bracing for the lobbyist onslaught but would not be deterred.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Weve just finished the opening ceremonies of the lobbyist Olympics.My phone has all kinds of messages and there are all kinds of criticisms, he said.The notion of just defending the status quo is insufferable, and were not going to do it.Slide Show The bill is estimated to cost $1.5 trillion over a decade, and lawmakers must keep it at that amount if they are to pass it along party lines and avoid a filibuster by Democrats.Lawmakers have been scrambling for days to find revenue to offset tax cuts that will cost trillions of dollars.That has prompted a host of changes on the individual side, including repealing tax breaks for things like medical expenses, moving expenses, student loan interest and adoption, as well as making some business tax breaks temporary.The benefits for individual taxpayers will be mixed and depend largely on where they fall on the income scale, where they live and the types of tax breaks they tend to claim.Those making up to $24,000 will pay no income tax.For married taxpayers filing jointly, earnings up to $90,000 would be taxed in the 12 percent bracket; earnings up to $260,000 would fall in the 25 percent bracket; and earnings up to $1 million would be taxed at the 35 percent rate.For unmarried individuals and those filing separately, the bracket thresholds would be half of these amounts, other than the 35 percent bracket, which would be $200,000 for unmarried individuals.The proposal roughly doubles the standard deduction for middle-class families, expanding it to $24,000 for married couples, from $12,700, and setting it at $12,000 for individuals, from $6,530 today.Republicans also plan to expand the child tax credit to $1,600 from $1,000 and add a $300 credit for each parent and nonchild dependent, such as older family members, though that credit would expire after five years.But it also tightens rules for claiming the child tax credit, a change that would hit immigrant parents whose children were born in the United States.Filers would need to provide a work-eligible Social Security number rather than just a taxpayer identification number in order to claim the credit.The left-leaning Center on Budget Policy and Priorities said the bill would roll back eligibility for about three million children in working families, including about 80 percent of whom were born in the United States.The bill includes a host of other changes that will affect taxpayers in different ways.For instance, it repeals certain tax credits, including a 15 percent credit for individuals aged 65 or over or who are retired on disability.Right now, those individuals can claim up to $7,500 for a joint return, $5,000 for a single individual, or $3,750 for a married individual filing a joint return.The House bill would entirely repeal that tax credit.It would also repeal the adoption tax credit, no longer allow deductions for tax preparation and repeal credits for alimony payments.And deductions for moving expenses would no longer be allowed.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.One of the biggest flash points is a proposed change to the popular mortgage interest deduction.Under the Republican plan, existing homeowners can keep the deduction, but future purchases will be capped at $500,000, down from the current $1 million limit.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The National Association of Realtors came out swinging against the bill, suggesting a huge fight awaits over how real estate is treated.Eliminating or nullifying the tax incentives for homeownership puts home values and middle-class homeowners at risk, and from a cursory examination this legislation appears to do just that, said William E. Brown, the president of the association.We will have additional details upon a more thorough reading of the bill.Mr. Howard of the homebuilders group said the bill was a broken promise.It puts such severe limitations on homebuyers ability to use the mortgage interest deduction that home values will fall, he said.Another area of contention is the bills treatment of the state and local tax deduction, which is popular among many middle- and upper-middle-class taxpayers in high-cost states like New Jersey, New York and California.The House bill would limit the deduction to just property taxes, rather than state and local income taxes and general sales taxes, and cap the benefit at $10,000.Several Republican lawmakers said they would oppose the bill in its current form, including Representatives Leonard Lance and Frank A. LoBiondo of New Jersey.The proposal will double the estate tax exemption to roughly $11 million, from $5.49 million, meaning families can avoid paying taxes on large inheritance.And it eventually repeals the estate tax altogether, phasing it out entirely in six years.Business groups that include large multinationals praised the bill effusively for lowering corporate rates permanently and sharply, and for overhauling the international tax system.Advertisement Continue reading the main story For the first time, the United States is proposing to effectively levy a global minimum tax of 10 percent, which would apply to income that high-profit subsidiaries of American companies earn anywhere in the world.The effort is aimed at preventing companies from shifting profits abroad and grabbing back some of the tax revenue on income earned overseas.Those profits are currently not taxed until they are returned to the United States, giving companies an incentive to keep that money offshore since they are taxed at the current corporate tax rate of 35 percent.The White House has said more than $2.5 trillion in American profits are held offshore.The bill would force companies to pay a one-time 12 percent tax on liquid assets held overseas, like cash.The tax, which is reduced from the current 35 percent tax rate, would be payable over eight years.For illiquid assets, like equipment or property, the tax rate would be 5 percent.It would also force American subsidiaries of foreign-owned companies to pay a 20 percent excise tax on any payments sent back to foreign affiliates.Neil Bradley, the chief policy officer at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, called the bill a home run for economic growth and warned other groups against blocking it.Everyones going to look at this and find something they dont like, Mr. Bradley said.So they are going to have to decide?Am I going to help get this done?Among those less sanguine about the bill are small businesses, which said the bill does not go far enough to help them reduce their tax burden.Republicans stuck to their promise of lowering the tax rate for pass through businesses to 25 percent.But to prevent the rate from becoming a loophole for all sorts of individuals, tax writers have created a formula they say will ensure that business owners will pay a higher individual tax rate on income that they receive as wages.The formula would be applied based on the circumstances of the business.That provision is not enough to satisfy the National Federation of Independent Business, which said in a statement it is unable to support the House tax reform plan in its current form.Placing even more pressure on lawmakers, the Peter G. Peterson Foundation is planning to spend $6 million on a nationwide ad campaign, including a TV commercial, that warns against a tax plan that adds to the national debt.The message of the campaign is that overhauling the tax code should grow the economy, not the debt, said Michael A. Peterson, the president and chief executive of the foundation, which advocates reining in federal budget deficits.
In Raising Interest Rates, Bank of England Issues ‘Brexit’ Warning:::::The action packed symbolic import.On a June morning last year, as Britain awoke to the startling news that voters had approved Brexit, the central bank governor, Mark Carney, took to television to offer assurances that help was at the ready to cushion against nasty consequences.Weeks later, the bank announced a quarter-point interest rate cut to spur economic activity.Now, nearly a year and a half later, Mr. Carney was taking that easy money back.Its signaling that the bank has a degree of confidence that that immediate post-referendum worry has been put to bed, said Lucy OCarroll, chief economist at Aberdeen Standard Investments, an asset management firm in London.But theres a long game to be played, and Mr. Carney is not convinced that Brexit is going to be anything other than harmful for the U.K. economy.Lifting interest rates tends to increase the value of a nations money, as investors arrive seeking higher returns.But markets pushed down the value of the British pound against both the dollar and the euro following the central banks action, an apparent reflection of worry about Britains economy and its trade with Europe.$ The price of the pound in dollars as of .The British pound has percent since it was valued at $1.47 just before the vote to leave the European Union on June 24, 2016.The clock is ticking toward a March 2019 deadline for negotiations between Britain and the European Union over their future dealings.So far, talks have produced a surplus of bitter recrimination and meager sign of an agreement.Uncertainty is already exacting a price.Nearly half of Britains exports are sold within the European Union, a stream of cars, liquor and pharmaceuticals that could confront tariffs absent a completed trade deal.As the markets factor in the prospect of diminished trade across the English Channel, they have pushed down the value of the pound by nearly 15 percent against the euro since last years Brexit vote.The falling currency has lifted the prices of Britains imported goods, squeezing households with inflation now running at a 3 percent annual rate.That has dented consumer spending, contributing to a marked slowdown in Britains economy.As the possibility looms that Britain might crash out of the European Union absent an agreement with the bloc, multinational companies are reassessing the merits of centering operations here, imperiling investment.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Londons status as a global financial center has in recent decades taken strength from rules that allow banking operations in Britain to serve clients across the European Union.Without a deal preserving that arrangement, Londons unique reach is imperiled.Global banks have in recent months inked leases for office space in Frankfurt, Dublin and Paris as they ready plans to move parts of their operations from Britain to places firmly within European confines post-Brexit.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Global auto manufacturers have similarly concentrated factories in Britain while exporting their wares across Europe.But as the potential for an unruly Brexit increases, auto companies are also calculating the merits of shifting production to European locales.The British government, headed by a weakened Prime Minister, Theresa May, has pinned hopes on halting this trend by convening negotiations toward striking a future trade deal with Europe.She wants those talks to start in December.That date is of more than random significance: Many multinational companies with operations in Britain hold board meetings in winter months to formulate plans for the next year.If December passes without sign of progress on a trade deal an outcome that is more than thinkable that will likely accelerate decisions by multinational companies to move pieces of their businesses to Europe.In that scenario, Britain risks a recession next year, said Peter Urwin, director of the Centre for Employment Research at Westminster Business School in London.At the very least, the odds are 50-50, he said.Central banks tend to lift rates when economies are strengthening.They make credit more expensive so as to guard against the side-effects of rapid expansion, such as rising prices and reckless investment.Yet the Bank of England, Mr. Urwin suggested, appears to be less concerned about inflation than positioning itself to step in with more help if the economy weakens.They are trying to get a little ammunition back in the armory, Mr. Urwin said.Many analysts assumed the bank was essentially forced to deliver the rate hike.Had it held back, that would have surprised investors a taboo in central banking while resonating as evidence of deepening concern about the health of the British economy.Investors might well have intensified their unloading of the British pound, exacerbating inflation, and increasing the strains facing the economy.Skipping the rate hike also would have put Britain further out of step with policymakers in the rest of the global economy, and especially the United States.The Federal Reserve has been lifting rates to return credit to more normal levels, following years of injections of extraordinarily cheap money.Yet in lifting rates, the Bank of England has slightly added to the headwinds assailing Britain on its continued slog toward Brexit.Retail and auto sales have been weak, even with ultracheap finance.Now, credit terms are likely to tighten along with variable mortgage rates.The cost of capital will climb slightly for companies already reluctant to invest in uncertain times.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Given the backdrop, investors concluded that another rate hike is unlikely anytime soon.Todays excitement is likely to prove only a short hiatus before the economy returns to another extended period of monetary policy inaction, declared Matthew Beck, lead U.K. economist with Oxford Economics in London.
Alibaba’s Earnings Jump as China’s Online Shopping Boom Continues:::::Still, the results released Thursday show that Alibaba still has ground to cover as it seeks to grow beyond e-commerce into more of a data and technology company.Apart from online shopping, its other businesses lost money.Bigger and Bigger Alibabas core business continues to be a money-spinner.That business generated nearly $3.6 billion in income during the quarter, about 50 percent more than a year ago.The company says nearly half a billion people now shop on its platforms annually.Photo Despite worries about a debt binge that could choke economic growth, Chinas new consumer class is expanding.That suggests the countrys online-shopping market, already the worlds largest, has room to grow yet.McKinsey estimates that the countrys middle class will expand to 315 million households by 2030, from 116 million households last year.In 2000, China had only two million middle-class households.Future Bets Alibaba has ranged far afield of e-commerce in recent years.It owns a movie studio, a soccer club and a Hong Kong newspaper, plus stakes in a variety of tech start-ups.The company is also spending $15 billion over the next several years on research in artificial intelligence and other cutting-edge fields.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.In the near term, though, investors are more interested in Alibabas recently announced investment of the same amount in logistics.Alibaba has long depended on outside companies to deliver packages.But Jack Ma, the companys founder and executive chairman, has said his goal is to ship anywhere in China within 24 hours, and anywhere in the world within 72.That will require a lot of spending.Offline to Online Alibaba has found ways to make more money from its shopping platforms.For instance, better targeting of ads at customers has helped generate more interest and sales from advertisers.Still, the company also wants to capture more of the 85 percent of retail sales in China that take place offline.Alibaba has been buying stakes in grocers and other brick-and-mortar stores since well before Amazons acquisition of Whole Foods this year.It has even opened its own grocery stores where purchases are made via smartphone app.These locations serve as hubs for delivering food to nearby homes, while also catering to shoppers who like to pick out fresh items, such as seafood, in person.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Alibaba says it is not interested in building a large grocery chain, however.The company says it wants to showcase the ways traditional retailers can incorporate online tools into their business with the hope that those retailers will then do so using tools and services provided by Alibaba.Going Global Mr. Ma has circled the planet and hobnobbed with world leaders in his effort to take the Alibaba brand global.The company has paid billions of dollars to take control of Lazada, an e-commerce company in Southeast Asia.And Mr. Ma pledged this year that Alibaba would create a million jobs in the United States by linking small American businesses with Chinese shoppers, who tend to view American-made goods as higher quality.But those efforts are not close to eclipsing Alibabas main businesses in China.In the latest quarter, Alibabas e-commerce business earned about 90 percent of its revenue at home.
Waymo Enlists AutoNation to Maintain Driverless Test Fleet:::::Photo Waymo, one of the leading forces in self-driving technology, is enlisting the largest auto retailer in the United States, AutoNation, to maintain and repair the growing number of driverless vehicles Waymo is testing around the country.No financial terms were disclosed.But the partnership suggests Waymo a unit of Googles parent, Alphabet is moving a step closer to putting driverless vehicles into ride-hailing fleets that would serve the general public, not just its own employees and others selected by the company to test them.AutoNation will help assure that Waymo vehicles are always in top condition as we bring fully self-driving cars to the public, John Krafcik, Waymos chief executive, said in a statement.Mr. Krafcik recently hinted that Waymo was further along in commercializing its self-driving technology than previously indicated.Were really close, he told reporters at a demonstration of Waymos driverless vehicles at Castle, its test center on a former Air Force base in Northern California.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Maintaining expensive and technology-packed self-driving vehicles is a main challenge for using them in moneymaking businesses, like ride-hailing fleets, said Michael J.

When Internships Don’t Pay, Some Colleges Will:::::We dont want our students to pick a field because it pays and overlook another field because it doesnt pay for an internship, said Meredith Daw, executive director of career advancement at the University of Chicago.There are 2,000 placements each year through Chicagos Jeff Metcalf Internship Program.Employers agree to cover the salary at least $11 an hour or the local minimum wage, whichever is higher.But when an organization cant afford to pay 40 percent cant the university provides a $4,000 grant for a 10-week stint.Starting last year, the universitys Odyssey Scholars low-income students like Ms. Eisenberg have been guaranteed a paid internship for their first summer.That, Ms. Daw said, is when they are at the greatest disadvantage compared to their peers with more of the social capital like parental connections needed to find internships on their own.Last summer, 232 students participated.Ms. Eisenberg interned at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, where she developed a machine learning model for its library.The grant helped defray airfare, her summer sublet and other expenses.Pace University posted more than 4,000 internships last year, about 40 percent of them unpaid, and provides grants for many internships in the nonprofit sector.Were not trying to proselytize with these students, but wed like their eyes to be open to the second and third sectors in our economy, said Rebecca Tekula, executive director of Paces Wilson Center for Social Entrepreneurship.The center pairs students with nonprofits in and around New York City, like Greyston Bakery, Housing Works and the Legal Aid Society.Elizabeth Pooran interned last year at Senior Planet Exploration Center in Chelsea, a community space designed to teach technology, including digital photography and the internet, to older adults to encourage them to lead independent, connected lives.And Latino U College Access, a fledgling nonprofit that works with first-generation college students, has used Pace interns for three of its five years.I always say that my organization was built with the support and by the hands of Pace University interns, said Shirley Acevedo Buontempo, the founder.Students in the Wilson internship program receive $16 an hour, or $4,480 for eight weeks.Some 120 students have participated since 2009, with grants totaling about $500,000.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Macalester College, too, subsidizes internships involving social missions, like helping integrate tuberculosis services into Georgias health system and fighting transgender discrimination.Last year, about 50 interns took part.This is an opportunity to try on a career no matter what their interest or major or their economic situation is, said Mindy Deardurff, dean of career development at the St. Paul campus.Especially for our students who have socioeconomic need, if we can get them in and let them try out some of the things they are so passionate about, it might get them over that hump of worrying about whether they can afford it.Amherst College distributed $1 million this past summer, 40 percent more than it did the previous year, helping 229 students take unpaid internships with nonprofit organizations and small start-ups.The money came from alumni gifts and $200,000 from the Jack Kent Cooke Foundation, which supports low-income college students.Because more than 80 percent of Amherst students go to graduate or professional school, some of the money is used to prepare them by financing research internships, study abroad and independently devised programs, said Emily C. Griffen, director of Amhersts Loeb Center for Career Exploration and Planning.Michael Loeb, president and chief executive of Loeb Enterprises, is an alumnus who has taken a particular interest in internships.In addition to offering paid stints at his own company, he has just started a program that matches start-ups in New York City with Amherst interns and covers their pay and living expenses.Its not surprising that alumni favor their alma mater.Over the past five years, alumni and parents have donated $4 million to Colgate University, enabling it to support some 200 students each year who want to take unpaid or low-paid internships, typically with nonprofits, the creative arts or to do research.Last summer, it spent $666,000, said Michael Sciola, associate vice president of institutional advancement and career initiatives.Colgate students can also come up with their own grant proposal, and the university will help them find a host who will turn that into an internship.We do allow students to do a self-designed summer, he said.For example, twin brothers received a grant to pay for travel to work on an archaeological expedition in Alaska.Mr. Sciola concedes that the connection between an immersive experience and a career might be less obvious than with an internship in the financial industry.Thats why students are more likely to take less career-driven internships in their first and second years, he said, when they are still exploring.Our overall goal is to empower our students to explore their interests with practical immersive experiences, he said, without the limitation of financial barriers.
A Disappearance in Berlin Clouds a Trade Deal in Vietnam:::::Vietnam could lose more than a beneficial free-trade agreement if it does not improve ties with Germany, said Doan Xuan Loc, a research fellow at the Global Policy Institute in London who studies the European Unions relations with Southeast Asian countries.It will also weaken Vietnam diplomatically and strategically, he said.Like China, Vietnam is fusing capitalism with its own brand of communism.The effort has produced impressive growth but also jitters among trading partners who fret about the governments harsh treatment of domestic dissidents and labor activists.Photo Worries about Chinas growing dominance underlie much of the drive to strike trade deals.Many Vietnamese fear their country will become more dependent on China as Beijing which is also in trade talks with the Europeans deepens its economic presence across Southeast Asia.Partly as a result, Vietnam is aggressively prospecting for new partners in an already crowded chessboard of global trading alliances.In 2015 alone, it signed trade deals with South Korea and with a group composed of Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Russia.The effort gained new urgency after the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the proposed free-trade agreement led by the United States, stalled earlier this year amid opposition from President Trump.Vietnam would have been a member and likely one of its biggest beneficiaries.The European deal is especially attractive for Vietnam because the European Union, which imported $39 billion in Vietnamese goods last year, is the countrys largest non-Asian investor and largest trading partner after China.A prolonged tiff with Germany, analysts said, could have repercussions for Vietnams economy that far outweigh any domestic political benefits from apprehending Mr. Thanh.The businessman was grabbed as part of an continuing corruption crackdown by Nguyen Phu Trong, a functionary in the Communist Party who became its general secretary last year after a bruising internal power struggle.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Nguyen Xuan Dien, a political blogger in Hanoi, the capital, likened Vietnams predicament to that of a frog sitting in a soup pot.The frog is already feeling the heat, he said.Vietnam could make some sort of apology, or concessions on human rights or labor issues.Several Vietnamese executives said in interviews that they were confident the standoff would somehow be resolved, even if they were not sure how.Photo Its a trade agreement, said Nguyen Chanh Phuong, the secretary general of the Handicraft and Wood Industry Association of Ho Chi Minh City, whose members have exported furniture to Europe since the 1990s.Theyll trade something.Le Hoai Anh, the chairwoman of Hal Group, a company in Ho Chi Minh City that distributes and sells European cosmetics, said she worried about trade disruptions or punitive measures that might lead to higher import tariffs.We dont know exactly how it will be, she said of Vietnams trading relationship with Europe.But we are expecting a bad situation.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.The German Foreign Office said in an email that the Vietnam trade deal would need to win approval in both the German and European parliaments, and that members of both bodies clearly saw the political implications of Mr. Thanhs disappearance.Vietnams Foreign Ministry did not respond to emailed questions.The deal is the European Unions second effort at a trade pact in Southeast Asia, after one with Singapore that is nearing ratification.The largest benefits for the E.U.would be in Germany, which last year imported $8 billion in goods from Vietnam including footwear, textiles, coffee and seafood and sold it $2.3 billion in machinery, equipment, motor vehicles, chemicals and other products.The deal would also create arbitration mechanisms aimed at giving European manufacturers, many of them German, more legal security here.For Vietnam, the upshot would be private-sector growth in an economy that has long been top-heavy with state-owned enterprises and overdependent on development aid.Beneficiaries would likely include companies in both established export industries, such as fisheries and textiles, and also in emerging ones like scooters, smartphones and furniture.Mr. Thanh, 51, had been a senior official in the southern province of Hau Giang and the chairman of PetroVietnam Construction, a subsidiary of the state oil giant PetroVietnam.He was accused of mismanagement that resulted in losses of about $147 million.Photo In late July, he was abducted outside a Sheraton Hotel in Berlins upscale Tiergarten district, his lawyers said, and bundled into a car with Czech plates.More than a week later, he was shown pleading for his governments forgiveness on Vietnamese state television.Advertisement Continue reading the main story George Orwell reloaded is how one of his Berlin lawyers, Petra Isabel Schlagenhauf, described the episode in a telephone interview.Nobody expected this, she said.Nobody.Top Vietnamese officials had asked their German counterparts to extradite him, according to Germanys Foreign Office.But Ms. Schlagenhauf said Mr. Thanh was convinced he would not receive a fair trial.Germany responded to the abduction by expelling two Vietnamese diplomats, suspending high-level bilateral visits and demanding an assurance that the law will not be violated again in this way in the future.The episode is absolutely unacceptable, and the case will certainly have to be taken into account in order for the trade deal to be ratified, said Marko Walde, the chairman of the German Business Association in Vietnam, whose members include the Vietnam subsidiaries of Audi, Bayer and Deutsche Bank.But Alicia Garcia-Herrero, an economist in Hong Kong who advised E.U.officials on the trade deal, said she believed it would go ahead so long as Hanoi found a scapegoat to blame its ambassador to Germany, for example.Germany cannot afford to ignore the potential benefits for its manufacturers, Ms. Garcia-Herrero added, or the leverage that a signed deal would give E.U.negotiators in their continuing trade talks with China.You spend years negotiating stuff you cant ratify?she said.The Chinese will laugh at them.
Emmanuel Macron’s Unwanted New Title: ‘President of the Rich’:::::For all the thunder, however, Mr. Macron, a former investment banker, is moving fast in the early days of his unexpected presidency to overhaul his countrys wary relationship with capitalism.His reforms major overhauls of Frances labor market, along with symbolic changes in fiscal policy are so far unchecked.Union demonstrations against him have fizzled.He has divided French labor, nearly a first in the Fifth Republic, by compromising on his reforms.But he has also maintained the essence of what he wanted: more flexibility for individual firms in carving out agreements with workers.Mr. Macrons plans have sailed through a Parliament with a big presidential majority, against a fragmented right and left.For now, hes winning the game, no point in hiding it, Jean-Luc Mlenchon, leader of France Unbowed, said in a television interview last weekend.Still, the new French presidents popularity ratings bounce up and down helped by a political persona that remains awkward outside the realm of the successful, and by speeches that are not always sensitive to class resentments.Mr. Macrons encounters with workers are often tense.Do-nothings, he called critics in one recent speech; people who are nothing, he said in another, referring to those one passes in train stations.Photo Last week the 39-year-old president successful at virtually every step in his rapid career trajectory got a rapturous reception at an elite engineering school outside Paris.It was easy to see that Mr. Macron, all smiles, was in his element.Advertisement Continue reading the main story This business of being the president of the rich, said Hugo Sevillia, 23, a student at Centrale Suplec in Saclay.It makes people mad who arent doing well, but I dont think its fair.Much of the hue and cry is over Mr. Macrons proposal to reduce a tax on the rich known here as the Solidarity Tax on Wealth in French, the Impt de Solidarit sur la Fortune, or I.S.F.The governments income from the tax is relatively modest.The taxs real value is its symbolism an emotional, longstanding one in a country where wealth is often perceived as synonymous with injustice.No president until Mr. Macron has dared go after the wealth tax since it was created, in a different form, under the first government of President Franois Mitterrand, a Socialist, in 1982.The tax aims at assets financial, property and otherwise above $1.52 million (1.3 million euros).Everybody with holdings above that sum has had to pay up, on a progressive scale: The more you own, the more you pay.This type of wealth tax has been eliminated almost everywhere else in the developed world.In Sweden, among other places, the elimination has had no effect on inequality, and there are signs it has actually spurred growth.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Meanwhile, in France the wealth tax has accounted for less than 2 percent of the governments total tax revenues.Mr. Macron and his economists contend it is nonetheless important to reduce the tax because the tranche is sliced off those accumulating capital.Capital gains will now be taxed at a flat 30 percent under Mr. Macrons plan, nearly half the previous maximum rate.Mr. Macron argues that he is merely trying to free capital for much-needed investment in Frances slow-growth, high-unemployment economy.His policies have nothing to do with setting one class off against another far from it, he insists.It is all about overturning the fraying, much despised, but paradoxically cherished status quo.Advertisement Continue reading the main story In a defiant recent television interview, Mr. Macron a president who has by now shown himself unafraid of sacred cows clenched his fists, waved his arms and showed no signs of retreating.Still, for all the criticism, some have defended his intentions.The I.S.F.is purely a symbol, said the ex-Harvard economist Philippe Aghion, now at the Collge de France, and one of Mr. Macrons principal economic advisers.Photo Weve got to stop being obsessed by the rich, and start being obsessed by poverty traps, Mr. Aghion said.President of the Rich is a thoroughly illegitimate charge against him, said Jean-Louis Bourlanges, a centrist deputy who is sympathetic to Mr. Macron, though not in his political movement.Its explained by the deep hostility of the French toward the rich, Mr. Bourlanges said.As soon as something is seen as favoring the rich, its also seen as an attack on the poor.But Mr. Bourlanges added that it was idiotic for Mr. Macron to present the suppression of the Solidarity Wealth Tax as the first thing you do.He should have said, well suppress it progressively.Mr. Macron has now eliminated non-real-estate assets from the tax, cutting it by some $3.7 billion.Isnt this just a gift to the rich?Mr. Macron was asked during the lengthy television interview, in language that echoed the attacks in parliament.Are you not the President of the Rich?he was asked.Mr. Macron bristled.I dont believe in this French jealousy which says, There are rich people; lets tax them and we will all feel better, Mr. Macron said testily.Advertisement Continue reading the main story He pointed to news reports showing that the big French fortunes dont even pay the Solidarity Wealth Tax, because they simply leave the country.So this is classic French hypocrisy, he said.In order for our society to do better, Mr. Macron argued, weve got to have people who succeed, and people will then say, thats great.But then he used a metaphor for the rich that left him open, again, to the elitist charge.He called them the first in the rope line.Mr. Macron, while vowing that the others who are fragile, we will protect them, added that if we throw stones at the first in the rope line, its the whole line that collapses.While Mr. Macrons phrase was clumsy and a bit arrogant, he was nonetheless on absolutely the right path in policy terms, said Mr. Bourlanges, the lawmaker.Macron is like a test-tube baby, he said.He came out of school and then it was a succession of bubbles.He lacks the popular touch.
Brett Ratner, Prominent Producer, Accused of Sexual Misconduct:::::A spokesman for Warner Bros. declined to comment.In addition to the cofinancing arrangement, Mr. Ratner will also remove himself from work on the studios adaptation of The Goldfinch, which he was set to produce.The New York Times spoke to several of the women interviewed by The Los Angeles Times, including Ms. Henstridge.Separately, The Times spoke to a former fashion stylist who said that Mr. Ratner had assaulted her in 2003.A lawyer for Mr. Ratner, Marty Singer, disputed the womens accusations to The Los Angeles Times.He also denied there had been any misconduct by Mr. Ratner in a statement to The New York Times, asserting that we are confident that his name will be cleared once the current media frenzy dies down and people can objectively evaluate the nature of these claims.Ms. Henstridge, in a phone interview with The Times on Wednesday, said she had fallen asleep while watching a movie with Mr. Ratner and a group of friends in an apartment in New York, and awoke to find herself alone with him.She said that when she got up to leave, Mr. Ratner tried to coax her into staying.When she declined, she said, he blocked the door, pushed her down and forced himself on her.In the wake of allegations against the producer Harvey Weinstein, whom dozens of women have come forward to accuse of misdeeds ranging from harassment to assault, Ms. Henstridge said she had struggled with whether to speak out.Every single day I woke up and realized, I cant let this go, she told The Times.This was not a confused lovers

trying mentally to figure out what to do with this experience that just happened.She said she struggled for years to make sense of the episode, and even attended a party for Mr. Ratner at the home the next day.In a letter, lawyers for Mr. Ratner disputed Ms. Foresters account, and said that Mr. Ratners recollection was substantially different.The letter asserted that the two were friendly at the time and remained so afterward.Attending the party the next day is completely inconsistent with the notion that something objectionable had occurred with my client the day before, the letter said.Mr. Ratner, who got his start making music videos, wields considerable influence in Hollywood as a successful producer of big-budget action movies.He directed all three Rush Hour films, a franchise that

of Ms. Newmans, Dennis Staroselsky, said she had told him about the encounter shortly after it happened in 2005.Ms. Newman also recounted the episode to The Los Angeles Times.Mr. Ratner could be generous and complimentary, according to several people who worked with him.He thanked every crew member by name during a screening of Rush Hour 2, Ms. Glatter said.Other women who appeared in the film told The New York Times that they had had positive experiences on set, and that Mr. Ratner had treated them professionally.Mr. Ratners behavior has occasionally gotten him into trouble.In 2011,

projector room.He basically pushes me into the room, comes in and closes the door behind him and shoves me against the wall, Ms. Forester said.Mr. Ratner began tugging at her clothes, she said, then masturbated and ejaculated on her.A friend of Ms. Foresters, Jen Bush, said that Ms. Forester told her of the encounter about a year ago.A spokeswoman for Mr. Evans declined to comment.Ms. Forester

assault is blurry, but I think my psychology around it was blurry.
Crops in 25 States Damaged by Unintended Drift of Weed Killer:::::The first problems emerged this spring, when reports began to flood state agricultural offices.In an effort to limit the damage, the E.P.A.announced last month that new instructions about how to apply the herbicide would be sent to farmers nationwide for use next year.Monsanto, BASF and DuPont the three companies that sell the dicamba formulations causing the problems have signed off on the new instructions, which prohibit application of the herbicide when winds are greater than 10 miles an hour.Farmers will also be required to take additional steps to clean up tanks where the herbicide is stored to make sure contamination does not result when the same equipment is used on conventional fields.Dicamba has been used in the United States since the late 1960s.But late last year, it was approved for the first time for over the top application, meaning spraying it on fields after the soybeans are already growing, instead of before they sprout.Genetically modified soybean seeds were designed by biotech firms to be resistant to dicamba, allowing it to be applied to kill weeds later in the growing season.Reuben Baris, the acting chief of the herbicides branch of the E.P.A., said that 2,708 complaints had been reported to state agriculture officials about dicamba crop damage as of mid-October.They came from 25 of the 34 states where the over the top application is approved for use.The largest number of complaints were filed in Arkansas, where there were 986 incidents, and Missouri, which had 310.Mr. Baris suggested the number of complaints understated the problem because most incidents went unreported.He estimated the actual number of damage incidents could be five times greater than the Missouri researchers found.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.It is an extremely high profile and significant situation, Mr. Baris said, calling the crop damage that has occurred unacceptable.The agency is still awaiting data on how the problem has affected soybean crop yields.The E.P.A., when it approved the over the top use of dicamba, notified the three manufactures that they would have to secure new approval of its use after two years.And Mr. Baris and Mr. Keigwin made clear on Wednesday that approval might be in jeopardy if the measures being taken for the next growing season did not significantly reduce the scope of the drift damage.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Sale of genetically modified seeds and related herbicides is worth tens of millions of dollars to these companies, which have already faced challenges as weeds have been growing resistant to another popular herbicide they sell, glyphosate.An estimated 22 million acres of soybean crops were planted with dicamba-tolerant G.M.O.seeds and treated with the over the top approach this year, out of the total estimated 89.5 million acres of soybeans planted nationwide.Some pesticide industry officials question whether the 3.6 million acre estimate represents the total number of acres for any farm that has even a small amount of damage, meaning actual crop damage might be much smaller.Several state officials asked E.P.A.officials at the Wednesday meeting how the agency would evaluate the extent of the dicamba drift problem at the end of 2018 growing season, and determine whether the corrective measures had gone far enough.Arkansas state officials have already moved toward banning the use of dicamba because of the crop damage in their state this year, though the pesticide companies are challenging that effort.Jay Vroom, chief executive of CropLife America, which represents the major pesticide manufacturers and who attended Wednesdays meeting, said he was confident the industry would successfully address the problem in the coming year.It is more in the manageable category, he said.Cynthia Palmer of the American Bird Conservancy, which is a member of an E.P.A.pesticide advisory committee, said farmers who did not use the genetically modified soybean seeds were being hurt.It seems like farmers have no choice but to buy dicamba-resistent seeds from Monsanto, she said, endorsing the moves the E.P.A.has taken to control the problem.I sure hope it works in the next growing season.
S.E.C. Warns Celebrities Endorsing Virtual Money:::::Photo The Securities and Exchange Commission took a first step on Wednesday to head off the recent trend of celebrities endorsing new virtual currencies, warning that they could be breaking laws.Entrepreneurs have been issuing the digital currencies through so-called initial coin offerings, or I.C.O.s, which have become a hot but largely unregulated method of fund-raising for technology projects.So far this year, some 270 projects have raised over $3 billion by selling new currencies to investors.The vast sums of money have drawn in celebrities, like the socialite Paris Hilton and the rapper the Game, who have promoted particular projects, generally in exchange for a payment of some sort.The S.E.C.said in a statement released on Wednesday afternoon that celebrities who promoted coin offerings could be violating multiple laws, including antifraud regulations and rules that govern investment brokers.Photo In language that suggested that the S.E.C.could take enforcement action against these celebrities, the statement promised that the agency would focus on these types of promotions to protect investors and to ensure compliance with the securities laws.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The regulatory warning followed an article in The New York Times in the past week about such celebrity endorsements.The article focused on a troubled project, known as Centra, that was promoted by the boxer Floyd Mayweather and the rapper DJ Khaled.
Panel Recommends Opioid Solutions but Puts No Price Tag on Them:::::The commission also appealed to the Trump administration to track more carefully the huge array of interdiction, prevention and treatment programs it is funding and to make sure they are working.We are operating blindly today, its report said.Regina LaBelle, who was chief of staff in the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy under President Barack Obama, said the recommendations recognized the importance of proper and appropriate treatments for addiction, particularly medications that help people avoid cravings and symptoms of withdrawal.But, she added, There needs to be more funding for this.The head of the commission, Gov.Chris Christie of New Jersey, a Republican, suggested in a television interview Sunday that Mr. Trump would soon ask Congress to allocate far more money for fighting the nations addiction problem.I would say that youre going to see this president initially ask for billions of dollars to deal with this, he said on ABCs This Week.The White House issued a statement thanking the commission and saying it would review the recommendations.It is hard to determine how much money is truly needed.When Senate Republicans added $45 billion in addiction treatment funds to an Obamacare repeal bill that ultimately failed, Gov.John Kasich of Ohio, a Republican, said that amount was akin to spitting in the ocean.More Reporting on Opioids Richard Frank, a health economics professor at Harvard Medical School who worked in the Obama administration, estimated that it could cost roughly $10 billion a year to provide medication and counseling to everyone with opioid use disorder who is not already in treatment.Treating opioid-dependent newborns, meeting the needs of children in foster care because of their parents addiction and treating hepatitis C and other illnesses common among opioid addicts would cost many billions more, Mr. Frank said.Mr. Frank also cautioned that block grants would not work if the administration decided to include federal Medicaid funding for addiction treatment in them.When one starts to carve out certain services as grants, as opposed to insurance funding, one undermines the insurance, he said.It is a method of killing Medicaid with 1,000 nicks.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Some of the commissions other recommendations included making it easier for states to share data from prescription drug monitoring programs, which are electronic databases that track opioid prescriptions, and requiring more doctors to check the databases for signs of doctor shopping before giving a patient opioids.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.The commission encouraged the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to review policies that it claimed discouraged hospitals and doctors from prescribing alternatives to opioids, especially after surgery.According to the commissions report, C.M.S.pays a flat, bundled payment to hospitals after patients undergo surgery, which includes treatment for pain.Because they get a flat fee, hospitals are encouraged to use cheap products and most opioid medications are generic and inexpensive.Purchasing and administering a non-opioid medication in the operating room increases the hospitals expenses without a corresponding increase in reimbursement payment, the report said.More broadly, the report said the federal government as well as private insurers should do a better job of covering a range of pain-management and treatment services, such as non-opioid medications, physical therapy and counseling.And it recommended that the Department of Health and Human Services and other federal agencies eliminate any reimbursement policies that limit access to addiction medications and other types of treatment, including prior authorization requirements and policies that require patients to try and fail with one kind treatment before getting access to another.One prevention measure the commission did not embrace is expanding syringe exchange programs, which public health experts say save money and lives by reducing the spread of H.I.V.and hepatitis C with contaminated syringes.I was hoping to see that in this report, Ms. LaBelle said.The commissions members Mr. Christie, Gov.Charlie Baker of Massachusetts, a Republican; Gov.Roy Cooper of North Carolina, a Democrat; Pam Bondi, the Republican attorney general of Florida; Patrick Kennedy, a former Democratic congressman from Rhode Island and Bertha Madras, a Harvard professor all voted for the final recommendations, which came about a month later than expected.His voice quaking with emotion, Mr. Kennedy said during the commissions meeting Wednesday that Congress needed to appropriate sufficient funds for the initiative, suggesting at least $10 billion.This town doesnt react unless it hears from real people who will vote in the next election, he said, nodding to guests who had testified about their families searing experiences with addiction, stigma, lack of treatment options and the refusal of insurance companies to cover treatment.Mr. Kennedy also noted that insurance coverage is crucial to fighting addiction; in another commission meeting earlier this year, he took Republicans to task for working to repeal the Affordable Care Act and cut Medicaid.
Swedish army to buy BONUS ammunition from BAE:::::Nov. 3 (UPI) -- A new contract awarded to BAE Systems calls for the delivery of 254 additional Bofors 155mm BONUS artillery rounds for the Swedish army, the company announced on Thursday.The additional artillery rounds are expected to strengthen Sweden's operational capabilities for its long range, indirect fire Archer artillery weapon systems.The Bofors 155mm BONUS artillery rounds are capable of detecting and striking heavily armored vehicles at a range slightly over 21 miles.When launched from any 155-millimeter artillery system, the BONUS carrier shell separates to deploy two sensor-fuzed munitions that then search for targets within a given footprint of up to 32,000 square meters.Each of the two expelled munitions independently seeks and neutralizes its own target.The army has used this smart munition since 2003."Because each BONUS shell carries two smart munitions, its mission success per round is far greater than with traditional ammunition, providing the Swedish army with clear advantages," Lena Gillstrm, managing director for BAE Systems' Weapon Systems business in Sweden, said in a press release."This order is part of a growing interest in BONUS around the globe and indicative of the system's reliability and success factor."Production on the contract will take place at BAE Systems' facility in Karlskoga, Sweden, and delivery is scheduled for sometime in 2019.
Decent labor figures, Nigerian oil threats, boost oil prices:::::Nov. 3 (UPI) -- Steady improvements in the U.S. labor market, coupled with militant threats against a major OPEC producer, helped support a soft rally in oil prices Friday.The U.S. Labor Department reported Friday that total non-farm payrolls jumped 261,000 last month, with food services and restaurant employment offsetting any of the declines that came as a result of Hurricanes Irma and Harvey.That beats the estimate early this week from payroll processor ADP, which reported private-sector employment increased by 235,000 from September to October The federal government added that those employed part-time because of economic reasons declined by 369,000 in October, another indication of post-hurricane resilience.More jobs means growing demand for energy products, something traders are watching for in oil and consumer fuels.U.S. levels of oil and gasoline held in storage have been on a steady decline for most of the quarter, indicating demand is drawing somewhat on the surplus for the five-year average for global crude oil inventories.After a wobbly session Thursday, crude oil prices returned to a rally that's extended for nearly a month.The price for Brent crude oil was up 0.58 percent at 9:20 a.m. EDT to $60.97 per barrel.West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark for the price of oil, was up 0.4 percent to $54.76 per barrel.Gains were supported elsewhere by a return to action from the Niger Delta Avengers, a militant group that last year claimed several attacks on infrastructure in the oil-rich Niger Delta."Our next line of operation will not be like the 2016 campaign which we operated successfully without any casualties," spokesman Murdoch Agbinibo said in a statement."This outing will be brutish, brutal and bloody."Nigeria is a member of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, but is exempt from the OPEC-led effort to balance the oversupplied market with coordinated production cuts.The Nigerian government lobbied for an exemption so it could steer oil revenue toward national security efforts.Nigeria's stance on the agreement matters as OPEC-ministers will consider extending the production agreement deep into 2018 during meetings later this month in Vienna.Elsewhere, U.S. labor figures may paint a mixed picture on economic momentum.Restaurant workers made up the bulk of the job gains, with industries like construction and mining showing little change in October.The average workweek for all sectors remains relatively unchanged, though those in the manufacturing sector were logging more in overtime.Wages, however, slipped in October by 1 cent per hour, after rising 12 cents in September.
Raytheon awarded $22.1M for Next Generation Jammer support:::::Nov. 3 (UPI) -- The Department of Defense on Thursday announced that Raytheon Co. has been awarded a $22.1 million contract for hardware and software requirements to support the Navy's Next Generation Jammer.The products provided by Raytheon will be installed on the Ground Power and Cooling System in support of the Next Generation Jammer.The modification was selected by the U.S. Navy in 2013 to replace the more than 40-year-old ALQ-99 jammer systems on the Boeing EA-18G Growler, an aircraft specifically designed for electronic warfare.In 2016, the U.S. Navy awarded Raytheon a $1 billion contract to develop and manufacture the Next Generation Jammer, according to Raytheon and Defense Department records.The Ground Power and Cooling System consists of "software changes to the pod operational flight program along with the following hardware; five ground power carts, five ground power kits, five ground cooling carts, five ground cooling kits, 12 common electronic unit connector kits, and four test access module kits," the Department of Defense said.Over 95 percent of the contract work will be performed in El Segundo, Calif., and is expected to be completed in December 2019.No funds are being obligated to Raytheon at time of award.
There will be blood, Nigerian militant group warns:::::Nov. 3 (UPI) -- To the international oil companies working in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria, a militant cease-fire is officially over, the Niger Delta Avengers said Friday."Our next line of operation will not be like the 2016 campaign which we operated successfully without any casualties," spokesman Murdoch Agbinibo said in a statement."This outing will be brutish, brutal and bloody."It's been nearly a year to the day since the group took credit for an attack on oil infrastructure in the Niger Delta region.The last time it took credit for an attack of note was during the second week of November 2016 when it said its rebel forces attacked an export pipeline controlled in part by a regional subsidiary of Royal Dutch Shell that has the capacity to carry as much as 300,000 barrels of oil per day.The NDA accused the government of Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari of favoring oil and gas interests over the interests of the people in the Niger Delta and its campaign had been blamed for pushing total Nigerian crude oil production to a 30-year low last year.This time, the NDA said it would target a floating production and storage facility under construction at a South Korean shipyard, to be operated by the Nigerian subsidiary of French supermajor Total."We are presently tracking and monitoring its movement," Agbinido said."And God willing, it shall not operate successfully in amidst the return of the fury of the Niger Delta Avengers."Total offered no comment when asked by UPI.After slipping into a formal recession last year, the Nigerian government said the contribution of oil to economic growth slipped slightly more than 2 percent.The government's Bureau of Statistics said at the time the economy, measured by gross domestic product, declined 2 percent year-over-year.Nigeria emerged from recession in the second quarter, after five straight quarters of contraction.Year-over-year growth for 2017 was about 0.6 percent.Economists at the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries said Nigeria produced 1.8 million barrels of oil per day last month, up 19 percent from the 2016 average.The NDA said some of its militants had switched sides and were now working with the Buhari administration, but it wouldn't stop its campaign until the Niger Delta was liberated."We can assure you that every oil installation in our region will feel warmth of the wrath of the Niger Delta Avengers," it said.Nigeria is a member of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries exempt for a multilateral agreement to trim production to balance an oversupplied market.Nigeria asked for exemption so it can steer oil revenue toward national security efforts.
Sanchez Energy trims spending plans for 2018:::::Nov. 3 (UPI) -- U.S. shale player Sanchez Energy said that it expects to cut spending next year, after reporting a record-setting rate of production in the third quarter."As 2017 draws to a close, we expect capital spending to be between $525 million and $550 million for the full year," CEO Tony Sanchez III said in a statement."We anticipate that 2018 capital spending will be $75 million to $100 million less than 2017."Sanchez is one of the larger operators in the Eagle Ford shale basin in Texas and added more than 300,000 acres to its portfolio through a March acquisition from rival shale player Anadarko Petroleum.The company said third quarter production increased 43 percent over the same period last year and reached a record rate of around 80,000 barrels of oil equivalent in the early part of the fourth quarter in part because of increased activity in the Eagle Ford shale.The Eagle Ford shale basin was in the path of Hurricane Harvey, which swept over most of Texas in early September.The company said it suspended some operations because of the storm, but production was relatively spared.In an update on operations after Harvey dissipated, Sanchez said production was around 75,000 barrels of oil per day, in line with its expectations for the third quarter.Sanchez raised around $100 million in cash from the sale of non-core assets in the Eagle Ford in the third quarter.The company's average cost per barrel of oil and natural gas production, meanwhile, was up 29 percent from the same period last year.Of the seven shale basins monitored by the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the forecast for Eagle Ford oil production is the second lowest after Haynesville, which is largely a natural gas basin.The EIA said Eagle Ford production should be around 1.2 million barrels per day this month a gain of less than 1 percent from October.Production from the Permian shale, largely situated in Texas, is expected to increase by about 2 percent for a November average of 2.6 million barrels per day.Sanchez spent all but 6 percent of its total capital expenditures in the third quarter on drilling-related activities.
Enbridge touts environmental record in Line 3 tours:::::Nov. 3 (UPI) -- From the Canadian side of the border, pipeline company Enbridge Energy said it was putting its environmental record on display for its Line 3 overhaul.Enbridge is proposing an overhaul of the Line 3 segment of a broader network that extends through parts of Canada and into the northern United States.The proposal for Line 3 includes a $4.2 billion Canadian component and a $2.9 billion U.S. component.Enbridge said replacements and upgrades to the 50-year-old system are the most efficient way to ensure the infrastructure is reliable.The company said it hosted tours of parts of the activity under way on the Canadian side of the border for members of the indigenous community.Brad Kilgour, an environmental advisor for the company, said the latest tour included a drilling site under the Saskatchewan River."I've been at lots of community events and open houses before, but the opportunity for them to see this type of activity first-hand was, I think, valuable to them," he said in a statement."Enbridge is doing some really good things on this project, and we really like to show what we're doing."The State Department under President Donald Trump said Enbridge could move forward with plans to build a three-mile section of its Alberta Clipper oil pipeline across the border.The company three years ago connected Alberta Clipper to its existing Line 3 pipeline through to the United States while it waited for approval for the new cross-border section.Enbridge now says it needs to make improvements on its Line 3 system that runs from Canada through Minnesota.Construction on the entire network to a terminal in Wisconsin began in 2010 and Enbridge had used existing corridors to facilitate the shipment of nearly 900,000 barrels of oil per day.A pipeline incident tied to Husky Energy in 2016 put about 1,500 barrels of oil on the banks of the North Saskatchewan River.The heavier type of oil found in Canada has the potential to sink in water and mix in with river sediment, making cleanup operations complex.A spill from an Enbridge system in Michigan in 2010 was the largest inland incident in modern U.S. history.The Line 3 proposal is under review still in the United States.Some public hearings of the plans in Minnesota were canceled by authorities because of "logistical and safety issues" stemming from protests.
U.S. exploration and production slowing down:::::Nov. 3 (UPI) -- While higher than last year, a survey of U.S. exploration and production activity in October suggests the sector may go into hibernation during the winter.The analytics division of commodity pricing group S&P Global Platts recorded 1,033 rigs in active service in the United States last month, down about 1 percent from the previous month.Rig counts serve as a metric for activity geared toward exploration and production and serve as a loose barometer to gauge sector confidence.Rig counts plummeted last year under strains from lower crude oil prices, but have since recovered on improved market conditions.The price for West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark for the price of oil, was near $55 per barrel early Friday, up by almost 23 percent from this date last year.The October rig count is up 62 percent from last year.Crude oil prices have been rallying for most of the quarter, with very few day-to-day declines recorded over the past few weeks.U.S. markets were idled by hurricanes for part of last month, though Trey Cowan, an industry analyst at Platts, said he was surprised market forces weren't enough to bring net gains in exploration and production."Where the rigs have gone idle of late is interesting because the changes fly in the face of what has happened in the commodities markets," he said in the emailed report."For example, it was rigs drilling for oil that showed some weakness during the past month, despite prices for West Texas Intermediate crude oil having generally improved."Drilling services company Baker Hughes offers weekly snapshots of rig activity.For the week ending Oct. 27, Baker Hughes reported 888 rigs working inland in the United States, a drop of 9 percent from the previous week.Total offshore rigs were static.For October, Platts counted 994 rigs working inland, a loss of 1 percent from the previous month, and 31 rigs in the Gulf of Mexico, a 6 percent drop, though offshore rig counts were likely impacted by hurricanes.The government said that about 92 percent of the total Gulf oil production and 77 percent of the natural gas production was offline because of the impact from Hurricane Nate at the peak."Over the coming winter we would not be surprised to see a continued seasonal flattening of rig activity as the holidays and the exhausting of yearly capital budgets tend to take a toll," Cowen said.Federal data show total crude oil production in August, the last full month for which data are available, was 0.3 percent lower than July.
Spain's Repsol notches profit win on strong production:::::Nov. 3 (UPI) -- Spanish energy company Repsol reported a strong profit for the first nine months of the year on the back of large production gains and big new discoveries.Through September, the company said it earned a net profit of $1.8 billion, a 41 percent increase over the same period last year.The company said the performance showed its resilience and discipline in a market where crude oil prices are still low by historical standards."International raw material benchmark prices remained in a low range throughout the period, although in September Brent crude reached $59 per barrel, a level that hadn't been seen since July 2015," the company said.Lower crude oil prices last year starved energy companies of the capital needed for robust exploration and production programs.Repsol added that its debt over the last 12 months was down 30 percent.For exploration and production, known as the upstream segment, Repsol reported a net income of $567 million, driven by "significant" wins in the United States and in Trinidad and Tobago.Most of the production from the United States comes from inland shale basins, though Repsol noted part of its success came from the start of operations at its Buckskin project in the deep waters of the Gulf of Mexico.In August, production started at the Juniper gas field in Trinidad and Tobago, where reserve estimates are the equivalent of two years of gas demand from the Spanish economy.Production for the company averaged 688,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.Output was boosted by the resumption of operations in Libya, which has moved in fits and starts over the year.Libya is a member of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, but exempt for a production cut agreement so it can use oil revenue for national security.Last month, the chairman and board of directors at the Libya National Oil Corp. met in London with representatives from Spanish energy company Repsol to review production planning, security challenges and ways to mitigate risk.The company reported a net loss of $2.26 billion for fourth quarter 2015, just as crude oil prices were targeting historic lows.For full-year 2016, however, the company, also one of the largest refiners in the world, said it recorded its highest net income in the last four years.
Texas applauds free-market move on electric vehicles:::::Nov. 3 (UPI) -- A Texas energy regulator said a proposal to eliminate federal tax breaks for electric vehicles keeps the government from falsely distorting the energy market.At least six sections of the 429-page bill meant to overhaul the federal tax code extend into the energy sector.While some considerations are extended for solar and small-wind energy projects, a tax break for electric vehicles would expire for those vehicles placed into serve at the beginning of the 2018 tax year, if the measure passes.The bill was introduced Thursday by U.S. Rep. Kevin Brady, R-Texas, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee.On Tuesday, the Texas Railroad Commission, the state energy regulator, said the tax break for electric vehicles was an attack on the energy industry."I have been impressed with the leadership our Texas delegation in the House and Senate has taken on issues of energy," Texas Commissioner Wayne Christian, a Republican, said in a statement after the bill was introduced."I look forward to ... work[ing] with them in the future to ensure Texas continues to create jobs and economic growth."Christian said the subsidies are "feel-good" tax breaks that have few tangible impacts on the environment.The International Energy Agency, however, notes that 23 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions come from the transportation sector."Electrifying road transportation has multiple benefits, including the reduction of emissions of local pollutants and noise and the promotion of energy security and decarbonization through increased energy efficiency and diversification," an IEA report read.The federal subsidy offers as much as $7,500 in tax credits per vehicle.The Texas commissioner, however, said it distorts the market, adding he was pleased his state counterpart took up free-market principles at the federal level."Additional subsides exist at a state level, and I hope Texas has a similar discussion prior to the next legislative session," he said.The IEA said electric vehicle sales are on the decline, though recent gains have been impressive.Growth in sales in 2015 was 77 percent, but below 50 percent from their 2010 levels last year.By the IEA's estimates, electric vehicle sales "have a long way to go" before reaching a market portion large enough to put a dent in oil demand or greenhouse gas emissions.In October, Colorado Gov.John Hickenlooper led a handful of Western state leaders in unveiling plans to support an electric-vehicle corridor across more than 5,000 miles of highway.About 2 percent of new vehicle sales in Colorado are plug-ins and Hickenlooper's office estimated clean-energy jobs support more than $3.5 billion in wages.
BAE receives $40M from Lockheed for sensor technology:::::Nov. 2 (UPI) -- BAE Systems announced Wednesday that the defense contractor has begun production on its sensor technology for the Long Range Anti-Ship Missile, or LRASM, following a $40 million prime contractor order from Lockheed Martin.The sensor technology will enable the AGM-158C LRASM anti-ship cruise missile that's currently under development for the U.S. Navy to "seek and attack specific high-threat maritime targets within the groups of ships, including those protected by sophisticated anti-aircraft system," the company said.The sensor technology will be used by the U.S. Navy and the U.S. Air Force, BAE said.The LRASM is said to be a "next-generation" precision-guided stealth missile that relies on precision routing and sensor guidance technology versus intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance systems, network links or GPS navigation.The missile can also operate in contested domains and all weather and lighting conditions, according to BAE Systems."The production of our advanced sensor for LRASM is a testament to the strength of our technology and our ability to transition the capability from airframes to missiles," said Joseph Mancini, LRASM program manager at BAE Systems."Precision guidance and advanced electronics are areas where we have leading capabilities, and where we can provide warfighters with an advantage on the battlefield."Work on the sensor technology will be conducted at BAE Systems' facilities in Nashua, N.H., and Wayne, N.J.
United Technologies awarded $19M contract for F-35 materials:::::Nov. 2 (UPI) -- Pentagon officials announced Wednesday that United Technologies Corp., Pratt & Whitney Military Engines is being awarded more than $19 million for materials in support of the F-35 Lighting II joint strike fighter aircraft production.The contract awarded from the Naval Air Systems Command is a modification to a previously awarded cost-plus-incentive-fee and fixed-price-incentive-firm-target contract signed in April 2015 for an estimated $2.24 billion for a over a four year period.The work on that contract is set to be completed August 2019.Wednesday's contract announcement calls for the procurement of extra-long-lead items in support of the low-rate initial production Lot XII F-35 Lightning II joint strike fighter aircraft production.The items under order include hardware and aids for both the conventional takeoff and landing systems for the U.S. Air Force and Navy and non Defense Department partners and foreign military customers, as well as for short takeoff and vertical landing propulsion systems for the U.S. Marine Corps version of the aircraft.The majority of the work will be completed in East Hartford, Ct., where United Technologies Corp., Pratt & Whitney Military Engines is located, as well as other locations across the country and overseas.The work is expected to be completed by November 2019.
Oil price surge cooling, but market holds at historic highs:::::Nov. 2 (UPI) -- Crude oil prices drifted further away from recent highs Thursday as geopolitical spats over sanctions put Russia on the offense about oil production.Oil prices moved lower in recent sessions as markets readjust after the U.S. hurricanes upended the energy sector in the world's largest economy.The U.S. Energy Information Administration reported Wednesday that domestic oil inventories declined 2.4 million barrels, larger than an estimate from the analysts surveyed by S&P Global Platts, but far less than the 5.1 million draw reported by the American Petroleum Institute a day earlier.Inventories matter for traders looking at the surplus on the five-year average in global crude oil inventories.The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and a handful of big producers like Russia are working to drain the surplus with coordinated production cuts, and that effort helped pull oil markets from the bottom reached in early 2016.Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak was defiant in the face of tightened U.S. sanctions that target the country's energy sector.The Kremlin said recently that sanctions were cover for U.S. efforts to tap into the European energy market and Novak said Thursday the Russian energy sector was unfazed by the latest push."On the whole, it is not going to affect Russia's production," he was quoted by Russian news agency Tass as saying.Russia is the largest contributor to the production cut agreement that's not a member of OPEC.The price for crude oil was lower early Thursday.Brent crude oil, the global benchmark, was down 0.3 percent at 9:20 a.m. EDT to $60.29 per barrel.West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark for the price of oil, was barely changed, up just 0.04 percent to $54.32 per barrel.Markets overall may be reacting Thursday to a decision by the Bank of England to raise its key policy rate to 0.5 percent in an effort to market a 2 percent inflation target, but added a note of caution about the road ahead as the country charts a path out of the European Union."Monetary policy cannot prevent either the necessary real adjustment as the United Kingdom moves towards its new international trading arrangements or the weaker real income growth that is likely to accompany that adjustment over the next few years," it said.For markets, the push above $60 per barrel represents new territory for oil, but the situation may be cooling off.An emailed morning fundamentals report from London oil broker PVM said at least some of the rally was supported by temporary factors."The aftershock of the U.S. hurricane season was still felt last month in the form of falling production and falling product stocks," the report read."The rise of geopolitical premium also contributed to the jump in oil prices."
U.S. sanctions won't hinder oil production, Kremlin says:::::Nov. 2 (UPI) -- U.S. sanctions that target the Russian energy sector won't do anything to influence the country's crude oil production, the country's energy minister said.The U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control amended Russian sanctions with respect to the energy sector, blocking U.S. entities from helping with companies with "the potential" to produce oil in Russian territory or shale projects anywhere in the world.The amended list makes reference to projects "initiated on or after Jan.29."Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said Thursday the sanctions are nothing new, relate mostly to foreign projects where Russian companies have more than a 35 percent interest and deal only with new projects slated for a January start date."On the whole, it is not going to affect Russia's production," he was quoted by Russian news agency Tass as saying.The Kremlin said earlier this week that sanctions were designed to give the United States a competitive edge in the European energy sector.A spokesperson for Polish energy company PKN Orlen confirmed to UPI on Thursday that it recently purchased about 730,000 barrels of crude oil from the United States.Russia's stance on oil production matters for the broader market because it's the largest contributor to an effort to balance an over-supplied market with production cuts that's not a member of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.The OPEC-led effort sidelines about 1.8 million barrels per day from the market and, while more U.S. oil is on the open market, most of that is going to Asian economies where it's competitive against other grades.The price for West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark for the price of oil, was $3.90 per barrel less than Dubai, a Middle East benchmark, and $4.80 less than Urals, the Russian benchmark, early Thursday.Saudi Arabia, the de facto head of OPEC, has suggested it was ready to do whatever it takes to balance the market and several ministers have hinted the agreement could be extended deep into 2018.Novak last month said the agreement could be extended into summer 2018.
Iraq defends oil sector transparency:::::Nov. 2 (UPI) -- Iraq said it was in a unique position as an oil producer in the region with its steadfast commitment to supporting transparency in the industry.Iraqi Oil Ministry officials said Thursday the government was committed to the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative.Overall, the Iraqi oil minister said its release of information "always" included export data and its contribution to transparency was unparalleled in the region.The EITI said last week that Iraq had made encouraging steps toward transparency in its oil exports, but was short of what's needed to demonstrate adequate progress."Iraq will have 18 months to carry out corrective actions and will be temporarily suspended in the meantime," the EITI board said in a statement.Oil accounts for more than 90 percent of Iraq's budget revenue, which the EITI said put the Middle East producer in a unique position when it comes to disclosing all of its sector information.For some metrics, like reporting oil sales on a cargo-by-cargo basis, the group said Iraq stands alone."Continued efforts are particularly noteworthy given the security situation in the country over the last decade and the broader political and regional circumstances," the board's statement read.Iraqi forces this summer liberated northern federal provinces from the group calling itself the Islamic State.Full liberation from key cities like Mosul, meanwhile, coincided with a referendum of independence in the semiautonomous northern Kurdish provinces.Fighting broke out between both sides and the federal Iraqi government now claims control over the oil in Kirkuk, a territory of dispute between Kurdish and federal authorities.Of the more than 30 metrics included on the EITI scorecard, Iraq was performing in at least "meaningful" ways in less than half.Good marks were given for monitoring production, though metrics like reporting the distribution of revenue were considered inadequate.
Shell's strategy is working, CFO says:::::Nov. 2 (UPI) -- A day after closing on the sale of billions of dollars in assets, Shell said its net quarterly profit of more than $4 billion showed "our strategy is working.""The competitive performance is further evidence of Shell's growing momentum and strengthens our firm belief that our strategy is working," Chief Financial Officer Jessica Uhl said.Shell said Thursday its net profit of $4.1 billion came from all of its business segments, though earnings came mainly from refining, higher production from new fields and improved market conditions.Net profit for the second quarter was $3.6 billion, up from the $1 billion reported for the second quarter 2016, but down about 4 percent from the first quarter.The price for Brent crude oil was near $51 per barrel when Shell announced second quarter results and was around $60.50 per barrel early Thursday."Upstream [exploration and production] generated almost half of the $10 billion cash flow from operations excluding working capital this quarter, at an average Brent oil price of $52 per barrel," CEO Ben van Beurden said in a statement.Realized crude oil prices were 4 percent better than the second quarter.Lower crude oil prices last year hobbled most major oil companies and Shell, retooling after its tie up with British company BG Group, set a target of trimming $30 billion from its portfolio by 2018.The completion of sales of assets in Gabon and in the North Sea, announced Wednesday, put the company $4.4 billion closer to its goal and Uhl said Shell has completed $20 billion in divestments to date.Capital spending in the third quarter was lower than the second by 11 percent.Uhl said the performance tooled Shell for future success as a "nimbler" company.For exploration and production, Shell highlighted operations in the oil-rich Niger Delta region of Nigeria.From the second phase of its Gbaran-Ubie project, which started this quarter, Shell expects peak production of around 175,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day by 2019.Nigeria is a member of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries exempt from a multilateral deal to balance an over-supplied market with production cuts because it needs oil revenue for national security purposes.
European lender closer to green finance goals:::::Nov. 2 (UPI) -- After signing an agreement in New Delhi with a global solar alliance, the European bank for development said it moved closer to its green finance goals The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development said Thursday it signed an agreement with the International Solar Alliance that envisions deep collaboration on the solar energy front."This is a very important agreement for the EBRD, which has always been eager to share its expertise with new partners and also to learn from them," EBRD President Suma Chakrabarti said in a statement."With the ISA we share the vision of sustainable development and of green energy, which ultimately benefits the global economy."To date, the EBRD said it's invested more than $4.5 billion directly on renewable energy, backing the development of 6.5 gigawatts of renewable energy capacity in more than 20 countries.The bank said it's now "well on the way" to its commitment of sending 40 percent of its annual investments toward green finance by 2020.European Union President Jean-Claude Junker this year said the bloc was setting its sights on becoming a global leader in renewable energy development as the United States signals its intention to leave the international Paris climate agreement.With Nicaragua joining recently, only the United States and Syria are standing on the sidelines.Juncker in June said the U.S. decision, however, had only strengthened the resolve of countries and leaders committed to taking action against climate change.The British and French governments said this year they'd work toward a benchmark of banning the sales of new gasoline- and diesel-powered vehicles from its roads beginning in 2040.For renewable energy, nine countries that share a border with the North Sea agreed last year to improve infrastructure to support offshore wind.Germany leads among European nations in terms of offshore wind energy growth, though Great Britain has more offshore wind capacity installed.In an apparent swipe at U.S. President Donald Trump's campaign slogan of "Make America Great Again," Junker said in September that "Europe will ensure we make our planet great again."The U.S. renewable energy sector has, nonetheless, started to generate organic growth.An annual report from the Natural Resources Defense Council said some components of the renewable energy sector have accelerated faster than the government estimated.Wind power capacity, for example, was 350 percent above a government forecast from 10 years ago.
U.S. offshore has unique oil export potential:::::Nov. 2 (UPI) -- Big energy companies with deep pockets could carve out a durable U.S. position on the global energy market with offshore production, analysis found.The U.S. Energy Information Administration reported total crude oil exports topped 2 million barrels per day for the first time since a 40-year-old ban on exports was lifted under President Barack Obama in 2015.Geoffrey Craig, the oil futures editor for commodity pricing group S&P Global Platts, said in an emailed report that exports were supported by the lower price for West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark for the price of oil, relative to Brent, the global benchmark."This trend [for exports] is not surprising with Brent's premium to WTI growing from approximately $3 per barrel in mid-August to $5-$7 per barrel most of the time since September," he said.WTI was less than Brent by about $6 per barrel early Thursday.That means U.S. oil is competitive on the open market when compared to other grades.Craig said another factor supporting exports is that total U.S. crude oil production has been, at around 9.5 million barrels per day, about 1 million bpd higher than last year, even as market pressures continue to constrain some spending.Most forecasts point to the booming Asian economies as the likely source of future demand and, in October, U.S. shale producer Continental Resources said it designated its first-ever batch of oil for the Chinese market.Sandy Fielden, the director of research, commodities and energy at Morningstar, said oil from the U.S. Gulf of Mexico may be more attractive to Asian markets than the "low-hanging crude export resource" like inland shales, which are lighter than the medium grades of oil that overseas refiners are tooled for."In the current circumstances, we believe that Gulf of Mexico producers could grab a permanent share of this market in coming years," he said in an emailed market report.U.S.Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke said the next auction of more than 75 million acres of federal waters in the Gulf of Mexico, slated for early next year, will be the largest ever in the national history of offshore development.The government estimates the lease area holds as much as 1.1 billion barrels of oil and 4.4 trillion cubic feet of natural gas Cindy Giglio, a principal energy merger and acquisition analyst at IHS Markit, told UPI last week that the Gulf of Mexico is an attractive return on investment, in part because of existing infrastructure and an available workforce.Fielden, meanwhile, said deepwater production probably won't ever be cheaper than other markets, but it needs to stay competitive because most international refiners aren't configured to process the type of oil found in the Lower 48 states.Because of this, he said, oil from the Gulf of Mexico has an edge on the export market, but if companies want to take advantage of that, they need to be disciplined."While smaller U.S. independent producers have made shale their forte, major oil companies and larger independents have deep experience offshore," he said."Now that exports are on the table, the majors could easily leverage their home plate advantage to grab a larger international market share-provided they are willing to roll the dice and invest."
Minnesota oil pipeline review 'half-baked,' opponent says:::::Nov. 2 (UPI) -- A review of plans by Enbridge Energy to overhaul an oil pipeline through Minnesota was "half-backed," the regional chapter of the Sierra Club said.The next phase of a state review of the plans to overhaul the oil pipeline began Wednesday and runs through Nov. 15th.Enbridge aims to spend more than $7 billion to upgrade the 50-year-old system, noting that operating the aging infrastructure carries more risk than running oil through a "newly constructed, modern pipeline."An administrative judge in the case told the state Public Utilities Commission, the vetting authority, that an environmental impact statement on the proposal was adequate.According to Margaret Levin, the director of the regional chapter of the Sierra Club, the impact statement included several calculation errors and fell short of its review of alternatives."The people of Minnesota deserve a full accounting of the risks of this project, not a half-baked, incomplete review of a project that would dramatically increase the amount of toxic tar sands running through our state," she said in a statement.In more than 125 pages of testimony submitted in late October, Kate O'Connell, an energy regulation manager at the Minnesota Department of Commerce, said it doesn't appear Enbridge actually needs the overhaul to boost capacity on the broader network because state refiners have been operating at near capacity.The company said the overall demand for fuels in Minnesota and the broader energy sector warrants the infrastructure, even if demand were to decline.The pipeline review process has been met with stiff opposition in Minnesota.Public hearings were canceled last week by authorities in St.Cloud because of "logistical and safety issues" stemming from protests at a convention center.Minnesota Gov.Mark Dayton said he was waiting until the entire review process was completed, adding the PUC was independent of his administration.The commission is expected to make a decision on the project by early 2018.
Royal Canadian Air Force to buy air-to-air missiles from U.S.:::::Nov. 1 (UPI) -- The State Department announced Wednesday a possible sale of up to 32 AIM-120D Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missiles to one of America's "Five Eyes" partner, Canada.Congress was notified of the possible $140 million sale on Tuesday, which includes the 32 AMRAAMs, as well as 18 AMRAAM Captive Air Training Missiles; four AMRAAM Non-Development Item-Airborne Instrumentation Units, two AMRAAM Instrumented Test Vehicles, seven spare AMRAAM guidance units and four spare AMRAAM control sections for use on their F/A-18 aircrafts."Included in the sale are containers; storage and preservation; transportation; aircrew and maintenance training; training aids and equipment, spares and repair parts; warranties; weapon system support and test equipment; publications and technical documentation; software development, integration, and support; system integration and testing; U.S. Government and contractor engineering, technical, and logistics support; and other related elements of logistics and program support," the Defense Security Cooperation Agency said in a press release.The missiles will be used on Royal Canadian Air Force fighter aircraft and are said to contribute to the foreign policy and national security objectives of the U.S. by helping to improve the security of a NATO ally.DSCA says the sale of armament is required to support the Royal Canadian Air Force fighters to "optimally fulfill" both North American Aerospace Defense and NATO missions.The deal also meets the U.S. Northern Command's goals of combined air operation's interoperability and standardization between Canadian and U.S. forces, according to the press statement.The State Department assesses that the proposed sale of equipment and support will not alter the basic military balance in the region, in addition to having no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness as a result of the sale.Raytheon Missile Systems, out of Tucson, Ariz., will provide the equipment and support for the Royal Canadian Air Force.
Fitzgerald, McCain collisions were 'avoidable,' U.S. Navy report finds:::::Nov. 1 (UPI) -- The U.S. Navy has concluded that two collisions between Navy destroyers and commercial vessels earlier this year were "avoidable," and were the result of multiple human errors in a report published Wednesday morning.The Navy concluded in its report, released Wednesday, that the crew and leadership on board failed to plan for safety, habitually committed basic navigational errors and were ineffective at using onboard navigational tools to respond adequately to the pending collision with the commercial vessels."Many of the decisions made that led to this incident were the result of poor judgment and decision making of the commanding officer," the report said."That said, no single person bears full responsibility for this incident.The crew was unprepared for the situation in which they found themselves through a lack of preparation, ineffective command and control, and deficiencies in training and preparations for navigation."The USS John S. McCain, a guided missile destroyer named after Arizona Sen. John McCain's grandfather and father, both of whom were Navy four-star admirals, was involved in a collision with the merchant oil tanker Alnic MC on Aug. 21., near Singapore.The wreck claimed the lives of 10 U.S. Navy Sailors and injured five more with extensive damage to both ships.The August crash of the McCain came less than two months after another Seventh Fleet ship, the guided-missile destroyer USS Fitzgerald, collided with a container ship in Tokyo Bay, leaving seven U.S. sailors dead.Investigators found that naval officers on the USS Fitzgerald possessed an "unsatisfactory level of knowledge of the International Rules of the Nautical Road," and that "watch team members were not familiar with basic radar fundamentals, impeding effective use."For the USS John S. McCain, a "loss of situational awareness" and corresponding mistakes while operating the ship's steering and propulsion system contributed to the ultimate crash, the investigators report.The Navy's report follows the firing of two top Naval officers from their positions on the USS John S. McCain back in October, with Cmdr.Alfredo J. Sanchez, the commanding officer of the Arleigh Burke class destroyer, and his executive officer, Cmdr.Jessie L. Sanchez.Both were relieved of their duties by Navy Vice Adm. Phil Sawyer, the commander of the Navy's Seventh Fleet, "due to a loss of confidence" and reassigned.The Navy reports that the command leadership's schedule on the USS Fitzgerald fatigued the crew prior to the collision and that leadership failed to assess the risks of fatigue and implement mitigation measures to ensure adequate crew rest.On the McCain, the report states that "leadership failed to provide the appropriate amount of supervision in constructing watch assignments for the evolution by failing to assign sufficient experienced officers to duties."The McCain and Fitzgerald collisions have spotlighted issues in the Navy's Seventh Fleet, headquartered out of Japan, as the wrecks underscore leadership failures and the corrosion of training standards, based on Congressional testimony alluding to naval crews being overworked and spread thin.In September, the Government Accountability Office reported that a reduction in Navy crew sizes was contributing to safety risks, with some sailors working over 100 hours a week.Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, has called for an immediate end to U.S. sailors working over 100 hours a week as Navy leaders grapple with growing ship collisions and worn-out crews."I think I know what 100 hours a week does to people over time and that has been standard procedure for a long time," McCain said during a September hearing of the SASC focused on the collisions."I'm glad you've got RAND and whoever the hell else it is that is studying [the issue]... [but] you could make the change tomorrow," McCain added.The publication of the Navy's report comes a day after the Navy held closed-door briefings for Congressional lawmakers on Capitol Hill on its findings and recommendations -- a broader review of the Seventh Fleet's operational tempo, training, equipment and maintenance is expected to be released on Thursday."In the Navy, the responsibility of the Commanding Officer for his or her ship is absolute.Many of the decisions made that led to this incident were the result of poor judgment and decision making of the Commanding Officer," investigators write in the report."That said, no single person bears full responsibility for this incident.The crew was unprepared for the situation in which they found themselves through a lack of preparation, ineffective command and control, and deficiencies in training and preparations for navigation."
Raytheon awarded contract for computer systems on Zumwalt-class destroyers:::::Nov. 1 (UPI) -- Department of Defense officials announced Wednesday that Raytheon Co., Integrated Defense Systems has been awarded a modified $29 million contract for mission systems equipment for the Navy's Zumwalt-class destroyer, the largest and most technologically advanced guided missile surface combatant ship in the world.Raytheon has been contracted to deliver total ship computing environment hardware, and software research, test and development for the Zumwalt class of destroyers.Work by Raytheon will be performed across the country, with 46 percent place in Portsmouth, R.I., and the work is expected to be completed by September 2018.The contract will be paid from fiscal 2018 research, development, test and evaluation funding in the amount of $12.4 million, and fiscal 2018 operations and maintenance funding in the amount of $775,000 will be obligated at time of award.The funds will expire at the end of the current fiscal year.Construction on the DDG 1000 class destroyers commenced in February 2009.The DDG 1001 was named after U.S. Navy SEAL and Medal of Honor recipient Michael Monsoor, who was killed during Operation Iraqi Freedom after he jumped on a grenade and absorbed the blast, which saved the lives of two other SEALs on a rooftop in ar-Ramadi, Iraq.In April 2012, DDG 1002 was named Lyndon B. Johnson by Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus.
Oil prices continue streak, but ceiling may be approaching:::::Nov. 1 (UPI) -- Oil prices continued their push Wednesday above multi-year highs on stronger demand and a narrowing glut, but the rally may be brushing up against a ceiling."Global demand is exceeding supply and the forward crude curve is signaling higher prices ahead," Phil Flynn, a senior market analyst for the PRICE Futures Group in Chicago, said in an emailed market report.The American Petroleum Institute reported after the market closed Tuesday that its data show crude oil inventories in the United States dropped about 5.1 million barrels.Gasoline storage levels fell 7.6 million barrels after motor club AAA said demand was resilient late in the season.The draw reported in the United States, the world's largest economy, came after the government reported a drop in crude oil production.The U.S. Energy Information Administration said crude oil production in September averaged 9.2 million barrels per day, a 0.3 percent drop from the previous month.By percentage, the largest decline came from offshore production.The price of oil was in rally mode early Wednesday, but softening ahead of the opening bell.The price for Brent crude oil was up 0.87 percent to $61.47 per barrel as of 9:20 a.m. EDT, after gains of more than 1 percent overnight.The price for West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark for oil, was up 1 percent to $54.94 per barrel.Ole Hanson, the head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank, said in response to questions from UPI that the "bulls have it right now" on news that members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries are strictly adhering to a pledge to ease supply-side strains, adding Saudi Arabia seems to be willing to do whatever it takes to support higher prices.With Brent above $60 per barrel, he said it seems most producers feel comfortable."Momentum can easily drive a market beyond what is fundamentally justified and a continued rally above $60 would in our view represent such a development," he said.Most U.S. metrics are skewed still by hurricanes that swept through southern states and island territories last month, which would in part explain the slight drop in crude oil production last month.Payroll processor ADP reported private-sector employment increased by 235,000 from September to October, which only in part was a response to post-hurricane recovery."Looking through the hurricane-created volatility, job growth is robust," Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's Analytics, said in a statement.
MBDA Inc. to produce parts for Small Diameter Bomb:::::Nov. 1 (UPI) -- The Boeing Company and MBDA Missile Systems announced on Tuesday a new contract that calls for 21,000 Diamond Back Wing assemblies for the U.S. Air Force's precision-guided GBU-39 Small Diameter Bomb Increment I or GBU-39 SDB-I The announcement follows several contracts awarded to Boeing by the Air Force, including an indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity foreign military sales contract worth $700 million back in Sept. 2016 for the production of GBU-39 SDB-I.The SDB-I is ideal for American jet fighters when compared to the 2,000-pound Mark-84 general purpose bomb because a pilot can carry a pack of four SDBs in place of a single Mark-84.Boeing's SDB-I is a next-generation strike weapon that can be deployed from both internal and external carriage systems and comes with an Advanced Anti-Jam Global Positioning System-aided Inertial Navigation System that guides the weapon system towards the coordinates of a stationary target.MBDA's Diamond Back Wing Assembly is paramount in the design of Boeing's SDB-I as the tandem wing design improves the maneuverability and extends its range to over 60 nautical miles, increasing pilot safety and expanding operational reach, they company says."This new award is possible thanks to our strong partnership with Boeing and outstanding past performance over many years of delivering wing kits," MBDA Inc.'s CEO John Pranzatelli said in a press release."As the MBDA Inc. Huntsville team scales up and expands our reach into the U.S. supply chain, we will continue to meet customer requirements on time and budget."In addition to Diamond Back, MBDA Inc. remains committed to introducing MBDA's superior portfolio of precision guided munitions and advanced technology to the U.S.," he added.Boeing has a two-year $261 million contract deal with the U.S. Air Force for additional SDB-I's that are expected to be produced by December 2018.About half of the ultimate contract value, roughly $129 million, has already been obligated by the Pentagon.Two months ago, Raytheon was awarded a $450 million contract for engineering changes and development of the Small Diameter Bomb II, an update to Boeing's SDB-I for the U.S. Air Force.The SDB-II is capable of three modes -- a millimeter wave radar that detects and tracks targets through all weather, imaging infrared for improved target discrimination, and a semi-active laser allowing it to track lasers in the air or on the ground.The bomb can strike targets more than 45 miles away and has a small size, so more of them can be carried by fewer aircraft.The SDB-II is being integrated for use on the F-35 and F/A-18E/F by the U.S. Air Force and Navy, and Raytheon is expected to have it prepared for integration with the F-15E by the end of the year.
China lends hand to Russian LNG projects:::::Nov. 1 (UPI) -- Russian independent gas producer Novatek said Wednesday it reached an agreement with a Chinese bank to help implement a Arctic liquefied natural gas project.Novatek said it signed a memorandum of understanding with the China Development Bank to cooperate on steering capital toward LNG."Our strategy envisages a rapid growth of LNG production using international financing sources," Leonid Mikhelson, the chairman of the Novatek board, said in a statement."We already have a positive experience of cooperating with the China Development Bank on the Yamal LNG project, and we are glad to continue this mutually beneficial cooperation on our new LNG projects."Novatek, the largest private natural gas company in Russia, leads the project aimed at sourcing the markets in the Asia-Pacific, alongside French energy company Total and the China National Petroleum Corp.The Yamal LNG project has the capacity to produce about 16.5 million tons of natural gas and exports could target consumers in the Far East.The understanding with the Chinese bank envisions support for a second LNG development in the Arctic.Separately, Novatek said it signed a strategic cooperation agreement with CNPC, its partner at Yamal, that outlines implementation of a second Arctic LNG project, including the development of infrastructure and trading mechanisms."We believe our strategic cooperation agreement will further enhance our mutual relationship as well as open up new opportunities for both companies, utilizing our experience in implementing LNG projects combined with the enormous opportunities in the Chinese market, one of the most perspective gas markets globally," Mikhelson said.Russian President Vladimir Putin talked up the growing energy partnership with China during a summer visit to Beijing.China is already linked to Russian oil supplies through the East Siberia-Pacific Ocean pipeline and Putin's visit followed reports that China may be a potential investor in Russian oil company Rosneft, on the table as a possible target of a privatization scheme meant to help pull Russia's energy-based economy out of recession.
Australian major Oil Search puts Alaska oil in its portfolio:::::Nov. 1 (UPI) -- In what was described as its most groundbreaking acquisition, Australian energy company Oil Search Ltd. said it was taking a big step into Alaskan oil."We're ready to walk you through one of the most exciting acquisitions we've done," Managing Director Peter Botten said in a conference call with reporters.The company said Wednesday it took on oil assets that Botten said were "particularly attractive" for $400 million in a buy that gives Oil Search a way to balance its core portfolio in Papua New Guinea.The company will take on the role of operator in June 2018, after buying assets in the North Slope from Armstrong Energy LLC and GMT Exploration Co.The Australian company said the North Slope was an attractive buy in a good market with break-even costs low relative to the price of oil.One of the largest fields in the United States, Oil Search said there could be as much as 1 billion barrels of resources there."Based on current oil price and project development cost forecasts, there is adequate capacity to fund these developments without raising additional equity or impacting our dividend policy," the company stated.The U.S. Energy Information Administration reported a four-week moving average for Alaskan oil production at 504,000 barrels per day, a 4.3 percent increase over the same period last year.Last week, Alaska Gov.Bill Walker said a December oil and gas lease sale in the state would be its largest in history and representative of a trend."Alaska's updated oil production forecast shows that production is up," he said in a statement.Oil Search stressed, however, that its push into Alaska was about diversification and not a move away from Papua New Guinea.The company holds a key stake in Papua New Guinea's liquefied natural gas sector and touted itself as a company with a potential for capital and resource growth.Oil Search last year acquired a 40 percent stake in two license areas off the coast of Papua New Guinea from a subsidiary of CNOOC Ltd., China's largest producer of offshore crude oil and natural gas, for an undisclosed sum.
U.S. unemployment drops to lowest in 17 years:::::America's job market got back on its feet in October.The U.S. economy rebounded from the hurricanes and added 261,000 jobs, the best performance of the Trump administration.Unemployment inched down to 4.1%, the lowest since December 2000."This labor market is still really firing on all cylinders," says Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West in San Francisco.But wages took a step back.They grew only 2.4% in October compared with a year earlier, behind September's number.The absence of better wage growth and inflation is one of the biggest mysteries in the economy.Related: Trump nominates Jerome Powell to lead Federal Reserve The United States has added jobs for 85 straight months, the longest streak on record.The government first estimated that the economy lost 33,000 jobs in September because of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma.Revised figures show a gain of 18,000 instead.The job gains for October were across the board.Restaurants reopened after the storms, adding 89,000 jobs after losing roughly the same amount in September.Business services gained 50,000 positions.Health care firms hired 22,000 employees.Manufacturing kept growing.The industry gained 24,000 positions in October.Since the U.S. presidential election last year, manufacturing has gained a strong 156,000 jobs.Economists attribute those gains to the renewed strength of the global economy and a weak U.S. dollar, which makes American exports more affordable for foreigners to buy.Manufacturing firms rely heavily on shipping and selling abroad.Related: Trump passes over America's most powerful woman Improved technology is persuading some U.S. companies to stay local, too, experts add."The cost differences are starting to make more sense for companies to produce more goods in America," says Cathy Barrera, chief economist at ZipRecruiter.There were some concerning figures in the report.More than 700,000 Americans left the labor market in October.Although the Labor Department didn't give a reason, that could be because Baby Boomers keep retiring.So the unemployment rate dropped for what economists think of as the wrong reason -- a shrinking labor force, not just more hiring.Some industries also registered minor job losses, such as mining, which lost 2,000 workers, and retail stores, which lost 8,000.Still, the overall picture is very good -- although getting to this point after the financial crisis has been a crawl, economists point out."You can look it at as a marathon or a sprint.Other expansions were more like a sprint.This is a marathon," says Robert Frick, chief economist at the Navy Federal Credit Union.Another way to put it: "The party can go on for a lot longer.It's just not a wild party."
Venezuela: We can't pay our debts anymore:::::Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro finally admitted his government can't afford to pay all of its mounting bills.Maduro said in a televised speech Thursday that Venezuela and its state-run oil company, PDVSA, will seek to restructure their debt payments.The oil company made a $1.1 billion payment on Thursday, he said, a sizable amount for a country with only $10 billion left in the bank."But after this payment, starting today, I decree a refinancing and a restructuring of the external debt," Maduro told the country.Venezuela is already deep into a humanitarian crisis, with people suffering from food and medical shortages.Many can't afford to buy basic items because prices are skyrocketing faster than wages.The country's currency, the bolivar, is worth less than a tenth of a U.S. penny.Related: Venezuela blames Trump for missed debt payments If Maduro's government can't reach a new agreement with bondholders over the debt restructuring -- which often means trying to pay less money -- it will end up defaulting.That would trigger a potentially ugly series of events.Investors in the U.S. and elsewhere could seize Venezuelan oil as collateral.Oil is the government's only significant source of external revenue and therefore its only way to buy food and medicine for its 30 million citizens.Because the government mismanaged vast swaths of farmland, it must import almost all food.Agreeing on a new payment schedule is no easy feat with Wall Street investors.Just ask Argentina.Its government fought in U.S. courts for 15 years to resolve its unpaid debts.Argentina's government was shut out of international debt markets over that time, which ultimately crippled its economy.Argentines called the investors "vulture funds" because they bought the bonds on the cheap and then sued the government to get much higher payments.The two sides reached a settlement in early 2016, shortly after a new Argentine government took office.Related: Venezuela tell citizens to eat rabbits amid food shortages Venezuela's experience at the negotiating table could actually be much worse.All told, Venezuela owes about $65 billion in bonds denominated in foreign currencies, mostly in dollars, according to research firm Capital Economics.Venezuela also owes debts to China, Russia, oil service providers, airlines and a slew of other entities.Its top negotiator also has a problem: He can't do business in the U.S. Maduro has appointed Vice President Tareck El Aissami to lead the debt restructuring efforts.In February, the U.S. Treasury Department accused El Aissami of drug trafficking and froze his assets in the U.S. El Aissami denies the accusations.Meanwhile, Maduro and others in his government have tried to pin the blame on President Trump for Venezuela's debt problems after Trump slapped stiff financial sanctions on the country in August.After the state oil company, PDVSA, made a large debt payment last week, it didn't mince its words.The company said it made the payment, "despite the economic war, unjustified imposition of sanctions by Donald Trump, and the sabotage, persecution and financial blockade to which the Republic and its institutions have been subjected by a significant portion of the international financial system as commanded by imperialism."
Trump passes over America's most powerful woman:::::President Trump just passed over America's most powerful woman.His decision to nominate Jerome Powell to lead the Federal Reserve, rather than letting Janet Yellen keep the job for four more years, marks a loss of female leadership not just in economic circles but in the world.Yellen is the first woman to serve as Fed chair, and she is the only woman leading a major central bank anywhere on the globe.Only 10 other women run a nation's central bank, and none of them comes close to Yellen's influence.The others are the central bank chairs of Aruba, Belize, Cuba, Cyprus, Israel, Lesotho, Russia, Samoa, Serbia and Seychelles, according to Central Bank Directory, a publication that closely follows the world of monetary policy.Because she steers the world's biggest economy, trillions of dollars in global markets sway with Yellen's every word.She may be the second most powerful woman on the planet, behind only German Chancellor Angela Merkel.Her departure leaves men holding all the top jobs that guide the Trump economy.The treasury secretary, the commerce secretary, the labor secretary, the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, the U.S. Trade Representative, the director of the National Economic Council and Trump's nominee for president of the Export-Import Bank are all men.(Most of those jobs were also held by men during the Obama administration, although he did appoint women as labor secretary and commerce secretary, and Yellen as Fed chair.)In Powell, Trump is appointing a man who holds many of the same beliefs as his history-making predecessor.Related: The biggest mystery in the U.S. economy Yellen and Powell work together because Powell is a Fed governor, and they always vote the same way on monetary policy.They differ on bank regulation, but only slightly.Powell supports many of the reforms in the Dodd-Frank financial reform law, instituted after the financial crisis.Yellen staunchly defends it.They both recommend tweaking it to reduce the burden on small community banks."We've got kind of the same person, just in different clothes," says Chris Gaffney, president of Everbank World Markets.And Trump himself has praised Yellen, saying just this week that she's done an "excellent" job.(He sang a different tune on the campaign trail.As a candidate, Trump said that Yellen should be "ashamed of herself" for creating a "false stock market.")Ivanka Trump, who is an official White House adviser to her father, has praised Yellen and even had breakfast with her in July.Yellen and Powell were both nominated by President Barack Obama, though Powell is a Republican and Yellen a Democrat.Yellen is highly respected on Wall Street and in academic circles.It's also customary for the president, regardless of political party, to renominate the Fed chair.However, Trump said in an interview with Fox Business anchor Lou Dobbs last week that he wanted to put his own stamp on the Fed."We're obviously doing very well together, you look at the markets," Trump said, speaking of Yellen.But he added: "In one way, I have to say, you like to make your own mark ... which is maybe one of things that she's got a little bit against her."Trump later asked Dobbs whom he would choose for Fed chair.Dobbs suggested Yellen.Yellen has been outspoken about the need for more female leadership and participation in the workforce.In May, she spoke at the Brown University to celebrate the 125th anniversary of its opening its doors to women."The rise in women's involvement in the workforce ... has contributed not only to their own well-being but more broadly to the welfare and prosperity of our country," Yellen said.Her term ends in February.
Notre Dame will stop covering birth control for students and employees:::::Less than a month after the Trump administration weakened Obamacare's contraceptive mandate, the University of Notre Dame announced it will stop covering birth control for students, faculty and staff.The Catholic institution, which had long battled the Obama administration over the mandate, will end coverage of contraceptives for employees after Dec. 31.Students, whose insurance follows the academic calendar, will lose the benefits after Aug. 14."The University of Notre Dame honors the moral teachings of the Catholic Church," the University Health Services director wrote to students in an email last week."To comply with federal law, Aetna Student Health has provided coverage, separate from University coverage, for additional women's health products or procedures that the University objects to based on its religious beliefs."Under Obamacare, insurance plans had to cover contraception for women without charging a co-pay.Over 55 million American women have had access to birth control coverage with zero out-of-pocket costs, according to the National Women's Law Center.Related: Trump administration deals major blow to Obamacare birth control mandate A fairly limited number of employers -- mainly churches and some other religious entities -- could get an exemption to the mandate.Some other employers, such as religious-based universities or hospitals, could seek accommodations so that they didn't have to provide coverage, but their workers could still obtain contraceptives paid for by the insurer or the employer's plan administrator.Notre Dame's students and workers received coverage this way.The Trump administration, however, issued new rules last month that would let a broad range of employers stop offering contraceptive coverage through their health insurance plans if they have a "sincerely held religious or moral objection."Notre Dame is one of the first employers to take advantage of the increased leeway.Its president, Rev.John Jenkins, applauded the administration's decision last month, saying "no one should be forced to choose between living out his or her faith and complying with the law."The university had filed lawsuits seeking relief from the contraceptive mandate in 2012 and then again 2013.The tables have now turned, with the American Civil Liberties Union filing a lawsuit against the Trump administration last month that challenges the new rules.One of its clients, Kate Rochat, is a law student at Notre Dame."While not surprising, Notre Dame's move to block access to affordable contraceptive coverage is deeply disappointing," said ACLU Staff Attorney Brigitte Amiri."We have already taken legal action against the Trump Administration because our client Kate Rochat and the thousands of other women affected by this decision should not have their access to basic health care services denied simply because of where they work or go to school."Related: Beyond just birth control: Rollback leaves some women fearful Some Notre Dame students are also protesting the university's decision.The Graduate Workers Collective of Notre Dame, an independent group of graduate students, held a rally last month and just started circulating an online petition demanding the administration re-examine the move."The health of people at Notre Dame who can become pregnant, especially those who are low-income, will be jeopardized by obstructed access to reproductive care," the petition reads."Meanwhile, University representatives are citing religious liberty as the rationale for a policy which is in fact discriminatory.The University's position is philosophically incoherent and morally untenable."Kate Bermingham, who is pursuing her PhD in political science at Notre Dame, said she depends on the free coverage for birth control pills and contraceptive counseling.The graduate student stipend is only $23,000 a year, she noted."We shouldn't be materially disadvantaged because we have women's bodies," said Bermingham, 28, who chose Notre Dame because of its strong political theory program.
Janet Yellen is going out on a high note:::::It's easy to forget that just two years ago many feared Janet Yellen and the Federal Reserve were trapped at zero.Yellen faced a puzzling challenge: How to raise interest rates without freaking out markets and disrupting the recovery?Under Yellen's leadership, the Fed has gradually moved interest rates higher and began to unwind its historic rescue program -- while other central banks remain in emergency mode.The Fed has executed this delicate strategy without derailing the recovery or markets.In fact, the economy looks very healthy right now, and stocks are booming.So even as Yellen is replaced as the leader of the Fed, there's a clear silver lining for her: She's exiting on a high note."She did phenomenally well during a hard period of time.You can't say she couldn't be reappointed because of some error," said Sarah Bloom Raskin, who served as a Fed governor with Yellen until 2014, when she became the No.2 official in the Treasury Department.Raskin credited Yellen with "almost flawlessly" executing the Fed's plan to lift rates."It's almost like no big deal right now, but it could have been.The space for error here is huge," said Raskin.Yellen "should be grateful" to step down now because "she'll go out on top," Greg Valliere, chief global strategist at Horizon Investments, wrote in a note to clients.Related: Trump set to nominate Jerome Powell for Fed's top job Of course, Yellen didn't face the once-in-a-generation financial crisis that her predecessor Ben Bernanke did as Fed chair.When she was elevated in 2014 from the No.2 Fed position to the top job, Yellen inherited an economy recovering from the Great Recession and a vastly healthier banking system.Yellen's challenge was threading the needle between weaning the economy off near-zero rates before bubbles and inflation reared their ugly heads.But not to exit so quickly that it halted the fragile recovery.Some accused Yellen of being too slow to act.But now many believe Yellen's patient approach paid off by allowing the job market to heal.The unemployment rate fell in September to a 16-year low of 4.2%, a lower level than some thought possible just a few years ago.And the economy is enjoying its best six-month stretch in three years."The economy is in very good shape.The Fed has been spot on.It made exactly the right call," said Rick Rieder, who helps manage $1.2 trillion in fixed income assets at BlackRock.Of course, the economy isn't perfect.Even though Raskin believes Yellen did a "marvelous job," the former Fed official is concerned that the recovery hasn't lifted all parts of the country."We're so much better than we were, but in my view we're not in a perfect place," she said.Related: Is now really the time for massive tax cuts?Critics argue Yellen's continuation of extremely low interest rates inflated prices for stocks, bonds, real estate and other asset classes."Her legacy is bubbles everywhere," said Peter Boockvar, chief market analyst at The Lindsey Group.Boockvar, an outspoken bear on the market, said it's too early to understand the consequences of Yellen's tenure until the Fed gets back to normal rates and dramatically shrinks its balance sheet."If we get there and we're not in a recession or a major bear market, maybe I'll change my mind," he said.As Yellen's replacement, Jerome Powell will be charged with guiding the Fed through the next phase of "normalizing" policy.That task could be complicated by the GOP plan to inject huge stimulus into an already-healthy economy.Doing so may force the Fed to more aggressively raise rates to prevent the economy from overheating."Lucky Janet Yellen," Valliere said, "getting out just in time."
Trump's chief economist says we need more immigrant workers, not less:::::Following the terror attack in New York City on Tuesday, President Donald Trump is renewing calls for a merit-based immigration system that would favor those with a higher education or specific skills over those picked via random selection or who have family members living in the U.S. "We want to immediately work with Congress on the diversity lottery program, on terminating it, getting rid of it," he said at a press conference Wednesday."We want a merit-based program where people come into our country based on merit."Trump backs a bill sponsored by Republican Senators Tom Cotton and David Perdue that would scrap the diversity lottery and dramatically reduce the number of visas available to family members of legal residents.Such moves would cut the number of green cards given out each year by roughly half.The remaining employer-based green cards would then be given out based on a point system that heavily favors highly skilled, highly educated, English-speaking immigrants.Related: Trump demands Congress terminate diversity immigration lottery But while the concept of immigration solely based on an applicant's resume has the support of conservatives in Congress, the proposal also has skeptics -- even within Trump's administration.Trump's top economic adviser, Kevin Hassett, has long maintained that the U.S. should embrace more immigrant workers, not fewer.While a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute in 2013, Hassett wrote that the U.S. could add half a percentage point to economic growth by doubling the number of immigrants it lets into the country, especially if they come on employer-sponsored visas."Perhaps surprisingly for a country that has long thought of itself as a nation of immigrants, the U.S. falls far behind almost all the other countries in the number of immigrants it admitted in 2010 relative to its population size," Hassett wrote.Hassett, who is now the chair of Trump's Council of Economic Advisers, reiterated that position just last week in testimony before the Joint Economic Committee.Related: Trump is making it harder for immigrants to start businesses "As an economist, if you want more output, you need more input, and labor is one of those inputs," Hassett responded."For any economy, immigration is an important source of labor."The comment came in response to a question from Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who asked Hassett what he thought about a 2013 immigration bill that she said would have reduced the federal deficit and created jobs.Known as the Gang of Eight proposal after the bipartisan group of senators who sponsored it, the bill passed the Senate and failed in the House.That Gang of Eight plan would have eliminated the diversity visa program as well.But it also provided a path to citizenship for the 11 million people living in the U.S. illegally, raised caps for employment-based visas, and only slightly restricted the categories of relatives whom residents could bring into the country from overseas.The White House said in February that Trump would not consider a new bill along the same lines."I'm very grateful that my Irish ancestors came here," Hassett added in his testimony."And I'm pretty sure that they weren't allowed here because they had computer degrees.""Exactly.Good point," said Klobuchar."Same with mine.Came as a chef's assistant."Economists have generally found that there are pros and cons to a merit-based immigration system, and that the American economy needs some low-skilled workers as well.Plenty of Republicans have articulated that position as well as Democrats, who oppose the Cotton-Perdue bill as it's written.Hassett's office did not respond to an inquiry seeking comment on Trump's latest call to reform the immigration system.
Homebuilder stocks rocked by tax reform plan:::::The homebuilding industry looks like an early loser from the GOP plan to overhaul the tax system.Homebuilding stocks fell sharply on Thursday following news that the Republican tax reform bill would limit two key tax breaks that favor homebuyers.The House tax legislation calls for capping the mortgage interest deduction at $500,000 instead of $1 million.The bill would also limit the deduction for state and local property taxes at $10,000.Watering down these tax breaks could be bad news for people who want to buy homes, especially pricier properties or ones in more expensive cities.Shares of Toll Brothers (TOL), which makes luxury homes in major U.S. cities, tumbled 6% on Thursday.That would be the stock's worst day since late 2015.KB Home (KBH), Hovnanian (HOV) and PulteGroup (PHM) lost between 2% to 4% apiece.The SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF (XHB)shed 2.6%, putting it on track for its biggest loss since October 2016.Related: What's in the House tax bill for people The overall market reaction was more muted.U.S. stock markets traded mostly flat, remaining near all-time highs.Stocks have soared this year, partially due to hopes that the GOP tax overhaul would drastically cut what Corporate America owes to Uncle Sam.The GOP tax bill would permanently slash the corporate tax rate from 35% to 20%.But the tax overhaul already faces opposition from some business groups, most notably the powerful homebuilding lobby.The National Association of Home Builders said in a statement on Monday, after some details about declining deductions emerged, that the GOP tax bill "will harm home values, act as a tax on existing home owners and force many younger, aspiring home buyers out of the market."The negative reaction from homebuilders underscores the difficult nature of ushering in sweeping tax reform.In order to pay for the loss of corporate tax revenue, lawmakers need to close tax breaks.But those loopholes are coveted by various business groups, setting off what Chris Krueger of Cowen Washington Research Group has dubbed a "corporate hunger game."

Don't worry, your 401(k) plan is safe:::::In what will be a welcome surprise to many, the House Republicans' tax bill, according to early details unveiled on Thursday, did not include one of the most controversial ideas that had been floated for weeks.Reports indicated Republicans on the Ways and Means Committee were considering including a provision in their tax bill that would have lowered the cap on the pre-tax 401(k) contributions you can make below the current $18,000 limit.In addition, they were said to be considering "Rothifying" any money saved above that new cap.That is, your contributions over the cap would be made after-tax, as they are in a Roth IRA.But your gains and withdrawals would be tax-free.The reason: The tax writers were looking for "pay-fors" -- i.e., ways to offset the cost of the trillions in tax cuts they proposed.Related: What's in the House tax bill for people Concerns had been raised by the retirement savings industry that such a change could harm Americans' savings habits if they couldn't get an immediate tax break for much of their savings today.And fiscal experts widely panned the idea as a "budget gimmick."That's because it would trade today's tax break (pre-tax 401(k) contributions) for tomorrow's (tax-free withdrawals in retirement).In either case, the government will lose revenue, it's simply a matter of when."It would just shift tax payments from the future to the present....It's borrowing in disguise," Len Burman and William Gale, co-founders of the Tax Policy Center wrote.Related: GOP leaders unveil key details in new tax plan Then there was President Trump.He hated the idea."There will be NO change to your 401(k).This has always been a great and popular middle class tax break that works, and it stays!"Trump tweeted last week.Of course, no pay-for will ever be popular.Even the ones that did make it into the House GOP bill still face stiff opposition.And it's still unclear how Senate tax writers will try to offset their proposed tax cuts.They plan to release their bill in a few weeks.

What's in the House tax bill for people:::::The House Republican tax bill has finally been revealed.Details from it offers the first look at how House Republicans want to reshape the tax code.Here's a rundown of key provisions that would affect individuals: Reduces income tax brackets: There are seven federal income tax brackets in today's code that are taxed at 10%, 15%, 25%, 28%, 33%, 35% and 39.6%.The House bill consolidates those into four brackets: 12% (on the first $45,000 of taxable income for individuals; $90,000 for married couples filing jointly) 25% (starts at $45,000 for individuals; $90,000 for married couples) 35% (starts at $200,000 for individuals; $260,000 for married couples) 39.6% (starts at $500,000 for individuals; $1 million for married couples) Nearly doubles the standard deduction: The bill raises today's standard deduction for singles to $12,000 from $6,350 currently; and it raises it for married couples filing jointly to $24,000 from $12,700.That would drastically reduce the number of people who opt to itemize their deductions, since the only reason to do so is if your individual deductions combined exceed the standard deduction amount.Eliminates personal exemptions: Today you're allowed to claim a $4,050 personal exemption for yourself, your spouse and each of your dependents.The House bill eliminates that option.For families with three or more kids, that could mute if not negate any tax relief they might enjoy as a result of other provisions in the bill.Expands child tax credit: The bill would increase the child tax credit to $1,600, up from $1,000, for any child under 17.But that $600 increase won't be available to the lowest-income families if they don't end up owing federal income taxes.That's because unlike the first $1,000, the extra $600 won't be refundable.Refundable means that if your federal income tax bill is zero, you get a check from the government because of the credit.The bill would let more people claim the child tax credit.The income level where the credit starts to be phased out would increase to $115,000 for single parents, up from $75,000 today, and to $230,000 for married parents, up from $110,000.Creates two new family credits: The bill would create two different $300 tax credits, but they would be in effect only for five years and would not be refundable.The first would be for nonchild dependents -- for instance, any son or daughter over 17 whom you're supporting, an ailing elderly mother or an adult child with a disability.The second is a credit for each spouse if they file jointly (or, in the case of single parents, the head of household).So a family of four -- two parents, a 12-year-old daughter and an 18-year-old son -- could reduce their tax bill by $2,500, said Elaine Maag, a senior research associate at the Urban Institute.They would claim the $1,600 child tax credit for the daughter, the $300 nonchild dependent credit for the son and a $300 credit for each parent.The income thresholds governing these two new credits are the same as for the child tax credit.Related: GOP leaders unveil key details in new tax plan Eliminates tax exclusion for dependent care assistance accounts: Today some employers provide parents the opportunity to save up to $5,000 of their income in a dependent care flexible spending account.That money is excluded from the parent's taxable income.The House bill would repeal that exclusion.The dependent care FSAs are disproportionately used by higher-income families, Maag said.Repeals state and local tax deductions, but preserves property tax break: The original GOP proposal was to fully repeal the state and local tax deduction, which lets filers deduct their property taxes as well as their state and local income or sales taxes.But it was met with strong opposition from lawmakers in high-tax states and cities.So Brady made a concession.The House bill restores an itemized property tax deduction for property taxes up to $10,000.Limits deductible mortgage interest: The bill preserves the mortgage deduction as currently structured for existing mortgages.But it curbs it for mortgages on newly purchased homes going forward.You would only be able to claim a deduction for interest you pay on mortgage debt up to $500,000, down from $1 million today.The percent of filers who claim the mortgage interest deduction would fall to 4% from 21% currently because the standard deduction would nearly double, according to Tax Policy Center estimates.Repeals many other deductions: These include those for medical expenses, tax preparation fees, alimony payments, student loan interest and moving expenses.Leaves 401(k)s alone: After strong pushback from President Trump, among others, the House bill did not propose lowering the cap on pre-tax contributions from $18,000 today.Repeals the Alternative Minimum Tax: The AMT, originally intended to ensure the richest tax filers pay at least some tax by disallowing many tax breaks, most typically hits filers making between $200,000 and $1 million today.Those who make more than that usually find they owe more tax under the regular income tax code, so end up having to pay that tab instead.Tax experts often note the AMT no longer meets its original purpose and further complicates an already complex tax code.But it's been kept on the books because it raises a lot of revenue.Repealing it would reduce revenue by $440 billion in the first decade, according to Tax Policy Center estimates.Repeals the estate tax: The estate tax today affects just 0.2% of all estates, and only those with more than $5.5 million in assets (or $11 million if you leave a spouse behind).Nevertheless, Republicans are still pushing to repeal it.The House bill, however, has delayed the repeal until 2024, and in the meantime doubles the exemption levels.Given that the White House and Republicans have been pushing tax reform as a boon to the middle class and given that the estate tax exemption levels are high enough to protect the vast majority of family farms and businesses from having to pay it, this provision may face a steep climb to the finish line.CNN's Ashley Killough, Deirdre Walsh and Phil Mattingly contributed to this report.
Jerome Powell nominated for Federal Reserve's top job:::::President Trump nominated Federal Reserve Governor Jerome Powell on Thursday to lead the world's most influential central bank.A Fed governor since 2012 and former Treasury official under the George H.W.Bush administration, Powell will replace current Fed Chair Janet Yellen.Yellen was nominated in 2013 by President Obama.Her term as the central bank's first female leader expires in February."I am confident that with Jay as a wise steward of the Federal Reserve, it will have the leadership it needs in the years to come," Trump said during a White House press conference.It will be the first time in four decades that a new president hasn't asked the current Fed chair to stay on for a second term.Powell was among five candidates considered for the job.Also on the president's short list: former Fed governor Kevin Warsh, Stanford University economist John Taylor, the president's top economic adviser, Gary Cohn and Yellen.Although news of Powell's nomination was expected, stocks ticked higher on the announcement and the Dow hit a record high.Related: Trump passes over America's most powerful woman Trump made his announcement in the Rose Garden at the White House, calling on the Senate to swiftly confirm him for the role."There are few more important positions than this, believe me, in our government," said Trump, who described Powell as "committed " and "smart."Powell said he was "honored and humbled" by the president's nomination.As the next Fed chair, he promised to keep the longstanding tradition of making objective decisions based on the best available data.The president also thanked Yellen for a "terrific job" leading the U.S. central bank."We are grateful for her total commitment to public service," Trump said.In a statement, Yellen congratulated her colleague and said she was "committed to working with him to ensure a smooth transition."Ahead of Trump's formal announcement Thursday, Cohn had praised the president's choice."I'm really supportive of the president's decision -- and it's a great decision," he said speaking before The Economic Club of Washington.A senior administration official told reporters that Trump wanted to appoint the "best person to this position" and that he "very much respected" and "found appealing" Powell's previous industry experience."He has to be very comfortable with the chairman of the Fed as events and economic developments (occur).He has to have somebody he trusts to make the right judgment calls," said the senior administration official.The position of Fed chair requires Senate confirmation.Republicans currently hold the majority and would be able to confirm Powell without any Democratic support, if necessary.At 64, Powell has been Yellen's ally on monetary policy, while also calling for easing some of the regulations on banks put in place after the 2008 financial crisis.Related: Janet Yellen is going out on a high note Unlike almost all of his predecessors in the position, Powell is not an economist by training.Instead, he was a lawyer and former partner at private-equity firm, Carlyle Group.Two immediate challenges face Powell once he is confirmed in the role: How quickly to raise interest rates and how to continue to safely unwind the Fed's hefty balance sheet.It's the job of central bankers to shift policy levers, nudging interest rates higher or lower, to boost jobs and keep prices, or inflation, at the optimal level.What's made their job trickier is that inflation is signaling the Fed should not increase rates.But economic growth and a low unemployment rate of 4.2% are saying it should.Powell has been supportive of Yellen's plan to gradually raise interest rates, if there are continued signs of improvement in the economy."The economy is as close to our assigned goals as it has been for many years," said Powell in a June speech at the Economic Club of New York."Risks to the forecast now seem more balanced than they have been for a some time."Given Powell's role in helping to shape the Fed's current policies over the last five years, analysts said they don't expect the central bank to deviate greatly from its current path."We expect the monetary policy reaction function to be little changed on several fronts," Michael Gapen, an analyst with Barclays Research, wrote in a note to clients.Powell will also have to oversee how the central bank continues to shed some of the $4.5 trillion in investments it made in order to prop up the economy after the financial crisis.The Fed began the process of unwinding almost a decade's worth of stimulus investments in September.For years, the central bank piled up purchases of Treasury and mortgage-backed securities, a strategy intended to stimulate the economy by reducing borrowing costs for everyone.At the time, it also reduced its benchmark interest rate to zero, and only began raising it in December 2015, seven years after the crisis.Related: Powell would be the first investment banker to chair the Fed Powell voted in favor of winding down the Fed's balance sheet.And like Yellen, he's left the door open for a new round of asset purchases in the event of another crisis.In April, the Fed tapped Powell to serve as the new point man overseeing how Wall Street banks are regulated after Daniel Tarullo, the central bank's regulatory czar stepped down.Tarullo held the position for the past eight years.In this role, the Fed governor has sided with the Trump administration on easing some of the regulatory burdens on banks.He's specifically suggested relaxing the so-called Volcker Rule, which bars banks from taking risky bets with taxpayer money.The heads of several top banking lobbying organizations lauded the decision by Trump to choose Powell for the role.Kenneth Bentsen, the President and CEO SIFMA, which represents the securities industries, commended Powell as someone who would "give markets and investors great confidence" and would provide a "steady hand.""He has demonstrated sound judgment in his handling of monetary policy since joining the Federal Reserve," said Rob Nichols, president of the American Bankers Association, in a statement.Key lawmakers on Capitol Hill said they welcomed the opportunity to speak further with Powell on his plans to guide the U.S. central bank at such a critical juncture.Senate Banking Committee Chairman Mike Crapo said he was keen to hear how Powell intended to "strike a proper balance" between a safe financial system and one that wouldn't stifle economic growth.His Democratic counterpart, Sen. Sherrod Brown, said he hoped Powell wouldn't have the "same amnesia that plagues the rest of the administration" when it comes to the Fed's role in shaping post-crisis rules on Wall Street banks.--CNNMoney's Matt Egan contributed to this report.
U.K. interest rates hiked for first time in 10 years:::::U.K. interest rates are doing something they haven't done in a decade: Going up.The Bank of England hiked its key rate on Thursday from a record low of 0.25% to 0.5%, a shift that economists widely expected.It's the first time the central bank has increased the cost of borrowing since 2007, a move it says was needed to help control surging inflation.The pound was trading 1% lower against the dollar following the announcement.Britain's economy has struggled to move out of first gear following the Brexit referendum in June 2016.Unemployment has continued to fall, but a sharp drop in the value of the pound has hurt consumers by making imported goods more expensive.Wages have also been squeezed and the housing market has slowed.Higher interest rates will benefit savers, who have for years seen paltry returns on their deposits.But it will also make borrowing and mortgages more expensive for consumers who are already facing tighter household budgets."It has been a long 10 years since the base rate last went up, so today represents the first time many U.K. borrowers will have ever experienced an increase in their mortgage payments," said Simon Gammon of Knight Frank Finance.Some analysts worry that hiking rates will put consumers under more pressure and could cause economic growth to slow further.The rate increase is a sign, however, that rising prices outweigh other concerns inside the Bank of England.At 3%, inflation is firmly above the central bank's official 2% target, and a rate hike would help cool things down.The Bank of England said in a statement that it expects inflation to diminish over the next year."The bank is on a tightrope, it wants to dampen down inflation and consumer borrowing without knocking out the U.K. consumer," said Ian Stewart, chief economist at Deloitte.The central bank also noted that effective monetary policy won't be enough to counteract the negative effects of Brexit."Monetary policy cannot prevent either the necessary real adjustment as the U.K. moves towards its new international trading arrangements or the weaker real income growth that is likely to accompany that adjustment over the next few years," it said.Governor Mark Carney said the central bank was hoping to ensure that, regardless of how Brexit negotiations turn out, the financial system remains secure and prices stay under control.Related: Why business is beginning to panic about Brexit U.K. interest rates remain at very low levels despite the hike.As recently as 2007, the key rate had been set at 5.75%.The central bank indicated that rates are likely to stay relatively low, saying that future increases "would be expected to be at a gradual pace and to a limited extent."David Cheetham, chief market analyst at trading firm XTB said the bank's "cautious comments" suggest "that this is a case of one-and-done rather than the start of a sustained hiking cycle."Carney said the bank's approach could change if households and businesses start to panic over Brexit."What matters to us is what people think is going to happen, and how they react to that," he said.This is the first rate hike from Carney.He joined the Bank of England in 2013 after a stint leading Canada's central bank.
Gender inequality: It's getting even harder to be a woman:::::Here's a shocking idea: Gender inequality is getting worse, not better.The World Economic Forum says in a new report that "equality is in retreat" for the first time since the group starting tracking the issue in 2006.The report, which examines gender imbalances in economics and the workplace, education, politics and health, found that years of global gains made by women are beginning to erode.To arrive at their conclusions, researchers examined specific metrics such as female labor force participation, life expectancy and the share of women in elected office."In 2017, we should not be seeing progress towards gender parity shift into reverse.Gender equality is both a moral and economic imperative," said Saadia Zahidi, head of education, gender and work at WEF.The organization described 2017 as "a bad year in a good decade," noting that the global gender gap will take exactly 100 years to close at the current rate of progress.Last year, the forecast was for 83 years.The timeline is even worse when the researchers looked at just economic inequality.That gap will take 217 years to close if the current slow rate of progress continues.Related: Should you share your salary?Where is the United States in all this?It's not leading the way forward.The U.S. slipped four spots to 49th out of 144 countries.It now ranks behind countries including the United Kingdom (15th), Australia (35th) and Bangladesh (47th).Back in 2006, the U.S. was in the 23rd spot.The organization has said that there are simple ways for the U.S. to improve its standing.For example, it's one of the few advanced economies that doesn't provide women with paid maternity leave.Other countries are making improvements.According to the report, 82 nations posted gains in 2017, while 60 had negative outcomes.Related: How to ask your future boss for more money According to the report, no country has achieved gender parity when it comes to economic opportunities and work.That means women the world over are paid less and have fewer opportunities at work than their male counterparts.Here's the ranking of the best 10 countries for gender equality:
Obama wants you to know Obamacare open enrollment has begun:::::Open enrollment for Obamacare is here ... and former President Obama wants to make sure Americans know about it.The former president rolled out a video on Twitter and Facebook Wednesday touting many of the benefits of his signature health reform law.The piece was made for Get America Covered, a group of Obama administration officials trying to boost enrollment for 2018.The effort seeks to counter the Trump administration's downplaying of the sign-up season.Trump officials have slashed advertising funding by 90% and cut support for outreach and assistance.Related: 5 changes for Obamacare open enrollment for 2018 Stepping into the void, Obama tells viewers that healthcare.gov is open for business, noting that eight in 10 people can find policies for $75 a month or less.He brings back one of his favorite marketing points: "That's cheaper than a lot of cell phone plans."Obama, who has kept a rather low profile as President Trump and congressional Republicans have sought to repeal the Affordable Care Act, extols several of the law's most popular provisions."And thanks to the Affordable Care Act, insurance companies can no longer charge you more just for being a woman, or for having a pre-existing condition," he says in the video, which runs 1 minutes and 19 seconds."That's a good thing."His goal in participating in the social media campaign is to help make sure that millions of Americans who aren't already insured understand that they still can get coverage through Healthcare.gov, a source close to Obama said.It's a direct response to what the former president believes is a wealth of "misinformation" about his legacy achievement.In the video, the former president advises consumers to shop on healthcare.gov, even if they already have coverage, because they could save money.And he urges viewers to spread the word.Related: Most Obamacare enrollees could pay less next year Obama is no stranger to marketing his landmark law.While in the White House, he made videos, appeared on late-night television and joined Zach Galifianakis on his mock comedy show Between Two Ferns.Meanwhile, Trump marked the start of open enrollment with a set of tweets promoting the repeal of Obamacare's individual mandate, a key provision of the law which requires nearly all Americans to have coverage or pay a penalty.Wouldn't it be great to Repeal the very unfair and unpopular Individual Mandate in ObamaCare and use those savings for further Tax Cuts.....

How many U.S. passports can you really own?:::::Eyebrows were raised after a court filing Tuesday revealed former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, now under federal indictment, has three U.S. passports.On top of that, he had filed for 10 passport applications in as many years, according to special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russia's alleged meddling during the 2016 presidential election.Three passports?We wanted to find some answers.Can you have more than one passport?Yes.U.S. citizens are allowed to have more than one valid U.S. passport at the same time, according to the National Passport Information Center, which is a division of the U.S. State Department.But in most cases, you are only allowed to have two valid passports at a time, according to the NPIC.As NPIC notes on its website, holding a second passport "is the exception to the rule."It remains unclear why Manafort has three.Related: How Paul Manafort spent his millions "Having three valid U.S. passports is incredibly unusual and normally would raise a red flag," said Valentina Meehan, owner of New York-based passport and visa expediting service Passport Plus.The State Department declined to comment on Manafort's passports.An official from State said in a statement that its general policy is that "no person shall bear or be in possession of more than one valid or potentially valid passport of the same type (regular, official, diplomatic, no-fee regular, or passport card) at any time, unless authorized by the Department of State."The spokesperson noted that requests for more than one passport are reviewed on a "case-by-case basis."How do you qualify for a second passport?Typically second passports are given to frequent travelers, especially those who travel overseas for business a lot, said Meehan.One reason you might hold a second passport: if your primary passport contains stamps or visas to other countries that may cause the country you plan to visit to deny you entry, according to the State Department.For instance, if your passport shows that you have traveled to Israel, countries like Lebanon and Libya may not allow you in, Meehan said.Another scenario in which you might be granted a second passport is if you have submitted your primary passport for a travel visa or some other administrative reason but have an immediate need to travel to another country."Sometimes your passport can be stuck with a consulate or embassy for weeks for a visa," said Meehan."Suppose you suddenly have to travel to Canada or Europe while you are waiting to get your passport back.Then you can apply for a second passport."How often do people need to renew or apply for a passport?A primary U.S. passport is valid for 10 years.A second passport is typically valid for one to four years based on a passport agency's discretion, after which an application can be filed for renewal.
Armstrong Energy becomes first coal bankruptcy of Trump era:::::President Trump has declared an end to the "war on coal."But coal country continues to grapple with powerful market forces that have crushed the mining industry.More evidence of coal's challenges came on Tuesday as Armstrong Energy, a western Kentucky coal company, filed for bankruptcy protection.Armstrong Energy is the first coal company to succumb to bankruptcy since Trump was elected nearly a year ago, according to the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, an environmentally focused research group.It joins a long list of coal companies that have collapsed due to plunging demand caused mostly by cheap natural gas.Armstrong declined to say how many people it employs, but last month it warned it would lay off some of the 110 people that work at two of its facilities.Despite the bankruptcy filing, Armstrong said it's committed to "being a good employer" and will continue mining operations throughout the process.As part of the bankruptcy, Armstrong plans to transfer most of its assets to a new business owned by Illinois coal company Knight Hawk.Armstrong produces thermal coal, which has seen its demand drop due to power plants switching to cheap natural gas as well as renewable energy options like solar.Related: Trump rejects cry for help from coal execs Trump has sought to reverse that trend by ripping up environmental regulations and withdrawing the U.S. from the Paris climate accord.The Armstrong bankruptcy comes just a day after Trump cheered rising U.S. coal production on Twitter with the hashtag "#EndingWarOnCoal."Rather than Trump's deregulation, analysts say a recent uptick in coal production has been driven by higher exports to Asia and natural gas prices that have stopped plunging.In June, a coal mine in western Pennsylvania opened up, an achievement Trump celebrated at the time.Longer term, those who follow coal remain skeptical about Trump's ability to fix what are largely market-driven, not regulatory, challenges."Him saving coal jobs was smoke and mirrors," said Andrew Cosgrove, senior analyst on global metals & mining at Bloomberg Intelligence."It was never going to happen because low natural gas prices are the main problem.That will continue to cap any upside for coal."The abundance of cheap natural gas, thanks to the shale revolution, is the main culprit for the decline in domestic U.S. coal consumption since 2011, according to an in-depth Columbia University analysis published in April."It's not surprising coal continues to struggle because the decline wasn't driven by environmental regulations that this administration wants to scrap," said Jason Bordoff, a former Obama energy adviser who is now director of Columbia University's Center on Global Energy Policy.Armstrong may not be the last coal bankruptcy in the Trump era.In August, Murray Energy CEO Robert Murray pleaded with the White House to issue an emergency order protecting coal-fired power plants from being closed.Failure to do so would spark the bankruptcy of his company, Murray said."Our time is running out," Murray, a Trump supporter, wrote.Related: Coal company yanks IPO, blaming 'market conditions' Trump's has promised to undo the Clean Power Plan, an Obama-era regulation that aimed to cut carbon emissions from power utilities, one of the largest sources of greenhouse gases.However, Bordoff argued it will take considerable time to cancel the Clean Power Plan, defend the deregulation in court and replace it with something else.Meanwhile, renewable energy keeps getting cheaper, creating more headaches for coal.The cost of electricity from solar has already cratered by nearly 75% since 2009, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance."Coal will continue to decline, even if you don't have the Clean Power Plan in place," said Bordoff.
Why the world isn't getting a pay raise:::::Charlie Braun can't find enough workers for his factory in Ohio and he's not sure how to keep the ones he has.His problem is a growing one for companies around the world: There just aren't enough skilled or available workers.At the same time, most people aren't getting a big pay raise -- what you would expect to see when jobs are plentiful.U.S. wage growth is a sluggish 2.6% this year, beating subdued inflation but still way below the Federal Reserve's target of 3.5%.It hasn't hit that level in nearly nine years.Braun knows the predicament all too well.He raised wages to retain staff and recruit others, but that hasn't helped.He doubts another pay raise will make a big difference, and in any case his firm is finding it harder to justify raising prices for their products."Everyone has just gotten used to no inflation," says Braun, president of Custom Rubber Corp. With those expectations, "it's more challenging for me to go to my customers and say 'hey I've got rising health care costs and I've got to give my workers a raise.'That's a more difficult sell."Related: The biggest mystery in the U.S. economy It's a challenge in many developed countries.Companies and economies are thriving, but workers are not getting their share of the pie despite job openings left and right.Global problem The IMF said last month that unemployment rates are now back to where they were before the global financial crisis, but wage growth remains well below.Federal Reserve leaders, who meet in Washington on Wednesday, call the lack of inflation a "mystery."Usually, when jobs are plentiful, it's hard to find workers so employers offer higher wages to recruit or retain their staff.When people start losing their jobs, workers become more anxious and are willing to work for less.Paltry wage growth isn't just a problem in America.Workers in Japan, the U.K., Germany, Australia and other countries are feeling the pain too.Australia is in the middle of the longest period of low wage growth since its last recession in the early 1990s.In Britain, real wages are falling despite record levels of employment.Paychecks in Japan are rising at an anemic pace even though unemployment is under 3%.Mexico is facing the same problem.Some experts say the global economy is in a "sweet spot."In one sense it is: From Brazil to China to Europe to the U.S., all major economies will grow this year.But the gains are uneven and many workers aren't seeing them.So what's the problem?Experts say the reasons are many and varied.Related: CNNMoney's Brexit jobs tracker Labor unions in decline Only 23% of British workers were members of a trade union last year, according to data from the OECD.That's down from 40% in 1990.In Germany, the proportion fell to 18% from 31% over the same period.In the U.S., where union membership has traditionally been lower, it stands at just 10%.That's bad news for almost everyone.IMF research suggests that the decline in union membership has led to the top 10% of earners taking a bigger share of income -- to the detriment of middle and low-income workers.Unions have used significant bargaining power at the negotiating table to fight for higher wages.But with fewer workers organized in unions, a bigger slice of the pie goes to managers and shareholders, according to the IMF.Turbulent past, uncertain future Memories of the financial crisis and worries about the future also make business owners reluctant to raise wages.In the U.S., companies are waiting to see what will come out of President Trump's ambitious tax reform.In the U.K., Brexit is causing huge anxiety.The new terms of trade with Europe are far from certain.French companies are waiting to see how President Emmanuel Macron's reforms will play out.He wants to make it cheaper for employers to hire, and to relax France's strict wage bargaining rules.In Mexico, the uncertain fate of NAFTA, the trade pact with Canada and the U.S., is hanging over the economy.Related: Harvard study says employers are making it harder to hire The gig economy Then there's the underemployment problem.The rise of informal employment and the so-called gig economy means many people find themselves working part time, even though they would prefer a full time job.Age and the wrong skills often create barriers.Take Germany as an example: Nearly 7 million Germans are working part time in precarious jobs that pay up to 450 ($540) a month.Many have to rely on welfare payments to get by and economists say the practice is increasing inequality.Over 5 million Americans are working part-time jobs but want full-time positions, according to Labor Department data.That number has come down significantly since the Great Recession but it's still higher than before the crisis.More for shareholders The pressure from investors may be forcing companies to focus on rewarding shareholders rather than employees.Data from FactSet showed S&P 500 companies faced at least 40 activist campaigns calling for dividends and buybacks in 2016, following 73 campaigns in 2015.The average dividend rose 14% in the third quarter compared to a year ago, and payouts totaled a record $15 billion, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices.The IMF says that the pressure to put investors first means companies are investing less, including in their staff."[Consulting firms] go to you as the CEO of a company and say 'you're investing, you're spending too much money, we'll try and take the cost down,'" Martin Sorrell, CEO of advertising giant WPP (WPPGF) told CNBC this week.Robots Some economists argue that the increasing use of robots and automation in many industries may also be holding down wages, but it's tough to measure.Braun, the CEO of the rubber company, say his customers tell him that if he feels the need to raise wages, he ought to consider replacing his

Trump tax cuts could create boom -- then a bust:::::President Trump argues the American economy "desperately" needs "massive" tax cuts.And there's no question that Wall Street is pumped about it.Others are less confident that adding expensive medicine to a healthy economy is such a wise idea right now.Morgan Stanley warned in a report this week that enacting aggressive tax cuts to businesses and individuals risks "overheating" the economy and causing stocks to "boom then bust."The concern is that slashing the corporate tax rate to 35% from 20% could backfire by forcing the Federal Reserve to accelerate interest rate hikes.That in turn would raise borrowing costs for consumers and businesses, potentially unnerving the stock market along the way."Adding stimulus to an already strong economy likely stirs the Fed...pulling forward the end of an aging cycle," Morgan Stanley strategists wrote.House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady plans to unveil his 1,000-page tax reform bill this week.Ironically, given all the excitement on Wall Street about tax cuts, Morgan Stanley argues that "failure of tax reform" would be the "best" outcome for extending the economic and market recovery from the Great Recession.Related: Is now really the time for massive tax cuts?All of this contrasts greatly with the urgent push by Trump to enact aggressive measures for the economy."We desperately need tax cuts to put our people back to work," Trump told reporters on October 25 from the White House lawn.To be sure, tax reform -- modernizing the sprawling and outdated system -- would be a smart thing to do for the long-term health of the economy.But that's different, and less costly, than the "massive" tax cuts for businesses that Trump has promised.Trump's push for stimulus comes despite signs of strength for the economy.Unemployment fell in September to a 16-year low of 4.2%.America has a record number of job openings.Consumer confidence has soared.And the U.S. is enjoying the best six months of growth in three years."There is little precedent for large-scale fiscal easing at current levels of unemployment," Morgan Stanley analysts wrote."Maybe this won't be a problem, maybe it will."Other economists agree that it's an unusual moment to provide meaningful help to the economy.Normally, fiscal stimulus comes when economies are either in recession or struggling to avoid one.Related: What to watch for in House GOP's tax reform bill But Jeff Morris, head of U.S. equities at Aberdeen Standard Investments, isn't buying the economic hype."The economy feels like it's stronger than it has been, but still not great," Morris said."We're a way off before we have to contend with the economy overheating."Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen certainly doesn't sound like she thinks big tax cuts are needed right now.In a September speech, Yellen said the job market is "generally healthy."If anything, Yellen warned that the labor market "could eventually become overheated" if the Fed doesn't keep raising rates.All of this suggests that stock market bulls should be careful what they wish for when it comes to tax cuts.
Puerto Rico is killing its $300 million Whitefish contract. Now what?:::::Now that Puerto Rico's governor has called for the cancellation of a controversial $300 million contract awarded to a small Montana-based utility, many questions remain for the millions of residents who continue to live on the island without electricity.Governor Ricardo Rossello's request to terminate the contract with Whitefish Energy comes less than two weeks after the two-year-old firm announced it had landed the deal to help restore Puerto Rico's electrical grid.On Sunday, Rossello called on Ricardo Ramos, the head of the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority -- known as PREPA -- to void the deal immediately in the wake of escalating public outrage and a growing litany of government reviews."There can be no distraction that alters the commitment to repair the power grid as quickly as possible," Rossello said in a statement.The Whitefish contract is the largest to be awarded since recovery efforts began over a month ago.Several lawmakers on Capitol Hill are calling for reviews of how Whitefish, a small firm with only two employees at the time Hurricane Maria hit, was chosen over bigger, more established utilities by PREPA.On Monday, it was reported that the Federal Bureau of Investigation had opened a preliminary review of the contract, according to a source familiar with the matter.Related: How Whitefish landed Puerto Rico's $300 million power contract A number of concerns have also been raised, including whether there was any political influence that resulted in Whitefish winning the deal and if PREPA took the appropriate steps in awarding the deal.PREPA's Ramos said the state-run utility would work toward canceling the contract and would appoint a trustee to oversee the hiring of any new contractors.Whitefish has expressed disappointment over the latest step."The decision will only delay what the people of Puerto Rico want and deserve," the company said in a statement.Still, about 70% of the island is living without power and now there is even more uncertainty about when all the lights will go back on.Here are some of the questions that remain: 1.Did PREPA do anything wrong by awarding the contract to Whitefish?The jury is still out.There are several ongoing reviews looking into how PREPA went about choosing the utility company over other potential candidates.So far, no wrongdoing has been discovered.Government agencies usually will make a public request for help on a particular job.Often, they will receive multiple offers and the agency reviews and accepts the best, lowest cost bid.Related: FBI opens inquiry into Whitefish's Puerto Rico contract But Puerto Rico's governor told CNN last week that PREPA triggered an "emergency protocol" to start rebuilding its electrical grid on the island immediately after the hurricane hit.The governor did not elaborate on what that protocol entailed.Both the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Federal Emergency Management Agency have said they did not sign off on the Whitefish contract, according to spokespersons for both agencies.On Tuesday, FEMA administrator Brock Long told members of a Senate panel the agency would never have signed off on the deal.After the controversy surrounding the contract emerged, the governor instructed Puerto Rico's Office of Management and Budget to conduct an audit of the Whitefish deal.The governor's office said it has since escalated the review by requesting a "detailed and in-depth investigation" of PREPA's emergency procurement process by Puerto Rico's comptroller.Results of the audit were expected last Friday, but have yet to be released.Without learning the full details of the audit, Rossello called upon PREPA to cancel the Whitefish deal over the weekend.The governor's office has made it clear the request in no way demonstrates any wrongdoing thus far.2.Has Whitefish already stopped work on the island?No, not yet.The embattled utility company is still pressing ahead with its work.Whitefish spokesman Chris Chiames told CNN the firm's work won't stop immediately per the terms of its contract with PREPA.PREPA's Ramos said earlier this week the contract requires 30 days notice before cancellation, and that the state-owned utility wanted Whitefish to "finish what they started."Related: Relief groups hit major hurdles getting aid to Puerto Rico So far, Whitefish said it has completed "significant work" on two major transmissions lines that crossed over mountains and it has done some critical work in some remote parts of Puerto Rico that were only accessible by helicopter and heavy equipment.Its efforts, the company said, have helped restore power to hospitals, businesses and residents of Manati and soon enough 500,000 people in the city of San Juan.Whitefish said it plans to continue fixing transmission lines into San Juan.It also plans to bring an additional 150 lineman to the island this week -- bringing the total to 500 workers."The original decision by PREPA to have Whitefish Energy come to the Puerto Rico only sped up the repairs, and if it were not for that action, crews would just now be getting to the island to begin the process of rebuilding the system and restoring power," according to a Whitefish statement Sunday.3.What happens after Whitefish is gone?With Whitefish on its way out, Puerto Rico's governor said he has turned to governors in New York and Florida for help in the recovery effort as part of the mutual aid network among public utilities.On Sunday, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo posted on Twitter the state would deploy "additional utility crews and equipment to restore power in Puerto Rico."New York is deploying additional utility crews and equipment to help restore power in Puerto Rico.Andrew Cuomo (@NYGovCuomo) October 29, 2017 "There was no reason for this to take 36 days," Cuomo told CNN's Fredericka Whitfield on Sunday."it's just frankly, because they didn't get the attention and I think we treat Puerto Ricans like second-class Americans."Florida Governor Rick Scott on Monday said he would lead a delegation of Florida utility providers to Puerto Rico later this week.4.What other steps can Puerto RIco take to get the power up and running?On Tuesday, PREPA formally requested to tap the mutual aid network that provides help to other utilities during widespread power outages.PREPA's Ramos sent a letter to the American Public Power Association and the Edison Electric Institute requesting additional resources for the island.The state-run utility could have requested aid through this network right after the hurricane hit.But Ramos said he didn't because the closest states to Puerto Rico were already dealing with their own rebuilding efforts after hurricanes Harvey and Irma.He said he believed they would not be able to respond quickly to the island's needs.The bankrupt utility, which is struggling with nearly $9 billion in debt, also couldn't afford to cover the costs of utilizing the network either, he said.Carlos Mercader, director of Puerto Rico Governor's office in Washington, told CNN utilizing the network would be a "different situation" than before since the governor himself is asking for help.One option would be for PREPA to rehire Whitefish subcontractors so they may continue doing the work to restore power and meet the governor's goal to restore nearly a 100% of power by the end of the year.Related: San Juan's mayor takes on small Montana firm over Puerto Rico power contract Mercader said the priority now is to transition away from Whitefish, while obtaining more resources to help with restoring power on the island.Rossello set a goal of having over 1,000 brigades in Puerto Rico by Nov. 8.So far, only 404 crews have arrived.Of those, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has only sent seven, according to Rossello.Rossello said his announcement on Sunday was intended to reaffirm Puerto Rico's "commitment to transparency in the contracting process... and to achieve the highest degree of efficiency possible in the restoration of the power grid of our island, in the shortest amount of time possible."--CNN's Rene Marsh and Greg Wallace contributed to this report.
Apple crosses $900 billion. Next stop: $1 trillion?:::::Apple's market value on Friday briefly topped $900 billion for the first time.The company crossed that threshold after it reported strong sales and profits, and gave a healthy outlook thanks to solid demand for its new iPhone X.Is it on its way to becoming the first $1 trillion company in the U.S.?Apple would only have to go up another 11% or so to top the trillion dollar mark.Shares of Apple (AAPL, Tech30) rose 3% thanks to its blockbuster quarterly results.Investors are clearly pleased by the mostly good reviews for the iPhone X and the long lines of customers around the globe eager to get their hands on the new phone.Apple also wowed Wall Street with strong growth of its Mac computers, iPads and services division.And the company has more than $268 billion in cash that it can use for future investments, higher dividends and bigger stock buybacks.Apple's shares are now up nearly 50% this year, making it one of the best performers in the Dow.But it's not the only tech giant that's posting eye-popping numbers.Google owner Alphabet (GOOGL, Tech30) is up more than 30% this year.The company is now worth more than $715 billion.Microsoft (MSFT, Tech30) has surged 35% and has a market value of nearly $650 billion.Amazon (AMZN, Tech30) has shot up 45% and is now worth more than $525 billion.Facebook (FB, Tech30) has soared 55% and has a market value of about $520 billion.And China's Alibaba (BABA, Tech30) has more than doubled this year and is approaching a half a trillion dollar market cap, too.
Asia braces for Trump's trade trash talk:::::President Trump is heading to Asia and nobody there knows quite what to expect.Trump, who prides himself on unpredictability, is parachuting into a region where he's thrown decades of American economic leadership into doubt.Since taking office, he's killed the world's biggest free trade deal, taken aim at another in NAFTA, threatened to tear up a compact with South Korea, and slammed U.S. economic relationships with major Asian countries as "horrible."So how do officials in the region view his trade policies and impending visit?"With a certain amount of alarm, uncertainty and concern," said Deborah Elms, executive director of the Asian Trade Centre in Singapore, which advises governments and companies."The question on everyone's mind is, what is it the United States is proposing?"Related: Trump at odds with hosts as he embarks on wide-ranging Asia tour As little Trump as possible By axing the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), a massive trade agreement spanning 12 nations, Trump did away with a deal that the U.S. had spent years working out with countries like Japan, Australia and Vietnam."Without the TPP, there is no narrative of American economic partnership with Asia," said Aaron Connelly, a research fellow at the Lowy Institute in Sydney.Trump left the field wide open for China, which is eagerly pushing President Xi Jinping's grand project to increase trade along historic silk road routes across Asia and beyond.By showing up in person, Trump has a chance to reassure nervous allies and set a new vision for America's role in Asia.But Connelly and other experts are skeptical."My view is it's better that Trump spends as little time in Asia as possible," he said, suggesting relations with countries in the region are better handled by lower ranking U.S. government officials."U.S. Asia policy under Trump hasn't been nearly as bad as you would have expected from his campaign," Connelly said, referencing his threats to slap huge tariffs on China and label it a currency manipulator."But the more you involve him in policy, the higher the risk it will look more like his campaign."The situation is complicated by the fact that key U.S. diplomatic posts for Asia that help promote American economic interests remain unfilled.U.S. companies lack help navigating the region and government's understanding of what's happening is weaker.That's a particular issue ahead of a major visit like Trump's."The depth of Asian knowledge coming in on the U.S. side is looking very thin in terms of who is planning this trip," Elms said."I'm a little alarmed."'Paying tribute' Rather than pursuing broad regional agreements, Trump says he wants one-on-one talks with countries.He promises American workers he can get them a better deal by fixating on bilateral trade deficits and surpluses.But that approach isn't playing so well with trading partners like Japan."America First means that everyone else comes in last," Elms said."It's not the best negotiating strategy from the point of view of the other party."Related: Russia probe raises the stakes on Trump's Asia trip Asian leaders have played along with Trump's wish for them to trumpet what they're doing for the U.S. economy when they visit him at the White House, often reciting lists of investments their countries were already planning."There is a cost because it creates the appearance that these leaders are coming to Washington and paying tribute," Connelly said."Over time, I think it's a really corrosive exercise."The U.S. is still 'indispensable' The Chinese government, meanwhile, puts in time visiting other countries in the region and talking up the investments it's making there."China is very good at selling their economic engagement," Connelly said."Much better than Western countries are."The irony is that U.S. companies have invested far more in many Asian economies than their Chinese rivals."The U.S. market, capital, technology ... cannot be easily replaced," said Shalendra Sharma, a professor at the University of San Francisco who specializes in globalization."The American economy, with all its flaws, is still indispensable."Related: Japan and Canada want to resurrect Pacific trade deal Trump killed The North Korea distraction The danger is that Trump takes this U.S. advantage for granted rather than trying to build on it.Related: North Korean crabs in China show challenge facing Trump In the absence of leadership from the U.S., governments in the region are pushing ahead on their own.The 11 other countries who signed up for the TPP have been negotiating a new agreement that they may announce at a regional summit in Vietnam that Trump is also attending.But Trump is more likely to be focused on the nuclear threat from North Korea during the trip.That could reduce the risk of a spat over trade -- for the time being, at least."Sooner or later, it is possible that he will become tired of the North Korea issue, especially once it becomes clear to him how little leverage he has," Gareth Leather, an analyst at research firm Capital Economics, wrote in a note."If this happens, trade tensions with China or South Korea could easily start to flare up."
Venezuela: We can't pay our debts anymore:::::Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro finally admitted his government can't afford to pay all of its mounting bills.Maduro said in a televised speech Thursday that Venezuela and its state-run oil company, PDVSA, will seek to restructure their debt payments.The oil company made a $1.1 billion payment on Thursday, he said, a sizable amount for a country with only $10 billion left in the bank."But after this payment, starting today, I decree a refinancing and a restructuring of the external debt," Maduro told the country.Venezuela is already deep into a humanitarian crisis, with people suffering from food and medical shortages.Many can't afford to buy basic items because prices are skyrocketing faster than wages.The country's currency, the bolivar, is worth less than a tenth of a U.S. penny.Related: Venezuela blames Trump for missed debt payments If Maduro's government can't reach a new agreement with bondholders over the debt restructuring -- which often means trying to pay less money -- it will end up defaulting.That would trigger a potentially ugly series of events.Investors in the U.S. and elsewhere could seize Venezuelan oil as collateral.Oil is the government's only significant source of external revenue and therefore its only way to buy food and medicine for its 30 million citizens.Because the government mismanaged vast swaths of farmland, it must import almost all food.Agreeing on a new payment schedule is no easy feat with Wall Street investors.Just ask Argentina.Its government fought in U.S. courts for 15 years to resolve its unpaid debts.Argentina's government was shut out of international debt markets over that time, which ultimately crippled its economy.Argentines called the investors "vulture funds" because they bought the bonds on the cheap and then sued the government to get much higher payments.The two sides reached a settlement in early 2016, shortly after a new Argentine government took office.Related: Venezuela tell citizens to eat rabbits amid food shortages Venezuela's experience at the negotiating table could actually be much worse.All told, Venezuela owes about $65 billion in bonds denominated in foreign currencies, mostly in dollars, according to research firm Capital Economics.Venezuela also owes debts to China, Russia, oil service providers, airlines and a slew of other entities.Its top negotiator also has a problem: He can't do business in the U.S. Maduro has appointed Vice President Tareck El Aissami to lead the debt restructuring efforts.In February, the U.S. Treasury Department accused El Aissami of drug trafficking and froze his assets in the U.S. El Aissami denies the accusations.Meanwhile, Maduro and others in his government have tried to pin the blame on President Trump for Venezuela's debt problems after Trump slapped stiff financial sanctions on the country in August.After the state oil company, PDVSA, made a large debt payment last week, it didn't mince its words.The company said it made the payment, "despite the economic war, unjustified imposition of sanctions by Donald Trump, and the sabotage, persecution and financial blockade to which the Republic and its institutions have been subjected by a significant portion of the international financial system as commanded by imperialism."
Now Amazon is coming for Sharpie, Rubbermaid and Elmer's:::::The company that makes Sharpie pens, Rubbermaid, Elmer's glue and Yankee Candles is in deep trouble.Newell Brands (NWL) is taking it from all sides.The company said Thursday that poor back to school sales, Toys 'R' Us' bankruptcy and consumers' changing shopping habits dragged sales down 7% from last year."You name it, we experienced it this quarter," CEO Michael Polk said on a conference call with investors Thursday."Obviously, this is a disappointing outcome, and as CEO, I take full responsibility for these results."Exasperated investors sent shares of the company tumbling nearly 27%.Related: Hasbro hurt by Toys 'R' Us bankruptcy Toys 'R' Us' bankruptcy hurt Newell's baby products line-up, which includes Graco strollers and baby car seats.Baby's 'R' Us has been one of the Newell's top customers.The company said store closures have weighed on sales and will continue to drag them down during the holiday stretch.Polk noted that baby products had been one of the company's best performing businesses, and Toys 'R' Us' bankruptcy is forcing the Newell to "re-plan" its future.Lackluster back-to-school shopping hurt Newell's writing division.Retailers like Staples chose not to restock their shelves with popular Newell products like Sharpie, Uniball, Expo, Elmer's and Mr.Sketch."Writing had the most significant impact on the quarter," Polk said."A number of retailers canceled late September back-to-school replenishment orders and we will not get most of those orders back in the fourth quarter."Rubbermaid was hit particularly hard by customers switching to online shopping on sites like Amazon (AMZN, Tech30).Stores are ordering fewer plastic containers for their inventories, since Rubbermaid products are remaining on store shelves, unpurchased."This [retail] landscape change that's going on is as profound as I've experienced in my 35 years," Polk said.Newell's (NWL) $15 billion acquisition of Yankee Candle maker Jarden in 2015 is also failing to live up to high expectations, and one analyst says investors may have lost confidence in Newell's leadership."Investors are throwing in the towel," said Rupesh Parikh, an analyst at Oppenheimer."The company can't deliver on the ... longer term growth it promised."
Growth for Starbucks slows in the post-Schultz era:::::Can Starbucks keep growing at breakneck speed without Howard Schultz as its CEO?That's the big question, after Starbucks posted disappointing sales growth in the most recent quarter on Thursday.Comparable store sales were up just 2%, compared with a 4% increase in the same period last year.Starbucks (SBUX) shares fell 7% after hours.This is the second set of earnings from the company since Kevin Johnson took over as Starbucks' top executive in April.Related: Starbucks store goes offline, and fans are bereft Schultz, Johnson's predecessor, is something of a legend.He stepped away from the company's top job in 2000, only to be brought back in 2008 to help Starbucks weather the financial crisis.Under his reign, the company's stock skyrocketed.To be fair, Johnson inherited a tough retail environment, with declining foot traffic at malls and shopping centers.So far, Johnson has made numerous efforts to slim down Starbucks' business.Starbucks announced Thursday that it's ditching its Tazo tea brand in order to focus on its other tea label, Teavana, instead.Unilever (UL) has agreed to acquire Tazo for $384 million, the company said."We continue to see significant growth in our tea business through our Teavana brand," Johnson said in a statement."And this transition supports our strategy to elevate the premium tea experience for our customers."In October, Starbucks shut down its online store to concentrate on its physical stores and mobile app.On the call, the company also played up its efforts to grow in Asia -- particularly in China.Johnson pointed to an upscale roastery and tasting room that's opening in Shanghai next month, which he said will "elevate the Starbucks brand" in the region.
Quest: Trump and trade come home to roost:::::Quest's Profitable Moment As President Trump heads to Vietnam for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit, the full force and ramifications of his trade policies will be clear to see.Firstly, he will come face to face with the leaders from all 11 other countries that were part of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the trade pact that fell apart after Trump withdrew the U.S. from it shortly after he was inaugurated.Those other countries, led by Japan and New Zealand, have been trying to salvage what they can and cobble together a new deal without America that may come to fruition early next year.Canada & Mexico will also be at APEC.Both governments are bravely trying to re-negotiate the NAFTA treaty with the U.S. and salvage what they can -- even as Trump seems hell-bent on leaving NAFTA if he can't get a better deal.Sign up for the weekly Quest newsletter in your inbox Then there's China -- a country that has borne the brunt of Trump's tough talk and threats.There has been a lot of noise from Washington about currency manipulation and closed markets, but no action yet.Meanwhile, the Chinese are taking advantage of the TPP's collapse by pushing their own deal for Asia -- the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership.President Trump promoted reforms of U.S. trade policies a cornerstone of his campaign and is following through in his administration.But we may soon see just how much progress he's made -- or damage that's been done with America's economic allies.Trump nominates Powell for Fed Chair President Trump nominated Jerome Powell (above) to lead the Federal Reserve.Powell is expected to maintain the Fed's policies of gradually raising interest rates.He's also a proponent of Dodd-Frank, the sweeping banking regulation instituted after the financial crisis.The decision means that Trump elected not to renominate current Chair Janet Yellen to another 4-year term, breaking the precedent of the last 40 years.Yellen is handing over the keys to Powell with the U.S. economy in much better shape since she joined the Board of Governors in 2010.Yellen and Powell also met with the rest of the Fed's monetary policy committee on Wednesday and decided not to raise rates, though a December rate hike is likely.-- Patrick Gillespie New York City withstands deadly terror attack U.S. investigators are scrambling to get to the bottom of Tuesday's terror attack in New York City.Authorities say a 29-year-old man driving a rented pickup truck plowed into a crowd of bicyclists and pedestrians and crashed the truck into a school bus, killing eight people.The Manhattan neighborhood where the devastation took place has transformed in the past two decades -- particularly since the September 11 attacks.Also of note: Sayfullo Saipov, the suspected attacker, was a driver for both Uber and Lyft.-- Julia Horowitz Social media goes to Washington Facebook told U.S. lawmakers as many as 126 million users may have been exposed to content from a Russia-linked troll farm trying to meddle in the U.S. election.Lawyers from Facebook, Google and Twitter faced tough questions from politicians at several hearings.Some wanted Congress to push harder though, and others wondered why the CEOs weren't asked to testify.But Mark Zuckerberg addressed the topic in Facebook's earnings call, saying that it plans to invest heavily in security -- even if it comes at the expense of profits.-- Paul R.

Believe in gender equality? Now you can invest in it:::::Want to invest in gender equality?There's a growing number of ways to do that.Earlier this year, National Australia Bank raised 500 million Australian dollars ($384 million) from investors keen to promote gender equality at work, and get a healthy return on their cash.It was the country's first gender bond."It's not often that you see capital markets and diversity come together," said Eva Zileli, head of group funding at National Australia Bank.The proceeds from the five-year bond, which offered investors an annual return of 3.25%, have been loaned to companies in Australia that are trying to foster greater equality between men and women at work.One of the companies is Mirvac, a real estate group praised by the Australian government's Workplace Gender Equality Agency for its commitment to appointing more women to its board.Mirvac set a target for women to make up half its board and reached it almost three years ahead of schedule.Related: It's getting even harder to be a women With its gender equality bond, NAB is following in the footsteps of the International Finance Corporation, an arm of the World Bank that lends to business in developing countries.The IFC launched its "Banking on Women" bond program back in 2013."It was the first bond program of its kind focused on creating opportunities for women entrepreneurs in emerging markets," said Denise Odaro, head of investor relations at IFC."Two [Banking on Women] bonds were issued in 2013 and 2014, which raised $268 million and supported over 20 projects."Growing demand for 'social bonds' The growing demand for investments that finance social projects prompted the International Capital Market Association (ICMA) in London to issue new transparency guidelines for social bonds this year.The IFC has since merged its Banking on Women program into a wider social bond program, a move that Odaro says has helped it to widen its investor base."There is certainly growing investor appetite for bonds that are themed as environmental, social and governance," said Odaro."The shift we are seeing is the appeal of the product to mainstream investors, although this is not without challenges such as the need for liquidity and diversity of issuers."Related: 6 ways to invest and change the world Environmental bonds still dominate in terms of volume -- ICMA data show that over $80 billion worth of green bonds were issued in the first nine months of this year, already ahead of the 2016 total.But social bonds are gaining momentum.Zileli said NAB's gender bond was a "natural progression" for the bank, which had previously issued bonds to finance climate projects.And the Australian bank has plans to issue more social bonds."We'd like to continue to build on our socially responsible investment bond issuance, whether that's gender or another theme," Zileli said.Social bonds, including gender bonds, should continue to attract more investors, but are unlikely to match climate bond volumes."I don't think it has the capacity to be as big as green," Zileli said."There's a defined amount of lending to support diversity activities.I don't think there's enough lending in that space to see this type of bond reach the levels of climate bonds," she added.One barrier to growth is measuring the impact of the investment.With a climate bond, investors can see how many carbon emissions have been saved.With social bonds, it's harder to agree reporting standards for different borrowers and themes, Zileli said.
Trump passes over America's most powerful woman:::::President Trump just passed over America's most powerful woman.His decision to nominate Jerome Powell to lead the Federal Reserve, rather than letting Janet Yellen keep the job for four more years, marks a loss of female leadership not just in economic circles but in the world.Yellen is the first woman to serve as Fed chair, and she is the only woman leading a major central bank anywhere on the globe.Only 10 other women run a nation's central bank, and none of them comes close to Yellen's influence.The others are the central bank chairs of Aruba, Belize, Cuba, Cyprus, Israel, Lesotho, Russia, Samoa, Serbia and Seychelles, according to Central Bank Directory, a publication that closely follows the world of monetary policy.Because she steers the world's biggest economy, trillions of dollars in global markets sway with Yellen's every word.She may be the second most powerful woman on the planet, behind only German Chancellor Angela Merkel.Her departure leaves men holding all the top jobs that guide the Trump economy.The treasury secretary, the commerce secretary, the labor secretary, the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, the U.S. Trade Representative, the director of the National Economic Council and Trump's nominee for president of the Export-Import Bank are all men.(Most of those jobs were also held by men during the Obama administration, although he did appoint women as labor secretary and commerce secretary, and Yellen as Fed chair.)In Powell, Trump is appointing a man who holds many of the same beliefs as his history-making predecessor.Related: The biggest mystery in the U.S. economy Yellen and Powell work together because Powell is a Fed governor, and they always vote the same way on monetary policy.They differ on bank regulation, but only slightly.Powell supports many of the reforms in the Dodd-Frank financial reform law, instituted after the financial crisis.Yellen staunchly defends it.They both recommend tweaking it to reduce the burden on small community banks."We've got kind of the same person, just in different clothes," says Chris Gaffney, president of Everbank World Markets.And Trump himself has praised Yellen, saying just this week that she's done an "excellent" job.(He sang a different tune on the campaign trail.As a candidate, Trump said that Yellen should be "ashamed of herself" for creating a "false stock market.")Ivanka Trump, who is an official White House adviser to her father, has praised Yellen and even had breakfast with her in July.Yellen and Powell were both nominated by President Barack Obama, though Powell is a Republican and Yellen a Democrat.Yellen is highly respected on Wall Street and in academic circles.It's also customary for the president, regardless of political party, to renominate the Fed chair.However, Trump said in an interview with Fox Business anchor Lou Dobbs last week that he wanted to put his own stamp on the Fed."We're obviously doing very well together, you look at the markets," Trump said, speaking of Yellen.But he added: "In one way, I have to say, you like to make your own mark ... which is maybe one of things that she's got a little bit against her."Trump later asked Dobbs whom he would choose for Fed chair.Dobbs suggested Yellen.Yellen has been outspoken about the need for more female leadership and participation in the workforce.In May, she spoke at the Brown University to celebrate the 125th anniversary of its opening its doors to women."The rise in women's involvement in the workforce ... has contributed not only to their own well-being but more broadly to the welfare and prosperity of our country," Yellen said.Her term ends in February.
Janet Yellen is going out on a high note:::::It's easy to forget that just two years ago many feared Janet Yellen and the Federal Reserve were trapped at zero.Yellen faced a puzzling challenge: How to raise interest rates without freaking out markets and disrupting the recovery?Under Yellen's leadership, the Fed has gradually moved interest rates higher and began to unwind its historic rescue program -- while other central banks remain in emergency mode.The Fed has executed this delicate strategy without derailing the recovery or markets.In fact, the economy looks very healthy right now, and stocks are booming.So even as Yellen is replaced as the leader of the Fed, there's a clear silver lining for her: She's exiting on a high note."She did phenomenally well during a hard period of time.You can't say she couldn't be reappointed because of some error," said Sarah Bloom Raskin, who served as a Fed governor with Yellen until 2014, when she became the No.2 official in the Treasury Department.Raskin credited Yellen with "almost flawlessly" executing the Fed's plan to lift rates."It's almost like no big deal right now, but it could have been.The space for error here is huge," said Raskin.Yellen "should be grateful" to step down now because "she'll go out on top," Greg Valliere, chief global strategist at Horizon Investments, wrote in a note to clients.Related: Trump set to nominate Jerome Powell for Fed's top job Of course, Yellen didn't face the once-in-a-generation financial crisis that her predecessor Ben Bernanke did as Fed chair.When she was elevated in 2014 from the No.2 Fed position to the top job, Yellen inherited an economy recovering from the Great Recession and a vastly healthier banking system.Yellen's challenge was threading the needle between weaning the economy off near-zero rates before bubbles and inflation reared their ugly heads.But not to exit so quickly that it halted the fragile recovery.Some accused Yellen of being too slow to act.But now many believe Yellen's patient approach paid off by allowing the job market to heal.The unemployment rate fell in September to a 16-year low of 4.2%, a lower level than some thought possible just a few years ago.And the economy is enjoying its best six-month stretch in three years."The economy is in very good shape.The Fed has been spot on.It made exactly the right call," said Rick Rieder, who helps manage $1.2 trillion in fixed income assets at BlackRock.Of course, the economy isn't perfect.Even though Raskin believes Yellen did a "marvelous job," the former Fed official is concerned that the recovery hasn't lifted all parts of the country."We're so much better than we were, but in my view we're not in a perfect place," she said.Related: Is now really the time for massive tax cuts?Critics argue Yellen's continuation of extremely low interest rates inflated prices for stocks, bonds, real estate and other asset classes."Her legacy is bubbles everywhere," said Peter Boockvar, chief market analyst at The Lindsey Group.Boockvar, an outspoken bear on the market, said it's too early to understand the consequences of Yellen's tenure until the Fed gets back to normal rates and dramatically shrinks its balance sheet."If we get there and we're not in a recession or a major bear market, maybe I'll change my mind," he said.As Yellen's replacement, Jerome Powell will be charged with guiding the Fed through the next phase of "normalizing" policy.That task could be complicated by the GOP plan to inject huge stimulus into an already-healthy economy.Doing so may force the Fed to more aggressively raise rates to prevent the economy from overheating."Lucky Janet Yellen," Valliere said, "getting out just in time."
Chili's won't make you wait for your baby back ribs:::::Chili's slimmed-down menu is making its service much speedier.In mid-September, Chili's announced it would trim its menu by 40% to focus on classic dishes.Chili's doubled down on Texas Size Ribs, Full-On Fajitas, Bigger Big Mouth Burger and Oldtimers with cheese and fries.It hoped the strategy change would shorten wait times at restaurants, which were driving away customers and eating into profits.The restaurant chain seems to have gotten what it was asking for.The average wait time to get food to customers' tables fell 12% within six weeks of rolling out the new menu, Chili's said."More importantly, tickets longer than 15 minutes and those are ones that generate the greatest number of guest complaints have dropped 40%, and those guests are now much more likely to return," said Wyman Roberts, CEO of Chili's parent Brinker International, on a conference call with investors Wednesday.Customers aren't necessarily digging having fewer options: Chili's reported that traffic and sales at restaurants that were open at the same point last year dropped about 3% last quarter.That's a steeper fall than analysts predicted.Chili's acknowledged the growing pains."Whenever you take away 40% of the items that are on your menu, there's a chance that you're going to have some pushback from guests because you may have touched one of their favorites," Roberts said on an investor call."That's been the biggest challenge."But investors were elated about the new menu and quicker service.Brinker, which also owns Maggiano's restaurants, spiked 7% Wednesday.It's down slightly Thursday, following broader market declines.Devastating hurricanes dealt corporate America a major blow What's next for Chili's?Focusing on providing cheaper options, especially burgers."The industry remains highly competitive when it comes to value and we're turning up the dial on our value strategy," Roberts said.Still, one analyst says it's too soon to tell if Chili's comeback will last."We remain guarded, especially as we move into a volatile holiday season," Barclays analyst Jeffrey Bernstein wrote in a research note on Thursday.Like other restaurants this quarter, Hurricanes Harvey and Irma battered Brinker's bottom line.The company lost around $5.4 million in sales because of the storms.
Homebuilder stocks rocked by tax reform plan:::::The homebuilding industry looks like an early loser from the GOP plan to overhaul the tax system.Homebuilding stocks fell sharply on Thursday following news that the Republican tax reform bill would limit two key tax breaks that favor homebuyers.The House tax legislation calls for capping the mortgage interest deduction at $500,000 instead of $1 million.The bill would also limit the deduction for state and local property taxes at $10,000.Watering down these tax breaks could be bad news for people who want to buy homes, especially pricier properties or ones in more expensive cities.Shares of Toll Brothers (TOL), which makes luxury homes in major U.S. cities, tumbled 6% on Thursday.That would be the stock's worst day since late 2015.KB Home (KBH), Hovnanian (HOV) and PulteGroup (PHM) lost between 2% to 4% apiece.The SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF (XHB)shed 2.6%, putting it on track for its biggest loss since October 2016.Related: What's in the House tax bill for people The overall market reaction was more muted.U.S. stock markets traded mostly flat, remaining near all-time highs.Stocks have soared this year, partially due to hopes that the GOP tax overhaul would drastically cut what Corporate America owes to Uncle Sam.The GOP tax bill would permanently slash the corporate tax rate from 35% to 20%.But the tax overhaul already faces opposition from some business groups, most notably the powerful homebuilding lobby.The National Association of Home Builders said in a statement on Monday, after some details about declining deductions emerged, that the GOP tax bill "will harm home values, act as a tax on existing home owners and force many younger, aspiring home buyers out of the market."The negative reaction from homebuilders underscores the difficult nature of ushering in sweeping tax reform.In order to pay for the loss of corporate tax revenue, lawmakers need to close tax breaks.But those loopholes are coveted by various business groups, setting off what Chris Krueger of Cowen Washington Research Group has dubbed a "corporate hunger game."
U.K. interest rates hiked for first time in 10 years:::::U.K. interest rates are doing something they haven't done in a decade: Going up.The Bank of England hiked its key rate on Thursday from a record low of 0.25% to 0.5%, a shift that economists widely expected.It's the first time the central bank has increased the cost of borrowing since 2007, a move it says was needed to help control surging inflation.The pound was trading 1% lower against the dollar following the announcement.Britain's economy has struggled to move out of first gear following the Brexit referendum in June 2016.Unemployment has continued to fall, but a sharp drop in the value of the pound has hurt consumers by making imported goods more expensive.Wages have also been squeezed and the housing market has slowed.Higher interest rates will benefit savers, who have for years seen paltry returns on their deposits.But it will also make borrowing and mortgages more expensive for consumers who are already facing tighter household budgets."It has been a long 10 years since the base rate last went up, so today represents the first time many U.K. borrowers will have ever experienced an increase in their mortgage payments," said Simon Gammon of Knight Frank Finance.Some analysts worry that hiking rates will put consumers under more pressure and could cause economic growth to slow further.The rate increase is a sign, however, that rising prices outweigh other concerns inside the Bank of England.At 3%, inflation is firmly above the central bank's official 2% target, and a rate hike would help cool things down.The Bank of England said in a statement that it expects inflation to diminish over the next year."The bank is on a tightrope, it wants to dampen down inflation and consumer borrowing without knocking out the U.K. consumer," said Ian Stewart, chief economist at Deloitte.The central bank also noted that effective monetary policy won't be enough to counteract the negative effects of Brexit."Monetary policy cannot prevent either the necessary real adjustment as the U.K. moves towards its new international trading arrangements or the weaker real income growth that is likely to accompany that adjustment over the next few years," it said.Governor Mark Carney said the central bank was hoping to ensure that, regardless of how Brexit negotiations turn out, the financial system remains secure and prices stay under control.Related: Why business is beginning to panic about Brexit U.K. interest rates remain at very low levels despite the hike.As recently as 2007, the key rate had been set at 5.75%.The central bank indicated that rates are likely to stay relatively low, saying that future increases "would be expected to be at a gradual pace and to a limited extent."David Cheetham, chief market analyst at trading firm XTB said the bank's "cautious comments" suggest "that this is a case of one-and-done rather than the start of a sustained hiking cycle."Carney said the bank's approach could change if households and businesses start to panic over Brexit."What matters to us is what people think is going to happen, and how they react to that," he said.This is the first rate hike from Carney.He joined the Bank of England in 2013 after a stint leading Canada's central bank.
The McRib is back at McDonald's:::::Take some pork, water, salt, dextrose and rosemary extract and slather it up with a sauce made of water, high fructose corn syrup, tomato paste, distilled vinegar, molasses, natural smoke flavor, modified food starch, salt, sugar, spices, soybean oil, xanthan gum, onion powder, garlic powder, chili pepper, sodium benzoate, caramel color and beet powder and what do you get?The return of a cult classic.McDonald's is bringing back the McRib, a sandwich that it launched in 1982 and removed from its menu in 1985.McDonald's has a "coming soon" McRib page on its corporate web site and the company confirmed to CNNMoney that the McRib, which also comes with dill pickles and onions on a toasted hoagie-style bun, is making a comeback for its 35th anniversary.The Twitter accounts for local McDonald's restaurants in Southern California and Hawaii have been promoting the return, too.There are some changes though.The bun no longer has high fructose corn syrup --even though the sauce still does.You can also order the McRib and have it delivered via Mickey D's partnership with ridesharing giant Uber's UberEats service.And there is, of course, a McRib Finder app for iOS and Android phones that also features McRib-themed stickers.The McRib has occasionally returned to the menu at select McDonald's over the past few years.In fact, it was most recently brought back last December.McDonald's said that the sandwich will only be available for a limited time though.Still, the comeback is sure to appeal to the sandwich's many fans.The McRib may have not lasted as long as the company's iconic Big Mac, but it's been a pop culture staple for years.One episode of "The Simpsons" featured a Krusty Burger knock-off called the Ribwich.McRib has been name dropped on "Family Guy" and "The Big Bang Theory" as well.The McRib's continued allure is yet another sign of the broader turnaround at McDonald's since CEO Steve Easterbrook took over in January 2015.Related: Big Mac attack!McDonald's is still red hot Since then, McDonald's has launched fancier signature sandwiches and more premium coffee beverages.But it has also re-embraced the notion that it's a place to get affordable food, too.The company's McPick 2 menu -- which offers 2 items for $5 -- has fueled the most recent sales growth in the U.S. Easterbrook said on last month's earnings call that it also plans to offer $2 and $3 value menus.And it seems that both investors and consumers are lovin' it.Shares of McDonald's (MCD) are up nearly 40% this year, making it one of the top Dow performers.Fast food in general is enjoying a bit of a nostalgic renaissance -- Burger King parent Restaurant Brands (QSR) and KFC and Taco Bell owner Yum!Brands (YUM) have soared too.Now if only McDonald's would bring back the McDLT.Or not.
Trump kills rule that made it easier for people to sue banks:::::A rule that allowed consumers to more easily sue banks and credit card companies is officially dead.President Trump signed legislation on Wednesday afternoon repealing a provision issued by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in July.The measure, which tackled mandatory arbitration clauses that are often tucked into contracts or agreements, would have allowed more people to jointly file lawsuits against financial firms.The president's decision comes despite pleas from Richard Cordray, the director of the CFPB and an Obama-era appointee.Cordray made a personal appeal to Trump on Monday, asking him in a letter not to sign the resolution.Related: Read the fine print: 4 ways you sign away your rights "Many have told me I am wasting my time writing this letter -- that your mind is made up and that your advisors have already made their intentions clear," he said."But this rule is all about protecting people who simply want to be able to take action together to right the wrongs done to them," Cordray said.The CFPB chief, along with the agency he leads, is unpopular among Republicans, and some in Congress have called for Trump to replace him.Related: Richard Cordray: Trump must veto bill that will hurt consumers In a statement, Cordray said Wednesday that the president had "signed away consumers' right to their day in court.""This action tips the scales of justice in favor of Wall Street banks less than ten years after they caused the financial crisis," he said."By blocking our arbitration rule, this action makes it nearly impossible for ordinary people to stand up for themselves."The repeal effort passed the House on a 231-190 vote over the summer.It passed the Senate last week by a much narrower margin.Vice President Mike Pence had to step in to cast the tie-breaking 51st vote.It's a win for a White House that has pledged to ease regulations and taxes, but has yet to deliver on comprehensive tax reform or a promised rollback of the reforms instituted after the 2008 financial crisis known as Dodd-Frank.The National Association of Federally-Insured Credit Unions, which watched Trump sign the bill from the White House on Wednesday, thanked Trump and Congress "for their leadership.""NAFCU is honored to have been invited to the White House to watch the undoing of a rule that likely would have had negative effects on the credit union industry," the group said in a statement.Consumer advocacy groups, for their part, aren't pleased."It's outrageous that President Trump sided with Wall Street to strip military servicemembers and ordinary Americans of the choice of banding together to have their day in court when financial giants like Wells Fargo and Equifax break the law," said Lauren Saunders, the associate director of the National Consumer Law Center.And Sen. Tammy Duckworth, a Democrat from Illinois, said abolishing the rule is "truly shameful.""Servicemembers who have been victimized by fraud and abuse by big financial institutions can't pursue justice through the legal system they fought to defend," she said in a statement.
15 women who founded $1 billion startups:::::Fewer than one in 10 unicorns -- startups valued at more than $1 billion -- were founded by women.But many of those firms are among the world's most innovative.Here's a look at 15 women who launched $1 billion startups, and how they got to the top.Valuations were provided by CB Insights.The first is Houzz, which was founded by Adi Tatarko and husband Alon Cohen after they struggled to communicate ideas to architects and designers during a home renovation.In 2009, the U.S.-based Israeli couple launched a website that featured images to inspire home decorators and information to help connect them with construction professionals.The company released their first app the following year.Their platform now has millions of images and includes a marketplace where users can buy furniture and other products.Houzz has more than 40 million users.Tatarko serves as CEO.
Why business is beginning to panic about Brexit:::::Grounded flights.Massive delays at border crossings.A shortage of parts for nuclear power plants.75,000 lost finance jobs.These are a handful of the dramatic economic consequences if Britain crashes out of the European Union in 2019 without agreeing a new relationship with the bloc.Negotiations have hit a roadblock but are due to resume next week.The British government has assessed the damage that a "no deal" Brexit would have on 58 industries.Opposition lawmakers are heaping pressure on the government to publish the findings, but it has so far refused.Here's a look at what experts say could happen in the days and weeks following a "no deal" Brexit: Aviation No deal would mean that key trade, regulatory and legal agreements that underpin Britain's economy will be invalidated on March 29, 2019.One immediate consequence: Thousands of flights in and out of Britain could be grounded.That's because the U.K. is signatory to international aviation agreements via the EU that allow flights to operate in and out of the country.Thomas van der Wijngaart, an airline specialist at law firm Clyde & Co., said that flights to all 27 EU members would be affected, along with 17 other countries including the U.S., Canada and Israel.Aviation experts say that London and Brussels are under immense pressure to reach a deal."It is so unthinkably disruptive that some arrangement has to be put in place, but what arrangement we don't really know," said Jonathan Wober, chief financial analyst at CAPA - Centre for Aviation.Airlines are taking precautionary measures.British budget carrier EasyJet (ESYJY) recently set up a separate business unit in Austria to make sure it can keep flying within the EU if there's no deal on Brexit.Trade For decades, trucks and ships carrying EU goods have entered and exited Britain with scarcely a second look from customs officers.But not anymore."No deal" means that Britain would lose free trade with Europe, and all trade deals and treaties that the EU has negotiated with other nations.Instead, Britain would be forced to operate under World Trade Organization rules.That would mean higher prices.Tariffs on dairy products from the EU would rise by 45%, while those on meat products would spike 37%, according to the U.K. Trade Policy Observatory and the Resolution Foundation.Imports from outside the EU, such as Cuban cigars and South African wine, would also be affected.Related: The CNNMoney Brexit jobs tracker A messy exit would result in chaos at border crossings, where new customs infrastructure would need to be installed.The Port of Dover, which handles 17% of the country's trade in goods, has warned that just two minutes of extra processing time per truck "would cause [lines] of over 17 miles."If fresh foods were stuck at the border -- say tomatoes from Spain -- they could rot before they reach grocery shelves.The U.K. currently gets about 30% of its food from the EU."One of the main challenges beyond the paperwork is the logistics," said Philippe Binard, general delegate of European fresh food association Freshfel."Maybe there will be a practical solution over time, or maybe not."The pain would extend beyond physical goods: Consulting firm Oliver Wyman says that 75,000 finance jobs could be lost over the long term if there's no deal on Brexit.Electricity Brits should prepare to pay more for energy too if a deal is not reached.Electric power imported from the EU would be more expensive if it's no longer covered by free trade deals."No deal" also promises to make life difficult for the nuclear power industry, which supplies roughly 20% of the country's electricity.If the U.K. loses access to the EU's nuclear safeguard system, operators would have trouble importing parts for their aging reactors.If plants are forced to shut down, the stability of the U.K. power grid could be at risk.The country would need to quickly negotiate new nuclear agreements and establish domestic oversight to comply with international nuclear rules."Our concern is that there is a lot to do in a short period of time," said Tom Greatrex, head of the British Nuclear Industry Association."It's hard to see there will be anything other than significant disruption."Immigration and rights Roughly 3 million people from other EU states live in the U.K.Meanwhile, 1 million Brits live in other EU nations.Under EU law, both groups currently enjoy the same rights when it comes to jobs, pensions and health insurance.Related: Why Britain needs the immigrants it doesn't want But a messy Brexit could instantly render both groups illegal residents.If negotiations collapse, it would be up to each individual country to determine the rights of these expats.Jonathan Portes, professor of economics and public policy at King's College London, said it's unlikely that Britain or EU countries would start deporting people in the absence of a deal.But given the uncertainty surrounding their status, it might be more difficult for them to get a job or rent an apartment, he said.Irish border "No deal" could mean drastic changes to the land border between Ireland (in the EU) and Northern Ireland (part of the U.K.).The border is currently "invisible," with up to 30,000 people and 13,000 commercial vehicles freely crossing it each day.Many companies have a presence on both sides of the border, and products often cross it several times before reaching consumers."With no transitional arrangements in place, and no future customs relationship agreed, we will see an immediate re-imposition of customs controls at the Northern Irish border," said Andrew Gilmore, deputy director of research at Ireland's Institute of International and European Affairs.Gilmore said that customs checks would be "profoundly disruptive for business," and policing the border would be a major challenge.Ports and airports would require significant extra staffing and storage infrastructure.The reintroduction of controls would also present a major political headache.The 1998 peace accord that marked the end of 30 years of deadly violence is based on cross-border cooperation and the removal of visible barriers.-- James Frater contributed reporting.
Armstrong Energy becomes first coal bankruptcy of Trump era:::::President Trump has declared an end to the "war on coal."But coal country continues to grapple with powerful market forces that have crushed the mining industry.More evidence of coal's challenges came on Tuesday as Armstrong Energy, a western Kentucky coal company, filed for bankruptcy protection.Armstrong Energy is the first coal company to succumb to bankruptcy since Trump was elected nearly a year ago, according to the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, an environmentally focused research group.It joins a long list of coal companies that have collapsed due to plunging demand caused mostly by cheap natural gas.Armstrong declined to say how many people it employs, but last month it warned it would lay off some of the 110 people that work at two of its facilities.Despite the bankruptcy filing, Armstrong said it's committed to "being a good employer" and will continue mining operations throughout the process.As part of the bankruptcy, Armstrong plans to transfer most of its assets to a new business owned by Illinois coal company Knight Hawk.Armstrong produces thermal coal, which has seen its demand drop due to power plants switching to cheap natural gas as well as renewable energy options like solar.Related: Trump rejects cry for help from coal execs Trump has sought to reverse that trend by ripping up environmental regulations and withdrawing the U.S. from the Paris climate accord.The Armstrong bankruptcy comes just a day after Trump cheered rising U.S. coal production on Twitter with the hashtag "#EndingWarOnCoal."Rather than Trump's deregulation, analysts say a recent uptick in coal production has been driven by higher exports to Asia and natural gas prices that have stopped plunging.In June, a coal mine in western Pennsylvania opened up, an achievement Trump celebrated at the time.Longer term, those who follow coal remain skeptical about Trump's ability to fix what are largely market-driven, not regulatory, challenges."Him saving coal jobs was smoke and mirrors," said Andrew Cosgrove, senior analyst on global metals & mining at Bloomberg Intelligence."It was never going to happen because low natural gas prices are the main problem.That will continue to cap any upside for coal."The abundance of cheap natural gas, thanks to the shale revolution, is the main culprit for the decline in domestic U.S. coal consumption since 2011, according to an in-depth Columbia University analysis published in April."It's not surprising coal continues to struggle because the decline wasn't driven by environmental regulations that this administration wants to scrap," said Jason Bordoff, a former Obama energy adviser who is now director of Columbia University's Center on Global Energy Policy.Armstrong may not be the last coal bankruptcy in the Trump era.In August, Murray Energy CEO Robert Murray pleaded with the White House to issue an emergency order protecting coal-fired power plants from being closed.Failure to do so would spark the bankruptcy of his company, Murray said."Our time is running out," Murray, a Trump supporter, wrote.Related: Coal company yanks IPO, blaming 'market conditions' Trump's has promised to undo the Clean Power Plan, an Obama-era regulation that aimed to cut carbon emissions from power utilities, one of the largest sources of greenhouse gases.However, Bordoff argued it will take considerable time to cancel the Clean Power Plan, defend the deregulation in court and replace it with something else.Meanwhile, renewable energy keeps getting cheaper, creating more headaches for coal.The cost of electricity from solar has already cratered by nearly 75% since 2009, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance."Coal will continue to decline, even if you don't have the Clean Power Plan in place," said Bordoff.

What now?:::::The fate of the Netflix hit show "House of Cards" is up in the air following the sexual abuse accusations lodged against Kevin Spacey, who stars as the manipulative Frank Underwood.But no matter what happens next, the DC drama that also stars Robin Wright as Frank's wife Claire is what made Netflix an entertainment powerhouse."House of Cards" transformed Netflix (NFLX, Tech30) from a company that relied mostly on other studios' content and DVD rentals into a Hollywood juggernaut that makes its own buzzy, watercooler TV and Emmy and Oscar winning films, shows and documentaries.The success of "House of Cards" helped legitimize Netflix and proved consumers were hungry for shows with shorter seasons (many Netflix shows have just 8-13 episodes) that they could view in a few sittings -- a term we now all know as binge watching.If not for Frank and Claire Underwood, Doug Stamper and the rest of those immoral Washington insiders, there may not have been "Orange is the New Black," "The Crown," "Stranger Things," "Narcos" and more of the now legion of Netflix hits.Heck, one could even argue that Netflix proved it was possible for Amazon (AMZN, Tech30), Hulu and other streaming giants to thrive as well.So it's fair to wonder if Netflix can continue to remain as relevant if it is forced to prematurely end "House of Cards" -- which was based on a shorter British miniseries of the same name about a Machiavellian UK prime minister named Francis Urquhart.Netflix has already said the sixth season will be its last, but production has now been suspended and there is already some chatter that Netflix may be looking to do some spin-offs of the show that don't involve Spacey.But Netflix may no longer need "House of Cards" -- even if that's what helped transform the company into what it is now.Consider this: When Netflix reported its fourth quarter of 2012 results on January 23, 2013, days before "House of Cards" debuted, the company had 33 million streaming subscribers.Its quarterly sales were less than $1 billion.The company's market value was $5.7 billion.Today, Netflix has 109 million subscribers, quarterly revenue of nearly $3 billion and a market value of $85 billion.To put that last number in perspective, Netflix is now worth more than established Hollywood giants Fox (FOXA), CBS (CBS) and Viacom (VIAB) --- combined.Netflix accurately predicted the shift in how we watch TV before "House of Cards" debuted.Check out what the company said in its fourth quarter 2012 earnings letter to shareholders."When it comes to highly serialized TV series, Netflix offers an amazingly better experience than any other alternative as members can start right from season one, episode one and watch episodes how and when they feel like it."The company also had this to say."Imagine if books were always released one chapter per week, and were only briefly available to read at 8pm on Thursday.And then someone flipped a switch, suddenly allowing people to enjoy an entire book, all at their own pace.""That is the change we are bringing about.That is the future of television.That is Internet TV. "Related: Can MoviePass be the Netflix of theaters?Well, the notion of calling it Internet TV never really caught on.But watching an entire season of a show in a weekend only to wait a year or more for the next installment of new episodes, has.And so far, it doesn't seem that the company is too concerned about the uncertainty surrounding "House of Cards" -- or even looming competition down the road from major media companies, particularly Disney (DIS).The House of Mouse plans to set up its own streaming service in a few years, and that network will eventually be home to Disney's library of Marvel, Pixar and Lucasfilm (i.e.Star Wars) movies.But Netflix still has a relationship with Disney that is helping to boost its subscriber base, namely the Marvel shows featuring Luke Cage, Iron Fist, Jessica Jones, Daredevil and The Punisher characters.And Netflix is planning tons of new shows for the post-Disney world.The company said in its most recent earnings release that it will spend as much as $8 billion on its own programming in 2018.Related: Here's why Disney won't kill Netflix in the streaming wars "While we have multi-year deals in place preventing any sudden reduction in content licensing, the long-term trends are clear," Netflix said."Our future largely lies in exclusive original content that drives both excitement around Netflix and enormous viewing satisfaction for our global membership and its wide variety of tastes," the company added.Investors aren't too worried about Netflix potentially losing some of its Hollywood partners either.Shares of Netflix are up 60% this year and are not far from an all-time high.Disney shares, on the other hand, are down 5%.
Fed leaves interest rates alone and waits for Trump:::::The Federal Reserve kept things quiet before President Trump's big announcement.The central bank left its key interest rate unchanged Wednesday at the end of a two-day meeting in Washington.The decision was expected, though Fed officials have hinted that a rate hike in December is likely.Fed leaders took note of the economy's strength in the face of the recent hurricanes.The job market "has continued to strengthen," and economic activity "has been rising at a solid rate despite hurricane-related disruptions," the Fed said in a statement.The Fed left the federal funds rate, which helps determine rates for mortgages, credit cards and other borrowing, in a range of 1% to 1.25%.Beyond monetary policy, everyone who cares about the Fed is waiting to find out President Trump's pick for Fed chair.His decision is expected Thursday, a White House official has told CNN.The two frontrunners are said to be Jerome Powell, a Fed governor, and John Taylor, an economist at Stanford University.Current Fed Chair Janet Yellen is also a contender, though Trump has hinted the former two are at the top of the list.Yellen and her colleagues raised interest rates last December, and again in March and June.They have argued that the U.S. economy is strong enough to handle higher interest rates.Unemployment is 4.2%, the lowest since 2001.The economy has added jobs in 83 of the last 84 months.And wage growth is showing signs of picking up.Wall Street investors have put a 95% chance on a rate hike in December, according to CME Group.
Bitcoin boom! Price now above $6,500:::::Some investors may still think that bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are a bubble about to burst.But bitcoin just got a big boost from one of the world's biggest financial marketplaces.CME Group, owner of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and Chicago Board of Trade, announced Tuesday that it plans to start listing bitcoin futures contracts during the fourth quarter.Futures let investors buy and sell an asset at a specified price at a later date, They're popular bets for currencies, metals and agricultural commodities like corn, soybeans and lean hogs -- as well as frozen orange juice for any fans of "Trading Places."The fact that bitcoin will now be joining other physical currencies as well as gold and other commodities is yet another sign of its growing legitimacy.CME (CME) CEO Terry Duffy said in a press release that the reason the company decided to launch the new bitcoin contract was due to "increasing client interest in the evolving cryptocurrency markets."Bitcoin prices -- which just passed $5,000 in October -- topped the $6,500 level on Wednesday.Bitcoin has now surged nearly 600% this year.The rapidly rising price has led to some skepticism.China has cracked down on its use in recent months, which has created more volatility in its price as of late.JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon called bitcoin a "fraud" that was only good for drug dealers and North Korea.He added that he would fire anyone at the bank that traded it "in a second."And Saudi Prince Alwaleed, a billionaire investor whose Kingdom Holding Company owns stakes in Apple (AAPL, Tech30), Citigroup (C), Twitter (TWTR, Tech30) and CNN owner Time Warner (TWX), told CNBC last month he thought bitcoin was an "Enron in the making" that will implode.Related: Bitcoin keeps surging to new record highs Both Dimon and Prince Alwaleed have been proven wrong in the short-term at least as the price of bitcoin has continued to soar.Lukman Otunuga, a research analyst at online foreign exchange broker FXTM, wrote in a report Wednesday that the CME's endorsement of bitcoin cannot be underestimated.It could help bring in more big-time institutional investors."Some skepticism over Bitcoin was rinsed away, consequently boosting its allure to market players," Otunuga wrote, adding that "it is simply remarkable how resilient Bitcoin has been in the face of significant negativity."And CME Group is not the only major financial firm that appears to be backing the cryptocurrency either.Goldman Sachs (GS) CEO Lloyd Blankfein tweeted last month that while he wasn't endorsing or rejecting bitcoin just yet, he did note that "folks also were skeptical when paper money displaced gold."CNNMoney's Charles Riley contributed to this report.
U.S. job growth speeds up, unemployment rate falls; wages flat:::::WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. job growth accelerated in October after hurricane-related disruptions in the prior month, but a sharp retreat in annual wage gains and surge in the number of people dropping out of the work force cast a cloud over the labor market.Nonfarm payrolls increased by 261,000 jobs last month as 106,000 leisure and hospitality workers returned to work, the Labor Department said in its closely watched employment report on Friday.That was the largest gain since July 2016 but below economists expectations for an increase of 310,000 jobs.Data for September was revised to show a gain of 18,000 jobs instead of a decline of 33,000 as previously reported.Some aspects of the report, however, were downbeat.Average hourly earnings slipped by one cent, leaving them unchanged in percentage terms, in part because of the return of the lower-paid industry workers.That lowered the year-on-year increase to 2.4 percent, which was the smallest since February 2016.Wages shot up 0.5 percent in September, lifting the annual increase in that month to 2.9 percent.Still, Octobers job growth acceleration reinforced the Federal Reserves assessment on Wednesday that the labor market has continued to strengthen, and probably does little to change expectations it will raise interest rates in December.The U.S. central bank has lifted rates twice this year.The weakness in wages will not go unnoticed at the Fed, particularly for members that remained more concerned over the inflation outlook, said Michael Hanson, chief U.S. economist at TD Securities in New York.Overall, sustained job growth and labor market slack at pre-crisis lows keeps December in play.Although the unemployment rate fell to near a 17-year low of 4.1 percent, it was because the labor force dropped by 765,000 after a surprise jump of 575,000 in September.The labor force participation rate, or the proportion of working-age Americans who have a job or are looking for one, fell four-tenths of a percentage point to 62.7 percent.Prices of U.S. Treasuries rose after the data.The dollar .DXY gained against a basket of currencies and stocks on Wall Street were largely flat.LABOR MARKET TIGHTENING FILE PHOTO: Pedestrians pass a sign advertising a sale and a job opening at a shop on Newbury Street in Boston, Massachusetts, U.S., October 11, 2017.REUTERS/Brian Snyder/File Photo The sharp moderation in job growth in September was blamed on hurricanes Harvey and Irma, which devastated parts of Texas and Florida in late August and early September and left workers, mostly in lower-paying industries such as leisure and hospitality, temporarily unemployed.Economists, however, remain optimistic that wage growth will accelerate with the labor market near full employment.Last months one-tenth percentage point drop in the unemployment rate took it to its lowest reading since December 2000.The jobless rate is now below the Feds median forecast for 2017.A broader measure of unemployment, which includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part-time because they cannot find full-time employment, dropped to 7.9 percent last month, the lowest level since December 2006, from 8.3 percent in September.Tepid wage growth supports the view that inflation will continue to undershoot the Feds 2 percent target and could raise concerns about consumer spending, which appears to have been largely supported by savings this year.FILE PHOTO: Job seekers listen to a recruiter at the Colorado Hospital Association job fair in Denver, Colorado, U.S. on October 4, 2017.REUTERS/Rick Wilking/File Photo The economy grew at a 3.0 percent annualized rate in the third quarter.Growth has remained strong even as President Donald Trump and the Republican-led Congress have struggled to enact their economic program.Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives on Thursday unveiled a bill that proposed slashing the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent, cutting tax rates on individuals and families and ending certain tax breaks.The plan has been met with opposition from small businesses, realtors and homebuilders.A separate report from the Commerce Department on Friday showed the U.S. trade deficit increased 1.7 percent to $43.5 billion in September as rising exports were offset by a surge in imports.Exports, which were the highest since December 2014, are being buoyed by a weakening dollar and strong global growth.Monthly job growth has averaged 162,000 over the past three months.The economy needs to create 75,000 to 100,000 jobs per month to keep up with growth in the working-age population.The slowing job growth trend largely reflects employers difficulties in finding qualified workers.Some economists believe the impact of the hurricanes was still holding back employment growth.Private payrolls surged by 219,000 jobs in October after falling by 3,000 in September.Manufacturing employment increased by 24,000 jobs.The retail sector lost 8,300 jobs last month.Construction payrolls gained 11,000 in October, likely boosted by hiring related to the clean-up and rebuilding efforts in the wake of the hurricanes.There were increases in professional and business services payrolls.Healthcare employment also rose last month.
BMW recalling 1 million vehicles in North America:::::WASHINGTON (Reuters) - BMW AG said Friday it is recalling about 1 million vehicles in North America for two separate issues involving fire risks and said it may expand the recalls to other countries.FILE PHOTO: A BMW logo is seen at the 2017 New York International Auto Show in New York City, U.S. April 13, 2017.REUTERS/Lucas Jackson One recall covers 670,000 2006-2011 U.S. 3-series vehicles to address a wiring issue for heating and air conditioning system may overheat and could increase the risk of a fire.The second recall covers 740,000 U.S. 2007-2011 vehicles with a valve that could rust and lead to a fire in rare cases.The recall includes some 128i vehicles, 3-series, 5-series and X3, X5 and Z4 vehicles.BMW spokesman Michael Rebstock said the recalls have overlapping vehicles and cover about 1 million vehicles, nearly all in the United States and about 15,000 in Canada.
S&P, Dow flat after jobs data; Apple lifts Nasdaq:::::(Reuters) - The S&P and the Dow were flat in late morning trading on Friday after October payrolls data sparked concerns about tepid wage growth while a jump in Apple supported the tech-heavy Nasdaq.The Wall Street sign is seen outside the New York Stock Exchange, March 26, 2009.REUTERS/Chip East/Files Apple (AAPL.O) gained as robust initial demand for its new iPhone X allayed investor worries and strong results a day earlier.The company briefly surpassed $900 billion in market capitalization after the stock opened at a record high of $174.The Labor Departments closely watched employment report showed that average hourly earnings slipped by one cent in October, leaving them unchanged in percentage terms.That lowered the year-on-year increase to 2.4 percent.If theres one thing I would focus on, it is the fact youre really not seeing the wage inflation, said Heidi Learner, chief economist in New York for Savills Studley, a unit of Savills Plc.The wage numbers are becoming increasing more important than the monthly payrolls number itself.Tepid wage growth supports the view that inflation will continue to undershoot the Feds 2 percent target and could raise concerns about consumer spending.Nonfarm payrolls increased by 261,000 jobs after a hurricane-ravaged September, but was below economists expectations for a 310,000 rise.At 10:49 a.m.ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI was down 15.35 points, or 0.07 percent, at 23,500.91 and the S&P 500 .SPX was down 1.44 points, or 0.06 percent, at 2,578.41.The Nasdaq Composite .IXIC was up 9.67 points, or 0.14 percent, at 6,724.61, helped by Apple and Starbucks (SBUX.O).The markets have had a busy week.On Thursday, President Donald Trump tapped Fed Governor Jerome Powell as the next head of the U.S. central bank and House Republicans disclosed their long-delayed plans for tax cuts.The Dow and the Nasdaq were on track to post weekly gains, while the S&P was on pace to report a small weekly loss.Starbucks was up 2.6 percent after dipping earlier following results a day earlier.AIG (AIG.N) fell 4.69 percent after the insurer posted a bigger loss on huge catastrophe losses and said it set aside more in reserves.More than three-fourths of the S&P 500 companies have reported results, with 72.4 percent topping profit estimates, above the 72 percent beat-rate in the past four quarters.Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1,592 to 1,137.On the Nasdaq, 1,469 issues fell and 1,182 advanced.
U.S. factory orders rise, core capital goods orders revised higher:::::WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New orders for U.S.-made goods rose for a second straight month in September and orders for core capital goods were stronger than previously reported, suggesting manufacturing activity was gathering momentum.FILE PHOTO: A Boeing worker is pictured in the wing system installation area at their factory in Renton, Washington, U.S., February 13, 2017.REUTERS/Jason Redmond/File Photo Factory goods orders increased 1.4 percent as demand for a range of goods rose, the Commerce Department said on Friday.Orders increased by an unrevised 1.2 percent in August.Economists had forecast factory orders increasing 1.3 percent in September.Orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft -seen as a measure of business spending plans - surged 1.7 percent in September instead of the 1.3 percent increase reported last month.Septembers increase in these so-called core capital goods orders was the largest since July 2016.Orders for core capital goods rose 1.4 percent in August.Shipments of core capital goods, which are used to calculate business equipment spending in the gross domestic product report, increased 0.9 percent instead of the previously reported 0.7 percent rise.The Commerce Department said it was unable to isolate the impact of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma on the data as the survey is designed to estimate the month-to-month change in manufacturing activity at the national level and not at specific geographic areas.Strong business spending on equipment is helping to underpin manufacturing, which makes up about 12 percent of the U.S. economy.Manufacturing is also being buoyed by a weakening U.S. dollar, replenishing of business inventories and strengthening global demand.Business investment in equipment has contributed to GDP growth for four straight quarters.Spending is rising despite signs of slowing oil and gas drilling as ample supplies curb crude oil price increases.In September, orders for machinery gained 0.1 percent after being unchanged in August.Mining, oil field and gas field machinery orders rebounded 17.8 percent after tumbling 7.5 percent in August.Orders for transportation equipment rose 4.7 percent, reflecting a 30.8 percent jump in civilian aircraft orders.Motor vehicle orders edged up 0.1 percent after accelerating 2.5 percent in August.
Cryptocurrencies' market cap hits record $200 billion as bitcoin soars:::::LONDON (Reuters) - The aggregate value of all cryptocurrencies hit a record high of over $200 billion on Wednesday, according to industry website Coinmarketcap, putting their reported market value at more than that of U.S. banking giant Citigroup (C.N).A copy of bitcoin standing on PC motherboard is seen in this illustration picture, October 26, 2017.Picture taken October 26, 2017.REUTERS/Dado Ruvic The new record came as the biggest and best-known cryptocurrency, bitcoin, hit a record high of $7,500 BTC=BTSP on the Luxembourg-based Bitstamp exchange, after a more than tenfold increase in value over the past 12 months.That took its own market cap - its price multiplied by the number of coins that have been released into circulation - to a record high of more than $120 billion.The second-biggest cryptocurrency, ether - sometimes known as Ethereum after the project behind it - has a market cap of just below $30 billion, with another 1000 or so rival digital currencies making up the rest of the $200 billion.If the cryptocurrency market were a company, its valuation would put it in the top 25 firms on the S&P 500 .SPX stock index.The latest surge in bitcoin was driven by news this week that CME Group (CME.O), the worlds largest derivative exchange operator, would launch bitcoin futures in the fourth quarter of the year, as well as speculation that Amazon could be set to accept the digital currency.Many are concerned that the market represents a bubble, with the latest warning coming from the head of Credit Suisse on Thursday.

AIG's $836 million reserve boost surprises investors; shares sink:::::(Reuters) - American International Group Inc (AIG.N) shares sank 4.5 percent on Friday as investors reacted to a surprise $836 million boost to the insurance giants reserves, related to prior-year accident claims.FILE PHOTO: A banner for American International Group Inc (AIG) hangs on the facade of the New York Stock Exchange, in New York, U.S. on October 16, 2012.REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo AIG posted a bigger-than-expected quarterly loss on Thursday as the insurer booked huge catastrophe losses from Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria.The storms coincided with AIGs review of reserves across various U.S. and European lines, leading to the $836 million charge.The New York-based company is one of the largest U.S. commercial insurers.Hefty losses from claims occurring in prior years have been an ongoing issue for AIG, which boosted reserves by $5.6 billion for similar reasons in February and $3.6 billion in 2015.The development on Thursday caught analysts and investors off guard.It wasnt in my earnings estimate that they were going to have that reserve charge, said Sandler ONeill analyst Paul Newsome.Shares were down 4.5 percent at $62 in morning trading.The charge also signals that AIGs efforts in recent years to improve its underwriting were inadequate because it stems from policies the company wrote in 2016 and 2017, Newsome said.AIG conducts quarterly reviews of reserves for its various lines.The company increased the number of those reviews during the second quarter.[T]his was our first chance to really view the 2016 accident year where we made many changes to our underwriting processes and tools, AIG Chief Executive Brian Duperreault said during a call with analysts on Friday.The 2016 accident year is still very green, but we saw greater-than-expected claim emergence this quarter and decided to be more cautious on the 2016 and 2017 accident years, Duperreault said.AIG is putting changes into place to reduce the volatility of its performance, which include pursuing double-digit rate increases and bolstering reinsurance, executives told analysts on a call on Friday.The insurer is also establishing specialized units for some businesses that are now spread throughout the company, including Lexington Insurance Company, its specialty lines insurer.The move will improve consistency and results, executives said.
Singapore police examine Goldman's role in 1MDB deals: Bloomberg:::::(Reuters) - Singaporean prosecutors and police are looking at Goldman Sachs Groups (GS.N) relationship with scandal-hit Malaysian state investment fund 1MDB, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the matter.FILE PHOTO: A trader works at the Goldman Sachs stall on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, New York, U.S. on April 16, 2012.REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo Singapores economic crime unit and city prosecutors have interviewed current and former Goldman Sachs executives who worked on bond offerings from 1Malaysia Development Bhd (1MDB), Bloomberg reported.The meetings with current and former Goldman Sachs employees are part of a criminal probe into fund flows related to 1MDB, it reported.The bank itself isnt the focus of the investigation, it added.1MDB, founded by Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak, is facing money laundering probes in at least six countries including the United States, Switzerland and Singapore.Najib and 1MDB have denied any wrongdoing.A Goldman Sachs spokesman in Hong Kong declined to comment.The Singapore police referred queries to Singapores Attorney-Generals Chambers.A spokeswoman for the Attorney-Generals Chambers (AGC) said: AGC is unable to comment as investigations are ongoing.1MDB did not respond to a request for comment.The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) had earlier in the week barred two individuals involved in breaches related to 1MDB from taking part in financial services management and advisory activities.In March, the MAS issued a 10-year prohibition order against Tim Leissner, former Southeast Asia chairman at Goldman Sachs, who it said had made false statements on behalf of his bank without its knowledge or consent.Leissner has not commented on the MAS order.Leissner was responsible for managing the relationship with 1MDB when Goldman was engaged to arrange three bond issues from 2012 to 2013.MAS had flagged its intention to ban Leissner last December.
Central bankers on the move, but where's the inflation?:::::LONDON (Reuters) - Now the Bank of England has raised interest rates for the first time in a decade, it is beyond doubt major central banks in industrialized economies are eager to shift away from ultra-easy policy.A man walks past the Bank of England in the City of London, Britain, November 2, 2017.REUTERS/Toby Melville But the fact the decision was so contested both in and outside the BoE perhaps reveals more concern about the lack of inflation pressure than about Britains clear difficulty in trying to leave the European Union without a concrete plan.The majority of those who argued against higher rates in Britain started with the fact above-target inflation is a result of sharply higher import prices due to the tumble in the pound since the June 2016 vote to leave the EU.A lack of domestic inflation pressure from higher wage deals remains as plain as ever, as does the ongoing lack of inflationary drift from the global economy, where trade is down from boom years but cheap labor remains plentiful.Among those who carefully follow Britains peers in the Group of Seven industrialized economies, notably the United States and those in the euro zone, the lack of inflation is real and striking, corroborated by a recent Reuters poll of over 500 forecasters around the world.News that Jerome Powell will be taking over as Federal Reserve chair from Janet Yellen does nothing to change the fact core inflation on the central banks preferred measure has fallen back to 1.3 percent.That is where it was the month before the Fed started raising rates nearly two years ago.The Bank of Canada has delivered two interest rate hikes this year - the July one more of a surprise than the follow-up in September - but growth has since flatlined and theres no sign of core inflation picking up there either.Led by President Mario Draghi, the European Central Bank has just skillfully engineered a broad acceptance January is the right time to slash its monthly asset purchases by half to 30 billion euros.But core inflation is still going nowhere fast.The ECB even has a core core measure it looks at that strips out a litany of pesky components holding inflation down, and even that is not offering much encouragement.Japan, like the euro zone, is experiencing one of its best economic years in the past two decades, drifting up with the rest of the global economy but also showing impressive domestic performance and more reason for hope for the future.But its notable recent improvements in raising wage settlements a bit still does not look like they will bring inflation much higher.The Bank of Japans latest meeting had a newcomer arguing for more easing, a crack in the armor that leaves a rather uncomfortable question lingering in the air.If Japan still hasnt escaped from two lost decades of near-zero pricing power, even after the authorities have thrown the kitchen, bathroom and garage sinks at it, isnt the logical conclusion that central banks arent in control of inflation?That is the challenge the BoE will have in coming months: persuading anyone who will listen that by raising rates a tiny amount from near-zero to just a little above zero it was instrumental in bringing UK inflation under control.It is also worth noting that as central bankers change their tune on inflation from tentative to more emphatic hopes for a revival, some very powerful disinflationary forces in the global economy remain.While labor unions everywhere are pushing for better pay, the most powerful pull for consumers appears to be the search for a good bargain.Amazon, now almost synonymous with instant and cheap in the eyes of consumers, and a website many routinely check on their mobile phones against consumer prices while in shops for just about any item, is rapidly expanding.Obviously more symbolic at this stage than statistical, its recent acquisition of Whole Foods, a grocery brand more associated with posh and expensive, should also be a reminder of where the path of least resistance lies.The other clear disinflationary risk, even if price pressure does pick up in the interim, is that on more than a few measures global asset prices look extremely stretched.Equity investors are trying to have their cake and eat it, economists at Fathom, an investment consultancy, say in a note.They are betting, simultaneously, that real rates of interest will never rise materially above zero, while the major economies will continue to enjoy positive, if not stellar real rates of economic growth.They will be proved wrong, in our view.
Exclusive: McKinsey worked with South African firm after learning of Gupta links - sources:::::JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Global consultancy McKinsey worked with a firm in South Africa for four months after learning it was controlled by the Gupta brothers, business friends of President Jacob Zuma accused of corruption, four sources familiar with the deal said.FILE PHOTO The logo of consulting firm McKinsey & Company is seen at an office building in Zurich, Switzerland September 22, 2016.REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann/File Photo Their comments contradict media statements by McKinsey that it ceased work with the firm, local consultancy Trillian, in March 2016 -- after due diligence by external consultants showed the links to the Gupta family, accused by South Africas anti-corruption watchdog of siphoning public funds.McKinsey, which says it never signed a separate contract with Trillian, also ignored warnings by senior staff in South Africa not to partner Trillian in a deal to advise state utility Eskom which is being investigated for fraud, the sources said.The senior staff were troubled by Eskoms demand that Trillian must be involved in the deal despite having little experience.It then took a year for McKinsey to act on calls for an internal inquiry into the relationship with Trillian, the sources said.Two of McKinseys global directors -- Europe-based Pal Erik Sjatil and Africa chief Georges Desvaux -- and South African office head Saf Yeboah-Amankwah told concerned partners the situation was under control, three former McKinsey employees said.Six sources with direct knowledge of the matter -- four former McKinsey employees and two current employees -- said there was no investigation until July 2017.McKinsey declined to comment on this allegation.Sjatil and Desvaux were on McKinseys Shareholder Council, its highest leadership body.Sjatil, Desvaux and Yeboah-Amankwah declined to comment for this story.Eskom, McKinsey and Trillian have denied wrongdoing.The sources disclosures are the first indication that McKinseys work with Trillian on the 1.6 billion rand (86 million) contract to turn around Eskom continued until July of that year -- when Eskom canceled the deal.Asked about the sources comments, McKinsey told Reuters by email on Thursday: McKinsey never had a supplier development partnership with Trillian.We terminated our discussions in March 2016 and notified the client and Trillian.HOPES FOR A SOLUTION Eskom had told McKinsey it must use Trillian as a partner to secure the turnaround contract under a black empowerment program, but by July it had become clear that McKinsey would not sign a formal contract with it.Four people involved in the contract with Eskom said McKinseys work with Trillian continued until then, with one saying the team hoped a solution could be found right up until Eskom cut ties.McKinsey and Trillian had wanted to extend their advisory partnership at Eskom for four years in a deal that could earn them $700 million (535.5 million), according to documents setting out the firms cooperation plans seen by Reuters.Sources at McKinsey confirmed the documents authenticity.Asked about the documents, a McKinsey spokesman did not deny they were genuine.McKinsey said in its email to Reuters that Eskom knew Trillian would not be McKinseys partner and added: Any questions about why Trillian remained at Eskom (after March 2016) and what they did, should be directed to Eskom.The disclosures are likely to form part of an investigation launched by South Africas parliamentary committee on public enterprises into whether McKinsey knowingly let funds from Eskom be diverted to a Gupta-linked company as a way of securing the deal, a source close to the committee said.Trillian was owned at the time by Salim Essa, a business partner of the Guptas and of the presidents son, Duduzane Zuma.McKinseys global risk committee, a vetting body, gave the partnership with Trillian initial approval, pending due diligence, but senior managers in Johannesburg did not inform the committee fully about how Trillian hid its ownership and why costs for Eskom were unusually high, three former partners said.In the end, McKinsey launched a full internal investigation into its handling of the partnership with Trillian in July this year, after local media published a letter from a senior McKinsey manager dated Feb. 16, 2016 asking Eskom to pay Trillian as a McKinsey subcontractor.McKinsey said the letter inaccurately characterized the relationship with Trillian.The manager has since left the firm.McKinsey said on Oct. 17 the preliminary findings of the inquiry, approved by global head Dominic Barton, found violations of our professional standards but did not uncover any corruption.In its email on Thursday, McKinsey did not comment directly on the timing of its internal inquiry, directing Reuters instead to its Oct. 17 statement.
What's in the House Republican tax bill for businesses:::::The House Republican tax bill would give U.S. businesses much of what they've wanted for years, such as a lower tax rate and more generous expensing rules.But it also includes a few provisions that might take big multinational corporations by surprise -- and not in a good way, said Martin Sullivan, chief economist at Tax Analysts.That's because the measures that apply to foreign business income would actually cost multinationals $285 billion more over a decade than they would otherwise pay, the Joint Committee on Taxation estimates.Other U.S. businesses, which are not taxed under the corporate code, would be subject to a host of other changes, including a much lower top rate that would benefit the most profitable ones.Here are the key elements of the plan for companies of all stripes: Lower corporate tax rate: The bill would permanently cut the corporate rate to 20% from 35%.The JCT estimates that would cost the government $1.5 trillion in revenue over a decade.Republicans argue that corporate tax cuts are good for the middle class because they will increase investment, jobs and wages.The White House even asserts that a corporate tax cut will result in at least a $4,000 boost in annual income for households.But a lot of economists push back on the idea that the middle class will see a big raise soon, if at all.Related: What's in the House tax bill for people Territorial tax system: The United States has a worldwide tax system.That means American companies owe U.S. tax on all their profits, regardless of where those profits are earned.Many argue that puts American businesses at a disadvantage to foreign competitors.That's because most of the competitors come from countries with territorial tax systems, meaning they don't owe tax to their own governments on income they make offshore.The House GOP bill would switch corporate taxation to a territorial system.That way, American companies would owe U.S. tax only on what they earn here.Their offshore profits would be subject to whatever tax is imposed by the country where the money is made."Now you'd just pay the local rate and bring it back to the U.S. without any additional taxes," said Gavin Ekins, a research economist at the Tax Foundation.Rules to prevent gaming the system: Under a territorial system, companies may be tempted to shift a lot of their profits to tax havens -- especially for products that were mostly developed stateside -- and then bring the money back to the United States tax-free.To dissuade companies from dodging their U.S. tax obligations, the House GOP bill imposes what is effectively a 10% U.S. tax on a portion of their foreign subsidiaries' income if those subsidiaries book profits that exceed a certain threshold.New excise tax: U.S. multinationals would be subject to a new 20% excise tax on payments they make to their foreign subsidiaries.The JCT estimates this provision alone would raise $155 billion over 10 years.Tax existing overseas profits: The House bill would impose a one-time rate of 12% on existing foreign profits if they're being held offshore in cash or cash equivalents.Foreign profits that are invested in noncash assets offshore would be taxed at 5%.Companies would have up to eight years to pay what they owe.Related: Homebuilder stocks rocked by House tax bill The idea is to raise revenue from income that has so far escaped U.S. taxation.Under current law, companies pay U.S. tax only when they bring the money home.But it's also meant to entice companies to invest some of the foreign profits stateside.Faster investment write-offs: The House bill would let business immediately and fully expense most new capital investments, the money they spend building plants and upgrading equipment.But the provision would end after five years.Even more than a lower tax rate, immediate expensing could offer a big break to companies that are just getting started or trying to grow.Lower tax rate on pass-through business profits: The House bill would lower the top income tax rate on the profits of so-called pass-through businesses to 25% from 39.6% today.Most U.S. businesses, large and small, are set up as pass-throughs, not corporations.They run the gamut from mom-and-pop shops to big law firms and investment partnerships.They're called pass-throughs because the profits are passed through to the owners, shareholders and partners, who pay tax on them through their personal returns.The vast majority of small businesses don't even make enough money to get into the 25% bracket.So the steep drop in the top rate disproportionately benefits the wealthiest owners, shareholders and partners in pass-throughs.That includes those in investment funds and other entities that don't necessarily create jobs.The National Federation of Independent Businesses has already said can't support the House GOP bill as is, saying it "leaves too many small businesses behind."Anti-abuse rule for pass-throughs: If the owners and partners in a pass-through also work for the business and draw a salary, that money is taxed at ordinary income tax rates, up to 39.6%.To prevent people from converting their wage income into profits just to get the lower 25% rate, the House bill says that, for tax purposes, only 30% of a pass-through's income would be treated as profits.The rest would be treated as wage income and other compensation.Businesses, however, would be allowed to make their case that the 70/30 split isn't appropriate for their company.Tax policy experts haven't weighed in yet on this anti-abuse provision.But their general concern is that when there's a large gap between ordinary income tax rates and pass-through rates, rules to prevent abuse are hard to make airtight, and even harder to enforce.They point to Kansas, which eliminated the tax on pass-throughs altogether in 2012 while continuing to tax wage income.State revenue fell sharply as far more filers than expected reported pass-through income.The state recently raised its taxes and ended the pass-through carve-out.
Talking about #metoo with our mothers:::::In 1979, when my mother was 18, she and her best friend worked at a pizza parlor in London.My mother appreciated her boss when she first started the job.Even at 2 a.m., he always called taxis for "the girls," making sure they got home safely at the end of the night.One afternoon the two friends showed up to start their shifts, but her boss stopped them before they got to their tables."You aren't working tonight," he said."My cousin and I are taking you out."The other waitresses watched silently as they left the restaurant.The cousin's car waited by the curb.As they walked out the restaurant's front door, my mother remembers her friend grabbing her arm, whispering, "You run this way, I run that way."They bolted in opposite directions.When they met up several streets away, my mother couldn't understand what had happened."I asked her, 'Why did we have to run away?I don't understand.That's so rude.Oh my God, we're going to get in trouble,'" she remembers."She was like, 'No, we were going to get in their car,' and I was like, 'You're right, they could have taken us anywhere.'"When my mom first told me her story, she remembered it as that time she and her friend got one over on the boss and his creepy cousin.But now, my mother says she sees the facts of her story in a different light."I think I was kind of clueless to sexual harassment," she says now."I just thought, 'Your boss tells you to do something and you do it, whether you like it or not.'"Related: How Anita Hill forever changed the way we talk about sexual harassment In the wake of sexual assault allegations against Hollywood executive Harvey Weinstein, with women everywhere sharing their own stories of harassment using the hashtag #metoo, a lot of young women are having honest -- and sometimes difficult -- conversations with their mothers.Acts of workplace harassment were still common in past decades, but less often recognized as something reportable, or even illegal.But the experience sometimes looks different after years of hindsight.My mother isn't the only one reexamining stories from her past this way.University of Maine psychology professor Amy Blackstone, who has done research on the subject of sexual harassment, titled her work after a quote from a subject: "I didn't recognize it was a bad experience until I was much older."She remembers one woman in particular, who in high school had worked as a lifeguard.She described the job as a fun summer gig, with after-work parties with coworkers.But then she remembered some of what happened during work: the groping, the inappropriate touching."As she was telling me this, she was like, 'You know, that really wasn't that fun.Now that I think about it, that really wasn't OK,'" she says."The facts of the incident didn't change, but her perspective about it changed, the way she felt about it changed, as she described it."Related: Are older generations more tolerant of sexual harassment?My mother's story didn't end when she ran away from the car.When she and her friend went back to work the next day, the boss called them into his office and yelled at them.He said they had embarrassed him.My mother said her friend just stared at the floor while he shouted.I ask my mom what she did."I probably apologized," she says.When she thinks about it now, she thinks about how smart her friend was to run, and how angry she is that they would even have been asked out like that, at work.Just a week later, my mother quit the job and moved to America.I ask her what happened when she left the restaurant.Did she file a complaint?Confront the boss?Tell other waitresses?But she didn't say anything."I felt like I was the one who was making it into a bigger deal than it probably was," she says."It was not something you even thought about.You did what you were told.I think back then, a lot of people felt that if someone complained about it, it was the woman overreacting."When my aunt later went to pick up my mother's last paycheck, the boss said he didn't have one.He looked around, pretending to be confused.He never paid "the girls" for their last week of work.How have you talked about sexual harassment with your mother?Tell us about it here and you could be featured in an upcoming story on CNNMoney.
What we know (and don't know) about Uber background checks:::::Accused terrorist Sayfullo Saipov made over 1,400 trips as an Uber driver registered in New Jersey.He passed an Uber background check about six months ago.Saipov also passed Lyft's background check -- and made 180 trips using the service, the company said.On Tuesday, Saipov allegedly killed 8 people driving a rented pickup truck to mow down cyclists on a busy Manhattan bike path.Records show Saipov had received traffic citations in the past, but Uber and Lyft said they were not disqualifying based on its criteria or under local and state law in New Jersey.News of the attack is nevertheless again drawing attention to how the companies vet their drivers.Both companies still mostly shun the idea of fingerprinting drivers.However, they've made some exceptions like in New York City, where Uber and Lyft drivers are fingerprinted because they are subject to the same standards as taxi drivers.Although the criteria for background checks varies by state, Uber mostly conducts digital background checks via a startup called Checkr.Lyft contracts with Sterling Talent Solutions for screenings.Both background check companies did not comment.According to its website, Checkr screens applicants by using Social Security numbers to identify associated addresses.It then reviews driving and criminal histories in national, state and local databases.Those databases include the U.S. Department of Justice National Sex Offender Public Website and ones that flag suspected terrorists.Sterling checks similar databases.Checkr and Sterling are bound by the Fair Credit Reporting Act, a federal law that regulates how reporting agencies use a person's information.Still, Uber makes the final call on whether to hire a driver based on Checkr's screening results, a source familiar with Checkr said.It's unclear what Lyft's decision making process is.In general, Uber drivers can't have DUIs or major moving violations within the last seven years.They're also not permitted to have more than three minor violations, such as speeding tickets, within the past three years.Drivers also can't have a criminal record that includes a conviction for a felony, violent crime or sexual offenses in the last seven years.Uber does not list on its website every type of driving incident or violation that would disqualify drivers.Lyft re-runs background and DMV checks for drivers annually.Uber doesn't have such a policy.Related: New York attack suspect drove for Lyft as well as Uber Many drivers work for both Uber and Lyft.While the companies follow similar guidelines, it's not uncommon for a driver to pass a background check for one company and not the other, according to Harry Campbell, who blogs at The Rideshare Guy and drives for both companies."It is not consistent," Campbell told CNN Tech."It shows you there are definitely some discrepancies.It's a gray area."Further complicating matters: The background process varies by state, too.For example, Massachusetts runs government background checks on drivers who are already approved to work for Uber and Lyft.Thousands of drivers failed these government screenings for inappropriate criminal charges and driving histories.While most states do not do government checks on drivers, some advocates think they should."Governments should be running background checks on Uber and Lyft drivers, not the companies themselves," said Dave Sutton, spokesman for "Who's Driving You?"an initiative from the Taxicab, Limousine & Paratransit Association."Uber and Lyft's background checks consistently miss things."Last week in Chicago, Lyft acknowledged it approved a driver with a federal conviction for aiding someone with ties to terrorism.Lyft said the man should not have passed the background check, and this was due to an error made by its screening provider.Lyft said it deactivated the driver and is re-running background checks on all drivers in Chicago "out of an abundance of caution."However, the man did not pass screening by Uber, which said he was rejected "and barred from ever joining the Uber platform."Related: 8,000 drivers fail Massachusetts background check Uber said it is quickly and aggressively reviewing Saipov's history with the company.So far, it hasn't found any safety reports that raise concerns.Lyft also didn't find any red flags associated with his account.His last background check with Uber was in July 2017 -- and he passed.His previous driving offenses include one in Platte, Missouri, for failing to equip a motor vehicle carrier with or maintain a required brake system, according to online records.Saipov also wasn't on any U.S. government terror watchlists, according to two sources familiar with the investigation.In addition, NYPD Deputy Commissioner of Counterterrorism and Intelligence John Miller said Saipov was not the subject of NYPD Intelligence Bureau or FBI investigations.Both Uber and Lyft are in contact with law enforcement authorities over the attack, the companies confirmed.-- CNN's David Shortell contributed reporting.
BMW recalling 1.4 million vehicles for risk of fires:::::BMW is recalling 1.4 million cars and SUVs in North America due to the risk they could catch fire.The company has filed two recalls with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.They affect versions of the 3-series, 5-series, X5, X3 and Z3.The first recall, which spans more than 740,000 vehicles, covers a part of the engine that can short circuit and melt.This increases the chances of a fire, even when the vehicle isn't in use.BMW, in its NHTSA filing, said it's not aware of any related accidents or injuries.Related: Subaru is the latest big Japanese company to admit it screwed up The second recall, which is for roughly 673,000 vehicles, deals with faulty wiring for the heating and air conditioning system.There's a chance it can overheat, causing the electrical connectors to melt and increasing the risk of fire, even when the vehicle is unattended.BMW received four incident reports related to this issue, with three reports of injuries.In both cases, dealers will replace the necessary parts starting Dec. 18.-- CNNMoney's Peter Valdes-Dapena contributed to this story.
Country Music Association warns press not to talk about Las Vegas shooting:::::One of America's biggest mass shootings happened recently at a country music festival but organizers at the Country Music Association don't want the tragedy to overshadow the genre's biggest night."The 51st Annual CMA Awards" will be held Wednesday, November 8 at Bridgestone Arena in Nashville, Tennessee, and it will be broadcast live on ABC.In its media guidelines CMA is asking journalists to avoid discussing several politically charged topics including the mass shooting at the Route 91 Harvest Festival in Las Vegas last month, which left 58 people dead and more than 500 injured."In light of recent events, and out of respect for the artists directly or indirectly involved, please refrain from focusing your coverage of the CMA Awards Red Carpet and Backstage Media Center on the Las Vegas tragedy, gun rights, political affiliations or topics of the like," a section of the guidelines read."It's vital, more so this year than in year's past due to the sensitivities at hand, that the CMA Awards be a celebration of Country Music and the artists that make this genre so great."The CMA Awards draw some of the music genres' biggest names and for the tenth straight year, it will be hosted by country superstars Carrie Underwood and Brad Paisley.The guidelines also includes a warning to those who don't heed them, including potentially missing out on covering country music's premiere event."It's an evening to honor the outstanding achievements in Country Music of the previous year and we want everyone to feel comfortable talking to press about this exciting time," the guidelines state."If you are reported as straying from these guidelines, your credential will be reviewed and potentially revoked via security escort."The tragedy has stirred a great deal of discussion in the country music community among fans and performers alike, given the genre's association with gun culture.Gun control debate enters country music community: 'Is this the kind of world we want to live in?'Paisley told Rolling Stone last month that he feels the pressure of handling the tragedy correctly while hosting the awards show."We're not going to ignore it, but we're not going to also dwell on that," he said.. "We have to make sure we honor those we've lost, but we also [have to] celebrate this music, which lives on, and do a good job having the heart we need to have on that night.And also the theme of the show this year is very much about unity and coming together as a format."
Apple crosses $900 billion. Next stop: $1 trillion?:::::Apple's market value on Friday briefly topped $900 billion for the first time.The company crossed that threshold after it reported strong sales and profits, and gave a healthy outlook thanks to solid demand for its new iPhone X.Is it on its way to becoming the first $1 trillion company in the U.S.?Apple would only have to go up another 11% or so to top the trillion dollar mark.Shares of Apple (AAPL, Tech30) rose 3% thanks to its blockbuster quarterly results.Investors are clearly pleased by the mostly good reviews for the iPhone X and the long lines of customers around the globe eager to get their hands on the new phone.Apple also wowed Wall Street with strong growth of its Mac computers, iPads and services division.And the company has more than $268 billion in cash that it can use for future investments, higher dividends and bigger stock buybacks.Apple's shares are now up nearly 50% this year, making it one of the best performers in the Dow.But it's not the only tech giant that's posting eye-popping numbers.Google owner Alphabet (GOOGL, Tech30) is up more than 30% this year.The company is now worth more than $715 billion.Microsoft (MSFT, Tech30) has surged 35% and has a market value of nearly $650 billion.Amazon (AMZN, Tech30) has shot up 45% and is now worth more than $525 billion.Facebook (FB, Tech30) has soared 55% and has a market value of about $520 billion.And China's Alibaba (BABA, Tech30) has more than doubled this year and is approaching a half a trillion dollar market cap, too.
Self-driving cars could make jaywalking legal:::::Self-driving cars could convert cities into pedestrian paradises.A report released this week from the National Association of City Transportation Officials, a nonprofit representing cities on transportation issues, lays out a vision for the future of city streets as autonomous vehicles arrive.Some cities look to NACTO for recommendations, but it's unclear if cities will adopt its guidance.The blueprint suggests generally limiting self-driving vehicles to 20 mph and allowing pedestrians to cross streets anywhere, rather than only at intersection crosswalks.The speed restriction would be a noticeable decline in top speeds in many cities.This may extend trip times in vehicles.The technology in self-driving cars will be able to identify when a person is trying to cross a street, and slow down.This could impact the concept of jaywalking."The instinctive human act of walking straight to one's destination, pejoratively known as 'jaywalking,' becomes simply 'walking,'" write the authors.The organization sees the adoption of autonomous vehicles as a chance to rethink how streets function.Under its plan, the big benefactors are those most vulnerable on roads: pedestrians and bicyclists.When pedestrians want to cross a street, it's not uncommon for them to walk several hundred feet out of their way.This wasn't always the case.A century ago, when cars first emerged, crossing a street mid-block was normal.Related: How free self-driving rides could change everything In 1920, the term "jaywalker" was controversial, according Peter D. Norton, author of "In Fighting Traffic: The Dawn of the Motor Age in the American City."It was popularized as a putdown for someone who didn't know how to walk properly in a city.In some cases, Boy Scouts handed out cards to jaywalkers, alerting them of their risky behavior.In 1925, a law passed in Los Angeles making the move illegal and police arrested some offenders.Jaywalking is still generally illegal, but not the rule is often not enforced.If streets are occupied by self-driving cars in the future, perhaps the biggest shift in city culture, according to NACTO, would be how easy it would be to cross streets.But the report warns that the future could also play out differently, depending on city and government policies.Traffic and emissions could skyrocket, and pedestrians could be forced to cross streets on bridges.Current transportation systems could also be replaced by new services that aren't as affordable or accessible.The Self-Driving Coalition for Safer Streets -- which represents self-driving vehicle companies such as Ford, Uber, Waymo and Volvo -- said in a statement responding to the report that autonomous vehicles should be able to follow the rules of the road, such as speed limits.Individual self-driving car companies declined to comment.Experts believe self-driving vehicles will significantly change city life, but many details are yet to be worked out.Cities may find themselves weighing tradeoffs, choosing whether to prioritize vehicles, pedestrians and other uses of streets."We have a historic opportunity to reclaim the street and to correct the mistakes of a century of urban planning," said Janette Sadik-Khan, NACTO's chair, and the former commissioner of New York City's transportation department, in the report.
5 money moves you need to make by 30:::::Turning 30 is a pretty significant milestone.If you're coming up on 30, now's a good time to take stock of your finances and get yourself on a responsible path.Here's how.1.Complete your emergency fund No matter your age, you need an emergency fund with enough cash to pay for three to six months' worth of living expenses.This way, you're covered if you find yourself out of work for a spell, or are faced with a sizable unplanned bill, like a major home or automobile repair.If your cash reserves aren't up to snuff, now's the time to start making changes that allow you to fill that emergency account.You can approach this challenge in a couple of ways.First, try reviewing your budget and seeing if there are any current costs you can cut.If you have a gym membership you're not really using, or a cable package you can easily downgrade, trimming those expenses could free up enough cash to get you to your goal.Of course, if you're really behind on savings, you'll probably need to make bigger changes, like cutting back on leisure or even trading a vehicle for public transportation.The key is to take a close look at your spending and see where there's room to improve.Another option for completing your emergency fund is to work a side hustle and bank the extra cash you bring in.Of the 44 million Americans who have an extra job, more than one-third bring home upward of $500 a month from that gig alone, so if cutting expenses doesn't do the trick, or you'd rather not deprive yourself, working more is a viable option.2.Start funding your nest egg You may not feel compelled to save for retirement, what with it being so far away.But now that you're staring down 30, it's time to start contributing to a tax-advantaged savings account, like an IRA or 401(k), immediately.Workers under 50 can put up to $5,500 a year into the former and $18,000 a year into the latter, and the earlier you get started, the more opportunity you'll give your money to grow.Take a look at the following table, which highlights the importance of saving for the future sooner rather than later: Thanks to the power of compounding, saving money when you're younger can translate into a major gain when you're older.For example, investing just $2,400 a year starting at age 30, for a total out-of-pocket contribution of $84,000, results in an ending balance of $413,000 when that money is invested at an average yearly 8% return.Not too shabby.3.Devise a smart investment strategy If your goal is to eventually retire in comfort, saving money is only part of the equation.You'll also need to put your savings to work in order to grow that cash into the largest possible sum.As a rule of thumb, savers over age 30 should have roughly 80% of their portfolio in stocks.In fact, in the above example, we saw how an 8% average annual return turned $84,000 into $413,000 over 35 years.Well, your best bet for achieving that sort of return is to go heavy on stocks.Know nothing about investing?No problem.You don't need to buy individual stocks to capitalize on the market's returns.Rather, you can load up on ETFs, or exchange-traded funds, and avoid the risk that comes with investing in specific companies.You can also consult our introductory guide to buying stocks if you're interested in taking a more customized approach to investing.Either way, take some time to figure out where to put your money so you're more likely to meet your eventual goals.4.Get out of debt It's natural to carry some amount of debt during your 20s, especially if you borrowed money for college.But as 30 approaches, you'd be wise to come up with a plan to knock out that debt so you're not still carrying it into your 40s.This might mean using one of the above tactics (cutting expenses or working a side gig) to generate extra cash to pay down your loans.But crucial as it is to eliminate student debt, it's even more critical to wipe out costly credit card debt.The typical 30-year-old carries a balance of roughly $5,800, but if you're paying 20% interest on that sum, you can easily get trapped in a cycle where you're struggling to break free.A better bet is to take a look at your various debts, figure out which are costing you the most interest, and work your way downward.5.Negotiate a higher salary Though it pays to fight for more money at any age, by the time you hit 30, you're more likely to have a solid leg to stand on than a younger worker with limited experience.Not only will boosting your income give you more flexibility to tackle the above-listed goals, but it'll open the door to higher earnings in the future.That's because when you do decide to move on to another job, you'll likely be asked about your current salary, and the higher that number is, the more generous an offer you're apt to receive.Not sure how to negotiate a raise?Start by doing your research to see what folks in your industry are commanding.Better yet, narrow your search to similar jobs in your geographic region for a true apples-to-apples comparison.Next, schedule a meeting with your manager that offers ample time to state your case, and present your research along with a list of your greatest on-the-job wins.And be sure to go in with a "nothing to lose" attitude, because really, the worst that can happen is that your boss will say no.Related

Hershey's Gold, the first new Hershey bar in 22 years, has no chocolate:::::Since 1900, just three candy bars have carried the Hershey name.Now there's a fourth.Meet Hershey's Gold, the first new Hershey bar since the chocolatier debuted the Cookies 'n Creme variety in 1995.The original milk chocolate Hershey's bar first went on sale in 1900.Hershey's Special Dark debuted in 1939.Hershey's Gold is a "caramelized creme" bar with pretzels and peanuts baked inside.Notice the missing ingredient?Yeah ... there's no chocolate in this Hershey's bar.If you're wondering what caramelized creme is, that's because it's not something Americans have seen before: Hershey says Gold is the first mass-market, golden creme confection in the United States.(Creme is the mostly-sugar-non-dairy-white-stuff filling in Oreo cookies.)Hershey says it turns the white creme gold by browning the sugar inside.That gives Gold bars a "sweet, buttery taste" topped with a creamy finish.The peanuts and pretzels add a crunch that Hershey says candy customers are longing for."Consumers favor a complex combination of ingredients, which led to the unique variation of sweet and salty, crunchy and creamy," Hershey said in a press release.For example, Hershey recently made a big advertising push for Reese's Outrageous (peanut butter cups with caramel and Reese's Pieces inside).It also launched Hershey's Cookie Layer Crunch, Popped Snack Mix and Chocolate Dipped Pretzels in the summer.Last week, Hershey posted decent third-quarter sales growth and expressed optimism that its new candies -- including Gold -- would boost consumers' candy demand.Hershey said its profit this fall would hit the high end of its previous forecast.Related: Hershey's bitter news -- 2,000 job cuts Hershey (HSY) plans to advertise Gold heavily during next year's Winter Olympics.(Gold, get it?)The company said it hired American speedskater Apolo Ohno, gymnast Simone Biles and Paralympian Rico Roman to hawk the new candy bar.Hershey's Gold will go on sale nationwide December 1.If you can't wait, you can pick one up now in Hershey's Chocolate World theme parks in Hershey, Pennsylvania, and Las Vegas.
Asia braces for Trump's trade trash talk:::::President Trump is heading to Asia and nobody there knows quite what to expect.Trump, who prides himself on unpredictability, is parachuting into a region where he's thrown decades of American economic leadership into doubt.Since taking office, he's killed the world's biggest free trade deal, taken aim at another in NAFTA, threatened to tear up a compact with South Korea, and slammed U.S. economic relationships with major Asian countries as "horrible."So how do officials in the region view his trade policies and impending visit?"With a certain amount of alarm, uncertainty and concern," said Deborah Elms, executive director of the Asian Trade Centre in Singapore, which advises governments and companies."The question on everyone's mind is, what is it the United States is proposing?"Related: Trump at odds with hosts as he embarks on wide-ranging Asia tour As little Trump as possible By axing the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), a massive trade agreement spanning 12 nations, Trump did away with a deal that the U.S. had spent years working out with countries like Japan, Australia and Vietnam."Without the TPP, there is no narrative of American economic partnership with Asia," said Aaron Connelly, a research fellow at the Lowy Institute in Sydney.Trump left the field wide open for China, which is eagerly pushing President Xi Jinping's grand project to increase trade along historic silk road routes across Asia and beyond.By showing up in person, Trump has a chance to reassure nervous allies and set a new vision for America's role in Asia.But Connelly and other experts are skeptical."My view is it's better that Trump spends as little time in Asia as possible," he said, suggesting relations with countries in the region are better handled by lower ranking U.S. government officials."U.S. Asia policy under Trump hasn't been nearly as bad as you would have expected from his campaign," Connelly said, referencing his threats to slap huge tariffs on China and label it a currency manipulator."But the more you involve him in policy, the higher the risk it will look more like his campaign."The situation is complicated by the fact that key U.S. diplomatic posts for Asia that help promote American economic interests remain unfilled.U.S. companies lack help navigating the region and government's understanding of what's happening is weaker.That's a particular issue ahead of a major visit like Trump's."The depth of Asian knowledge coming in on the U.S. side is looking very thin in terms of who is planning this trip," Elms said."I'm a little alarmed."'Paying tribute' Rather than pursuing broad regional agreements, Trump says he wants one-on-one talks with countries.He promises American workers he can get them a better deal by fixating on bilateral trade deficits and surpluses.But that approach isn't playing so well with trading partners like Japan."America First means that everyone else comes in last," Elms said."It's not the best negotiating strategy from the point of view of the other party."Related: Russia probe raises the stakes on Trump's Asia trip Asian leaders have played along with Trump's wish for them to trumpet what they're doing for the U.S. economy when they visit him at the White House, often reciting lists of investments their countries were already planning."There is a cost because it creates the appearance that these leaders are coming to Washington and paying tribute," Connelly said."Over time, I think it's a really corrosive exercise."The U.S. is still 'indispensable' The Chinese government, meanwhile, puts in time visiting other countries in the region and talking up the investments it's making there."China is very good at selling their economic engagement," Connelly said."Much better than Western countries are."The irony is that U.S. companies have invested far more in many Asian economies than their Chinese rivals."The U.S. market, capital, technology ... cannot be easily replaced," said Shalendra Sharma, a professor at the University of San Francisco who specializes in globalization."The American economy, with all its flaws, is still indispensable."Related: Japan and Canada want to resurrect Pacific trade deal Trump killed The North Korea distraction The danger is that Trump takes this U.S. advantage for granted rather than trying to build on it.Related: North Korean crabs in China show challenge facing Trump In the absence of leadership from the U.S., governments in the region are pushing ahead on their own.The 11 other countries who signed up for the TPP have been negotiating a new agreement that they may announce at a regional summit in Vietnam that Trump is also attending.But Trump is more likely to be focused on the nuclear threat from North Korea during the trip.That could reduce the risk of a spat over trade -- for the time being, at least."Sooner or later, it is possible that he will become tired of the North Korea issue, especially once it becomes clear to him how little leverage he has," Gareth Leather, an analyst at research firm Capital Economics, wrote in a note."If this happens, trade tensions with China or South Korea could easily start to flare up."
Now Amazon is coming for Sharpie, Rubbermaid and Elmer's:::::The company that makes Sharpie pens, Rubbermaid, Elmer's glue and Yankee Candles is in deep trouble.Newell Brands (NWL) is taking it from all sides.The company said Thursday that poor back to school sales, Toys 'R' Us' bankruptcy and consumers' changing shopping habits dragged sales down 7% from last year."You name it, we experienced it this quarter," CEO Michael Polk said on a conference call with investors Thursday."Obviously, this is a disappointing outcome, and as CEO, I take full responsibility for these results."Exasperated investors sent shares of the company tumbling nearly 27%.Related: Hasbro hurt by Toys 'R' Us bankruptcy Toys 'R' Us' bankruptcy hurt Newell's baby products line-up, which includes Graco strollers and baby car seats.Baby's 'R' Us has been one of the Newell's top customers.The company said store closures have weighed on sales and will continue to drag them down during the holiday stretch.Polk noted that baby products had been one of the company's best performing businesses, and Toys 'R' Us' bankruptcy is forcing the Newell to "re-plan" its future.Lackluster back-to-school shopping hurt Newell's writing division.Retailers like Staples chose not to restock their shelves with popular Newell products like Sharpie, Uniball, Expo, Elmer's and Mr.Sketch."Writing had the most significant impact on the quarter," Polk said."A number of retailers canceled late September back-to-school replenishment orders and we will not get most of those orders back in the fourth quarter."Rubbermaid was hit particularly hard by customers switching to online shopping on sites like Amazon (AMZN, Tech30).Stores are ordering fewer plastic containers for their inventories, since Rubbermaid products are remaining on store shelves, unpurchased."This [retail] landscape change that's going on is as profound as I've experienced in my 35 years," Polk said.Newell's (NWL) $15 billion acquisition of Yankee Candle maker Jarden in 2015 is also failing to live up to high expectations, and one analyst says investors may have lost confidence in Newell's leadership."Investors are throwing in the towel," said Rupesh Parikh, an analyst at Oppenheimer."The company can't deliver on the ... longer term growth it promised."
How did this happen? 3 questions for Twitter after it deleted Trump's account:::::We know this much: A Twitter employee used their final day at the company to delete President Trump's account.The account, which has more than 41 million followers, was restored after just 11 minutes, and Twitter says it's conducting an internal review.But the company's statements have raised more questions than they've answered: How did this happen?And could it again?Here are three key questions Twitter (TWTR, Tech30) has yet to answer: How could this happen?The fact that one worker was able to take down the president's account left people asking whether Twitter has appropriate internal controls.The early consensus seems to be "no.""This is a case of human negligence and lack of process in place," said Subramanian Udaiyappan, a Bangalore-based cybersecurity specialist at Cisco."Twitter needs to ensure that only the right people have access to such actions and these have to go through process permissions, approvals and logging before any action is taken by an employee."Related: Twitter employee briefly shut down Trump's account on last day of work People are also puzzled over how Twitter detected the issue so quickly."Eleven minutes?Does that mean he checks his Twitter account every 60 seconds?!?How did they get it back up so fast and HOW could this happen?"asked a Twitter user named Luke Tucker.Who did it?Twitter didn't name the staffer who deactivated Trump's account, but it did describe the person as a "customer support employee."One big question: How many employees at Twitter have the same power?Employees that review accounts for abuse typically have the power to suspend users, according to a former consultant for Twitter who asked not to be identified.The consultant said that many of these employees tend to be relatively junior a common practice across social media firms.The situation "raises bigger questions on privacy as to what level of information access does a normal Twitter employee get," Udaiyappan said.Related: Twitter accidentally suspends its own CEO's account Has it happened before?High-profile accounts have gone offline before, causing confusion and uproar.Twitter temporarily suspended the account of actress Rose McGowan in October after she tweeted about sexual harassment allegations made against Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein.The move caused a huge backlash, and Twitter later reversed it.The company said it suspended McGowan's account because the actress had tweeted a private phone number, a violation of its terms of service.Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey would later announce new rules over "unwanted sexual advances, non-consensual nudity, hate symbols, violent groups, and tweets that glorifies violence."Dorsey has had his own problems using Twitter.His account was abruptly suspended last year in what he later described as an "internal mistake."Trump addressed his account's suspension in a tweet early Friday."My Twitter account was taken down for 11 minutes by a rogue employee," he wrote."I guess the word must finally be getting out-and having an impact."My Twitter account was taken down for 11 minutes by a rogue employee.I guess the word must finally be getting out-and having an impact.Donald J.

Believe in gender equality? Now you can invest in it:::::Want to invest in gender equality?There's a growing number of ways to do that.Earlier this year, National Australia Bank raised 500 million Australian dollars ($384 million) from investors keen to promote gender equality at work, and get a healthy return on their cash.It was the country's first gender bond."It's not often that you see capital markets and diversity come together," said Eva Zileli, head of group funding at National Australia Bank.The proceeds from the five-year bond, which offered investors an annual return of 3.25%, have been loaned to companies in Australia that are trying to foster greater equality between men and women at work.One of the companies is Mirvac, a real estate group praised by the Australian government's Workplace Gender Equality Agency for its commitment to appointing more women to its board.Mirvac set a target for women to make up half its board and reached it almost three years ahead of schedule.Related: It's getting even harder to be a women With its gender equality bond, NAB is following in the footsteps of the International Finance Corporation, an arm of the World Bank that lends to business in developing countries.The IFC launched its "Banking on Women" bond program back in 2013."It was the first bond program of its kind focused on creating opportunities for women entrepreneurs in emerging markets," said Denise Odaro, head of investor relations at IFC."Two [Banking on Women] bonds were issued in 2013 and 2014, which raised $268 million and supported over 20 projects."Growing demand for 'social bonds' The growing demand for investments that finance social projects prompted the International Capital Market Association (ICMA) in London to issue new transparency guidelines for social bonds this year.The IFC has since merged its Banking on Women program into a wider social bond program, a move that Odaro says has helped it to widen its investor base."There is certainly growing investor appetite for bonds that are themed as environmental, social and governance," said Odaro."The shift we are seeing is the appeal of the product to mainstream investors, although this is not without challenges such as the need for liquidity and diversity of issuers."Related: 6 ways to invest and change the world Environmental bonds still dominate in terms of volume -- ICMA data show that over $80 billion worth of green bonds were issued in the first nine months of this year, already ahead of the 2016 total.But social bonds are gaining momentum.Zileli said NAB's gender bond was a "natural progression" for the bank, which had previously issued bonds to finance climate projects.And the Australian bank has plans to issue more social bonds."We'd like to continue to build on our socially responsible investment bond issuance, whether that's gender or another theme," Zileli said.Social bonds, including gender bonds, should continue to attract more investors, but are unlikely to match climate bond volumes."I don't think it has the capacity to be as big as green," Zileli said."There's a defined amount of lending to support diversity activities.I don't think there's enough lending in that space to see this type of bond reach the levels of climate bonds," she added.One barrier to growth is measuring the impact of the investment.With a climate bond, investors can see how many carbon emissions have been saved.With social bonds, it's harder to agree reporting standards for different borrowers and themes, Zileli said.
Did Russia make this ship disappear?:::::Gurvan Le Meur was steering the 37,500-tonne oil tanker Atria toward the Russian port of Novorossiysk when something odd happened.His ship disappeared."First we had a few alarms -- losing signal alarms," the ship's captain said of the June incident."We quickly found that the position given by the GPS was offset by about 20 nautical miles."Alarms were ringing because the ship's navigation system, which is underpinned by the Global Positioning System (GPS), showed that the tanker was located inland, at a regional airport near the resort town of Gelendzhik.The system showed other vessels in the same position.Le Meur checked his systems, and reported the incident to the U.S. Coast Guard.The U.S. Maritime Administration would later issue an advisory about the incident, confirming that more than 20 other ships in the area had reported the same type of interference.Experts say the episode was likely the result of interference with GPS, a navigation system developed by the U.S. Air Force that is now used in a wide range of civilian applications.They say the system's signal was most likely "spoofed," or overpowered by a stream of false data."It's clearly deliberate, to make receivers in one location believe that they're in another location," said Dana Goward, president of the Resilient Navigation and Timing Foundation.Who was behind the interference?Experts point to Russia.There has been a major uptick in reports of GPS interference in Russia and its territorial waters in recent years.In 2017, maritime analytics company Windward has tracked nearly 450 cases of ships being at sea when their locations have mistakenly been displayed at airports in Sochi, St. Petersburg and Gelendzhik.In 2016, smartphone users attempting to access Uber and Google Maps near the Kremlin reported that the apps showed their position as being 20 miles away at Vnukovo Airport.A CNN team in Moscow was able to replicate the error at the time."Do I think this is a sign that the spoofing is government backed or state sponsored?"said Todd Humphreys, an assistant professor at the University of Texas at Austin."I would have to say the evidence points to 'yes.'" Russian officials did not respond to multiple requests for comment.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told Russian news agency TASS in October 2016 that he had also experienced the signal jump while driving.At the time, he referred all queries to the Russian Federal Protection Service, which is charged with protecting the Kremlin.That agency declined to comment.Some experts believe it's a defense tactic and is tied to protect President Vladimir Putin's movements.A vulnerable system?GPS underpins an incredible range of modern systems: It is used to track deliveries as well as create maps.It gives accurate location measurements in severe weather, and financial institutions use its clock functions to time stamp transactions.Reports of interference have raised concerns that the system may be vulnerable to disruptions that would result in severe economic damage.A report published this year by London Economics estimated a navigation systems outage would cost Britain's economy roughly 1 billion ($1.3 billion) a day."I have seen an example of the time stamps intended for a stock exchange being slowly, slowly moved, so that they become incorrect," said David Last, former president of the Royal Institute of Navigation."It is possible to attack financial institutions in this way."Humphreys said that his research shows "we are dangerously vulnerable to spoofing.""We depend dearly on GPS signals for timing and location all the way through our infrastructure, and we've never really been tested on our vulnerability," he added."We're only getting a taste of that now ... on the eastern seaboard of the Black Sea."Humphreys has himself demonstrated several GPS vulnerabilities.In 2012, he managed to spoof a drone, and a year later his team used a similar technique to move an $80 million dollar yacht off its intended course in the Mediterranean Sea - with the cooperation of its owner - as part of a test."We found that we didn't raise any alarms on the bridge," he said of the experiment."The spoofing was clandestine."Large vessels and planes have backup systems that reduce the impact of GPS spoofing.Other solutions are available -- but they are pricey, and until now spoofing hasn't been considered a threat.'Incompetent' tech Brad Parkinson was the chief architect of GPS, and led the first blind landing of a commercial aircraft using the system.For him, the problem is one of technology -- and priorities."There are many receivers today that are incompetent in terms of jamming and spoofing," he said."A good receiver can be toughened ... but frankly it hasn't been done.The economic imperative has not been there."

Quest: Trump and trade come home to roost:::::Quest's Profitable Moment As President Trump heads to Vietnam for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit, the full force and ramifications of his trade policies will be clear to see.Firstly, he will come face to face with the leaders from all 11 other countries that were part of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the trade pact that fell apart after Trump withdrew the U.S. from it shortly after he was inaugurated.Those other countries, led by Japan and New Zealand, have been trying to salvage what they can and cobble together a new deal without America that may come to fruition early next year.Canada & Mexico will also be at APEC.Both governments are bravely trying to re-negotiate the NAFTA treaty with the U.S. and salvage what they can -- even as Trump seems hell-bent on leaving NAFTA if he can't get a better deal.Sign up for the weekly Quest newsletter in your inbox Then there's China -- a country that has borne the brunt of Trump's tough talk and threats.There has been a lot of noise from Washington about currency manipulation and closed markets, but no action yet.Meanwhile, the Chinese are taking advantage of the TPP's collapse by pushing their own deal for Asia -- the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership.President Trump promoted reforms of U.S. trade policies a cornerstone of his campaign and is following through in his administration.But we may soon see just how much progress he's made -- or damage that's been done with America's economic allies.Trump nominates Powell for Fed Chair President Trump nominated Jerome Powell (above) to lead the Federal Reserve.Powell is expected to maintain the Fed's policies of gradually raising interest rates.He's also a proponent of Dodd-Frank, the sweeping banking regulation instituted after the financial crisis.The decision means that Trump elected not to renominate current Chair Janet Yellen to another 4-year term, breaking the precedent of the last 40 years.Yellen is handing over the keys to Powell with the U.S. economy in much better shape since she joined the Board of Governors in 2010.Yellen and Powell also met with the rest of the Fed's monetary policy committee on Wednesday and decided not to raise rates, though a December rate hike is likely.-- Patrick Gillespie New York City withstands deadly terror attack U.S. investigators are scrambling to get to the bottom of Tuesday's terror attack in New York City.Authorities say a 29-year-old man driving a rented pickup truck plowed into a crowd of bicyclists and pedestrians and crashed the truck into a school bus, killing eight people.The Manhattan neighborhood where the devastation took place has transformed in the past two decades -- particularly since the September 11 attacks.Also of note: Sayfullo Saipov, the suspected attacker, was a driver for both Uber and Lyft.-- Julia Horowitz Social media goes to Washington Facebook told U.S. lawmakers as many as 126 million users may have been exposed to content from a Russia-linked troll farm trying to meddle in the U.S. election.Lawyers from Facebook, Google and Twitter faced tough questions from politicians at several hearings.Some wanted Congress to push harder though, and others wondered why the CEOs weren't asked to testify.But Mark Zuckerberg addressed the topic in Facebook's earnings call, saying that it plans to invest heavily in security -- even if it comes at the expense of profits.-- Paul R.

U.S. unemployment drops to lowest in 17 years:::::America's job market got back on its feet in October.The U.S. economy rebounded from the hurricanes and added 261,000 jobs, the best performance of the Trump administration.Unemployment inched down to 4.1%, the lowest since December 2000."This labor market is still really firing on all cylinders," says Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West in San Francisco.But wages took a step back.They grew only 2.4% in October compared with a year earlier, behind September's number.The absence of better wage growth and inflation is one of the biggest mysteries in the economy.Related: Trump nominates Jerome Powell to lead Federal Reserve The United States has added jobs for 85 straight months, the longest streak on record.The government first estimated that the economy lost 33,000 jobs in September because of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma.Revised figures show a gain of 18,000 instead.The job gains for October were across the board.Restaurants reopened after the storms, adding 89,000 jobs after losing roughly the same amount in September.Business services gained 50,000 positions.Health care firms hired 22,000 employees.Manufacturing kept growing.The industry gained 24,000 positions in October.Since the U.S. presidential election last year, manufacturing has gained a strong 156,000 jobs.Economists attribute those gains to the renewed strength of the global economy and a weak U.S. dollar, which makes American exports more affordable for foreigners to buy.Manufacturing firms rely heavily on shipping and selling abroad.Related: Trump passes over America's most powerful woman Improved technology is persuading some U.S. companies to stay local, too, experts add."The cost differences are starting to make more sense for companies to produce more goods in America," says Cathy Barrera, chief economist at ZipRecruiter.There were some concerning figures in the report.More than 700,000 Americans left the labor market in October.Although the Labor Department didn't give a reason, that could be because Baby Boomers keep retiring.So the unemployment rate dropped for what economists think of as the wrong reason -- a shrinking labor force, not just more hiring.Some industries also registered minor job losses, such as mining, which lost 2,000 workers, and retail stores, which lost 8,000.Still, the overall picture is very good -- although getting to this point after the financial crisis has been a crawl, economists point out."You can look it at as a marathon or a sprint.Other expansions were more like a sprint.This is a marathon," says Robert Frick, chief economist at the Navy Federal Credit Union.Another way to put it: "The party can go on for a lot longer.It's just not a wild party."
Venezuela: We can't pay our debts anymore:::::Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro finally admitted his government can't afford to pay all of its mounting bills.Maduro said in a televised speech Thursday that Venezuela and its state-run oil company, PDVSA, will seek to restructure their debt payments.The oil company made a $1.1 billion payment on Thursday, he said, a sizable amount for a country with only $10 billion left in the bank."But after this payment, starting today, I decree a refinancing and a restructuring of the external debt," Maduro told the country.Venezuela is already deep into a humanitarian crisis, with people suffering from food and medical shortages.Many can't afford to buy basic items because prices are skyrocketing faster than wages.The country's currency, the bolivar, is worth less than a tenth of a U.S. penny.Related: Venezuela blames Trump for missed debt payments If Maduro's government can't reach a new agreement with bondholders over the debt restructuring -- which often means trying to pay less money -- it will end up defaulting.That would trigger a potentially ugly series of events.Investors in the U.S. and elsewhere could seize Venezuelan oil as collateral.Oil is the government's only significant source of external revenue and therefore its only way to buy food and medicine for its 30 million citizens.Because the government mismanaged vast swaths of farmland, it must import almost all food.Agreeing on a new payment schedule is no easy feat with Wall Street investors.Just ask Argentina.Its government fought in U.S. courts for 15 years to resolve its unpaid debts.Argentina's government was shut out of international debt markets over that time, which ultimately crippled its economy.Argentines called the investors "vulture funds" because they bought the bonds on the cheap and then sued the government to get much higher payments.The two sides reached a settlement in early 2016, shortly after a new Argentine government took office.Related: Venezuela tell citizens to eat rabbits amid food shortages Venezuela's experience at the negotiating table could actually be much worse.All told, Venezuela owes about $65 billion in bonds denominated in foreign currencies, mostly in dollars, according to research firm Capital Economics.Venezuela also owes debts to China, Russia, oil service providers, airlines and a slew of other entities.Its top negotiator also has a problem: He can't do business in the U.S. Maduro has appointed Vice President Tareck El Aissami to lead the debt restructuring efforts.In February, the U.S. Treasury Department accused El Aissami of drug trafficking and froze his assets in the U.S. El Aissami denies the accusations.Meanwhile, Maduro and others in his government have tried to pin the blame on President Trump for Venezuela's debt problems after Trump slapped stiff financial sanctions on the country in August.After the state oil company, PDVSA, made a large debt payment last week, it didn't mince its words.The company said it made the payment, "despite the economic war, unjustified imposition of sanctions by Donald Trump, and the sabotage, persecution and financial blockade to which the Republic and its institutions have been subjected by a significant portion of the international financial system as commanded by imperialism."
Plaintiff in Russia dossier suit argues BuzzFeed isn't a real news organization:::::Lawyers for a Russian tech executive are asking a federal judge to force BuzzFeed to reveal its source for an unverified dossier about Donald Trump that it published in full earlier this year.Their argument: BuzzFeed isn't a real news organization.In court papers filed Wednesday in Florida federal court, attorneys representing Aleksej Gubarev and his companies tried to prove that BuzzFeed does not qualify for the reporters' privilege that would allow it to avoid naming its source because it is not "a newspaper, news journal, news agency, press association, wire service, radio or TV station, network, or news magazine."As such, the plaintiffs argue, BuzzFeed does not qualify for the privilege under a 1998 Florida law.Related: Russian tech exec sues Buzzfeed for publishing unverified Trump dossier While the filings cite an arcane statute, the argument also has echoes of an era when BuzzFeed was thought of more as a supplier of listicles and cat videos and less about its reporting.It also goes back to a time when news websites and bloggers were often looked down upon by more traditional journalists."Anyone paying attention to current events would be surprised by this claim, given the string of massive stories BuzzFeed News has recently broken, from allegations against Kevin Spacey, to connections among white supremacists and right-wing media--which led this week to the billionaire Robert Mercer severing ties with Breitbart," BuzzFeed News spokesperson Matt Mittenthal said in a statement."It would also come as a surprise to President Trump's White House, where BuzzFeed News occupies a seat in the press briefing room.We look forward to demonstrating that publishing the dossier - which is the subject of multiple federal investigations and was circulating at the highest levels of government - was, and continues to be, in the public interest."Since tapping Ben Smith as its editor in 2011, BuzzFeed has produced a number of memorable scoops, as the site has transformed from a site known largely for clickbait to an award-winning news organization.But lawyers for Gubarev argued Wednesday that BuzzFeed writers "could win the Nobel Prize for literature and still not qualify for protection" in Florida.Smith isn't covered by the reporters' privilege either, the filing asserts, because -- by their argument -- he's not employed by a news organization.Gubarev sued BuzzFeed and Smith for defamation in February, less than a month after the site published an unverified dossier containing allegations involving President Donald Trump and Russia.As his lawyers' filing notes, the dossier named Gubarev, the CEO of the web hosting company XBT Holding, and said that he had been "recruited under duress" by Russia's FSB and that he had become a "significant player" in the operation to hack the Democratic National Committee.Gubarev denies these allegations.BuzzFeed redacted Gubarev's name from their published version of the dossier and issued an apology for including it shortly after the lawsuit was filed.Gubarev filed the suit in Florida, where an XBT subsidiary is based.Wednesday's filings also said that Gubarev's attorneys have subpoenaed the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, the New Yorker, Mother Jones, Yahoo News and CNN for depositions in an attempt to reveal who leaked the dossier to BuzzFeed.
iPhone X goes on sale around the world:::::Apple fans can finally turn themselves into an animated pig emoji on their very own iPhone X.The company's newest smartphone started going on sale in stores around the world Friday.It's become a tradition for hundreds of dedicated customers to line-up outside stores around the world to be among the first to own the new iPhones.Apple enthusiast Rupert Legallias in London lined up for hours, as he did for previous launches for the iPhone 5S and iPhone 6, but he said this event was disorganized and his model sold out before he could get it."There was only 120 people in front of me in the [line].Their stock level must have been non-existent," he said."It's just a disappointment."People who pre-ordered online will also start receiving their devices in the mail on Friday.Pre-orders for the iPhone X started early Tuesday morning.But within 15 minutes, the main Apple site in the U.S. ran out of devices that would ship on November 3.The wait times for online sales have jumped several weeks.To celebrate the iPhone's 10th anniversary, Apple included a number of major changes to the iPhone X.The screen takes up more space on the device, and replaces the Home button with face-detection technology.But those features don't come cheap.The iPhone X starts at $999 in the U.S. and significantly more in many other countries.Apple has tried something new this year, launching two different iPhone models six weeks apart.The iPhone 8 and 8 Plus went on sale September 21, but excitement was tepid outside Apple Stores compared to previous releases.Fewer people appeared to line up in person for that device, which cost hundreds less than the iPhone X.The iPhone 8 devices are more traditional than the X.They added wireless charging, better cameras, and faster processors, but nothing as thrilling and futuristic as an animated poop emoji.Related: iPhone X first impressions: The highs, lows and quirks In Hong Kong, the iPhone X sells at a premium price, starting at 8,588 Hong Kong dollars ($1,100).But most people buying the latest model at a store in the city's main shopping district on Friday were Apple loyalists, willing to pony up the extra cash."The phone is worth the price.I've always been an iPhone user.I really like how the new iPhone X looks with the all-screen design," said KC Wong, a secretary in her 40s.Related: The iPhone X won't solve Apple's China problems Several shoppers CNNMoney spoke with in Hong Kong were excited about being able to unlock their new phone with their face, but some were concerned about privacy."Even if Apple says it's secure, you never know if an accidental glance on the phone would unlock certain things on your phone.There are still privacy risks," said 27-year-old Leo Ko.But those concerns didn't stop him from buying the device.iPhone X is here!A big thank-you to all our customers in Sydney, and everyone turning out around the world Friday!pic.twitter.com/5NKXUnePLu Tim Cook (@tim_cook) November 2, 2017 Though the company has not released any sales figures yet, Apple CEO Tim Cook said on an earnings call Thursday that pre-orders for the iPhone X have been "very strong."He cited early reports of lines forming outside its stores ahead of the launch.iPhone sales grew 3% in the most recent quarter, with 46.7 million iPhones sold in the three-month period ending September 30.The company said it expects sales for the upcoming holiday quarter to hit between $84 billion and $87 billion.-- Seth Fiegerman, Kinnie Li and Emma Bowden contributed to this report
Apple fans lose sleep in wild dash to grab new iPhone X:::::Want an iPhone X today?Good luck, unless you staked out a spot at an Apple store.Long lines -- some snaking for blocks -- of Apple enthusiasts are greeting Apple store employees this morning.The iPhone X (pronounced "ten") officially hits store shelves today, though customers willing to wake up early on Oct. 27 were able to preorder the smartphone, which starts at $999 and features an all-new 5.8-inch super retina display with OLED screen and facial-recognition technology.Tech analyst Jan Dawson of Jackdaw Research said he expects every iPhone X thats available today will sell out.But it won't be the tech giant's bestselling model."Its sharing the lineup with the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus and theyll take a decent amount of share of sales this year, too," he said this morning in an email to ABC News.Bodo Marks/dpa Photo via Newscom A line of people are standing outside of the Apple store for the #iPhoneX, a $1K phone that costs $300 to fix a broken screen and has features that Samsung has had for years.????princewonder (@princewonder) November 3, 2017 Are you getting the new #iphone?There is already a line forming for the #iPhoneX in Scottsdale this morning.#abc15 pic.twitter.com/03QA7ImmW3 ABC15 Arizona (@abc15) November 3, 2017 https://twitter.com/abc15/status/926443369860972545 Apple CEO Tim Cook would not reveal how many iPhone Xs were preordered last month but he said Thursday in the company's fourth-quarter earnings telephone call that preorders were "very strong."Brian White, an analyst with Drexel Hamilton, wrote in a recent research report that the iPhone X has taken the "iPhone franchise to a whole new level ... pushing the company deep into the ultra-luxury smartphone market with the highest priced iPhone in the companys history.We believe the iPhone X will become the new status symbol in the smartphone world."White, like Dawson, believes the iPhone X will sell out, and the hype will only get bigger."It's a game changer," he told ABC News."Once people see their friends buying this," they'll want one, too, he said, adding, "Demand is very strong and will continue until 2018."As for the customers willing to wait in the dark to buy an iPhone X?It's a tradition for some to spend hours -- if not days -- outside a store for the excitement of being one of the first ones in on launch day, White said.Others, however, may not even realize the iPhone X was available for sale online."The online system is so flawless and easy to use," White said.Robert Fine, founder and publisher of VR Voice, an online site that covers virtual and augmented-reality industry ecosystems, said the iPhone X will likely be one of the must-have gifts this holiday season."It will be as hard to find as a Cabbage Patch doll was in the '80s," he told ABC News.For customers who will inevitably walk away empty-handed, fear not: Production of the iPhone X is increasing every week and the company is going to get as many iPhone Xs to customers as quickly as possible, Cook said.CJ Gunther/EPA
How to score Black Friday deals weeks before Thanksgiving:::::Halloween costumes are barely put away and candy remains to be eaten but retailers are already releasing deals normally reserved for the day after Thanksgiving.Black Friday deals from companies including Dell, Amazon, Walmart and Groupon are letting consumers get an early start on their holiday shopping.Some of the retailers are getting very excited and pushing the deals starting today, Janice Lieberman, consumer expert for DealNews, told ABC News.E-commerce giant Amazon is hoping to lead the pack by rolling out deals 23 days ahead of Black Friday.David Paul Morris/Bloomberg via Getty Images Amazon opened a Countdown to Black Friday deals store on Nov. 1 that features discounts on toys, appliances and electronics.Some of the deals include a vacuum discounted by $85 and Beats headphones marked $40 off.Walmart also already has a page dedicated to its holiday specials, including a Samsung TV normally priced at $1,599 that's now $597.EBay is introducing new daily deals every five minutes now through Nov. 9.Best Buy started offering free shipping through Christmas Day on Oct. 30, while Groupon started its "12 Days of Doorbusters" on Nov. 1.Even with the early deals, experts say some items will be worth waiting until Black Friday to buy.DealNews predicts flat screen televisions could be priced as low as $70.Mohammed Elshamy/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images Lieberman said consumers can also buy now and ask for a discount later.Some of the deals out there are awesome right now but we believe they are going to get even better, she said.So if you feel like youve got to have that item and you've never seen it that cheap buy it [and] hold on to the receipt.She added, Then go back later if it goes down and say 'Hey, please adjust the price.I want it cheaper.'ABC News' Taylor Dunn contributed to this report.
Equifax calls executive stock sales days after breach legal:::::Equifax, the credit report company hacked over the summer exposing the personal information of 145 million Americans, said a special committee has determined that none of the four executives who sold shares at the time did anything wrong.The high-level executives sold shares worth a combined $1.8 million in the days immediately after the company discovered the breach.When Equifax went public with the breach in early September, company shares cratered, erasing about $2.35 billion of its market value.The company revealed that an ongoing cyberattack lasted from mid-May to July.Equifax Inc. said it detected the hack on July 29.On Aug. 1 and Aug. 2, Equifax Chief Financial Officer John Gamble and three other executives sold a combined $1.8 million in stock.The company said Friday that a special committee comprised of independent directors, and advised by an independent counsel, found that none of the executives had knowledge of the breach when their trades were made.The committee's review included dozens of interviews and the scouring of more than 55,000 documents including emails, text messages, phone logs and other records.The report Friday is unlikely to relieve pressure on the beleaguered company, which badly bungled the response to the hack.Investigators will want to know how a breach of this size and scope could have occurred, without the knowledge of some of the company's highest executives.Faith in the leadership and the security of private information eroded in the weeks after the attack.Anxious consumers experienced jammed phone lines and clueless company representatives.An Equifax website set up to help people determine their exposure was described as sketchy by security experts.The site provided inconsistent and unhelpful information to many.The company blamed the problems of an online customer help page on a vendor's software code after it appeared that it had been hacked as well.High-level executives, including CEO Richard Smith, have already stepped down.The internal report did not appear to ease the apprehension of those who hold company stock.Shares were essentially flat on Friday.That's because it is the Securities and Exchange Commission, the federal agency that enforces securities laws, which will have the final say.SEC Chairman Jay Clayton has refused to comment when asked by lawmakers if executives at Equifax engaged in insider trading when they sold their shares.He has not confirmed or denied that the SEC is investigating.Smith, the former Equifax CEO, appeared before Congress to answer questions from lawmakers, but they were far from satisfied with the answers they received.The Atlanta company is under multiple state and federal investigations and has been sued by numerous customers in litigation likely to evolve into class-action lawsuits.What makes the data breach so dangerous is the information that Equifax holds.Social security numbers, identification, addresses and personal information held by Equifax and the two other, major credit agencies is used to determine a person's creditworthiness.
More than 40M fire extinguishers that may not work recalled:::::More than 40 million fire extinguishers, some on the market for more than four decades, are being recalled because they may not work in an emergency.One death has been linked to problems with the extinguishers made by Kidde, according to a notice Thursday from the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission.In 2014, extinguishers failed to function as they should for emergency personnel responding to a fiery car wreck.The recall covers 134 models of push-button and plastic-handle extinguishers in the U.S. and Canada made from 1973 through Aug. 15 of this year.It includes models that were previously recalled in March of 2009 and February of 2015, the commission said Thursday.The government says the extinguishers can become clogged and fail to spray when needed.Also, the nozzle can come off with enough force to pose an injury hazard.Including the death, the CPSC says there have been 391 reports of extinguishers failing to work properly or of nozzles coming off, resulting in 16 injuries that included smoke inhalation and minor burns.Also, there were about 91 reports of property damage linked to the problem.Owners should contact Kidde to ask for a free replacement and for instructions on how to return recalled models.Kidde can be reached at (855) 271-0773 or at www.kidde.com .Kidde, based in Mebane, N.C., near Raleigh, says it has worked closely with the government to start the recall and make sure the extinguishers are replaced with different models as quickly as possible.The company also makes smoke detectors and other fire safety products.The recalled extinguishers are red, white and silver and are either ABC or BC rated.They were sold at Menards, Montgomery Ward, Sears, Home Depot, Wal-Mart and other home and hardware stores, as well as on Amazon.com, ShopKidde.com and other online retailers.They also were sold for use in commercial trucks, recreational vehicles and boats.
Ready for the golden years? 8 facts on retirement savings:::::Americans planning for their golden years got a few more grey hairs last week when Washington floated the idea of curtailing the tax-deferred contributions that workers make to their 401(k) accounts.President Donald Trump quickly pushed back on the possibility, but a key Republican tax cutter responded by saying an adjustment to the 401(k) is still on the table.The debate raises the question: Just how ready are most Americans for retirement?Most people will need a combination of savings and Social Security to get by, money they might need to stretch over decades.Some are better able to save before retiring than others.And it's almost inevitable that as a person ages beyond 65, they'll pay more for health care.Getty Images As Americans await the fate of their 401(k) contributions, here are eight facts to keep in mind about the nation's retirement readiness: 1.A little more than half of America has a retirement account, such as a 401(k) or Individual Retirement Account, according to the Federal Reserve.2.Not everyone can save in a 401(k), even if they want to, because not all jobs offer one.Only 35 percent of low-income working households had access to a 401(k) or similar plan, according to a recent study by the U.S. Government Accountability Office.For high-income households, meanwhile, it's 80 percent.3.The typical household with a retirement account had $60,000 last year, but there's big variation.Among the top 10 percent of households by income, the typical amount of savings was $403,000.Middle-income households had a median of $25,000.4.Millennials have more than their parents did at a similar age.The typical household led by someone aged less than 35 with a retirement account had $12,300 last year.In 1989, those same kinds of households had $7,500, after accounting for inflation.Getty Images 5.The age to get full retirement benefits from Social Security is moving higher.Someone who is 66 years old today can get full benefits.But full-retirement age will move up slowly, beginning with people born in 1955, until it hits 67 for people born in 1960 and later.6.Retirement can last for decades.Once an American woman gets to 65 years old, life expectancy is an additional 20.6 years, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.For men, it's 18 years.7.Don't forget about health care costs.A 65-year-old couple will need an estimated $275,000 to cover health care and medical expenses through their retirement, according to Fidelity.That doesn't include nursing-home or long-term care costs.8.The traditional corporate pension, where workers get a set amount sent to them through retirement, is disappearing.Only 13 percent of private-sector workers were participating in such a plan in 2014, according to the Employee Benefit Research Institute.In 1979, the rate was nearly triple that, at 38 percent.
US hiring jumps after hurricanes as employers add 261K jobs:::::U.S. employers added a solid 261,000 jobs in October in a bounce-back from the hurricanes that slammed the Southeast in September.The unemployment rate declined to 4.1 percent, the lowest in nearly 17 years, from 4.2 percent in September, the Labor Department said Friday.But the drop in the rate occurred mostly because many people stopped looking for work and so were no longer counted as unemployed.October's burst of hiring largely reflects a rebound from the hurricanes that temporarily depressed job gains in September.But it also shows that for all their fury, the storms didn't knock the economy or the job market off course.Over the past three months, job growth has averaged 162,000, similar to the pace of hiring before the hurricanes."Hiring got a boost from the post-hurricane rebound, but the underlying trend remained steady," said Jed Kolko, chief economist at Indeed, a job-search website.In part because of the durability of the job market, the Federal Reserve is likely on track to raise its short-term interest rate in December.That could lead to slightly higher mortgage rates and other borrowing costs over time.At the same time, Republicans in Congress proposed tax cuts Thursday that they say would fuel faster economic growth and job gains.That might be hard to achieve with unemployment already so low.Many employers already complain that they can't find the workers they need.Because the tax proposals would also swell the budget deficit by $1.5 trillion over a decade, the tax cuts might also be temporary.Tax experts generally say that permanent tax cuts are more likely to bolster the economy than are tax cuts that expire.When the Penn Wharton Budget Model examined a similar plan, it found that tax cuts would increase economic growth by 0.13 percent annually for a decade.That is a far cry from President Donald Trump's claims that he could lift annual growth by a full percentage point on a sustained basis.The proportion of adults who are either working or looking for work fell last month to 62.7 percent, slightly lower than a year ago.That drop suggests that there aren't many people on the sidelines who want jobs.Despite a shortfall of workers, average hourly pay rose just 2.4 percent from a year ago, nearly one-half percentage point lower than September's annual gain.That figure might have been distorted by the storms: Many lower-paid workers at restaurants and bars returned to work last month, and their influx could have depressed overall pay.Still, the figure illustrates a chronic shortcoming of the economy: Even as the unemployment rate has reached a nearly a two-decade low, employers haven't yet been forced to offer significantly higher wages to attract or retain workers.The government also revised up its estimate of the job total for the previous two months.In August, employers added 208,000, up from 169,000.They added just 18,000 in September as thousands of businesses were forced to close.But that figure was revised higher from a previous estimate that showed a loss of 33,000.With September's jobs figure back in the positive column, the economy has now added jobs for 85 straight months, a record streak.The biggest swing in the past two months occurred among restaurants and bars, which shed 98,000 jobs in September.That reflected shutdowns in Texas and Florida after Hurricanes Harvey and Irma.Yet restaurants and bars regained 89,000 jobs last month.Manufacturers added 24,000 jobs.A category that includes mostly higher-paying professional jobs, such as accountants and engineers, added 50,000.Retailers shed 8,300.Even with the economy in its ninth year of recovery from the Great Recession, hiring remains solid and growth is healthy.For the first time since the downturn, the global economy is broadly improving, with all major advanced economies expanding at the same time.The value of the dollar has slid since earlier this year, a move that makes U.S. goods less expensive overseas.Those trends are lifting U.S. exports and boosting the profits of American multinational corporations.Americans are also sounding more optimistic about the economic outlook, which could prompt more people to open their wallets in the coming months.Consumer confidence reached its highest level in nearly 17 years in October, according to the Conference Board.Auto sales have also jumped since the hurricanes as people replace damaged and destroyed cars.Replacement auto sales helped lift overall consumer spending by the most in eight years in September.Still, that is likely to be a temporary economic boost.The economy expanded at a 3 percent annual rate in the July-September quarter, after a 3.1 percent gain in the second quarter.That was the best six-month showing in three years.AP Economics Writer Josh Boak contributed to this report.
GOP tax plan may offer little aid for many in middle class:::::House Republicans have stressed that the tax plan they unveiled Thursday is tailored to benefit America's middle class.Just how much it would remains uncertain based on the details that have been provided so far.What is clear is that many of the benefits for the middle class could dwindle over time, even while companies and wealthy individuals could enjoy lasting tax advantages.The plan promises tax savings next year of $1,182 for a typical household of four with gross income of $59,000, leaving their tax bill at $400."We are focused on increasing paychecks in a major way," said Rep. Kevin Brady, the Republican chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee.But the proposal's conflicting provisions and phase-outs of certain benefits suggest that taxes could rise for some middle class earners over time.And for many, the income gains being touted by President Donald Trump are unlikely to materialize.Some of these complications arise because under the budget instructions, the planned tax cuts can't increase the national debt by more than $1.5 trillion over the next decade.Anything above $1.5 trillion would force Republicans to amend their plan to generate more revenue a change that would likely prove difficult.Trump has frequently said that this would be the biggest tax cut in U.S. history.But outside analyses show that that's not the case.The tax plan's primary beneficiaries would be wealthier Americans, who would enjoy lower tax rates despite the elimination of some breaks, a repeal of the so-called alternative minimum tax and the termination of the estate tax."With the details they've presented to us so far, it looks like the tax cut benefits the wealthy and major corporations," said Martin Sullivan, chief economist at Tax Analysts and a former staff economist at the Treasury Department."In fact, if you have a large family, given the facts that we have now, that you would pay more in taxes."Here's why: A married couple making less than $90,000 would be taxed at a 12 percent rate, instead of the current 15 percent.The size of their standard deduction would nearly double to $24,000.But that same couple would lose personal exemptions deductions that largely benefit families with multiple children.The child tax credit would rise to $1,600 from $1,000 short of the $2,000 that Sullivan said would be needed to make many families whole.The tax plan would also repeal the deduction of substantial medical costs, including what families might spend on nursing home care.Nor could people with student loans deduct the interest paid on the debt anymore.And the plan would cap the deduction of state and local taxes.It also would use a less generous measure of inflation, so that more middle class taxpayers would creep into a higher bracket over several years.All told, nearly 70 percent of the tax cuts would go to businesses over 10 years, according to an analysis by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.The rest of the tax cuts appear to favor the wealthy.Gary Cohn, the president's top economic adviser, said Thursday at the Economic Club of Washington that the objective was to help the middle class.But he declined to say whether the wealthy would benefit."The hard part about taxes is everyone has got their own unique set of circumstances," Cohn said.The plan is already showing some splintering along ideological lines.The conservative Tax Foundation's analysis of how different families would fare under the plan suggested that the largest cuts as a percentage of taxes paid would go next year to sample couples earning between $48,000 and $85,000.Even a married couple with two children earning $165,000 would receive a reduction.But liberal groups stressed the analysis of nonpartisan groups that the benefits would flow largely flow to major companies and the top 1 percent of earners over time as tax breaks such as a new family credit would expire after five years."Tax cuts for the well-off are forever," said Gene Sperling, a former top economic aide in the Obama and Clinton presidencies."Tax cuts for the middle class are a small, a maybe and some-time thing that can be cut off in their plan."The overarching promise made to the middle class by Trump and congressional Republicans is that lower taxes would fuel faster economic growth, which, in turn, would cause incomes to rise.Kevin Hassett, chair of Trump's White House Council of Economic Advisers, estimates that lowering the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent would lead to an average income gain of $4,000 a year.But most mainstream economists have disputed that claim.Kent Smetters, faculty director of the Penn Wharton Budget Model, estimates that the income growth after a decade would range between $500 to $1,500.Some tax experts say the tax overhaul might also hurt those who aspire to be middle class.The bottom half of taxpayers now pay no net income tax, according to Treasury Department figures.Many receive refunds via the Earned Income Tax Credit.The plan unveiled Thursday would require eligible taxpayers to provide their Social Security Number to receive this benefit, thereby creating a possible delay in receiving a refund as the IRS enforces this provision.David Kamin, a former Obama White House official who now teaches law at New York University, said the plan seems to have "no significant help of any kind for about the bottom 35 percent of income earners."He added that the proposal could also "run up deficits significantly that would eventually have to be paid for and could threaten programs that do help low and middle income Americans whether that be health care coverage, Social Security, or investments like in infrastructure."
Stocks muddle along following US jobs report; bonds steady:::::Stocks held steady on Friday after a report showed that the U.S. job market strengthened last month, but not by quite as much as expected.While stock indexes flipped between small gains and losses, bond and commodity markets were also relatively quiet, with few big moves.KEEPING SCORE: The Standard & Poor's 500 index was close to flat at 2,580, as of 11:15 a.m. Eastern time.The Dow Jones industrial average was up 6 points, or less than 0.1 percent, to 23,522, and the Nasdaq composite rose nearly 17 points, or 0.3 percent, to 6,731.JOBS REPORT: Employers added 261,000 jobs last month, and the unemployment rate dipped to 4.1 percent, its lowest level in nearly 17 years.But job growth was weaker than economists forecast.So was growth in wages: Average hourly earnings were up 2.4 percent from a year earlier, a slowdown from September's growth, which was revised down to 2.8 percent.Workers are still waiting for the strengthening job market to lead to bigger paychecks.Economists said the last two months' jobs reports have been difficult to parse because of the damage that hurricanes did across broad swaths of the economy.The government initially said employers cut 33,000 jobs in September, but on Friday it said that employment actually grew by 18,000 during the month.FED EFFECT: Reports on the economy have been mostly encouraging recently, which has spurred expectations that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates at its next meeting in December.It would be the third increase this year.Economists said Friday's jobs report likely won't change that timetable.The Fed is slowly reining in the stimulus it provided the economy following the Great Recession.Besides gradually raising interest rates, it's also trimming its bond-investment portfolio.Economists expect the slow pace to continue, even as a new chairman arrives.President Donald Trump on Thursday nominated Jerome "Jay" Powell to succeed Janet Yellen, whose term expires in February.TECH RISES: Technology stocks were among the market's strongest, continuing a trend that has held for much of this year.Tech stocks in the S&P 500 have jumped 36 percent this year, more than double the 15 percent rise for the overall index.Apple rose $4.08, or 2.4 percent, to $172.19 after it reported stronger revenue and earnings for the latest quarter than analysts forecast.A new iPhone model is debuting Friday, and Apple said it expects the $1,000 phone to make this holiday season its best quarter ever.DISAPPOINTED: American International Group fell to one of the sharpest losses in the S&P 500 after it reported weaker results for the latest quarter than analysts expected.AIG shares dropped $2.95, or 4.5 percent, to $62.03.It's an outlier in what's been a mostly better-than-expected earnings season.The majority of companies have delivered higher profits than Wall Street had forecast, with growth particularly strong for the technology sector.YIELDS: Bond yields held relatively steady.The yield on the 10-year Treasury note was unchanged at 2.35 percent.The two-year yield rose to 1.62 percent from 1.61 percent late Thursday, and the 30-year yield was flat at 2.83 percent.COMMODITIES: Benchmark U.S. crude rose 10 cents to $54.64 per barrel.Brent crude, the international standard, rose 14 cents to $60.76 per barrel.Gold fell $10.80 to $1,2767.30 per ounce, silver fell 32 cents to $16.82 per ounce and copper dropped 3 cents to $3.11 per pound.OVERSEAS MARKETS: The French CAC 40 slipped 0.1 percent, Germany's DAX rose 0.2 percent and the FTSE 100 in London was virtually flat.South Korea's Kospi index rose 0.5 percent, and the Hang Seng in Hong Kong gained 0.3 percent.Japan's market was closed for a holiday.CURRENCIES: The dollar rose to 114.36 Japanese yen from 114.00 yen late Thursday.The euro dipped to $1.1611 from $1.1659, and the British pound rose to $1.3069 from $1.3060.
Countries in Manafort indictment known to laundering experts:::::The three countries named in the indictment of former Trump Campaign Chairman Paul Manafort span three separate continents but all have something in common: They're island nations with a legacy of relatively lax oversight of offshore entities and a known history of being a conduit for suspicious money.Special counsel Robert Mueller has accused Manafort and his business partner Rick Gates of using shell corporations located in the three countries Cyprus, the Seychelles, and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines as a way to hide assets and keep from paying taxes."They don't ask questions about what their banks know about their customers, which is a basic requirement to stop money laundering," said Ted Truman, a fellow at the Peterson Institution for International Economics and an expert on money laundering.The Mediterranean island country of Cyprus plays an outsized role in Manafort's indictment.The country is listed as the domicile for a dozen of Manafort's shell corporations and the alleged source of millions of dollars in wire transfers in and out of the country.Cyprus has been a focus for anti-money laundering officials going back to the 1990s, but is probably best known for its alleged ties to money flowing in and out of Russia.The country had been accused in the past of providing lax oversight to potential money laundering, as well as providing ways for Russian and Ukrainian officials to hide assets abroad."Russia has become the primary source for investors in Cyprus, usually through banks or companies set up as trusts.Most of the money that goes into Cyprus is then invested back in Russia," said James S. Henry, an economist and former journalist with the Tax Justice Network, which studies offshore tax havens.Cyprus and Russia have a favorable tax treaty, which has resulted in Cyprus having a cottage industry of bankers and lawyers on the island who primarily exist to set up shell corporations and trusts to help money move in and out of Russia, Henry and other experts said.Its role has drawn scrutiny from other members of the European Union as well, particularly after Cyprus joined the bloc in 2004.When Cyprus suffered its own financial crisis in 2012 and 2013 and requested a bailout, German intelligence reportedly estimated that Russians had roughly $26 billion in deposits in Cypriot banks.EU authorities, worried that any bailout package would ultimately be going to help out Russian multimillionaires, insisted Cyprus place even tough anti-money laundering laws and regulations as part of any rescue deal.Cyprus banking officials have in recent years started taking tought action and asking uncomfortable questions to suspicious clients, desperate to rebuild confidence in the banking system."."Since its entry into the European Union in 2004 and especially after the 2013 banking collapse, Cyprus has done much to clean up its act," said Sofronis Clerides, professor and chair of the economics department at the University of Cyprus."Unfortunately, it takes a long time for the stigma to wash off."Federal prosecutors became interested in Manafort's activities in Cyprus years ago as part of a broad investigation to recover stolen Ukrainian assets after the ouster of pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych there in early 2014.No U.S. criminal charges were filed in that case.It's worth noting that setting up foreign companies and bank accounts is not illegal, however using them to evade taxes or hide proceeds from ill-gotten gains is.Manafort and his business partner pleaded not guilty in district court Monday.The other two countries in the Manafort indictment play decidedly smaller roles in both Manafort's alleged operations and international money laundering overall.Located at least a thousand miles from any major continent in the middle of the Indian Ocean, the Seychelles is primarily used by French and African investors as a place to discreetly park money.The country was repeatedly named as a domicile for offshore tax havens in last year's Panama Papers investigation.While not historically an offshore tax haven like the Bahamas or the British Virgin Islands, the Caribbean island nation Saint Vincent and the Grenadines recently has been considered an at-risk place for money laundering.In the indictment, Manafort allegedly had at least two offshore corporations based in the Grenadines.The Financial Action Task Force, an international watchdog organization for money laundering, placed Saint Vincent and the Grenadines on its so-called "black list" back in 2000 for its lack of money laundering controls, but it was taken off that list a few years later.The Tax Justice League listed Saint Vincent as one of the more secretive places to park money.There's a fourth country worth noting that gets listed repeatedly in the Manafort indictment: the United States, particularly the State of Delaware.Investors and companies have long used Delaware as a place to set up shell corporations to take advantage of Delaware's loose corporate regulations.Manafort himself allegedly had at least nine corporate entities set up in Delaware.AP Reporter Melenaos Hadjicostis contributed to this report from Cyprus.
Retailers try to step up their game heading into holidays:::::Stores are trying to step up their game online and in person for the critical holiday season, from dangling more discounts to livening up their stores.And Amazon, which is expanding into more areas, has opened its online store of Black Friday discounts.Department store chain Kohl's is hoping to woo new customers by emphasizing the exact amount people can save by stacking coupons and other deals.It's also opening at 5 p.m. on Thanksgiving, an hour earlier than last year."Retail is changing.And there is market share to gain," said CEO-elect Michelle Gass.The chain, based in Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin, is also delivering more of its incentive Kohl's Cash than before.The app also features the option to scan ads, store Kohl's Cash offers and saving offers.Ailing Sears Holdings Corp., which has struggled to keep up with rivals, says its Sears and Kmart stores launched a "Holiday Blowout" promotion Wednesday that will last through Nov. 25.Sears is also bringing back its Wish Book, last issued in 2011, which features items like toys, games and tools.Online leader Amazon promised Wednesday that shoppers will find better deals than ever before on hot toys, electronics, home goods and other items as it announced the discounts.Starting Wednesday, Prime members, who pay $99 a year for free shipping, will also have access to Amazon Key.That's a service that will allow delivery people to leave packages in your home without you having to be there.Walmart, the nation's largest retailer, will have parties for customers at its stores for the first time, around the themes of toys, entertainment and curated gifts.It's increasing the number of product demonstrations and will expand the role of employees who last year helped find customers the shortest register lines.This year, they'll assist customers in the toys and electronics areas every weekend and be at the online orders pickup stations as Christmas approaches.The company, based in Bentonville, Arkansas, says it has tripled the number of products online from last year's holiday season and is offering more exclusive merchandise.Rival Target is also being more aggressive about pulling in shoppers.It now has dedicated staff in areas like clothing, beauty and consumer electronics to better service shoppers.And it will offer eight new store brands this holiday season.While retailers like Target and Best Buy are waiving their minimum for free shipping again, Walmart is sticking to its $35 threshold for free two-day free shipping on 2 million products.Kohl's is sticking with its $50 minimum threshold for free shipping.Its best customers who spend $600 a year can have items shipped for free during Kohl's credit events.Amazon's non-Prime members can choose from more than one hundred million items for free shipping provided they spend $25 or more.Many retailers, including Walmart and Target, haven't announced specific plans for the Black Friday weekend.Kohl's says it based its decision to open early on customer shopping patterns."We looked at what the competitive environment was," said Gass, "and we really wanted Kohl's to be the first stop."Follow Anne D'Innocenzio; http://twitter.comADInnocenzio

on.George, I'm never wearing a tie again.So like I'm the main guy.I'm in the middle.That's true.Dr. Denis Leary here with "Good morning America."I'm here to announce that George Stephanopoulos is running for president in 2020.And we're not going to use the last name, it's going to be George 2020 and I'm taking over his slot so we're announcing that today.So -- Big news story.He's going to run for president and I'll be a "Good morning America" regular.How is that?Dr. Dennis leer which without a tie, thank you.I am a doctor.All rit.I'm ray celebrity -- are you a celebrity doctor, a fake doctor, celebrity -- I think I am.Really?I hate that.It's true.They give it to anybody, right?So I got one from my ALMA mater and Emerson college and I did well there and graduated with a degree in acting and writing then when I got famous they gave me a celebrity doctor at and it is real.You get it framed and everything, right?So -- Actually wear a white coat here.You're really taking it quite seriously.I take it seriously.I called a good friend, Michael J.Fox, Mike fox who's like -- yeah So I was so puffed up.At first I called my mom.She's like oh, my god.My son is finally going to be a doctor.My Irish immigrant mom.Big move and Mike, I said you're not going to believe this.I'm going to be a doctor.He said, welcome to the club.I go, what do you mean.Mike didn't even finish high school, okay.He was on "Family ties" when he was like 16.He said, I have eight doctorates because they just hand them out to famous people.Great.We'll get you another one.Now I'm upset.Spreeing of handing things out, no, but I'm going to give you a fruitcake.What do you think about that?I'll tell you what I think -- don't applaud.Please.This is -- I just want to say something about fruitcake.I'm Irish.I had aunts that used to make these things and I play hockey.They last longer than hockey.These are not food.You can throw this at somebody in an argument and hurt them, okay.This is the most thoughtless gift you could give to a person.This is like walking outside and going, hey, a rock, let me give it to robin.Merry Christmas.That was -- you just proved the point, fruitcakes are known as the most thoughtless gift.Horrible and have you ever tasted one.No, I have not.Just once.I have not.They're horrible.No, no.The reason I'm talking about this, target is actually trying to combat people receiving gifts they don't like and saying a feature called gift now, sends an e-mail to your recipient.They can either accept the gift you've chosen for them whether it be a fruitcake or choose an entirely different gift.What do you think about that?Before they ship it you can say, no, thanks, I don't want to fruitcake I'll take socks.I think it's brilliant.I'm tired of my kid, adult, 27 and 25.I know it's a cliche when they say what do you want.I say, this rancwrench.Then they buy me sog I don't want and don't get the socks or wrench.So now you can change it.I do like it.I think it's good.Is it already up and running for the holidays?But Dr. Denis Leary, this is his new book out right now and, you know what, we have been -- Can we say the title.You can say it.We can't say all of it.So I'll say it.So you won't get in trouble.Look, we blocked it out, the last word.It's called "Why we don't suck."Hang on and how all of us need to stop being such partisan little -- rhymes with stitches.What are you doing here?I can see it's on the book.Are you blurring it out.Blurring it out right there.You did start with a warning.I start the book with a warning.Listen, here's how I wrote the book because I -- I voted for Hillary Clinton but I didn't want to, okay.I thought she was a terrible candidate.They don't know what to clap for.[ Laughter That's like, Donald Trump, I didn't vote for Donald Trump obviously.I knew Donald Trump.He did a cameo on an ABC sitcom I did years ago called "The job."He also did a tinge on "The apprentice" for my foundation.He was a nice guy.He was generous.He was on time.He knew his lines when he had them memorized but he was a different color.He was white.He was actually -- he made me look like I was a dark skinned person.He was so white so it was a different guy.But he -- whatever you want to say about trump, he has changed the game.So after the election I did -- I do this concert every year for the cancer foundation at T.D.Garden.This year it's November 18th.Yeah.So four days after the election, I did a concert and what I basically did was go up and stage and vent against Hillary and against trump and the audience was explosive so people -- I could tell they had -- half voted for Hillary and half voted for trump so to me I thought I got to write ray book about it because it got more and more divisive and nothing is getting done.So in trump's world which he's changed the game, celebrities can now become president so I think we have to look at it that's why I said George 2020.Weed to to stop -- yeah, let's change the process.I want to have -- talk about so you think you can dance or "Dancing with the stars" we should have a reality show to elect the next president.Someone said we already did that.Right.I mean, because the debates suck.We don't learn anything at the debates so I say you have a 13-week reality show called "President idol" as Howard Stern was calling it or I call it "America's got leaders."Four celebrity judge answer have all these people that want to run for 1 week, give them tanks, make them dance, sing, whatever you want to do and on November 2nd or 7th we vote by phone.That's it.No electric tort college.That's it.The winner is the winner.I mean I think that's the future, you know.Something to think about.It's so scary.Nick lachey would be a great presidential candidate on that show.I'm telling you.Justin Timberlake could be president.I think we need a woman.I want Oprah.Yay.There we go.I want Oprah.There you go.Because --S if.Oprah would be so great because you know every three weeks she'd give us free stuff.You know what I mean.That wouldn't suck.That would be great.That would be awesome.So anyway the book is about -- it starts with the election and just want to remind I'm out to make people laugh their asses off but I want to talk about racism.All the stuff that was so divisive that's still happening, racism and sexism and all that stuff and make people laugh about how twisted we have been in the last couple of years.And that we don't suck.And we don't suck?That is nice and remind ourselves how great of a country we are and like my democratic friends have lost their sense of humor.My Republican friends have lost their sense of humor and nothing is getting done.Look at the carvilles.No, no, no.You don't want me to be president.I'd be impeached within four months.All I would do can just a free beer for everybody.No fruitcake.No fruitcake.No fruitcake.But you can doesn't "Why we don't suck," it's out today.Out today.Are we done?This transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.

BMW issues recalls for fire risk, recommends parking outside:::::BMW is recalling more than 1 million cars and SUVs in two U.S. recalls due to the risk of fires under the hood, and it's recommending that they be parked outdoors until repairs are made.A spokesman for the German automaker says the risk of fire is very low in both cases, but the vehicles should say outside "in an abundance of caution."In both recalls, repairs are expected to start on Dec. 18.The largest of the recalls covers over 740,000 328i, 328xi, 328i xDrive, 525i, 525xi, 528i, 528xi, 530i, 530xi, X3 3.0si, X3 xDrive30i, X5 xDrive30i, Z4 3.0i, Z4 3.0si and Z4 sDrive30i vehicles from 2007-2011.Also included is the 2008-2011 128i.All have 6-Cylinder engines.Documents posted Friday by the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration show that a heater for the positive crankcase ventilation valve can overheat and cause the valve to melt, increasing the risk of a fire even when the vehicle is not in use.No injuries have been reported.Dealers will replace the heater.The heater is designed to prevent the valve from freezing in cold temperatures, BMW spokesman Hector Arellano-Belloc said.But irregularities in manufacturing can cause corrosion can lead to overheating.The other recall covers nearly 673,000 cars including the 323i, 325i, 325xi, 328i, 328xi, 330i, 330xi, 335i, 335xi and M3 from the 2006-2011 model years.Also covered are the 2007-2011 328i xDrive, 335i xDrive and 335is, and the 2009-2011 335d.Wiring for the heating and air conditioning system can overheat and cause connectors to melt, also increasing the fire risk, even when vehicles are unattended.Four drivers reported injuries.BMW says a wiring connection can corrode and in rare cases cause fires.Dealers will replace the wiring and connectors.The recalls total about 1.4 million vehicles, but some are included in both, BMW said.
Equifax calls executive stock sales days after breach legal:::::Equifax, the credit report company hacked over the summer exposing the personal information of 145 million Americans, said a special committee has determined that none of the four executives who sold shares at the time did anything wrong.The high-level executives sold shares worth a combined $1.8 million in the days immediately after the company discovered the breach.When Equifax went public with the breach in early September, company shares cratered, erasing about $2.35 billion of its market value.The company revealed that an ongoing cyberattack lasted from mid-May to July.Equifax Inc. said it detected the hack on July 29.On Aug. 1 and Aug. 2, Equifax Chief Financial Officer John Gamble and three other executives sold a combined $1.8 million in stock.The company said Friday that a special committee comprised of independent directors, and advised by an independent counsel, found that none of the executives had knowledge of the breach when their trades were made.The committee's review included dozens of interviews and the scouring of more than 55,000 documents including emails, text messages, phone logs and other records.The report Friday is unlikely to relieve pressure on the beleaguered company, which badly bungled the response to the hack.Investigators will want to know how a breach of this size and scope could have occurred, without the knowledge of some of the company's highest executives.Faith in the leadership and the security of private information eroded in the weeks after the attack.Anxious consumers experienced jammed phone lines and clueless company representatives.An Equifax website set up to help people determine their exposure was described as sketchy by security experts.The site provided inconsistent and unhelpful information to many.The company blamed the problems of an online customer help page on a vendor's software code after it appeared that it had been hacked as well.High-level executives, including CEO Richard Smith, have already stepped down.The internal report did not appear to ease the apprehension of those who hold company stock.Shares were essentially flat on Friday.That's because it is the Securities and Exchange Commission, the federal agency that enforces securities laws, which will have the final say.SEC Chairman Jay Clayton has refused to comment when asked by lawmakers if executives at Equifax engaged in insider trading when they sold their shares.He has not confirmed or denied that the SEC is investigating.Smith, the former Equifax CEO, appeared before Congress to answer questions from lawmakers, but they were far from satisfied with the answers they received.The Atlanta company is under multiple state and federal investigations and has been sued by numerous customers in litigation likely to evolve into class-action lawsuits.What makes the data breach so dangerous is the information that Equifax holds.Social security numbers, identification, addresses and personal information held by Equifax and the two other, major credit agencies is used to determine a person's creditworthiness.
Interest rate rise: Why hasn't my savings rate gone up yet?:::::Image copyright PA When the Bank of England announced the first increase in interest rates for a decade, savers across the country could be forgiven for giving a little cheer.They've endured years of pathetic rates with returns on most accounts not even beating inflation.Yet any small pang of joy experienced will have been extinguished as there hasn't been a widespread increase in savings rates.What's going on?Are banks and building societies ripping us all off?The simple answer is no, at least not because they haven't immediately passed on Thursday's 0.25% interest rate rise.Pass it on!Mark Carney, the Bank of England governor, said he expected all providers to increase returns for savers."Banks did pass on the cuts to their depositors, and we expect competition to push it in the other direction," he said.And the fact is they will - in their own good time.It's a certainty that all the major savings institutions will improve the interest rates they pay on deposit accounts by the beginning of December.They just don't react to a Bank of England base rate change immediately anymore.Severed link "The link between the bank base rate and savings has been severed for years, most recently thanks to government lending initiatives, which has meant banks don't need savers' cash to fund their mortgage books as they used to," explains Rachell Springall of Moneyfacts.In short, the savings rates they offer are driven by competitive pressures rather than tied to the Bank of England rate.That means you're far more likely to get a decent return from a smaller institution which is keen to build up its business.And those banks and building societies that have announced plans to increase savings rates from December are simply doing "a PR exercise", according to Andrew Hagger of Moneycomms."Other banks and building societies, perhaps with a larger and more diverse range of savings products, will take a more considered view and will need internal approval before making an announcement," he says.But whether they announce quickly to get a PR advantage, or wait a week or so to take a considered view, savers won't be affected as rate changes normally take a month or so to take affect.In any event, rather than being concerned about such a minimal increase savers would do better to actually check what rate they're being paid.They're likely to be in for a shock.The average easy access account rate has fallen from 0.45% in December 2016 to just 0.37% today, according to Savings Champion."With savings rates with the High Street providers paying as little as 0.01%, it's time for savers to vote with their feet and earn as much interest as they can elsewhere," says Anna Bowes of Savings Champion.
US jobs growth in October falls short of forecasts:::::Image copyright Getty Images US employers added 261,000 jobs in October, a solid gain that nevertheless fell short of expectations.Analysts had expected a sharp increase in hiring, after hurricanes Irma and Harvey depressed payroll growth in September.Wage growth was also slower than expected, while the number of people out of the labour force rose.That helped drive the US jobless rate down to 4.1% in October, the lowest rate since 2000.The US Department of Labor said employment in the food and drink industries had "increased sharply" and had mostly offset a decline in those areas in September when hurricanes devastated areas of Florida and Texas.Job numbers for September were revised up to a gain of 18,000 after initial estimates suggested that employment fell by 33,000.JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade, said that "there was a lot to like" in the report, pointing to an increase in jobs in industries such as manufacturing and professional and business services.But economists were cautious, saying it is hard to tease out the effects of hurricane-related activity.'Where is the wage growth?'The US economy has expanded steadily in recent months, with GDP growing an estimated 3% in the most recent quarter.At the same time, job growth has slowly decelerated, with the hurricanes sharpening the effect.Economists said the earlier pace of hiring would be hard to sustain as the supply of people looking for jobs shrank.But they have been puzzled that wage growth is not stronger, as employers pay more to recruit staff."Again it's a case of strong jobs growth but where is the wage growth?"said Neil Wilson, senior market analysts at ETX Capital.The Labor Department said average hourly earnings for private sector employees were $26.53, nearly unchanged over the month.Earnings were up 2.4% year-on-year.Economist Jared Bernstein, former adviser to vice president Joe Biden, said the figures are a sign there is room for unemployment to fall farther.Others said the large hurricane-related swing in food and hospitality jobs - typically lower paid fields - might be affecting the numbers."Let's come back next month and see how wages might have evened out after the hurricane impacts," Mr Kinahan wrote.Although October's figures fell short of forecasts, Mr Wilson and others said the report does not alter expectations that the US Federal Reserve will raise interest rates in December.But he added: "Of concern for the Fed is that wage growth has stalled and this raises doubts about the pace of inflation growth....Without wages going up the Fed is going to struggle to achieve its inflation target."
iPhone X: Why did people queue up overnight?:::::Image caption Brady Daniels queued up from 06:00 in London for the iPhone X The new 999 iPhone X has hit shelves in more than 50 countries - but what drove fans to line up in the middle of the night for it?The queue was already 100-strong when Nick Davies arrived at Apple's flagship UK store at 02:30.It wasn't the painfully early start or the night-time cold that people minded.It was the lack of portaloos."Everyone is desperately looking for a toilet at 4 or 5 o'clock," he says.There were queues outside Apple stores the world over in the early hours of Friday for the launch of the tenth anniversary iPhone.Apple is predicting that big demand for its most expensive phone to date will help revenue hit a new record high.If it is a big hit, the US tech firm could even become a trillion dollar company, according to some analysts.Image caption Nick Davies was frustrated he couldn't get the version of the iPhone X with more memory There is always fanfare for a new Apple phone - but Brady Daniels, who joined the queue at 06:00 in London, says the "hype is high" for this one.It's largely because of the edge-to-edge screen - with no "home" button - and the Face ID, which unlocks the phone with a selfie, he says."People have been pretty excited.Now people are getting cold and a little grouchy because the line is moving slower than expected, but people are pretty happy," he says.The phones were available to order in the UK from 27 October - but plenty missed out, and so queued up on Friday to be among the first to get their hands on one.Image copyright EPA Image caption The iPhone X is Apple's most expensive phone to date The queue for the Regent Street store in London was still stretched round the corner and down the road just after 10:00 when the shop opened.But not everyone was happy with the launch.The problem, for Nick at least, was that the store quickly ran out of the version of the phone with more memory - the iPhone X 256GB."It's difficult because you're loyal to the brand but the launches are pretty bad."This is their loyal customer base.It's just nice if Apple would show a little bit of loyalty to them," he says.Image caption This is the first iPhone that Aiden, Jason and Aaron (left to right) have queued up for Others came up with intrepid, time-saving ways of getting the phone.Aaron paid someone 30 a hour to queue from 06:00.He then arrived and took over the place in the queue at a more leisurely 09:30."I've always been a little bit of an Apple geek," Aaron says.He failed to reserve one, but rather than wait for a month he thought he'd try to get it from the shop.Apple chief executive Tim Cook is predicting the iPhone X will help the company record its "biggest quarter ever" in the three months to the end of the year.His guidance - and strong sales of other products - led Daniel Ives, an analyst at GBH Insights, to say "a trillion-dollar market cap may now be in Cook's sights".There won't be many in the iPhone X queues who would disagree with that.
UK firms pull multi-billion pound stock market floats:::::Image copyright Arqiva Arqiva, the UK's largest owner of TV transmitters and food producer Bakkavor have pulled their stock market listings because of market uncertainty.Arqiva has postponed a stock market flotation that would have valued the group at 6bn.Bakkavor, which supplies food to M&S and Waitrose, has scrapped its plan that potentially valued it at 1bn.Both firms announced their listing plans last month, but cited market volatility for their change of heart.In October, a number of European companies floated but saw their shares perform weakly in the following days.French fashion group SMCP shares have barely risen above their initial stock market flotation price of 21 (19; $24) each.Austrian bank Bawag listed at 48 a share and is now trading at 45.76 while Spanish housebuilder Aedas Homes floated at 31.65 and its shares are now worth 31.00.Arqiva, which is owned by the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and Australian bank Macquarie, may proceed with a float next year if market conditions improve.Its clients include the BBC, ITV and international broadcasters and its masts cover about 98% of the UK.Image copyright Bakkavor However, Bakkavor, the UK's largest supplier of hummus, said it will no longer proceed with its plans for an initial public offering (IPO).It said: "Whilst the company received sufficient institutional demand to cover the offering, the board has taken the decision that proceeding with the transaction would not be in the best interests of the company, or its shareholders, given the current volatility in the IPO market."'Keeping their powder dry' Neil Glover, business development director for the UK and Ireland at EY, said that recently there has been a "real lack of traditional IPOs" which he described as companies with household or more easily recognisable names.He said: "We believe in 2018, there will be a minor build-up of IPOs in the second and third quarter," adding that "some investors are keeping their powder dry" until then.Mr Glover also said that that companies are eager to announce their flotations before 2019: "Everyone is a bit paranoid about Brexit and they want to move before it takes place."Bakkavor, which operates across the UK, China and the US and employs around 18,500 people, was founded in 1986 by Icelandic brothers Lydur and Agust Gudmundsson.Mr Gudmundsson is the chief executive of the group which in 2016 reported a 3.6% rise in group sales to 1.7bn.Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (ebitda) increased by 12.3% to 145.6m.
New orders boost growth in the UK services sector:::::Image copyright Getty Images Activity in the UK's dominant services sector grew at the fastest rate for six months in October, helped by stronger order books and "resilient" demand.The Markit/CIPS purchasing managers' index (PMI) for services rose to 55.6, up from 53.6 in September, well above the 50 threshold that indicates growth.The services sector, which accounts for most of the UK economy, saw new orders rise at the fastest pace since May.However, new employment was muted due to uncertainty over longer-term demand.The better than expected reading for services follows a strong October for manufacturing as well as a return to growth for the construction industry last month.Ruth Gregory, UK economist at Capital Economics, said the data suggests that quarterly GDP growth is running at about 0.5%, above the 0.4% recorded in the third quarter.The pound edged up on the dollar and euro to $1.30620 and 1.12140 respectively.Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey, said: "The latest PMI surveys bring mixed news on the economy."He said: "While an upturn in business activity growth adds some justification to the Bank of England's decision to hike interest rates for the first time in a decade, a deeper dive into the numbers highlights the fragility of the economy and points to downside risks for the outlook."
Donald Trump nominates Jerome Powell as Fed chair:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Jerome Powell had been widely tipped as the top choice President Donald Trump has named Jerome Powell as his pick to lead the Federal Reserve.Mr Powell, a Republican and multi-millionaire, currently serves as a member of the bank's board, to which he was appointed in 2012.He had been widely tipped as the top choice for more than a week.Analysts regard him as a status quo candidate, likely to continue the Fed's current policies of gradually raising interest rates.Jerome Powell: Who is Trump's Fed chair nominee?President Trump said Mr Powell, known as Jay, commanded the respect of both parties and urged swift Senate confirmation."I am confident that Jay has the wisdom and leadership to guide our economy through any challenges," he said during the announcement in Washington.President Trump interviewed five candidates for the role, including current chair Janet Yellen, whose term finishes in February.Despite a tradition of reappointing Fed chairs, President Trump has said he wanted to make his own "mark".Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Jerome Powell was appointed to the Federal Reserve board in 2012 On Thursday, President Trump thanked Ms Yellen for her stewardship of the bank, calling her a "wonderful woman who has done a terrific job".Mr Powell, who has an estimated income of between $20m and $55m (15m-41m), is a lawyer by training and a former partner in the Carlyle Group, one of the world's biggest investment companies.He was appointed to the Federal Reserve board in 2012 and has voted with the majority on issues such as interest rates.In brief remarks on Thursday, Mr Powell said the economy has made progress since the financial crisis and pledged to make decisions "with objectivity, based on the best available evidence"."Thank you again for this extraordinary opportunity to serve the American people," he said.Reaction to the pick The pick was no surprise on Wall Street and stock market reaction was muted.Goldman Sachs chief executive Lloyd Blankfein praised the selection in an interview on Bloomberg TV."His background is a terrific background - again a lot of government service, service in the Fed, service in the private sector," Blankfein said.John Silvia, chief economist for Wells Fargo, said the selection of Mr Powell was a bit of a "surprise", given the president's campaign criticism of the Fed's recent policies.But it also reflected economic and political realities."It's an easy transition, both in terms of doing the policy but also in terms of getting approval in hearings in front of Congress," Mr Silvia said."Most people in the financial markets would feel a comfortable relationship with Governor Powell."Representative Jeb Hensarling, a Republican from Texas, has pressed for increased congressional oversight of the Fed, as well as looser industry regulations.In a statement, he said he had urged President Trump to pick a more hard-line candidate, but issued his congratulations.He said: "If confirmed, it is my hope that [Mr Powell] will break from the past and lead the Federal Reserve to adopt a more transparent and more predictable monetary policy strategy and rationalise a regulatory agenda that has seen big banks become even bigger while community banks have become fewer."Analysis by Michelle Fleury, New York business correspondent Jay Powell is seen as the "status quo" candidate.When it comes to monetary policy, he doesn't appear to have deviated from the path set by the current Fed Chair Janet Yellen to raise rates at a slow and steady pace.And the appeal of his appointment is easy to understand.After all, what's not to like about full employment and low inflation if you are a central banker or indeed the President.That means more people with jobs and more money in their pockets.The question is how will he respond when unexpected events unfold?And let's face it, nasty surprises have a habit of creeping up.History teaches us that the next crisis will be different from past financial crises.In such an instance, will being the continuity candidate be a hindrance or a help?Hopefully the latter given the importance of the role to the global economy.
Old scams, new tricks as fraudsters adapt:::::Image caption Fraudsters are using junk mail in new and more sophisticated ways The organisation at the frontline of UK consumer protection says it is seeing a pattern of "old scams, new tricks".National Trading Standards (NTS) said that while online crime was a growing problem, time-honoured fraud methods would not disappear any time soon.It said many people were still hounded by cold callers, scam mail and doorstep criminals.Criminals were also using smart TVs and voice-activated home devices to steal data, its Consumer Harm Report warned.'Challenging times' NTS, which was set up by the government in 2012, said 2016-17 had been a record-breaking year, with 104 criminal convictions.However, it said criminals were using new tactics to avoid detection, such as mail arriving via third-party countries and the use of blank envelopes, so that people had to open them to find out what they contained.In its annual report, it listed the potential emerging threats to consumers over the coming year, including: Continued manipulation of online ticket retail sites by scammers and organised criminals The growth of social media as a selling platform, putting consumers at risk of intellectual property crime and product safety issues The risk posed by connected devices such as smart TVs and home assistants, which may leave consumers open to data theft Increasing sophistication of doorstep criminals who use websites, social media and fake reviews and are increasingly part of larger organised crime groups."An evolving criminal landscape does not mean the more traditional scams will disappear," it said."Instead, National Trading Standards is seeing a trend of criminals diversifying and adapting their current schemes, evidenced in mass marketing mail scams."Additionally, more scams are originating abroad, with criminals concealing the payments they're receiving from their victims through payment processing companies," it said.But it said its actions had prevented nearly 127m in losses to consumers and businesses during the year.Lord Toby Harris, who chairs the NTS, said: "Our teams are operating in an ever-evolving criminal environment.Consumer protection bodies are facing changing and challenging times."He also praised the efforts of the public, who were "pivotal" in reporting crimes and supporting the NTS's work."So together, we continue to work to disrupt, investigate, prosecute and keep people safe."

Apple shares hit record as iPhone X launches:::::Image copyright Getty Images Apple shares have risen to a record high as the tech giant's iPhone X hit shelves around the world.The launch coincided with strong results for Apple, with sales increasing by 12% to $52.6bn (40bn) for the three months to September.The tenth anniversary iPhone, which retails for 999, is Apple's most expensive handset yet.Analysts said Apple was now closer to becoming the first trillion dollar company, as shares rose 2%.The California-based firm, which also sells computers, iPads and makes revenue from apps, is now valued at nearly $900bn (690bn).With iPhone 8 and X handsets now on sale, Mr Cook predicted Apple's "biggest quarter ever" in the three months to the end of the year.Shoppers queued up at Apple stores in dozens of countries, as the high-end iPhone X launched on Friday.The iPhone X abandons the signature "home" button and can be unlocked with face-scanning technology, among other new features."A trillion-dollar market cap may now be in Cook's sights in light of these results and guidance around iPhone X," said Daniel Ives, an analyst at GBH Insights.Image copyright AFP Image caption Apple fans queued up overnight to buy the new iPhone X on Friday Mr Cook said the company was "firing on all cylinders", thanks to a sales rebound in China, record purchases through the App Store and robust demand for its latest iPhone models.It sold more than 46.6 million phones in the July to September period, up 3% year-on-year.That produced $28.8bn, or more than half of its revenue.Other products, including the Mac, iPad and Apple Watch, also did well, growing in the double digits.The firm got another boost from its services division, which includes the App store, Apple Pay and its music subscriptions service.That unit made $8.5bn in the quarter, up 34% year-on-year, thanks in part to a one-time adjustment.Though its costs increased, Apple said profits were $10.7bn in the quarter, increasing 18%.Augmented reality future?Apple said it expects to make between $84bn and $87bn in revenue in the upcoming quarter - a record for the company.Mr Cook said the iPhone X positioned Apple ahead of the curve when it comes to new augmented reality or AR technologies.He said the technologies were poised to "change everything".For example, he said, shoppers will be able to see how furniture looks in their living rooms before making a purchase."I view AR as profound, not today... but what it will be, what it can be," he said."I think it's profound and I think Apple is in a really unique position to lead in this area."
Pound boosted by services data:::::Image copyright Getty Images The pound continued to strengthen on Friday, boosted by higher-than-expected services data.The UK services sector, which accounts for most of the UK economy, grew by its fastest rate in six months in October.Sterling rose against the dollar and euro, adding 0.3% to $1.30950 and 0.4% to 1.12410 respectively, partially reversing Thursday's sharp falls.In contrast, the benchmark FTSE 100 share was flat by midday at 7,556.14, with shares hit by the pound's rise.The index often falls when sterling rises, as the stronger currency decreases the value of companies' overseas earnings when they are brought back to the UK and converted into pounds.The pound had fallen to a near five-month low against the dollar on Thursday following the Bank of England's first interest rate hike in ten years.The Bank of England had reiterated that it would take a "very gradual" approach to raising interest rates further.'One-and-done' "A lot of speculation has been put to bed by the tone of the BoE yesterday."The signals that we got was that it's probably a 'one-and-done'," said Jane Foley, senior currency strategist at Rabobank.The top winner on the FTSE 100 was private healthcare provider NMC Health.Its shares rose almost 4% following an upgrade from Deutsche Bank.Airline shares were some of the biggest fallers with EasyJet losing 2% and British Airways owner International Consolidated Airlines Group dropping 1.3%.The falls follow a 9% drop in Air France-KLM shares, which analysts linked to the airline's unclear guidance on costs next year.
Tesco fraud trial hears of boss's shock over misstated profits:::::Image copyright Julia Quenzler Image caption Former Tesco executives Carl Rogberg (left), Christopher Bush (centre) and John Scouler (right), are on trial at Southwark Crown Court Tesco's chief executive has told a court of his "surprise and shock" on learning the company's profits had been misstated by 246m.David Lewis was told about the issue just weeks after he took up the post in September 2014.Mr Lewis has been giving evidence at the trial into alleged fraud at the supermarket giant.Former Tesco executives Carl Rogberg, Christopher Bush and John Scouler are on trial.All deny the charges.They are accused of fraud by abuse of position and false accounting between February and September 2014.Mr Lewis told jurors at Southwark Crown Court that he took up his post at the beginning of September 2014.He said he had had numerous meetings with Bush and one with Scouler, but he was not told of the accounting issue until 19 September.He recalled he was called into a meeting with Adrian Morris, Tesco's chief counsel, at about lunchtime that day, and presented with a paper detailing the problem.Asked for his reaction to this, he told the court: "One of surprise and one of shock, really."I think the thing that was unique to this paper was the indication that the numbers that had been declared had a potential misstatement within them."What was new was the proposition here that 246m of income had been included in the first half of the year that on that basis of this paper was deemed to be questionable."'Intensive' investigation Mr Lewis said: "I had never experienced anything like this before, but it was quite clear that having read the paper, and the manner in which it was served, I felt that it had to be taken very seriously."He said he called Tesco's chairman, Sir Richard Broadbent, and told him what the document said, and that a team of internal and external auditors was assembled to work through the weekend.Mr Lewis went on to explain the company had spent a great deal of time between Tesco's public announcement on 22 September stating profits had been overestimated, and when the company was due to issue its interim results on 23 October.He said: "It was a very intensive amount of investigation of these numbers.It required a huge amount of review of paperwork, documentation between pretty much all of the suppliers to Tesco and the different categories in order to validate the number."So that was quite an extensive exercise."At an earlier hearing, the court heard that two members of its finance department resigned in 2014 over concerns they may be compromising their professional integrity.The two were unhappy about what they were being asked to do by bosses.Carl Rogberg, 50, Chris Bush, 51, and John Scouler, 49, are alleged to have failed to correct inaccurately recorded income figures.The company's former UK finance head, UK managing director and UK food commercial boss deny charges of fraud by abuse of position and false accounting.The court has heard the three men were accused of "cooking the books" by bringing forward income not yet earned to artificially inflate its figures.Problems with Tesco's accounts came to light in a regulatory announcement in September 2014, when Tesco shocked the market in admitting it had overstated profits forecast by about 250m.The trial continues.
HSBC 'ignored money laundering warning' in South Africa scandal:::::Image copyright Getty Images HSBC should be investigated for "possible criminal complicity" in connection with corruption allegations in South Africa, a UK peer has said.Lord Peter Hain told Parliament he had asked the Treasury to refer an unnamed UK bank for investigation into possible involvement in money laundering.In the letter, seen by the BBC, he named HSBC and said it ignored a warning about large transfers of cash.He cited evidence of transactions out of South Africa involving HSBC.The controversy relates to the close relationship between the wealthy Gupta family and South African President Jacob Zuma.The Guptas are alleged to have bought influence in government in order to loot state enterprises.Mr Zuma and the Guptas strongly deny wrongdoing and say they are victims of a "politically motivated witch-hunt".Lord Hain, a leading anti-apartheid campaigner who grew up in South Africa, has previously called for UK authorities to examine the role of British banks in the scandal.Regulators are looking into HSBC and Standard Chartered's roles in South Africa following a separate letter from Lord Hain in September.When asked about the issue earlier this week, HSBC's chief executive, Stuart Gulliver, said the bank was co-operating with the government.Mr Gulliver said: "On the inquiries as a result of Lord Hain's letter to the chancellor, obviously we are responding to those inquiries that have come in from the [Financial Conduct Authority] and also from South African authorities, and there is nothing more I can really add at this point in time."An HSBC spokesperson declined to comment further.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Lord Hain is a former Labour cabinet minister and an anti-Apartheid campaigner Lord Hain told the House of Lords on Wednesday that the latest evidence he had sent to the Treasury showed the illegal transfer of funds from South Africa made by the Guptas.He said illicit transactions were "flagged internally in the bank concerned as suspicious, but I'm reliably informed they were told by the UK headquarters to ignore it"."Can the chancellor please ensure that such evident money laundering and illegality is not tolerated and that the bank is investigated for a possible criminal complicity over this matter?"he said.In September, Lord Hain requested that the Financial Conduct Authority, the Serious Fraud Office and the National Crime Agency look into whether British banks facilitated alleged money-laundering by the Gupta family.At the time, he told the House of Lords that the banks may "inadvertently have been conduits" for up to 400m of illicit funds.Standard Chartered said following Lord Hain's initial call: "We are not able to comment on the details of client transactions, but can confirm that following an internal investigation accounts were closed by us in 2014."
Republican tax plan to target mortgage deduction:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Trump displays the proposed new 'postcard' tax form Republicans have unveiled details of a sweeping tax plan, aimed at slashing rates for businesses and lowering inheritance taxes.The proposal would lower the corporate tax rate from 35% to 20%, while retaining the top individual rate for the wealthiest at 39.5%.It eliminates a popular mortgage interest deduction for new home loans of $500,000 (380,000) or more.Delivering on the plan is a priority for Republicans and the president.Republicans said the bill, which is estimated to cost about $1.51tn over a decade, is transformational.They say it will make US companies more competitive and simplify the tax-filing process for the average American family."This is our chance to make sure that generations to come don't just get by, they get ahead in this country," House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan said.The most costly part of the plan is the reduction of the corporate rate.Republicans said the bill also provides "relief" for ordinary Americans.They said the changes will save the average family of four about $1,182 on their tax bill.President Donald Trump and other Republican party leaders are hoping to win approval of the bill by the end of the year.Mr Trump called it a "big, beautiful Christmas present" for families.But Democrats say the plan favours corporations and the wealthy.Representative Nancy Pelosi, who leads Democrats in the House, slammed the bill as "half-baked" and said it would raise taxes on the middle class.Key elements The standard tax deduction increases from $6,350 to $12,000 for individuals, and from $12,700 to $24,000 for married couples Estate tax exemption nearly doubles to $11.2m, up from $5.49m, and will be eliminated by 2024 Alternative Minimum Tax - which ensures the wealthy cannot entirely avoid taxes by taking advantage of deductions - will be repealed Corporate profits from overseas will no longer be taxed, but a minimum 10% tax will be placed on US foreign subsidiaries Child tax credit expands from $1,000 to $1,600 per child Despite speculation, there is no change to a limit on pre-tax contributions to 401(k) retirement funds Federal deductions for state and local income and sales taxes will be eliminated Local property taxes can be deducted from federal income, but are capped at $10,000 Murky details By Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington The Republican party's outline of its new tax plan lists almost as many items that are going to stay the same as are being changed.That's the nature of tax reform - every deduction and loophole has a group that will fight to preserve it.Republicans will boast that tax-deferred retirement plans, the credit for low-income workers and the charitable donations deduction are untouched.They're playing a dangerous game, however, by targeting one cherished middle-class deduction - for interest on home mortgages.The powerful homebuilding lobby will wage a pitched effort to squash Republican hopes.The tax proposal is framed as geared toward the working and middle classes - and there is some help there - but its central focus is a corporate tax reduction that, while popular among the party's corporate base, doesn't excite the general public.Republicans will try to push the legislation through much the way they did healthcare reform - by keeping details murky and scheduling quick votes.Forces are already aligning against it, however, and Democrats are ready to paint the plan as a sop to the rich.Donald Trump and congressional Republicans have a lot riding on a successful effort, but the road ahead is far from easy.Who are the winners and losers?Winners: Corporations and businesses The bill slashes the corporate tax rate from 35% to 20%.That's expected to reduce revenue by almost $1.5tn from 2018-2027.The bill also sets a 25% top tax rate for income from certain businesses that is taxed at the personal rate - a further $500bn reduction in revenue.Winners: Wealthy heirs Under current law, inheritances over $5.49m face a 40% tax rate.The Republican proposal would immediately double the amount excluded from taxes to $11.2m and repeal it entirely in 2024.The committee expects that to reduce revenue by $172.2bn through 2027.Winners: Some families The plan also reduces the number of tax brackets to four from seven.For married couples, income up to $24,000 would not be taxed under the proposal; income between $24,000 and $90,000 would face a 12% rate; earnings between $90,000 and $260,000 would be taxed at 25%; while income between $260,000 and $1m would fall in the 35% bracket.Income over $1m would face the top 39.5% rate.For single filers, the bill sets the income thresholds at half those amounts, but the 35% rate would start at $200,000.How those changes would affect a tax bill depends on the particulars of a person's income, residence and what benefits they claim.In theory, for joint-filers, the proposal would mean the tax rate on income up to about $76,000 would fall from 15% under current law to 12%, while the tax rate on income between $76,000 and $90,00 would drop from 25% to 12%.The tax rate on income between about $471,000 and $1m would also fall for joint-filers, from 39.5% under current law to 35%.Losers: Wealthy homeowners in Democratic states Current law permits taxpayers to deduct interest paid on mortgages up to $1m.The Republican proposal would cap that at $500,000.Trade groups for home builders and realtors oppose the shift, but the change is favoured by some left-leaning groups, including the National Low Income Housing Coalition.The organisation estimates that only about 5% of mortgage-holders in the US would be affected.Many of those mortgage-holders are concentrated in high-cost, coastal states, such as California, New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts and Maryland.In California, for example, more than 16% of home loans exceeded $500,000, compared to less than 1% in Iowa.Many of those homeowners would also likely be hit by the $10,000 cap imposed on local property tax deductions.Many of the states most affected are strongholds of Democratic voters and home to Democratic leaders, including Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer.The change would also raise revenue, but the committee did not estimate the specifics of the provision.Losers: Ivy League universities The bill would impose a 1.4% tax on investment income earned by certain private colleges and universities.The shift is expected to raise $3bn over a decade.Losers: manufacturers testing drugs for rare conditions The bill repeals a credit granted for some drug development expenses.That is one example of how the bill aims to close "loopholes" for businesses.
US sets final tariffs on softwood lumber from Canada:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Why are Trump and Trudeau fighting over trees?The US Department of Commerce has said it has concluded that imports of Canadian softwood lumber are being unfairly subsidised.In a statement released on Thursday, it said efforts to reach a negotiated agreement with Canada have failed.Canada called the decision on countervailing and anti-dumping duties on lumber "unfair, unwarranted and deeply troubling".This is the latest salvo in a lengthy dispute between the two countries.The US has set final total tariffs for most Canadian softwood lumber producers at 20.8%.A handful of producers were singled out for individual duties, including one of up to 23.8%.Except in one instance, those combined countervailing and anti-dumping duties are below preliminary tariffs issued earlier this year.The final tariffs will be set if the US International Trade Commission (ITC) makes a determination that the US industry was harmed.An ITC decision is due by 18 December.In a joint statement on Thursday, Canada's Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland and Natural Resources Minister Jim Carr said they "will forcefully defend" the domestic softwood lumber industry."We are reviewing our options, including legal action through the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) and the World Trade Organization, and we will not delay in taking action," they said.Softwood lumber products, like pine, fir and spruce, are mainly used in the construction of single family houses.The US has claimed for decades that Canada is unfairly subsidising its lumber industry by charging minimal fees to log public lands.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Dairy wars: Why is Trump threatening Canada over milk?Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in a statement that the US remains committed to "free, fair and reciprocal trade with Canada", and that the decision is based on "a full and unbiased review of the facts in an open and transparent process".The department said it had determined that Canadian exporters have sold softwood lumber to the US at 3.2-8.89% less than fair value.It also maintains that the country is providing unfair subsidies at rates from 3.34-18.19%.The US Commerce Department valued softwood lumber imports from Canada at C$7.6bn (US$5.6bn;4.3bn) in 2016.Image copyright Reuters Image caption British Columbia is Canada's biggest logging province In June, Canada announced C$867m (US$640m;500m) in relief for the country's lumber industry.The aid came after the US first slapped hefty tariffs on the import of Canadian softwood lumber in April.The department announcement comes during a tense point in trilateral talks between Canada, the US and Mexico to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement.
Alibaba revenues surge 61% on online shopping:::::Image copyright AFP Image caption Jack Ma founded Alibaba in 1999 Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba has beaten market expectations with a huge jump in quarterly revenues fuelled by online shopping.Revenues for the three months to September rose 61% on the same period a year earlier, to 55.1bn yuan ($8.3bn; 6.4bn).It also raised its revenue predictions for the full-year forecast.Alibaba is expanding from its core online businesses to investments in supermarkets and stores."We had an outstanding quarter," Alibaba chief executive Daniel Zhang said in a statement."We are seeing the early results from our efforts to integrate online and offline with our new retail strategy".For the July to September quarter, income from operations surged 83% from a year earlier, to 16.58bn yuan.Alibaba, started by billionaire Jack Ma, is the dominant online retailer in China through its Tmall and Taobao shopping platforms.The company said mobile monthly active users of its Chinese retail marketplaces grew to 549m in September, up 20m from three months ago.The US-listed firm has been on a strong run, regularly beating revenue estimates, and its shares have more than doubled in value this year.It expects more good news for shareholders ahead: Alibaba raised its revenue guidance for the 2018 fiscal year to growth of between 49% and 53%.That's up from 45% to 49% previously forecast.The Chinese firm is also gearing up for the annual blockbuster Singles' Day event on November 11, a sales bonanza that moves more goods than the Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales days in the United States combined.
World's most expensive dram of Scotch was a fake:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The dram was bought for 7,600 A dram of vintage Scotch bought by a Chinese millionaire in a Swiss hotel bar for 7,600 was a fake, laboratory tests have concluded.Analysts from Scotland were called in by the Waldhaus Am See hotel in St Moritz after experts questioned the authenticity of the 2cl shot.It had been poured from an unopened bottle labelled as an 1878 Macallan single malt.It is believed to be the largest sum ever paid for a poured dram of Scotch.But analysis found that it was almost certainly not distilled before 1970.The hotel said it had accepted the findings and reimbursed the customer in full.Zhang Wei, 36, from Beijing - one of China's highest-earning online writers - had paid just under 10,000 Swiss francs (7,600, $10,050) for the single shot while visiting the hotel's Devil's Place whisky bar in July.But suspicions about the spirit's provenance surfaced soon after the purchase, when whisky industry experts spotted discrepancies in the bottle's cork and label from newspaper articles.Image copyright Sandro Bernasconi Image caption Mr Zhang was photographed with hotel manager Sandro Bernasconi after buying the dram That prompted the Waldhaus to send a sample to Dunfermline-based specialists Rare Whisky 101 (RW101) for analysis.Carbon dating tests were then carried out by researchers from the University of Oxford, which suggested a 95% probability that the spirit was created between 1970 and 1972.Further lab tests by Fife-based alcohol analysts Tatlock and Thomson indicated that it was probably a blended Scotch, comprising 60% malt and 40% grain - ruling it out as a single malt.RW101 said the tests had shown that the bottle was "almost worthless as a collector's item".Had the bottle been genuine, it would have carried a bar-value of about 300,000 Swiss francs (227,000).Image copyright Sandro Bernasconi Image caption The dram was poured from an unopened bottle that purported to be an 1878 Macallan Mr Zhang, who writes martial arts fantasy novels under the pen name Tang Jia San Shao, earned the equivalent of about $16.8m in 2015, according to China Daily.He bought the dram while on holiday with his grandmother at the Swiss hotel, which stocks 2,500 different whiskies.Waldhaus manager Sandro Bernasconi told BBC Scotland that the hotel had no idea the bottle was a fake.He said: "My father bought the bottle of Macallan 25 years ago, when he was manager of this hotel, and it had not been opened."When Mr Zhang asked if he could try some, we told him it wasn't for sale.When he said he really wanted to try it, I called my father who told me we could wait another 20 years for a customer like that so we should sell it."Mr Zhang and I then opened the bottle together and drank some of it."Image copyright Weibo Image caption Mr Zhang wrote about his experience with the "1878" Macallan a few days after his visit to the Waldhaus hotel A few days after tasting the whisky, Mr Zhang posted a message on the Chinese micro-blogging platform Weibo about his experience.He wrote in Mandarin: "When I came across a fine spirit from over 100 years ago, there wasn't much struggle inside."My grandma who accompanied me on this trip was only 82, yet the alcohol was 139 years old - same age as my grandma's grandma."To answer you all, it had a good taste.It's not just the taste, but also history."Image copyright Hotel Waldhaus Am See Image caption The dram was bought from the Devil's Place whisky bar in St Moritz Mr Bernasconi broke the bad news to Mr Zhang when he flew out to China to reimburse him recently.He added: "When I showed him the results, he was not angry - he thanked me very much for the hotel's honesty and said his experience in Switzerland had been good."When it comes to selling our customers some of the world's rarest and oldest whiskies, we felt it was our duty to ensure that our stock is 100% authentic and the real deal."That's why we called in RW101."The result has been a big shock to the system, and we are delighted to have repaid our customer in full as a gesture of goodwill."RW101 co-founder David Robertson said: "The Waldhaus team did exactly the right thing by trying to authenticate this whisky."We would implore that others in the market do what they can to identify any rogue bottles."The more intelligence we can provide, the greater the chance we have to defeat the fakers and fraudsters who seek to dupe the unsuspecting rare whisky consumer."
Airline to buy 31 C-Series Bombardier planes:::::Image copyright Reuters Image caption Parts of Bombardier's C-Series planes are made in Belfast A European airline intends to buy at least 31 of Bombardier's C-Series planes, the aerospace firm has said.The unnamed airline has signed a letter of intent for 31 orders, with options for 30 more.It expects the deal to be agreed by the year's end.C-Series wings are made at Bombardier's Belfast operation, providing employment for about 1,000 people.For the third quarter of 2017, Bombardier posted a net loss of $117m on turnover of $3.8bn.Alain Bellemare, Bombardier's chief executive, said: "This significant new order confirms the increasing confidence customers have in the C Series."Based on the list price, a firm order would be valued at approximately $2.4bn (1.81bn), rising to nearly $4.8bn should all 30 options be exercised.Last month, Airbus agreed to take a majority stake in the C-Series project.Bombardier has faced a series of problems over the plane, most recently a trade dispute in the US that imposed a 300% import tariff.Bombardier was accused of anti-competitive practices by rival Boeing, which complained to the US authorities.Boeing accused the Canadian firm of selling the jets below cost price after taking state subsidies from Canada and the UK.Bombardier said it would fight the "absurd" import tariff ruling.Gavin Robinson MP, whose constituency houses the Belfast plant, said the new orders were a "welcome piece of news for the company as a whole"."The timing too is significant and is a vote of confidence in the joint venture between Bombardier and Airbus," he added.
HS2: Five companies on shortlist to build the trains:::::Image copyright PA The Department for Transport has shortlisted five companies to build trains for the new HS2 rail network.Alstom Transport, Bombardier Transportation UK, Hitachi Rail Europe, Patentes Talgo and Siemens are vying for the 2.75bn contract.The winner will design, build and maintain some 54 new high-speed trains.The vehicles, which can travel at speeds up to 225mph, are expected to come into service in 2026.The government has been criticised in the past for awarding transport contracts to overseas businesses instead of UK companies.In 2011, it chose to hand a contract to build train carriages for the Thameslink rail route to Siemens, which rival Bombardier said threatened 1,400 jobs at its Derby plant.A number of the companies that have been shortlisted have UK production lines such as Hitachi's manufacturing plant in Newton Aycliffe, County Durham, while Alstom is developing its new train technology and manufacturing facility in Widnes, Cheshire.HS2 minister Paul Maynard said on Thursday: "Thousands of skilled British jobs and apprenticeships will be created by HS2, which gets a step closer as we reveal the companies shortlisted to build the high speed trains."In summer, the government announced which companies would build the first phase of HS2 between London and Birmingham.Preparatory work has begun and major construction work is due to start in 2018-19.The five bidders for the train-building contract will tender next year and the contract will be awarded in 2019.
BT profits dented by sports rights investment:::::Image copyright BT Profits at BT dipped in the second quarter partly due to higher payments for sports rights and a slowdown in its global corporate services division.The company said other factors holding back profits included investment in customer service, and higher pension costs and business rates.Pre-tax profits for the three months to 30 September fell 1% to 666m BT said it was taking "robust actions" to improve the performance of global services.The company said market conditions in the division continued to be "challenging".It is cutting back staff numbers and has shed 1,500 posts so far this year, with a further 1,500 roles to go in the second half of the year.Another 1,000 will be cut next year.Mobile growth BT said operating costs in its consumer business had risen by 2%, due to investment in new UK customer service roles and additional sports rights costs from the Premier League, Box Nation and the Ashes.Investment in customer services has led to an improvement in waiting times, with calls now answered almost four minutes faster than last year, on average after 74 seconds.BT chief executive Gavin Patterson said the company's cost-cutting programme was on track to deliver savings of 400m.He also said BT was "committed" to delivering ultrafast internet speeds to 12 million premises by the end of 2020.BT, which bought mobile operator EE last year, said it added 279,000 mobile subscribers in the past quarter taking the total number of its contract customers to 17.3 million.In total, it now has almost 30 million mobile customers.The company also said it was continuing to sort out its Italian business, where earlier this year it said it had uncovered years of "inappropriate behaviour" and improper accounting practices.
Pound falls on Bank's rate comments:::::Image copyright Getty Images The pound fell after the Bank of England increased interest rates but indicated that any future rises would be "very gradual".As had been widely expected, the Bank raised rates from 0.25% to 0.5%, with seven of the nine Monetary Policy Committee members backing the increase.But it repeated previous guidance that any future rises would be "at a gradual pace and to a limited extent".Sterling fell nearly two cents against the dollar to $1.3062.Against the euro, the pound was also down nearly two cents at 1.1204.Although the Bank reiterated its guidance of "limited" and "gradual" future rate rises, it did not repeat comments suggesting the financial markets were underestimating the extent of future rises."The pound and gilt yields slid sharply on the back of the removal of the line that interest rates may have to rise faster than markets currently expect," said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK."The removal of this line suggests that any further hikes are likely to come much further out into 2018."In contrast, the benchmark FTSE 100 share index rose following the Bank's decision, closing 67.36 points higher at 7,555.32.The index often rises when sterling falls, as the weaker currency increases the value of companies' overseas earnings when they are brought back to the UK and converted back into pounds.
Morrisons notches up more sales growth:::::Image copyright Reuters Morrisons, the UK's fourth-biggest supermarket chain, has reported a 2.5% rise in sales for the third quarter.The rise in like-for-like sales, which measures activity in stores that have been open for more than a year, shows the retailer's recovery is continuing.Sales at the supermarket have now grown for eight quarters in a row.Chief executive David Potts, said: "We again worked hard during the quarter... and made good progress on becoming more competitive."While the sales increase in the three months to 29 October is another step forward in Morrisons' recovery, it is a notch below the 2.6% rise in the previous quarter and is also down on the 3.4% rate seen in the first quarter of this year.Morrisons has been the best performing of the established "Big Four" UK supermarkets recently, although all chains are attempting to fight off the fierce competition coming from discounters Aldi and Lidl.Image copyright Morrisons One area earmarked for growth is its higher-quality "Best" range.Mr Potts said this was being increased to 1,000 items and would have double the range of items offered this Christmas, compared with last.Morrisons is also expanding its home delivery services.It now has partnerships with both internet giant Amazon, which in certain areas will deliver an entire shopping basket, and home delivery specialists Ocado.Ocado delivers orders from the Morrisons.com website to half the country.Morrisons has been unable to service the North East from Ocado's site in Warwickshire, but it has now launched a delivery service in the region.It also plans to roll out deliveries to areas in the south of England that it does not already serve.Tom Berry, retail analyst at Global Data, said the company's recovery drive was bearing fruit: "The continued drive to improve quality and affordability has paid off for Morrisons, as it fends off competition from the discounters and capitalises on Asda's failure to implement a clear turnaround strategy."However, he said maintaining the pace of growth could get tougher.
Tesla delays Model 3 production in its worst quarter:::::Image copyright Tesla Image caption Production targets for Tesla's Model 3 car have been set back by months Electric carmaker Tesla pushed back targets for its new Model 3 car, admitting it's months behind schedule.Tesla said it would now produce 5,000 of the cars each week by early 2018, instead of December.The new target emerged as Tesla posted its biggest quarterly loss ever, sending its shares down more than 5% in after-hours trading.Tesla made net losses of $619m (468m) in the three months to 30 September, nearly double the previous quarter.A year earlier, the firm made a profit of $21.9m.The losses were bigger than usual because Tesla has been focused on ramping up production of its Model 3 sedan.Image copyright Tesla Image caption Tesla said it won't reach its production target of 5,000 Model 3 cars per week until 2018 The carmaker is hoping to attract mass market interest in the vehicle which is priced at $35,000, about half the cost of its Model S car.Tesla said it had produced just 260 of the Model 3 cars in the third quarter, less than a fifth of the 1,500 vehicles it had planned to build.In a statement the company said it continued "to make significant progress each week in fixing Model 3 bottlenecks"."The nature of manufacturing challenges during a ramp such as this makes it difficult to predict exactly how long it will take for all bottlenecks to be cleared or when new ones will appear", it said.Gigafactory delays Tesla said the main constraint was that progress had slowed at its Gigafactory in Nevada where its battery modules are assembled, and part of the production process has needed to be redesigned.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Tesla boss Elon Musk said he was "really depressed" about the slow progress "I was really depressed about three or four weeks ago," chief executive Elon Musk said, adding that he is now optimistic because it is clear what changes need to be made.But there could be further problems ahead.While quarterly revenues rose about 30% from a year ago to nearly $3bn, Tesla continues to burn through cash.The firm said it expected capital expenditures of $1bn in the fourth quarter, bringing its total investments for the second half of the year to $2bn.And it could face heavy new demands for cash given the delays with the Model 3 and plans for new vehicles.

Why Finnair wants to put passengers on the weighing scales:::::Image copyright Getty Images For the past two days, passengers passing through Helsinki airport may have wondered whether their airline is suffering from weight issues.At check-in, Finnair staff have been asking them to please step briefly on to a set of weighing scales.But this isn't a new "thin air" strategy to slim down the cargo.The airline is surveying customers to check that the estimates it has been using to calculate total weight, fuel and safety are accurate."Airlines know what the aircraft weighs, what the check-in luggage weighs, but not what passengers weigh," said Pivyt Tallqvist, communications director at Finnair.So far, they have found 180 volunteers willing to weigh in, complete with carry-on luggage.They need a total of 2,000 to accurately understand their regular payloads, said Ms Tallqvist.Until now, Finnair has, like most airlines, been using European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) passenger standard weight estimates, which put a male's weight at 84.6kg, a female passenger at 66.5kg and the average under-12 at 30.7kg.But the EASA found those averages hide a range of variables: men travelling first class tend to weigh more than those in economy, while for women the reverse is true.The average hand luggage is 6.1kg, but that average falls significantly in the summer and men carry on heavier items than women.So Finnair is keen to survey the mix of air travellers specific to their airline.As well as flying Finns in and out of their home country, the airline offers transfers between Asian and European destinations, and they suspect that the combination of tall Finnish men in winter coats, long-haul travellers from East Asia and daily business travellers around Finland will add up to different set of average outcomes.Finnair is looking for more volunteers to be weighed over the winter months.Then they'll recommence in the spring, when travellers have stripped down to their lighter season togs.Image copyright Finnair One question is whether basing the data on those happy to step up might skew the results."That's a question a lot of people have asked," said Ms Tallqvist.But she doesn't think it will pose a problem."We found yesterday and today we had people of all shapes and sizes.We had Finnish and Asian customers, we had a variety of male and female and of different sizes."In recent years, other airlines have begun to look at the variation in passenger weight.In 2013, Samoa Air controversially became the first airline to charge passengers by the kilo rather than per person.Travellers hold strong opinions on both sides of the argument whether treating heavier passengers differently is fair.But Finnair says that is certainly not what they are considering."That has been a concern that some people have raised," says Ms Tallqvist."For us, this has nothing to do with ticket pricing or anything like that."
Simon's Cat game app showed adult bite advert:::::Image copyright Strawdog Publishing Image caption The Simon's Cat game requires players to connect matching coloured treats The UK's advertising watchdog has intervened after an adult advert was shown within a video game app popular with children.The pop-up ad featured a "temporary tattoo" that looked like a deep bite mark, placed on a woman's shoulder.The imagery appeared in the match-puzzle title Simon's Cat Crunch Time in July.Wish.com, the retailer responsible for creating the ad, failed to respond to the complaint.The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) said it was concerned by the San Francisco-based company's lack of response and ordered the business to ensure its adverts were properly targeted in the future.Although the body does not have the power to impose fines itself, it can refer repeat offenders to Trading Standards, which can take further action.The game's publisher has also banned Wish.com from serving ads to its products in the future.'Red and bloody' The Simon's Cat game has a Pegi 3 rating - meaning it has been judged to be suitable for anyone above the age of three - and has been installed more than one million times on Android and iOS devices.As with many titles, adverts are automatically placed within the software by algorithms, which are supposed to screen out adult content.Image copyright Wish Image caption This Wish.com ad was spotted within the game app on 24 July The publisher, Strawdog Studios, told the ASA that it also had the power to remove ads manually.But it added that it relied on customer reports to flag unsuitable content, and had not been alerted to the tattoo image before the watchdog had become involved."We considered the app was likely to have strong appeal to children and therefore children were likely to have seen the ad," said the ASA in its ruling."We noted that it was not clear from the ad that the product shown was a fake tattoo and we considered that the image... which was red and bloody, might cause distress."The authority added that Wish.com was obliged to ensure the ad was not promoted again in an untargeted manner.The company - which describes itself as the world's sixth biggest e-commerce business - sent an automated response to the BBC when asked for comment but has yet to address the problem."The ASA has a growing problem with non-UK online businesses, who will sometimes take the view that a self-regulatory body can be ignored," said Andy Milmore, a partner at the law firm Harbottle & Lewis."This is especially so where the complaints relate to 'inappropriate' marketing, where the ultimate backstop of enforcement action under criminal statute is unlikely to apply."
Spreading the word: How to promote your online business:::::Image copyright Gemma Day Image caption Nosh Detox founder Geeta Sidhu-Robb used bloggers to help promote her brand Online businesses now have a wealth of digital tools and techniques at their disposal to help them get noticed in the global marketplace.Geeta Sidhu-Robb, founder of juice and health food delivery service, Nosh Detox, was using social media to promote her business long before it became fashionable to do so.Ten years ago, in fact.On a tight budget and needing to convince a sceptical public, she tapped in to the power and reach of bloggers to promote her diet and wellbeing products."Juice fasts didn't really exist in the UK at the time," recalls the former corporate lawyer and single mum of three."In fact some people actually thought a detox could kill you.""We couldn't afford PR [public relations] agencies or expensive advertising campaigns, so we'd talk to pretty much anyone with an online presence and persuade them to take photos, film us on YouTube and write about us," she says.The bloggers would include a link to her website on their pages - occasionally in return for some Nosh Detox freebies Ms Sidhu-Robb admits.This helped push the business to the top of organic - not paid-for - search rankings.A 2m turnover and Hollywood A-list clientele followed, along with significant followings in Russia and Australia.It shows how, on social media, a little can go a very long way when it comes brand promotion.Image copyright EyeFitU Image caption Isabelle Ohnemus is a big believer in finding the right social media "influencer" for your brand Now social media marketing is a business in its own right.Convenient and low cost, with a potentially vast audience reach, the platforms have overtaken all other media for small businesses, says research firm BIA Kelsey.Former investment banker Isabelle Ohnemus has extensively used "influencers" to promote her Zurich-based fashion company EyeFitU, which is an online platform aimed at remedying some of the sizing inconsistencies across fashion brands.Usually young, fashion-conscious females with a prominent online presence act as "brand ambassadors" for EyeFitU, promoting the company to their followers on Instagram, Snapchat or Facebook.Big brands will sometimes pay in excess of $30,000 (23,000) to such influencers for a single post, but smaller companies with more modest budgets can still get in on the action."There is a trend for going with smaller-scale bloggers rather than those with million-plus followers," says Ms Ohnemus,."Having those kinds of numbers doesn't necessarily mean a higher number of conversions."In other words, it's the quality of the following not the size that matters.People who trust an influencer's opinion are more likely to buy the brand's goods, she says.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Reality TV star Marnie Simpson fell foul of the Advertising Standards Authority Of course, there are rules governing this sort of social media influencer marketing, so you have to be careful.Geordie Shore TV star Marnie Simpson recently got into trouble for uploading images of products from two firms she had business relationships with, without identifying them as adverts A spokeswoman for the UK's Advertising Standards Authority tells the BBC: "Our current codes state that if an advertiser gives payment to a social media influencer - this can be in the form of a monetary payment or a freebie - and there is control over the contents of the ad, the social media post would be considered an ad; thus the influencer must clearly indicate somewhere on the post that this is an advertisement."Know your customer One of the main advantages of an online business compared to a traditional bricks-and-mortar shop is the amount of data you can gather about your customers.You can find out which search words people use to find your business, for example, which images they respond to the most, and which website content they share on other platforms.This all helps to refine and target your marketing efforts.Free monitoring tools, like BuzzSumo and Metrixapp, not to mention Google Analytics, are all powerful helpers for the small business.Image copyright Gourmet Meat Club Image caption Gourmet Meat Club found that images of cooked food were more popular than raw ingredients Vikas Shah, visiting professor of entrepreneurship at the MIT Sloan School of Management, says: "You can easily start by using many free SEO [search engine optimisation] tools on platforms like Google and Twitter, and because this activity is very much results driven, you will see a fairly robust relationship between spend and return on investment."Gourmet Meat Club, an online provider of free range British meat, is one of the 54% of websites globally using Google Analytics to delve into customer quirks.Recent insights reveal that Android mobile users visit more web pages than those on an Apple phone, and images of cooked food generate more views in a digital ad campaign than images of raw ingredients.Furthermore, the technology tracks the most popular food searches online, giving Gourmet Meat Club the opportunity to create content based on the very latest trends.More Technology of Business Image copyright Getty Images "It's crucial to act fast," says Stuart Cordingley, the firm's managing director, "jumping onto popular searches as soon as they emerge to get ahead of the competition and be present where the public is discussing its new favourite food topics."This is the best way for the brand to get "ample exposure", he says.Data is now "central to the marketing mix".This up-to-the-minute content is sent to journalists and shared on the firm's own Facebook and Twitter pages.Social media marketing expert Andy Barr says it is an example of how online businesses are increasingly morphing into social media communities, creating content that positions them as authorities on particular topics.But he also advises supplementing this approach with social media advertising."As a general rule of thumb, it's worth spending between 7-12% of your total monthly revenue or income on social media promotion for the best results," he says.
Ever fancied joining a private members' club?:::::Image copyright Paul Winch-Furness Image caption The Hospital Club is one of a new breed of trendy private members' clubs A new breed of fashionable private members clubs are growing in popularity around the world, promising to be more inclusive and diverse than their stuffy older counterparts.Yet while the newer venues certainly have a far more youthful membership, and you certainly don't need to have gone to a posh school or university, they still have high joining fees and strict vetting processes.So how less elitist are they?And what are the benefits of getting your name on the list?"I like how organically relationships happen at Soho House," says tech entrepreneur Tyler McIntyre."You can't wear business suits, you can't hand out business cards, and you can't take phone calls."The 26-year-old joined Soho Beach House in Miami two years ago, after visiting with friends who were members."It's a laidback place to network but it's also given me the opportunity to try things I typically wouldn't do by myself, like wine tastings or a jam-making class.Image copyright Dave Burk Image caption Soho House New York has a rooftop pool "And sometimes I'll go to the sunset DJ parties by the pool, which are loud and pretty crazy."Welcome to the new breed of private members' club, which claim to be less restrictive and more diverse than the stuffy gentlemen's clubs of the past.These modern venues - with their co-working spaces, screening rooms and rooftop pools - are fast becoming the places where many of today's young creative class choose to work and play.Membership isn't cheap though, with some charging more than $2,000 (1,500) per annum, along with joining fees of $300.Image copyright Tyler McIntyre Image caption Tech entrepreneur Tyler McIntyre joined Soho House Miami two years ago "In the past, members' clubs were seen as being elitist and populated by people who went to the same public schools and universities," says Richard Cope, a senior trends consultant at Mintel."But these places are more for entrepreneurs and self-made people.The only thing you have to be able to do is pay the fee, and it can be fairly expensive."While trendy members' clubs have been around for years, they became much more common after the launch of Soho House in London in 1995.The trend has also gained a foothold in the US and other countries."We've see a huge jump in the number of the new types of club coming online, as compared to the traditional model," says Zack Bates of Private Club Marketing, a firm that promotes members' clubs.Image copyright Soho House Image caption Soho House Barcelona looks to attract creative entrepreneurs "In Los Angeles, you can't get into Soho House.So others are being built, the Hospital Club, Griffin House and Norwood, to keep up with the appetite for these spaces."Soho House itself now boasts 18 venues around the world, including in New York, Istanbul, Berlin, and soon Mumbai.Group revenue rose 3% in 2016 to 293.4m, while global membership jumped from 56,000 to 70,000.However, you have to do more than just fill out an application to join its venues.Membership costs between 400 to 1,580 per annum, depending on the club, although there are discounts for under-27s.Image copyright Soho House Barcelona Image caption The gym at Soho House Barcelona More stories from the BBC's Business Brain series looking at interesting business topics from around the world: Image copyright The Hospital Club Image caption The Hospital Club has a TV and music studio on site And there's a tough background check to ensure potential members are part of the creative class - Soho House frowns on those who work in financial services, for instance.Once accepted, members enjoy a host of perks.Soho House Barcelona, for example, one of the chain's newest venues, boasts a retro-themed gym, pool and free classes like yoga.Members pay full price for food and drink but get discounts on the club's hotel rooms.Mr Cope says: "These clubs offer people a discreet place to network and wind down, typically in cities where personal space is at a premium."However, they are also about "showing off to a degree"."In an age of social media, people like to let others know where they hang out or which restaurants they eat at.So there's an element of satisfying those peacock tendencies."Image copyright Richard Booth Image caption The Hospital Club says it provides its members with networking opportunities The newer clubs do serve more practical functions, though, such as offering young entrepreneurs a place to work.Take London's Hospital Club, based in Covent Garden, which offers its own meeting and conference rooms, and even an in-house TV and music recording studio.Standard membership costs 865 plus a 250 joining fee.While some might find such fees high, it's still cheaper than forking out for your own office space, says Mr Bates."It suits today's digital nomads, who work remotely via their laptops.Paying for an office can be prohibitively expensive, especially in a major city."Members' clubs also offer vital networking opportunities that help further your career, says Zikki Munyao, 40.The remote IT worker joined Common House, a private member's club in Charlottesville, USA, largely for this purpose.Image copyright Andrea Hubbell Photography Image caption The co-working space at Common House "There are areas to socialise and meeting spaces where I can have privacy," he says of the club, where membership costs $150 (113) a month, plus a $600 joining fee."I even met my estate agent over a game of pool."The new breed of members' clubs does face challenges, though.Some warn that as clubs proliferate, their exclusivity is becoming diluted, and they struggle to attract the celebrities that once lent them cachet.The social commentator Peter York tells the BBC: "Traditionally private members' clubs have played on their exclusivity and being able to attract the 'magic people'."But as more and more of them pop up, you get blase.The magical people also can't be corralled in one place anymore."He adds that as clubs like Soho House keep on expanding, they seem to be "more about business", which further dilutes their brand."The danger is that a new challenger, which looks younger and groovier, arrives and steals your limelight."But Mr Cope believes the market for these new clubs is going to expand."Having somewhere where you can unwind and host friends in the centre of cities is useful.So there are a lot of practicalities around this."It is also about expressing your individuality, so I think the emotional need for this is only going to grow."
The new port trying to fulfil our shopping obsession:::::Image copyright DP World Image caption DP World London Gateway opened in November 2013 Just five years ago, DP World London Gateway was still being dredged from the Thames.Now the UK's newest port is trying to lure the world's biggest ships to its quayside to get us our shopping quicker.You browse online, click on something you fancy, and lo and behold often as little as 24 hours later it's on your front door step.This seemingly magical process - a relatively recent phenomenon - is being made possible by one of the oldest industries on the planet - shipping.Most of us don't spend a lot of time thinking about how what we buy gets to us.Yet most of the clothes you wear, much of the food you eat, the TV you watch, your phone and even the materials for the house you live in will have come to you via a ship."You can put anything in a box more or less," quips James Leeson, head of port commercial, at DP World London Gateway.The boxes here mostly contain frozen foods such as chicken and beef, and fruit such as bananas.Occasionally they may contain the lifelong belongings of a family moving overseas, expensive cars, or even, as was the case recently, Virgin founder Richard Branson's yacht.The port officially opened for business just four years ago.Image copyright Thinkstock Image caption Most of what we buy arrives by ship The windswept, vast space has literally redrawn the Essex landscape.Situated 20 miles down the River Thames from London, in Thurrock, Essex, the port sits on a bed of sand and silt dredged from the Thames on the site of a former oil refinery.The 1.5bn construction saw a staggering 350,000 animals moved off site into new habitats.At one stage DP World's office building on the site homed tanks of great crested newts before they were moved into newly created ponds.It was planned long before the financial crisis when the world economy was booming and ports were struggling to handle the sheer volumes of goods coming in.The two busiest container ports in the south east are Hutchison Whampoa's Felixstowe, in Suffolk, and DP World's other port in Southampton.And so far the number of containers London Gateway has handled in its short existence has been dwarfed by its rivals.Last year, Felixstowe handled almost six times as many containers as London Gateway.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Most of the port's processes are automated Mr Leeson is undeterred - saying the company is in it for the long term."It takes a bit of time to get moving.Shipping volumes are up and we've got big names signing up to leases in logistics park," he says.The port's deep channels means it can handle the latest biggest ships, the so called Neo-Panamaxes.These giants, equivalent to the width and length of three football pitches laid end to end, are increasingly the way goods are shipped.Its other big advantage is that most of the port's operations are automated.In a space which is twice the size of the City of London just 500 people are employed.'Frictionless trade' This means faster "frictionless trade", says Mr Leeson.It is this that London Gateway believes will help it to gain more customers.Incoming trucks have to pre-register and are scanned on arrival, before being sent to a specific bay where an automated crane removes or adds their container, meaning they can be in and out in half an hour.The containers themselves are organised by huge cranes which stalk the landscape like Star Wars At-Ats.Like an oversized game of Jenga, where each container goes is carefully organised to make sure that the boxes which need to unloaded or loaded first are near the top.A sophisticated computer system continually tracks where the containers are in the port.Mr Leeson says this is crucial."It used to be that your box would arrive at port and you'd have no clue what happened.Now you can track it through port and see when it's ready for collection.Consumers are more and more demanding and we had to respond to that," he says.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Containers are continually tracked But it is the scale of its logistics park which DP World is betting on to be London Gateway's biggest lure.Currently most of the goods imported into the UK are taken by road, and some by rail, to big distribution centres in the Midlands, the traditional logistics hub for the country.This means shipped goods are often driven from the south, up north to be packaged or priced, and then driven back to the south where the majority of items are bought and sold.DP World believes the space it is offering will enable firms to process goods immediately after arrival, speeding up their deliveries to shops and to consumers increasingly used to Amazon Prime's 24-hour delivery promise.Environmentally it will cut carbon emissions, but crucially DP World also expects it to cut costs.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Consumers increasingly expect goods to arrive within 24 hours So far, parcel giant UPS and discount supermarket Lidl have taken space, with Dixons Carphone also reported to soon be opening up a warehouse.And fruit importer SH Pratt Group is getting ready to build a giant refrigerated facility for its new venture Halo, which will package chilled and frozen goods.Currently, the space is a muddy patch of wasteland, but Halo's managing director Gavin Knight says it will be up and running by next summer.He says the decision to choose London Gateway was "quite simple"."As soon as you put a container on wheels it adds cost.[This way] we're saving time, food miles and money," he says.Global Trade More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade: But Neil Davidson, shipping consultancy Drewry's senior analyst for ports and terminals, says firms will have to weigh up the advantages against the potentially higher cost of renting space and hiring staff in the south east.With the shipping market growing "steadily but not hugely", the only way for London Gateway to succeed will be to steal market share from its local rivals, Mr Davidson says.It's something that London Gateway has already started to do, albeit on a small scale.But Mr Leeson is confident its growth will continue, "We built London Gateway as a future proof model for future trade," he says.And its other big advantage as Brexit looms is that 99% of its trade comes from outside the EU."We are confident that whatever happens we will see an upturn in trade," he says.
Play it again: The firm saving vinyl:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption How a small company in the Czech Republic became the world's largest maker of vinyl records Whether gathering dust in your loft or currently spinning on your turntable, it's a fair bet that at least some of your vinyl records came from a small factory in the Czech Republic.The facility in question is the headquarters of GZ Media, based in the small town of Lodenice, 25km (16 miles) west of the Czech capital, Prague.GZ is today the world's largest producer of vinyl records, of which it expects to press 30 million this year, for everyone from the Rolling Stones and U2, to Lady Gaga and Madonna.The success of the company is a far cry from the early 1990s, when vinyl records appeared to be on the way out, with music fans having switched en masse to compact discs.Back in the early 1970s more than three-quarters of album sales were on vinyl, but by the 1990s that had plunged to just 1.5%.Image caption Producing vinyl records is a multi-step process "In 1993 our output was at its lowest, vinyl was almost dead," says GZ's chief executive Michal Sterba."If we'd have stayed as a vinyl-only producer in the 90s, GZ would be no more."The operation had only become a private company two years earlier after the fall of communism.Prior to that it had been a state-run enterprise called Gramofonove Zavody (Gramophone Record Factory) which had started in 1951, and had pressed records for the world's largest music companies.With demand for vinyl having dwindled, GZ realised that it had to diversify to survive, so it branched out into printing and making packaging for consumer goods.Image caption Michal Sterba is now expanding GZ, with new sister factories in the US and Canada Crucially though, it kept pressing vinyl to satisfy what little demand there was.At the lowest point in 1993 it made just 350,000 discs."We wanted to be the last company standing in the field of vinyl record production," says Mr Sterba.So when the resurgence of vinyl began around 2010, GZ was in a position to take advantage of it.Unlike most rivals, GZ still had the vinyl-making equipment and the expertise.Its successful diversification also gave it the cash to invest.Image caption The company has also seen a rising demand for picture discs Mr Sterba says: "Our competitors could buy machinery and materials, but the know-how is very hard to acquire."The firm's printing and packing capabilities give it another advantage over its rivals, he adds: "As well as producing the actual vinyl discs, GZ also makes the packaging, prints the artwork and any extras such as posters or booklet."One particularly tough job, he recalls, was producing a real metal zip on the cover of the reissued Rolling Stones' Sticky Fingers album.How vinyl records are made The original music, on tape or a digital file, is transferred to a diamond-tipped cutter This cuts a groove of the music into a steel disc coated in a layer of copper just 100 microns thick This master disc is then placed into a solution of nickel salt though which an electric current flows.This forms a layer of nickel on top of the copper The nickel layer is then peeled off, and has ridges that are a mirror image of the grooves on the master disk.This nickel plate forms the "stamper" that will imprint the vinyl Next the vinyl compound (a type of plastic) is heated to 160C, and the stamper is pressed into it with the weight of more than 100 tonnes, to produce one side of a vinyl record To keep up with demand, GZ Media's Czech factory now runs 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and employs 1,600 permanent workers.It's a fast-paced operation at every stage of the production process; from the initial stamping to the high-speed ballet of forklifts loading trucks for delivery.The company has invested $20m in equipment, building 12 new presses, but the old still runs alongside the new.Image caption GZ's Czech factory has a permanent workforce of 1,600 plus 400 seasonal workers Bright white, computer-controlled stations sit next to their huge, pale-green iron counterparts, still dripping oil into trays and buckets.GZ's revenues this year are expected to total $110m (83m), and are growing by 9-10% per year.Meanwhile, its vinyl output has tripled since 2010.For the industry as a whole, global sales of vinyl records are expected to reach $1bn in value this year.This may be just 6% of total music industry revenues but vinyl sales are now at a 25-year high.With most of its customers in North America, GZ recently bought a vinyl plant in Memphis, Tennessee, to supplement its Czech production.It has also opened a production facility in Ontario, Canada.Image caption Staff at the factory listen to the records to test them GZ still makes albums for small indie bands - the punk and metal bands that kept the company going in the 1990s, but now it also works with massive global stars."We'll still press 100 records for a small metal band," says Mr Sterba, "but we're also pressing 100,000 for U2.""As for the future," he says, "we're concentrating on making a success of our plants in North America.But in the longer term, we think manufacturing in Asia and preferably Japan [as well], is the right thing to do."This is the third story in a new series called Connected Commerce, which every week highlights companies around the world that are successfully exporting, and trading beyond their home market.Yet, while vinyl sales are growing, some who buy the records don't actually play them.Last year a BBC/ICM poll found 48% of those questioned said they'd never played the vinyl they'd bought and 7% said they didn't even own a turntable.These fans buy a vinyl album for the "feel" of owning a physical object and for the artwork that often comes with it - but they never actually play it.Image caption Staff at GZ had to add a real metal zip to the cover of the Rolling Stones album Sticky Fingers While vinyl sales are growing, they remain tiny compared with their 1980s heyday, says Paul Lee, a music industry expert at accountancy group Deloitte."Vinyl's first and biggest peak was back in the 80s when a billion records, just albums were sold per year.This year we're expecting about 40 million, so it's about one 25th... so it is nothing like that we had back in the 80s."Image caption The company can make vinyl records in any colour Mr Lee adds: "The reality is vinyl is a lovely product, it's also very difficult to consume compared to just tapping in the name of a song on a smart phone... so we would expect the market to be approaching a peak."Yet with music giant Sony announcing earlier this year that it was to re-open its vinyl manufacturing plant in Japan for the first time since 1989, it doesn't look like the vinyl revival is coming to an end any time soon.
The problem facing Trump's China probe:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Trade tensions will be top of mind during US President Donald Trump's visit to China When US President Donald Trump visits China, one subject high on the agenda will be the sweeping trade investigation of Chinese policies that he ordered in August.The White House said it would probe practices that encourage the theft of intellectual property from US businesses - a long-simmering source of tension in the US, Europe and elsewhere.The Chinese government has said the inquiry was a "serious concern" and has warned that it will not sit back if the US takes actions it deems unfair.But one of the biggest challenges for Mr Trump's investigation comes from his own country.Since the White House started its inquiry, a slew of US business groups have submitted formal comments describing their concerns.But just six companies have proved willing to come forward with complaints, according to the public record of comments.Many of them are smaller businesses describing already known incidents.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The US could risk a trade war with one of its biggest trade partners Analysts say companies are hesitant to put at risk their access to one of the world's biggest markets by speaking out.But the decision to stay quiet has consequences: it is likely to limit the administration's ability to build a strong case against China.It may hurt the ability to identify effective remedies, while also making unilateral action more appealing to the White House."It's going to be a huge problem that companies are unwilling to provide specifics because it's going to be very difficult for the United States government to take effective action," says Lee Branstetter, a professor of economics and public policy at Carnegie Mellon University.Intellectual property The White House's focus on intellectual property theft in China follows years of concerns in the US, Europe and elsewhere over counterfeit goods, piracy, hacking, patent violations and other forms of theft.The Commission on the Theft of American Intellectual Property estimates that the annual cost to the US economy from counterfeit goods, pirated software and theft of trade secrets is between $225bn and $600bn.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption General Motors, which has opened factories in China, is among those working with local partners In recent years, the US says the Chinese government has encouraged some of those practices as part of its economic and national security strategies.Those involve state-backed enterprises and are focused on boosting certain industries such as aerospace, robotics and biotech.The US inquiry asked for information about topics including policies that pressure companies to share information with local business partners; opaque approval processes; and possible cyber espionage backed by the government.But previous US efforts to tackle the issue have been hindered by the hesitance of major companies to speak out, says Phil Levy, senior fellow at the Chicago Council on Global Affairs."This has been the problem," says Mr Levy, who served as a trade economist under former President George W Bush."If you want to say China has these violations and we are acting in response to that... you need to have that fairly well documented.And to do that you need to have the co-operation of the companies involved."Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Beijing has promoted renewable energy and US firms in the industry have been among the few to speak out Edwin Rogers is co-founder of Bonumose Biochem, a small Virginia-based start-up that was one of the six companies that shared its complaints.In his case, he says scientists in China filed a copycat patent for a process of making a healthy rare sugar - technology that he believes his company had purchased rights to after acquiring a firm last year.The scientists worked in the US for that firm, he says.They are affiliated with the Chinese Academy of Sciences, a government-backed entity, and have political connections.He says he felt a "duty" to come forward and hopes his story will help the White House craft a response.China's response The office of the US Trade Representative, which is leading the inquiry, did not respond to requests for comment about the investigation.China maintains it has responded to concerns, pointing to laws that forbid intellectual property theft, success by western companies in Chinese courts, and its own efforts to address cyber crime.In September, after the Trump administration launched its investigation, it announced a four-month crackdown focused on intellectual property and foreign investors.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption China says it has made strides to prevent intellectual property theft In comments submitted to US investigators, Chinese organisations told the US that decisions to establish joint ventures and share technology are voluntary agreements between private companies.They cast government initiatives, such as Made in China 2025, as "promotional" - not mandatory - programmes.Some US businesses also defend China's approach.William Mansfield is the intellectual property director at Abro Industries, a 25-person company based in Indiana that makes products such as glue and tape for sale overseas.He says he has spent years fighting against counterfeiters in China - and has figured out successful ways of using China's system, like asking for help from local authorities instead of immediately pursuing a lawsuit.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption President Trump has reportedly told advisors he wants "tariffs" He says US companies often don't understand how China works and unfairly blame problems on the government."I've just never seen anything that would lead me to believe it's anything other than individual counterfeiters acting to maximise their profit and not really caring about the rules," he says.What next?Many US analysts expect the White House to find fault with Beijing; pointing to the growing corporate involvement of the Communist Party and rules that require foreign companies in some sectors to use local partners.But it is unclear what the White House might do after that.The US could work with the Chinese government, collaborate with other countries to craft a response, bring a complaint in an international forum such as the World Trade Organisation, or take unilateral action.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The US has long had concerns over Chinese intellectual property theft and hacking That risks triggering a trade war but President Trump - who has repeatedly attacked China while dismissing international pacts - may be more open to that approach, Mr Levy says.The White House China's strategy remains unclear as different advisors appear to promote clashing approaches, he adds.Investigation of Chinese steel companies, for example, has not led to action.The White House also wants Chinese cooperation as it responds to missile tests from North Korea."It's hard to puzzle out what they're doing," Mr Levy says.Business concerns US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross says he expects addressing the issue to take time.But he says the US is looking for immediate deals, like ones struck between Boeing and Saudi Arabia, as a sign of good faith.Many businesses remain worried the White House could damage the US relationship with China to satisfy isolationists among President Trump's supporters.Erin Ennis, of the US China Business Council, says about 20% of its members have faced pressure in China to transfer key technology in recent years, but adds that they also report that the environment in China is improving.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Chinese President Xi Jinping visited a US Boeing plant in 2015.Aerospace is one of the industries the Chinese government has promoted She urges the administration to focus on specific changes in China, rather than simply imposing penalties, such as sanctions.For example, China could stop making a distinction between foreign and domestic companies, she says.Even without testimony from major companies, associations like hers have provided enough suggestions for the White House to work with the Chinese government, says Ms Ennis.But Prof Branstetter says the US will need to take stronger, more targeted action if it expects intellectual property thefts to stop.He says it doesn't have the information to do so now and he has doubts about this administration's abilities to craft an adroit response."It's easy to see this going badly," he says.
What happens to Mexicans returned from US?:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption There were protests over the threats to deport undocumented young migrants from the US Hundreds of thousands of Mexicans are deported to their home country each year from the United States.The Trump administration's pressure on undocumented young migrants - the so-called "Dreamers" - could mean many more coming home.But what are so many returning people going to do?Starting a new life in Mexico has been harder than expected for Reyna del Rio, a 29 year old who spent most of her childhood in South Carolina before returning to Mexico.Like many returning bilingual Mexicans, she was able to get a job at a call centre.Tough returning But the long hours and angry customers started to take a toll on her.A new initiative by Mexico's public education ministry, known by the Spanish acronym SEP, could be her ticket to a stable career."If you work at a call centre you do things repeatedly.I don't see it as enjoying my job," said Ms del Rio.Image caption Reyna del Rio has returned to find work in Mexico, having left for the US as a young child "I would like to teach and learn new skills.I would like to pass on what I've learned because I think it will fulfil me more than just doing customer service."She is part of a group of young deportees and voluntary returnees who are in the process of applying for English teaching positions through SEP.It's a project trying to make the most of their English language skills.For more than 600 new teaching jobs, the education ministry adapted the application process to encourage repatriated Mexicans.There were changes to make the positions more accessible to returnees, who often face bureaucratic roadblocks related to their time outside of Mexico.The goal is twofold.It aims to provide employment for young deportees and help Mexico reach its goal of being bilingual - in Spanish and English - in 20 years."We made that clause flexible particularly for repatriated Mexicans, because the idea is that no one who might have the possibility of being an English teacher should be left without the chance of doing so," said Mario Chavez Campos, director of the general directorate of higher education for professionals in education, an office within SEP. 'Dreamers' sent back As well as those deported, there are others returning by their own choice, although often forced by the lack of higher education and job opportunities.This was the case for Ms del Rio, who left South Carolina at the age of 18, hoping to access better educational opportunities in Mexico, when she couldn't get financial aid as an undocumented student in the US.Image copyright Reuters Image caption Prototypes for the proposed border wall between the US and Mexico When she arrived in 2009, she barely remembered the country she left when she was five years old.But she persevered."We have the culture of never giving up," Reyna said of her fellow "Dreamers"."We have always had to fight for many things."These undocumented young people, who might have come to the US as children, are feeling vulnerable.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Looking through from Mexico into New Mexico in the US President Donald Trump decided in September to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals programme, known as DACA.This allowed young undocumented immigrants to work legally in the US and be temporarily shielded from deportation.About 800,000 youths received protected status under DACA, and more than 600,000 were from Mexico.Many could soon face deportation as their DACA permits expire in the upcoming months.Retraining as teachers Mexico has pledged to support returning deportees, with initiatives to help them access employment, health and education.But many of these still remain promises.So far 80% of the returned deportees trying to get a job as an English teacher through SEP have had difficulty meeting requirements, primarily for reasons related to their time spent outside of Mexico, according to Israel Concha, founder of the New Comienzos group which support people returning to Mexico.More from Global education Ideas for the Global education series?Get in touch."They have to understand it's an emergency," said Mr Concha, a deportee himself."Tomorrow if thousands of people get deported because there is no immigration reform or there is nothing for DACA, we need to be ready and the federal government is not ready."To be eligible for teaching, all candidates must have their US schooling recognised in Mexico, pass a test in Spanish grammar and Mexican history, and earn a college degree.The scheme intends to break down the barriers returnees face in completing these steps, but there are still discussions about how to achieve this.Mexican dream Not all bilingual deportees have the training required to become a teacher, so the SEP is brainstorming other ways to incorporate Dreamers into English language lessons at public schools, such as through conversation clubs or as teacher's assistants."This call for English teachers is just the first step," said Mr Chavez Campos of the public education ministry."From there, we have a list of the dreamers and deportees who are interested in participating in the national English strategy."Image copyright Reuters Image caption What opportunities are there for those returning to Mexico?He says this is Mexico's "rapid response to the migration policies of the US".Working as an English teacher would mean a new start for many of Mexico's deportees.If selected to be an English teacher for SEP, Ms del Rio would receive much more than the minimum wage with a starting salary of about $1,100 (830) per month, plus benefits and holidays.Unlike working in a call centre, an English teaching position would provide a long-term career."We need more opportunities where we can have a job where we can retire," said Mr Concha."That's what we are looking for: the actual American dream in Mexico.""The Mexican government wants to make Mexico bilingual in 20 years," said Mr Concha."What better place to start than the dreamers that are coming back?"
What will Brexit mean for our bacon?:::::The United Kingdom imports the majority of the pork products we consume, from loins to bacon.With 17 months to go until we are due to leave the European Union, how will Brexit affect our pork?Denmark is the main supplier of the UK's imported pork.There are thousands of pig farms across the country and pork is the Danes' third most valuable export.And it is Jutland which is the heart of Danish pig country.At one farm, Baldershave, 35,000 pigs are born every year.Soren Sondergaard's farm has been in his family for five generations and the UK is one of their biggest markets.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Denmark is the largest overseas supplier of pork products to the UK "We follow it a lot, and we keep an eye on what is happening in the UK at the moment," says Mr Sondergaard."We hope of course we can continue to do trading together, but we have 130 markets all over the world which we will be looking to instead if it will be a hard Brexit."The Danish port trade with the UK started 150 years ago, and now about 25% of all UK imported pork products come from Denmark.What might happen to food exports after Brexit?The single market has meant there are no tariffs on the food we import from this Nordic country.There have been warnings from the meat industry that if the UK adopts world trade tariffs then imported food could be more expensive.Transport Secretary Chris Grayling said earlier this month that the UK would respond by: "Growing more here and buying more from around the world".Image caption Soren Sondergaard hopes that Brexit won't significantly affect Danish pork exports to the UK At the annual conference of the Danish pig industry, there is a positive mood about Denmark's future trading relationship with the UK.Brexit is one of the key issues on the agenda."The ideal situation for us would be that the UK would remain within the European Union, that unfortunately is not going to happen," says Christian Fink Hansen, from the Danish Agriculture and Food Council."So we hope that we will reach an agreement that will be as close as possible to the current situation."Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Rearing pigs is big business in Denmark Mr Hansen adds: "We have high levels of animal welfare, high veterinary standards."The alternatives for you would be to look to Brazil, to Canada, to the US, where they have lower standards of animal welfare."At its facility in the Danish city of Horsens, staff at Danish Crown - the world's largest pork exporter - are preparing pork loin which will be sent to the UK to be cured and made into back bacon."The only thing we know is uncertainty, and the one thing we know we don't like as a business is uncertainty," says Lars Albertsen, head of exports at Danish Crown.Image caption Lars Albertsen hopes that Denmark's close ties with the UK will limit the impact of Brexit on Danish pork exporters "We don't know what the trade agreement with the UK will be, but we know there is a need for imports [in the UK]."And we also think the affinity there is between Denmark and the UK, especially with food, will prevail.We need the UK and the UK needs us as well."The majority of the pork exported from Denmark to the UK travels via Esbjerg on the country's west coast.Daily shipments sail to Immingham in Lincolnshire, and currently there are not any border checks.Authorities at the port of Esbjerg are now closely watching what is happening across the North Sea."The UK is one of our top five export markets for Denmark," says Jesper Bank, the chief operating officer at the port.Image caption Jesper Bank says that Danish ports can cope with any extra Brexit paperwork "The total value of our exports [to the UK] is about 10bn euros ($12bn; 9bn) a year, so obviously we are concerned about what is going to happen [with Brexit]."Mostly our concerns are not about the practicalities of what will happen, we are quite sure that if we get administrative burdens we can sort some of those out with the technology."But some of our concern is what will happen in the UK.Will your economy slow down?Will the buying power of the British people slow down?".British hauliers have warned that the possible introduction of checks for goods coming into the UK could lead to queues at both British and continental ports.Mr Bank says that he and his team are confident about their ability to cope with the possible changes."We are aware that even small delays in times can have effects on ports due to custom clearance," he says."This will obviously create some sort of line in this port we have the capacity to cope with that, but I'm aware that some of our colleagues in the UK will have raised this issue."
How solar-powered suitcases are helping babies in Nepal:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The solar suitcase was the brainchild of obstetrician Dr Laura Stachel and husband Hal Aronson, co-founders of We Care Solar Hari Sunar is a 24 year-old mum whose second child is due in a few days.She walked from her home in the remote Nepalese village Pandavkhani for her final antenatal check up at her local birthing centre through shuddering thunder, a drenching rainstorm and one of the village's frequent power cuts.These power cuts can last up to two weeks and used to cause the birthing centre significant problems.But now it has its own power solution.The light in the birthing centre stays on and she smiles."I am really happy," the young mum says."Because we have a solar light at the birthing centre."That light is powered by a bright yellow suitcase bolted to the delivery room wall.This is a solar suitcase.Image caption Hari Sunar's final antenatal check at Pandavkhani health post in Nepal Connected to a solar panel on the roof, the device is a miniature power station that provides light, heat and battery charging and a baby monitor.Life saving For local midwife, Hima Shirish, the solar suitcase has been a lifesaver.She was determined find a solar solution for her health centre's energy problems.A charity called One-Heart Worldwide sourced the solar suitcase and installed it in Pandavkhani in 2014.Since then there have been no maternal or baby deaths here."Pregnant mothers used to be afraid of the dark when they came to give birth at the health post," Hima says.Image caption Midwife Hima Shirish switches on the solar suitcase to power life-saving medical equipment "They feared losing their babies.But now the fear is gone and they are relieved that they are going to have a baby using the solar light."Off-grid solution The solar suitcase is the brainchild of California-based obstetrician-gynaecologist Dr Laura Stachel of We Care Solar.While in Nigeria in 2008, she witnessed complications and even deaths when babies were delivered at night without reliable light or power.Dr Stachel devised a suitcase-sized, off-grid, solar electric system with her husband, solar engineer, Hal Aronson.The prototype was so successful in Nigeria, they decided to bring the innovation to clinics and health stations in other countries with high rates of maternal and new-born baby mortality.Earthquake challenge In Nepal, the 2015 earthquake destroyed many of its hospitals and left most of the remaining facilities without reliable power.Weighing just 16kg (35lbs) solar suitcases were ideal for deployment over tough terrain.They provided life-saving power to makeshift medical and birthing tents in the immediate aftermath of the quake.The BBC's Innovators series reveals innovative solutions to major challenges across South Asia.Ever heard of the concept of "jugaad"?It's a Hindi term meaning cheap innovation.If you have

able to generate the electricity its people need."There are a lot of maternity or small clinics in rural areas where they have no electricity at all."Up to a third of rural areas have no reliable power, says Raj Kumar Thapa, managing director of Solar Solutions Private Limited.Government schemes to increase small-scale power generation using solar, wind or hydro have had limited success, he says, because it is difficult for private companies to install and maintain systems in remote areas while still making a profit."So as long as the users are provided with proper training on the operation of the system I think there is a bigger role to play for solar energy especially on a charitable basis in Nepal."Before the birthing centre was built in Pandavkhani in 2013, most babies were delivered at home, sometimes by torchlight or in total darkness.Image copyright We Care Solar Image caption The 16kg solar suitcase was light enough to be deployed to remote earthquake zones in Nepal In difficult cases, mothers in labour would be taken on a 65km (40-mile) mountainous trek over mud and rocks to the hospital in the nearest town, Baglung."Some babies were in the wrong position and we did not have the equipment to help them," Hima recalls."Mothers used to die from haemorrhaging."Now Hima and her staff are also able to charge their mobile phones, another vital piece of kit in this remote part of the world."Sometimes the power cuts can last for 15 days," Hima explains."We used to be completely out of contact because we could not charge our mobile phones."Mrs Sunar is just one of 175 mothers who have already given birth at the centre at least once.As she waits to deliver her second child, she is reassured by her experience during the birth of her daughter."When I was in labour

Somalia's 'touch and feel' e-commerce hit:::::Image copyright Innovate Ventures Image caption Muraadso co-founders Abdiqani Ibrahim, Hamse Musa and Saed Mohamed When Saed Mohamed, a young entrepreneur from Somalia, pitched his online shopping business Muraadso as part of an East African start-up competition in 2015, he was prepared for rejection.And rejection is what he got.Abdigani Diriye, head of the Somalia-based accelerator, Innovate Ventures, which oversaw the competition, was not impressed."We had a few applications from e-commerce start-ups and they just weren't really doing it for me," he told the BBC.But Mr Mohamed and his team were not about to give up."We have had a lot of rejections and we have learned to be persistent.We wouldn't take no for an answer," he says.They did eventually get on the programme and ended up winning it."The irony is they went on to become the most successful start-up we took on," joked Mr Diriye.But the business they were pitching - a online store selling mainly electronics - "failed miserably" at first, admits Mr Mohamed.Image copyright Muraadso Image caption Users can see goods before they buy by visiting one of Muraadso's three offline stores It seemed Somalia wasn't ready yet for online only.Perhaps this isn't surprising given that less than a third of its 14 million people are able to access the internet and few have bank accounts.It's an uphill struggle to get any online business off the ground.So he looked to how Western retailers were combining offline and online sales to revive the flagging brand."The hybrid model is the thing right now.Amazon has opened a physical store and Walmart and other traditional retailers are acquiring e-commerce sites," he told the BBC.Muraadso did the same and "sales sky-rocketed," he said.Opening bricks and mortar stores in three different cities meant that potential buyers could go and touch the goods first before committing to buying them.The site offers traditional home deliveries and flexible ways to pay, including cash on delivery.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Amazon opened a physical bookstore in Seattle in November, 2015 Many purchase are made via mobile money transfer service, Zaad, which operates in a similar way to Kenya's famous M-Pesa platform.Zaad has an 80% market share in Somalia, charging no fees to send or withdraw money, but making its money instead from offering extra services and mobile airtime."The hybrid model wasn't a concept that I was familiar with, but Muraadso started implementing it late last year and they have been growing ever since, going from a three-man team to employing dozens and looking to raise another round of funding," says Mr Diriye.E-commerce in Somalia is nascent, and across Africa generally, online shopping remains niche, says Matthew Reed, a consultant at research firm Ovum."Many people are still living on desperately low incomes, so e-commerce is really just for the middle classes.And there are other big challenges for e-commerce firms, not just in Somalia," he says.Image copyright AFP/Getty Images Image caption Terrorism, drought and famine have hampered Somalia's technological progress Chief among them is lack of infrastructure - both decent roads that enable quick and efficient deliveries, and the telecoms infrastructure that allows people to access the platforms in the first place.But things are changing.Millions in Africa have bypassed traditional telephone landlines and leapt straight to mobile - the oft-quoted "leapfrog" effect.According to mobile body the GSMA, there will be 725 million unique mobile subscribers on the continent by 2020.And Somalia is benefiting from this improved connectivity.In 2013, fibre optic firm Liquid Telecom connected the East African country to its network of cables, which now spreads 50,000km (31,000 miles) across 11 other African countries."There is increasing connectivity, mobile is increasingly widely available, and more of that is data-enabled with the increase of 3G and 4G networks," says Mr Reed.More Technology of Business Image copyright Getty Images "Devices are also becoming more affordable."Changing social and cultural patterns of behaviour, an increasingly youthful population, and urbanisation, mean the stage is set for e-commerce to thrive, he believes.According to Mr Mohamed, Facebook is "huge" in Somalia among younger people, so Muraadso is aggressively exploiting the platform to market its products, gaining 25,000 likes along the way.It aims to have 100,000 by the end of the year.Perhaps unsurprisingly, South Africa has the most mature e-commerce market in Africa, with others such as Kenya and Nigeria gaining user quickly.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Jumia delivers goods via scooter and offers a variety of payment options Online retailer Jumia is in all three countries and, while it offers a very similar set of services to global market leader Amazon, there is one crucial difference."They realised that they couldn't just copy-and-paste the approach and methodology of Amazon because of factors such as infrastructure, access to couriers and cultural preferences," explains Dr Diriye.So Jumia pioneered the idea of letting customers see the goods before they paid for them.Safari.com, Kenya's leading communications firm, recently announced that it would be launching its own online shopping offering by the end of the year and it plans to expand that service beyond Kenya.Muraadso is still small - its turnover is at around $40,000 (30,000) a month - but already it has a rival - Samionline - and Dr Diriye predicts more will follow."Every day another one pops up in Somalia as the digital wave starts to flow," he says."People are getting online, becoming more tech-savvy and the cost of owning a smartphone is falling."The benefits to the people of Somalia go beyond access to better quality goods and more choice, he adds."It also saves them time as they don't have to travel to town, and it saves them money because they don't have to pay for a bus."People are more productive with their time, and when you multiply that to a whole city or country, the impact can be very significant."
Countdown to Brexit: How to divide food sold to the EU:::::Image copyright Getty Images Here's a Brexit recipe: lamb with grapes and lemon.I haven't tried it, but the recipe does exist and it looks delicious in the pictures I've seen.It also gives us the ingredients for looking at one of the food issues that comes up as the UK prepares to leave the European Union.All of them are covered by a trade arrangement that most people have spent their lives blissfully unaware of.It goes by the name of "tariff rate quotas".Now what on Earth does that mean?When countries import goods, including foods, they often impose a tariff, a tax that is applied only to traded goods.The UK does not currently have its own national tariffs.They are set by the EU for all member nations.Countries and blocs of countries such as the EU, that are members of the World Trade Organization, have made commitments to the others that the tariffs will not exceed certain levels.Many countries have agreed to import a certain quantity of some goods at a lower or even zero tariff, as a negotiated compromise between the interests of: overseas exporters domestic producers concerned about exposure to foreign competition consumers That quantity of goods that gets in on the lower tax rate is called a tariff rate quota.It is a bread and butter dish on the trade negotiating menu, routine enough to have its own acronym, which is TRQ.TRQs are often used for farm products.The EU has about 100, negotiated at the WTO on behalf of all member states, which currently have an impact on the UK.All three of our ingredients have a TRQ for imports into the EU.Image copyright Getty Images In the case of lamb, 280,340 tonnes a year can be imported at a reduced tariff.There's a quota for table grapes of 1,500 tonnes, and for lemons it's 10,000 tonnes.So how does Brexit come into this picture?The UK and the remainder of the EU have to work out how to divide the existing TRQs.The EU doesn't want to take the existing TRQs for the 28 states and use them for the remaining 27, because each EU country may end up importing more food on the low tariffs, therefore creating tougher competition for EU farmers.Image copyright Getty Images Unlike on many other Brexit issues the UK and the EU actually agreed, and told the other WTO members, in a letter, that they wanted to divide the TRQs in line with recent trade flows.That would mean, for example, the UK taking a large share of the quota for lamb because comparatively the UK has been importing more lamb than the other EU countries.But the proposal was met with a raspberry by several countries, including the United States, Canada and New Zealand.Although the UK-EU proposal would give the same total TRQs as today, they would lose flexibility.As things stand, if the price of lamb fell in the UK, they could divert some or all of it to other parts of the EU.After Brexit, that would not be possible.Image copyright Getty Images The other WTO countries feel they should be compensated with a higher combined TRQ in order to maintain the same commercial benefit they currently enjoy.In other words, they see Brexit as an opportunity to negotiate better access for their goods to Europe.There is another option.In some cases, the UK could decide to remove the tariffs altogether.Now, some economists think we should do that anyway with all tariffs, that Brexit is a glorious opportunity for unilateral free trade.This seems politically unlikely for products where there are UK producers.In our recipe, lamb is a case in point.Unrestricted tariff free access for lamb from anywhere in the world would be a problem for many British lamb producers.With lemons, that is not an issue.We are not citrus producers.There are British table grapes.It's not a big industry, but it is a new one so that might need some consultation with producer and consumer groups too.There's another complication: cross-Channel trade.British farmers can now automatically sell, for example, their lamb to France tariff free.The same applies to French cheese sold in the UK.Depending on what sort of deal there is, that might not be true after Brexit.So will the UK and the EU get some share of each other's TRQs?That's another thing to be negotiated.Read more from Reality Check Follow us on Twitter
Managing the managers: The rise of the business 'philosopher-kings':::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Are the new ideas and approaches pioneered by management consultants worth their fees?The place: a textile plant near Mumbai, India.The time: 2008.The scene?Chaos.Rubbish is piled up outside the building - with almost as much inside.There are piles of flammable junk, and open chemical containers.The yarn is at least bundled up in white plastic bags, but the inventory is scattered around the plant in unmarked piles.Such shambolic conditions are typical in the Indian textile industry, and that presents an opportunity.A team of researchers from Stanford University and the World Bank is conducting a novel experiment.They're going to send in a team of management consultants to tidy up some of these companies - but not others.Then they'll track what happens to their profits as part of a rigorous, randomised controlled trial.It will tell us conclusively whether the management consultants are worth their fees.50 Things That Made the Modern Economy highlights the inventions, ideas and innovations which have helped create the economic world in which we live.It is broadcast on the BBC World Service.You can find more information about the programme's sources and listen online or subscribe to the programme podcast.That question has often been raised over the years.If managers often have bad reputations, what should we make of the people who tell managers how to manage?Picture a management consultant.What comes to mind?A young, sharp-suited graduate, earnestly gesturing to a bulleted PowerPoint presentation that reads something like "holistically envisioneer client-centric deliverables"?Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Some management consultants are criticised for their reliance on business jargon Okay, I got that from an online random buzzword generator.But you get the idea.The industry battles a stereotype of charging exorbitant fees for advice that, on close inspection, turns out to be either meaningless or common sense.Managers who bring in consultants are often accused of being blinded by jargon, implicitly admitting their own incompetence, or seeking someone else to blame for unpopular decisions.Still, it's big business.The year after Stanford and the World Bank started their Indian study, the UK government alone spent well over $2bn (1.5bn) on management consultants.Globally, consulting firms charge their clients a total of about $125bn (94bn).'Noble' origins Where did this strange industry begin?There's a noble way to frame its origins: economic change creates a new challenge, and visionary men of business provide a solution.In the late 19th century the US economy was expanding fast, and thanks to the railway and telegraph it was also becoming more of a national market and less a collection of local ones.Company owners began to realise that there were huge rewards to be had for companies that could bestride this new national stage.So began an unprecedented wave of mergers and consolidations.Image copyright Alamy Image caption Heinz, which dates back to 1869, grew substantially at the beginning of the 20th century Companies swallowed each other up, creating giant household names: US Steel, General Electric, Heinz, AT&T.Some employed more than 100,000 people.And that was the challenge: nobody had ever tried to manage such vast organisations before.Enter a young professor of accountancy by the name of James McKinsey.His breakthrough was a book published in 1922, with the not-entirely-thrilling title Budgetary Control.Accounting for the future But for corporate America, Budgetary Control was revolutionary.Rather than using traditional historical accounts to provide a picture of how a business had been doing over the past year, McKinsey proposed drawing up accounts for an imaginary corporate future.These future accounts would set out a business's plans and goals, broken down department by department.And later, when the actual accounts were drawn up they could be compared to the plan, which could then be revised.McKinsey's method helped managers take control, setting out a vision for the future rather than simply reviewing the past.Image copyright McKinsey & Company Image caption James McKinsey saw the potential of setting out a corporate vision of the future McKinsey was a big character - tall, and fond of chomping cigars, ignoring his doctor's advice.His ideas caught on with remarkable speed: by the mid-1930s he was hiring himself out at $500 (380) a day - about $25,000 (19,000) in today's money.And as his own time was limited, he took on employees.If he didn't like a report they wrote, he'd hurl it in the bin."I have to be diplomatic with our clients," he told them."But I don't have to be diplomatic with you bastards!"Aged just 48, James McKinsey died of pneumonia.But under his lieutenant, Marvin Bower, McKinsey & Company thrived.Bower was a particular man.He insisted that employees wore a dark suit, a starched white shirt, and, until the 1960s, a hat.McKinsey & Co, he said, was not a business but a "practice".It didn't take on jobs, but "engagements".It was not a company, but a "firm".Eventually it simply became known as "The Firm".'Business philosopher-kings' Duff McDonald wrote a history of The Firm, arguing that its advocacy of scientific approaches to management transformed the business world.It acquired a reputation as perhaps the world's most elite employer.The New Yorker once described McKinsey's young Ivy League hires parachuting into companies around the world as a "Swat team of business philosopher-kings".But hold on.Why don't company owners simply employ managers who've studied those scientific approaches themselves?There aren't many situations where you'd hire someone to do a job, and also hire expensive consultants to advise them how to do it.What accounts for why companies like McKinsey gained such a foothold in the economy?Part of the explanation is surprising: government regulation.The Glass-Steagall act of 1933 was a far-reaching piece of American financial legislation.Image copyright Alamy Image caption The Glass-Steagall act - signed by Franklin Roosevelt in June 1933 - was meant to limit conflicts of interest Among many provisions, Glass-Steagall made it compulsory for investment banks to commission independent financial research into the deals they were brokering.Fearing conflicts of interest, Glass-Steagall forbade law firms, accountancy businesses and the banks themselves from conducting this work.Effectively, the act made it a legal requirement for banks to hire management consultants.In 1956 the Justice Department banned the emerging computer giant IBM from providing advice about how to install or use computers.Another business opportunity for the management consultants.More from Tim Harford: How market research revolutionised advertising and shopping How a creative legal leap helped create vast wealth How much wealth is hidden offshore?The great intellectual property trade-off Minimising conflicts of interest was a noble aim, but it hasn't always worked out well.Some time after McKinsey's long-serving boss, Rajat Gupta, left the firm, he managed to get himself convicted and imprisoned for insider trading.McKinsey also employed Enron's Jeff Skilling, and then was paid for advising him, before quietly fading into the background while Enron collapsed and Skilling went to jail.Here's another argument for employing management consultants: ideas on management evolve all the time, so maybe it's worth getting outsiders in periodically for a burst of fresh thinking.'Land and expand' But often it doesn't work like that: the consultants continually find new problems to justify their continued employment.Some use the analogy of leeches, attaching themselves and never letting go.It's a strategy known as "land and expand".One UK government ministry recently admitted that 80% of its supposedly temporary consultants had been working there for more than a year - some for up to nine years.Needless to say, it would have been much cheaper to employ them as civil servants.No doubt the consultancy firms will claim that their expertise is giving the taxpayer value for money.Which brings us back to India, and that randomised controlled trial.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Management consultants saw an opportunity in the often shambolic Indian textile industry The World Bank hired a global consulting firm to put some structure into these jumbled Mumbai textile factories, instituting preventive maintenance, proper records, systematic storing of spares and inventory, and the recording of quality defects.It worked.Productivity jumped by 17% - easily enough to pay the consulting fees.We shouldn't conclude from this study that cynicism about management consulting is always misplaced.These factories were, after all, what a jargon-filled PowerPoint presentation might call "low-hanging fruit".But it's scientific proof of one thing, at least.As so often in life, when an idea is used simply, and humbly, it can pay dividends.Tim Harford writes the Financial Times's Undercover Economist column.50 Things That Made the Modern Economy is broadcast on the BBC World Service.You can find more information about the programme's sources and listen online or subscribe to the programme podcast.
The woman who won the lottery and used it to do good:::::Image copyright AFP Image caption Rachel Lapierre set up Le Book Humanitaire after winning the lottery What would you do if you won the lottery?Buy a new house, a sports car, or travel the world perhaps?But how many of us would use our winnings to set up a charity?That is exactly what Rachel Lapierre, a former Miss Quebec, did back in 2013.The Canadian always loved volunteering, and after running her own modelling agency and working as a nurse, she was looking for a way to follow her idol, Mother Teresa, and dedicate her life to charity.Then fate came knocking when she won a lifetime salary of C$1,000 (605) a week in the Quebecois lottery "Gagnant vie", or "winner for life".Image copyright Andreane Williams Image caption Ms Lapierre meets a family of Congolese refugees living in Quebec "At first I couldn't believe it, but I didn't celebrate or shout it from the rooftop because I had made a promise to the universe and I was determined to keep it."I wanted to do something I loved for the rest of my life.I wanted to help others," she says.It took Ms Lapierre only two months to quit her nursing job and launch her own charity, Le Book Humanitaire.Her non-profit organisation, which is located in Saint-Jerome, about 60km north west of Montreal, uses social media to connect those in need with people who can help.Image copyright Rachel Lapierre Image caption Ms Lapierre became Miss Quebec in 1982 On its Facebook page, which has 22,000 followers, those who are struggling can let the community know about their plight.At the same time, members of the public can advertise services or goods they want to donate."Let's say that you have clothes to give away.We will put you in contact with a family that needs those clothes and will allow you to go give them yourself," Ms Lapierre explains."It's not only about material things.You might end up driving a cancer patient to a doctor's appointment."It's a far cry from Ms Lapierre's former career in the more glamorous, and some might argue consumerist, world of modelling.More The Boss features, which every week profile a different business leader from around the world: In the early 1980s she joined a local modelling school where she was encouraged to enter the Miss Quebec beauty pageant.To her surprise, the then-21-year-old won the contest."I thought modelling was for tall blondes with blue eyes and I was short and brunette...But I am so glad I entered, it was a great experience."The following year she toured Canada as Miss Quebec and even got to meet Rene Levesque, the then-premier of Quebec.Image copyright Andreane Williams Image caption Ms Lapierre meets with a family of Syrian refugees in Saint-Jerome It inspired her to set up her own modelling school in 1984, to teach young women how to build careers in the industry.It had about 10 staff."Running my own business taught me about accounting and how to manage employees," Ms Lapierre says.She closed the business in the late 1980s to focus on bringing up her four children, but also dedicated herself to voluntary work - making numerous trips with humanitarian organisations to places like India and Haiti.It was this passion that led her to set up Le Book Humanitaire four years ago.This year, the charity has made 15,000 "direct actions" in Quebec, ranging from furnishing an apartment for a family of Syrian refugees, to finding a home for a homeless mother who had just given birth.Image copyright Andreane Williams Image caption The charity donates food to those in need She has also funded the organisation - which has 10 full-time volunteers and its own board - entirely by herself, investing $70,000 to date."This weekly C$1,000 I get from the lottery allows me to not go to work anymore and finance my organisation," she says."I pay for things such as our office rent and other administrative costs."There are limits to Ms Lapierre's budget, though.After she was interviewed by a popular Quebecois television station earlier this year, Le Book Humanitaire saw a huge increase in its Facebook followers, from around 4,000 to more than 20,000.It led to an influx of requests for help, as well as donations, and the charity has struggled to keep up.Image copyright Andreane Williams Image caption A volunteer, Ms Lapierre and her sister Guylaine discussing strategy at the charity's offices It needs to open several new facilities to store donated items, but Ms Lapierre can't afford to do this alone."We are counting on municipalities to lend us offices and make donations," she says."But there are always ways to make things work."Growing pains Jean-Pierre Tchang, the founder of IRIS Mundial, a non-profit group that works to improve visual health in developing countries, says that building a successful charity is not easy."The main difficulty is money and getting funding," says Mr Tchang, who worked with Ms Lapierre earlier in her volunteering career."You also have to know your limits.You can start feeling overwhelmed by all the work and forget oneself...I am sure Rachel's nights must be very short."Despite the challenges, Ms Lapierre shows no sign of slowing down.She is also taking a workshop class on managing non-profit organisations to get better at what she does.She continues to get joy from her work, which, she says "is nothing like running a regular business" and instead "feeds her soul"."Volunteering work represents billions of unrecorded dollars across the world.Without it, the world would not function."
How Facebook saved a dying mill town:::::Image copyright Alan Brandt A mill town with high unemployment has seen its fortunes changed by Facebook's need for data servers.But will the town have to radically change to save itself?The people of Prineville live deep in a valley surrounded by dense forests.In the 1800s, it was the first place in central Oregon where white settlers drove out Native Americans to start a city.Steve Forrester's grandparents got here in 1902.When he was growing up in the 1970s, Prineville felt idyllic."It was a magical, magical place to grow up," he remembers."My dad worked in the sawmill industry as an electrician; my mom didn't work.We all learned to hunt and shoot a gun."We all learned how to drive in the forest before we were 16.In the spring, we could snow-ski in the morning and water-ski in the afternoon."And everybody had a job, and everyone did well."Prineville was the largest producer of ponderosa pine in the world.But when the federal government restricted logging and increased protections for animals like the spotted owl, the city's milling industry was decimated.As an adult, Forrester took a job with one of the few remaining mills, because he wanted to live in Prineville.Eric Klann was driven by the same devotion.He's the seventh generation of his family to live here.Out of college, he also took a job in Prineville that he knew wouldn't last."There was always a little voice in the back of my head saying, 'What are you doing - you want to be here, but you're in a dying industry,'" he says.A few years later, the US housing bubble burst and demand declined for parts made by the last mills.Lots of people lost jobs and left.It felt like Prineville couldn't catch a break.Image copyright Alan Brandt Image caption One of Prineville's new kind of "factory" - a data server farm Both Forrester and Klann felt lucky to land jobs at the city - Forrester as city manager, Klann as city engineer.Their chance to save Prineville arrived in 2009 in the form of a mysterious email from a company called Vitesse."For the longest time, we had no idea what Vitesse meant," he says.All Klann knew is that Prineville's natural resources made it perfect for a new industry - the information industry, created to save the massive amounts of information people post on the web.Vitesse wanted to build a big warehouse and fill it with rows and rows of servers - servers that tend to get hot.Central Oregon's cold nights could cool them naturally.Klann remembers the first in-person meeting with Vitesse, and how it felt like Prineville's last chance."Right before I walked into our conference room to meet with their nine lawyers, I got an email and our unemployment rate had peaked at 23%," Klann says."I got that email and I walked into that room, and I kept thinking, 'I better not screw this up.'"Klann and Forrester decided to outperform the other cities Vitesse was considering.They showed the company their small town could move at big-city speed, by responding to Vitesse's questions day and night."What we heard back is that other cities weren't doing that," Forrester says.Their strategy worked, and in 2010, Prineville finally learned who Vitesse actually was."They had the big finger with a thumb-up Facebook sign, and we all pressed the button and it lit up, et cetera," Mayor Betty Roppe says, recounting the new data centre's groundbreaking."That was the big announcement - it was Facebook."It was Facebook's first data centre of its own.Mark Zuckerberg was there, and Roppe had planned to give him a cowboy hat to show the city's pride in its cowboy culture."Cowboy hats are not cheap.They said, 'Do not get Mark Zuckerberg a cowboy hat.He does not want a cowboy hat.'OK.So, I got him a hoodie.He wears hoodies all the time," she says.When she presented the gift, Roppe gave Facebook's founder a kiss on the cheek."He just blushed like he wanted to have the floor open up and swallow him."Image copyright Rupa Shenoy Image caption Mayor Betty Roppe oversaw Prineville's transformation after data centres were built in the city Seven years later, Facebook has two more data centres in Prineville and six others across the world.Apple's moved into Prineville, too - it's built three data centres here.All of them sit high above Prineville's valley, in huge, long, flat buildings painted pale blue and grey so they blend in with the sky.About 500 employees work in the centres, most of them from Prineville.Security's tight, so few other people ever see inside.Despite their low profile, the data centres have had a profound impact.Roppe says the mills taught Prineville a lesson - not to rely on just one industry.So they're putting in things that appeal to lots of employers - like good roads, walking and biking paths, modern wastewater treatment, a new hospital and a state college outpost.But now that the city's successful, officials have a lot more to think about.Like, how do you slow success down?"We can keep the small-town feel.I'm sure of it," Roppe says."We don't want to be a big city."The cost of housing is up, so city officials know they have to build more affordable housing.And Mayor Roppe's own granddaughter, with a college degree, can't find a living wage job.So, they have to keep bringing in new employers.All city manager Forrester can do is calibrate the development carefully.He worries about Prineville changing too much, too."We are small-town people.We live the Western lifestyle," Forrester says."The quiet and peace of central Oregon is a beautiful, beautiful thing, and to be able to make a living here is tremendous."But Forrester says he's seen that central Oregon towns that don't adapt will die.And he knows they have to risk changing Prineville in order to save it.The World is a co-production of the BBC World Service, PRI and WGBH.This piece is part of the series 50 States: America's place in a shrinking world.
Are too many tourists visiting Iceland?:::::Image copyright Getty Images An explosion in tourism saved Iceland's economy.But in a country of just 300,000 people, how much tourism is too much?It's a cold, overcast and blustery day in Iceland, but that hasn't put off the busloads of tourists at the Blue Lagoon - one of the country's most popular attractions.The lagoon is a pool of geothermally heated water.It is rich in minerals and is said to be good for your skin.Its creation is something of an accident.Locals noticed the run-off from a local geothermal power plant was a strange shade of blue and started bathing in it.Located between Reykjavik and the airport, it's now become a "must-do"' on tourist itineraries."In our first year in 1994 we had about 50,000 guests, and this year we will be welcoming 1.3 million," says Grimur Smundsen, the Blue Lagoon's chief executive.That success reflects the astonishing growth of tourism in Iceland as a whole.Last year 1.7 million people visited Iceland - more than triple the number that came in 2010, when the small island nation of just 330,000 was still reeling from a catastrophic banking crisis and the eruption of Eyjafjallajkull - a volcano that grounded air traffic across Europe for a week.Image caption This year 1.3 million tourists will visit the Blue Lagoon, says Grimur Smundsen At the time the eruption was seen as a disaster for tourism, but that pessimism proved ill-founded."In the long term it had a tremendous positive effect because Eyjafjallajkull was one of the things that put Iceland on the map."Mr Smundsen says."Maybe tourists heard of Iceland for the first time in the various airports when they were stranded."The sudden interest from travellers could not have come at a better time.When Iceland's three major banks collapsed in 2008 at the height of the financial crisis, there were fears they would take the rest of the economy with them.Nine years later the economy is growing at more than 7% a year, unemployment is less than 3% and foreign currency is rolling in.The tourism boom is leading to a construction boom and the creation of tens of thousands of jobs."Tourism really helped us take off," says Gylfi Magnusson, a professor at University of Iceland and a former minister for economic affairs after the banking crisis."Certainly the recovery would have taken considerably longer if it hadn't been for this unexpected boom."But the sudden influx of foreign visitors has not come without problems.Some sites lack the infrastructure to cope with the rising numbers.Image caption "We don't have any neighbours anymore," says Reykjavik resident Benony Aegesson In summer Reykjavik's restaurants are filled to capacity.There is a shortage of hotel rooms, meaning that AirBnB has flourished, and Reykjavik's main shopping streets have been turned into a stream of tourist shops selling Icelandic wool jumpers and soft toy puffins."We don't have any neighbours anymore," says Benony Aegesson, who has lived in downtown Reykjavik since the 1970s.He says virtually all the flats around his home are now rented out to tourists."It was very fashionable for young people to live here, but the prices are getting so high that the young people can't afford it anymore."Speculators have come here and bought up apartments and stores and we're worried about its future as a residential area.If it's only old people and tourists here, there is a danger it will die."Is there a limit to the number of tourists a small nation like Iceland can accommodate?Inga Hln Plsdttir is the director of Visit Iceland, and has been in charge of promoting Iceland as a tourist destination for the past decade.She says the question is a difficult one to answer.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Areas outside the capital Reykjavik are looking for more travellers to come and visit, says Inga Hln Plsdttir "If you said there would be five million people coming to Iceland in five years and you told me they would all be coming to Reykjavik, i would really worry," she tells me."But we've been putting the focus on the other regions of Iceland.If you get numbers like that spreading around Iceland, visiting other communities then you have a completely different scenario."At this point I don't think we have an overflow - if you talk to someone just outside Reykjavik they're complaining that they want more travellers to come and visit them."I asked long-time Reykjavik resident Benony Aegesson if he would ask people not to come to Iceland on holiday."No, I wouldn't do that," he says: "We're not against tourists per se, but nobody wants to come to a ghost city.Of course they saved us from our financial crisis - that we are grateful for."
The flying drones that can scan packages night and day:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Pinc's flying drone scans warehouse packages Flying drones and robots now patrol distribution warehouses - they've become workhorses of the e-commerce era online that retailers can't do without.It is driving down costs but it is also putting people out of work: what price progress?It could be a scene from Blade Runner 2049; the flying drone hovers in the warehouse aisle, its spinning rotors filling the cavernous space with a buzzing whine.It edges close to the packages stacked on the shelf and scans them using onboard optical sensors, before whizzing off to its next assignment.But this is no sci-fi film, it's a warehouse in the US - one of around 250,000 throughout the country, many gargantuan in size: retail giant Walmart's smallest warehouse, for example, is larger than 17 football fields put together.And these automated drones are now doing the jobs humans - on foot, or operating fork-lift trucks and mechanical lifts - used to do: and they're doing them more cheaply and more accurately."Every year companies lose billions of dollars due to misplaced items and faulty inventory records in their warehouses," says Fadel Adib, an assistant professor of media, arts and sciences at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.Image copyright Hardis Group Image caption Hardis Group's EyeSee drone can fly autonomously "Today's inventory management requires workers to scan items manually, which is a very time consuming and error-prone process.It's impossible to keep track of all items in the warehouse."Two drones can do the work of 100 humans over the same time period, according to supply chain specialist, Argon Consulting.This means they can do several tours of a warehouse - even at night - compare results, identify discrepancies, and build up a much more accurate picture much more quickly.Drone makers claim scanning accuracy of close to 100%.Matt Yearling, chief executive of Pinc, one of the firms offering such aerial robots, says they can save warehousing and logistics companies millions of dollars."Nobody has 100% accuracy - including Walmart and Amazon," he says."For a warehouse that is 95% accurate, it means that 5% is ambiguous.So if the warehouse is storing $100m [75m] worth of inventory, then $5m is uncertain."Typically the retailer will have more than one warehouse.So, if you multiply the problem across the warehouse network you are talking big dollars."Pinc's drones use hydrogen fuel cells, enabling them to fly for up to two hours - four times as long as some battery-powered drones.More Technology of Business Image copyright Getty Images French firm Hardis Group has also launched an inventory-scanning drone - EyeSee - and emphasises how autonomous it is."Flight orders and flight plan execution are ensured by our Android application," says Stephane Cadenet, manager of the firm's drone programme."Our solution is simple to use: no installation, no infrastructure adaptation and no driver.The only thing to do is unpack the drone.The calculation of the flight plan is automatic."Other companies, such as Infinium Robotics, have also developed drone scanning systems.Of course, retailers have been using robots and automated systems in warehouses for some years.In 2012, fashion brand Net-A-Porter said its robot pickers were already 500% faster than humans, while online retailer Amazon's Kiva robots have almost become famous.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Instead of humans walking miles to pick goods, these robots take the shelves to the pickers "Innovators are working to make drones and robots an integral part of warehousing, inventory, and logistics," says JP Gownder, a principal analyst at research firm Forrester."Over the next 10 years, these technologies look set to revolutionise these spaces."But all this cost saving and efficiency comes at the expense of jobs for humans.The $2.3tn e-commerce industry is huge and growing, but almost 75% of e-commerce companies employ no more than four people.So it is no coincidence that in the US some 89,000 shop workers were laid off between October and April this year, while employment in New York City clothing stores has declined for three consecutive years.Forrester estimates that automation technologies, including artificial intelligence, will replace 17% of US jobs by 2027.And growth in new types of employment will not be enough to compensate."Automation does create opportunities for new jobs - equivalent to 10% of today's jobs," says Mr Gownder."But that still leads to a net 7% loss of jobs due to automation, which has to be made up by macro-economic growth, non-automation related jobs, and monetary policy."Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The Ocado warehouse run by robots Ryan Bax, industry analyst for mobility at research consultancy Frost & Sullivan, concedes that the use of drones and robotics in warehousing will lead to job losses, but believes growth elsewhere will compensate for this."As automation reduces the demand for lesser qualified jobs, the need for specialised skills within the logistics sector will grow," he maintains.And he thinks automation tech may even become mandatory once it has been shown to reduce accidents in the workplace."The use of automated technologies will permit warehouses to operate 24-hour days and improve stock management accuracy, but beyond this they will provide significant benefits to safety within the workplace."This will be small comfort for the thousands of warehouse workers displaced by drones and robots, but it is the inevitable consequence of our desire for online convenience, cheaper prices and faster deliveries.
What's behind the rise of Asia's stock markets:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Analysts believe the strong appetite for Asian stocks can continue Memory chips and China's economic muscle are among the factors that have put a rocket under Asian stocks this year, pushing markets to record or multi-year highs."Everyone hated Asia markets for a long time," says Josh Crabb, head of Asian equities at Old Mutual Global Investors."Now we've moved on from there".Moved on indeed: South Korea's Kospi sits at a record; Japan's Nikkei 225 index is above a two-decade high; Hong Kong's Hang Seng is around a 10-year peak, while markets in India, Taiwan and Indonesia are among the others scaling fresh heights.It's an unusual moment for equities in the region as strong corporate profits, economic stimulus and growth are overshadowing nearby political risks."Markets seem impervious to events," says CMC Markets analyst Michael McCarthy."Sabre-rattling from North Korea barely makes a dent".And some analysts argue that as long as US markets keep their cool, there's plenty of good times for investors in Asia still to come.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Many markets in Asia are trading at historic or multi-year highs Since the 2009 crash, global markets have been moving steadily higher - with a few stumbles en route.Regional growth Massive liquidity coupled with ultra-low interest rates has created a fertile environment for stocks to thrive.Asia has enjoyed a tailwind from record gains on Wall Street.At the same time, China's economy - aiming for 6.5% growth this year - has been underpinning the broader region for some time.The world's second largest economy has a big impact on the fortunes of other countries, even as its growth rate moderates.Take South Korea: It's seen double-digit export growth for the last 11 months, thanks largely to China, which buys about one-quarter of its products sold offshore."China's improving economic conditions can really be seen as a trigger for the equity run in Asia," says IG Markets analyst Jingyi Pan.Image copyright AFP Image caption Asia is home to two of the world's three largest economies, China and Japan Japan's economy is also gathering steam.Exports are climbing and strong domestic spending on devices like cameras and computers from China is driving growth.Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's re-election, and the likely continuation of his Abenomics policies, was met with cheers from investors.Ed Rogers, chief executive of Rogers Investment Advisors in Japan believes the benchmark Nikkei index can track even higher."Japan has a long way to go.There's $18tn in cash on the sidelines," he says, adding that most of that money is currently invested in low-yielding Japanese government bonds."There's a similar boat load of money that wants to get out of China," Mr Rogers says.Earnings bump That money could find plenty of homes in Asia where equities are cheap relative to other parts of the world.Companies in the region are strengthening, and well-received results this earnings season have given markets a boost.For South Korean firms, the outlook is even brighter.CLSA analyst Paul Choi says at the beginning of 2017, people were expecting 10% corporate earnings growth, now that forecast is around 50%.It's got a lot to do with memory chips.Higher prices for chips used in electronic devices have spurred index heavyweights like Samsung and SK Hynix, as well as the broader market.In fact, Mr Choi says that fluctuations in the value of memory chips is more threatening to South Korea's market than provocations from its northern neighbour.Which brings us back to North Korea.Image copyright AFP Image caption North Korea insists it needs a nuclear-weapons programme to ensure its survival Investors appear largely unshaken by displays of military aggression - missile tests and provocations against Japan - and analysts say markets have factored in the risk.Rogers Investment Advisors Mr Rogers describes the North Korea threat as "kind of overblown".That attitude will shift dramatically if threats turn to action.Until then, other risks to the Asian rally loom larger.'Unknown' threat Turning off the stimulus tap and the ratcheting up of interest rates will dampen enthusiasm, while analysts point to China's ballooning debt as another threat to the region.Mr Rogers says political risk and "unpredictability" hang over Asian markets and unexpected moves could stunt recent rallies.The threat of the "unknown" is a familiar refrain from market-watchers in the region."The most damaging risks are the ones we don't forecast," says CMC Markets' Mr McCarthy.A final recurring note of caution is the rush on Wall Street.Recent gains have been inspired by strong earnings, along with hopes of tax reform and business friendly policies under President Trump.But the chorus of concern about the market's sharp rise is growing on Wall Street.History shows a gradual climb-down from the record highs on US markets is unlikely, and a collapse could shock the world."If the US blows up, most things will come off.[Asia] won't be immune," says Josh Crabb of Old Mutual Global Investors."Markets tend to get euphoric and then they get fearful.Theoretically you shouldn't have boom and bust, but human behaviour drives stock markets more than logic."
The US and Iranian battle over the pistachio nut trade:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Relations between the US and Iran have an outsized impact on the global trade in pistachios There are lots of casualties in international conflicts but this one is nuts, you might say - although strictly speaking the pistachio is a seed.The international pistachio trade has faced unexpected headwinds due to the tensions between Iran and the US.The global pistachio industry is a multi-billion dollar a year sector that is continuing to grow in value as its popularity as a foodstuff grows.The US and Iran dominate the world's trade in pistachios - collectively controlling between 70% and 80% of yearly output for the last decade.Over the last forty years, Iran's growers have faced pressures from sanctions, tariffs and restrictions on their ability to access international financial tools.Although pistachios themselves were not on the list of sanctioned products, restrictions on global banking made trade difficult for Iranian farmers.All that changed in 2016 following the Iran nuclear deal, officially The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA).This agreement with the US and its allies removed sanctions.It wasn't just Iranian oil that came flowing back onto the international market, pistachio exports began gaining overseas markets.Trump's threat That progress could face challenges though.US President Donald Trump called the agreement created under his predecessor the "worst" deal the US has ever made.In October he decertified the agreement.The move passes responsibility to the US Congress to evaluate and determine whether it believes Iran is compliant with the terms and if the US should remain in the deal.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Over 90% of US pistachios are grown in California President Trump said in the speech announcing his decision that the agreement "threw Iran's dictatorship a political and economic lifeline," but had failed to prevent Iran's "sprint" towards nuclear weapon development.For Iran's pistachio industry the threat of losing the deal and reinstating sanctions could mean the return of what Hojat Hassani Sadi, deputy director of the Iran Pistachio Association calls "unfair and unequal competition".Ancient roots The pistachio industry in Iran dates back thousands of years.By contrast, pistachio farming in the US started in the 1930s with Persian seeds.The boom in commercial pistachio cultivation came after the US severed ties with Iran following the 1979 hostage crisis, after which the US and its allies placed sanctions on Iran.Over the next several decades, even in countries where Iranian pistachios were welcomed, restrictions on its companies' ability to access international financing made it hard for the industry to flourish.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Archaeological evidence suggests pistachios were first grown in what is now Iraq in 7,000BC During that time the US market expanded, with farmers - mainly across California - planting the crop.But in 2014. hot and dry weather conditions across the western US cost the industry nearly half its crop and cut profits for 2015 - the year those nuts were sold - by close to $1.4bn (1bn).Globally, pistachio prices rose, but for Iran's growers it was also an opportunity.Price competition The price of pistachios has been on the rise since 2002.Richard Matoian, executive director of the American Pistachio Growers (APG) trade association, attributes this to increased awareness of their health properties and global demand for healthy snacks."The industry has been pushing the products with advertising," he says, adding that middle-class demand in developing markets has also boosted exports.Global Trade More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade: Increased demand in China has been key to sector growth.Between 2008 and 2013 Chinese imports of US pistachios rose 146% according to APG.But the 2014 drought saw the price of California's nuts rocket from $3/lb (453g) to over $5/lb.By contrast Iran's pistachio yield that year was strong.In markets like China, they were able to undercut American prices by close to $0.20/lb.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Pistachio plants grow best in arid climates but that leave crops vulnerable to water shortages A strong growing year in 2016 has helped the US market recover and led to a moderation in price.But Iran has another advantage that helps it in global trade - its location."Iran has a transportation advantage.They can certainly take markets away and China is an example of that," says Mr Matoian.Uphill march The advantages and disadvantages for Iran are not only linked to sanctions.Iran claims its pistachios have a better taste, as do several large European distributors, though the US and Iran mainly grow the same strain.(Turkish pistachios, for example, are a different variety.)The US also imposes a 241% tariff on Iranian pistachios meaning even without sanctions the US market has been all but cut off for Iran.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Aging water infrastructure in Iran is a major difficultly for Iran's farmers Water shortages are another problem for Iran.According to Mr Sadi it is the "major obstacle to growth" for his industry.Iran's pistachio sector is second in the world following the strong 2016 season in the US.And with the two countries dominating so much of the global market, Iran isn't in dire need of a comeback.But for the growing number of pistachio fans around the world increased access to Iran's pistachio exports and decreasing prices would be a sweet outcome.
The 350 million people who don’t officially exist:::::Image copyright Getty Images Whenever any report has a "global" subject matter it's never long before there's a massive, global-size statistic, counting people by the millions and billions.News reports on global problems like to gesture to devastation and deprivation on an epic scale, counting out the suffering in numbers so big that they almost lose meaning.And maybe they actually do go astray.Because the annual monitoring report on education from the United Nations education agency, Unesco, makes the point that global figures on access to education could be out by a factor of 350 million.That's not a minor gap in the headcount.That's the equivalent of the combined populations of the UK, Germany, France, Italy and Spain.Undocumented and invisible These "invisible" people, below the demographic radar, are described as "the poorest of the poorest".These are families growing up in places where censuses and administrators do not reach.These are millions of unregistered lives in sprawling slums around some cities in the developing world, or in families living illegally and undocumented as migrants.Unesco's report says that the conventional means of gathering information - such as household surveys, censuses and records of birth and death - are only likely to be accurate for populations that are settled, visible and accessing services.Image copyright EPA Image caption How accurate are international figures on education targets?Shifting and excluded populations, even in their tens of millions, are harder to identify and can slip away from the spreadsheets and the data gatherers.Children living on the streets might not show up in the numbers not making it to school.They won't even count enough to be absences.The homeless or nomadic are missing from population studies going from house to house.Unwanted refugees driven over borders by political violence can be left uncounted and unrecognised by reluctant hosts.The UN agency estimates an undercount of 250 million in household surveys used in developing countries and says another 100 million are likely to be outside the reach of official statistics, including those living as illegal immigrants in wealthier countries.Taking account This year's education monitoring report focuses on accountability.But the Unesco study highlights that holding governments accountable for failing to deliver education services depends on knowing how many people need to be supported.More from Global education Ideas for the Global education series?Get in touch.International goals to cut illiteracy and increase access to school places need to recognise that some of the most disadvantaged are not even part of the target.Unesco says that it raises the question of who is responsible for people who don't even appear in national figures.Such discrepancies appear in the UN agency's own range of figures.Unesco says that its annual statistics for children without access to school include an estimate for those hard to reach communities.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption More pupils are getting access to school - but 264 million are still missing out But in comparisons for inequalities in access and public spending on education, Unesco says these "invisible" millions are not included.The UN agency makes the point that if the "mantra" of the current development goals is that "no one is left behind", for hundreds of millions, they never even get as far as being recognised as existing.As such, "no one is ultimately held to account for protecting their rights".Missing school This year's newly-released figures show 264 million young people without access to primary or secondary school.The report warns of six successive years in which education has received a declining share of aid budgets.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Undocumented migrants and the homeless can go below the radar of official figures And an international group of former education ministers, the Atlantis Group, including former UK education secretary Nicky Morgan and US education secretary Arne Duncan, has called for a greater commitment to aid for education.Last month, another UN agency, Unicef, reported there had been "nearly zero progress" in the past decade on improving access to school in the poorest countries.And earlier this month, Unesco's Institute for Statistics warned of a "staggering" problem in lack of quality in schools, with more than 600 million young people who have been to school but are lacking basic skills in literacy and numeracy.Counting in education and making education count remain a challenge.
Why businesses are saving the humble text message:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The firm that sends two billion text messages per year If you think that WhatsApp is killing the humble text message you may need to think again.A growing number of us are sending far fewer text messages than we used to.Armed with our fancy smartphones, in recent years we have instead switched to the likes of Facebook Messenger, Google Hangouts, Snapchat, and of course WhatsApp for our chats.As a result, the number of text (or SMS, as they are officially known) messages being sent per day around the world has now fallen far behind the more hi-tech rivals.At WhatsApp alone, 55 billion messages are now sent globally every day, more than twice the 22 billion figure for SMS messages.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption People are switching from texts to the likes of WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger Yet while the number of text messages being sent by people in the developed world has fallen since 2011, there continues to be one big growth area - notification SMS messages sent from businesses to customers.Most of us are now increasingly receiving such text messages on a regular basis, such as when you are being reminded of an opticians' appointment, when an engineer will come to repair your boiler, or when a delivery is going to arrive.One company at the forefront of this business text messaging industry is a small English firm Esendex, based in Nottingham, in the East Midlands.With just 200 employees, it now sends out two billion text messages per year, on behalf of 30,000 businesses and other organisations, up from 100 million texts in 2010.Image caption Businesses are now increasingly sending text messages to their customers Esendex is already the biggest player in the UK, France and Italy; it is growing strongly in Germany, Spain and Australia.And it is a lucrative business.Esendex has annual revenues of 23m a year, as firms pay it a fee for every text sent.Meanwhile, a report earlier this year predicted that the global business text message industry would be worth $70bn by 2020, up from $55bn in 2014, as more and more texts are sent out to customers.Geoff Love, Esendex's chief executive, says while friends may like to chat over Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp, there are a number of key reasons why businesses prefer to send out text messages instead."SMS is the only app that's on every phone in the world, so no matter who you are trying to communicate with, you know they can receive a text message."Test messaging facts SMS stands for Short Message Service The first text was sent in 1992 by British software engineer Neil Papworth.It read simply "Merry Christmas" 15.2 million texts are sent globally every minute Text messages are read, on average, within five minutes of being received Text messages are up to 160 characters in length Google is working on a new version of text messaging called RCS or Rich Communication Services, which aims to make it more similar to WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger "That's not the same with WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger or any of the other applications.SMS is simply ubiquitous," he says."SMS is also very powerful - people read text messages.95% of text messages are read within five seconds, so you know your message will get there quickly and cheaply."And with SMS we know that the text message has been delivered to the person's phone."Image caption Geoff Love says firms use SMS because it is on every mobile phone in the world Majority-owned by a private equity firm, Esendex is continuing to quickly expand overseas through a determined acquisitions policy.Given that the global marketplace is a crowded one, with a large number of firms touting to help businesses send out text messages to their customers, mobile phone industry expert Ben Wood, says Esendex is right to have wanted to grow quickly."It is a cutthroat business, down to fractions of a penny in terms of margins," says Mr Wood, who works for research group CCS Insight."So scale is all important, companies need to be growing in the space in order to make sure that they're able to buy messages at scale, and therefore compete when they're tendering for business."Image caption Esendex's head office is in Nottingham With its main overseas offices in Barcelona, Spain, and Melbourne, Australia, plus others in France and Italy, Mr Love says an attempt to break into the US market failed."Melbourne and Barcelona grew quickly, [but] things were tougher in America, and we ended up closing down our American operation."Not all of the [US] mobile telephone networks could communicate with each other, so you'd be in a situation where you might send a message and it wasn't received because the two networks didn't have any kind of agreement between them to receive messages, which was crazy."This is the second story in a new series called Connected Commerce, which every week highlights companies around the world that are successfully exporting, and trading beyond their home market.The first feature in the series, looked at a Canadian winemaker who has to battle winter temperatures of less than -25C."In Europe, whilst it appears to be more complicated because people speak different languages, in reality they are far more similar," says Mr Love.Yet there are some differences in Europe, he adds, with companies in Germany demanding far more stringent tests on the software and technology.Image caption The global mobile phone market is taking over the world Entering the Australian market also brought an unforeseen issue - due to the time difference it can't shut down its UK head office computer systems overnight for maintenance, because it is daytime in Australia."It forced us to become a 24/7 business," says Mr Love."That was quite hard to begin with because it meant changing the way we operated... but in the end it turned into quite an advantage because the companies we are working with are using us for mission-critical stuff 24/7 anyway."Our customers are in every single industry you can think of, it could be a very small business or a massive enterprise.But typically it's organisations who really need to communicate with a large number of people very quickly."
Could this 10-year-old fix Pakistan's waste problem?:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Zymal Umer has discovered there is money to be made in recycling "If people just thought for a moment before dumping their rubbish then maybe they wouldn't do it as it harms our environment."Zymal Umer, 10, sighs as she takes in the view of a makeshift rubbish dump on the outskirts of her hometown Sargodha in Punjab, Pakistan.But could the girl dubbed the country's "youngest social entrepreneur" by many have a solution?For now, there are colourful piles of plastic bags, metal and general waste as far as the eye can see.Wafts of smoke fill the air with a putrid and toxic stench as much of the refuse is set on fire.What's in front of Zymal is just the tip of the iceberg that is Pakistan's problem with waste.According to the country's environment protection department, 20m tonnes of solid waste is generated a year and the figure is growing by 2.4% annually.Landfill issues "This is a situation you can find across all of Pakistan - these bags are not biodegradable and people carelessly discard them.They don't really think about recycling," Zymal says.Image caption Zymal turns old newspapers into gift bags Proper solid waste management has never been practiced in the country; only half of the rubbish generated is collected by the government and there is a severe lack of adequate landfill sites.Dumping and burning remain the most common methods of disposal and much of the uncollected waste poses serious risks to public health.Beautiful bags Zeebags is Zymal's bid to try to reduce pollution and increase awareness about the environment.The schoolgirl turns old newspapers into bright and beautifully decorated gift bags which are then sold to family and friends and most of the profits distributed to various local charities.In the space of just three years she has gone from selling a few bags to selling hundreds - worth $4-5,000.Image caption Pakistan has a real problem with waste "I learnt to make the bags by watching YouTube."It is hard to balance my schoolwork with running Zeebags, so I make them at the weekend or during the holidays with my cousins."My father and grandfather pay for my raw materials and if they didn't help me, it would be very hard to keep my project going," she says.One charity Zymal's money goes to is called SOS Children's Villages, which helps orphaned and destitute children across Pakistan.Image caption Zymal has used the money she has raised to help other children "Through my income I've been able to pay for water coolers, washing machines, batteries and the type of things they need for daily life," Zymal explains."To see the happiness on their faces gives me a lot of satisfaction and motivation to carry on."Her innovative and charitable enterprise has attracted a fair bit of attention with TV and newspaper coverage labelling Zymal as "Pakistan's youngest social entrepreneur".Award winner Zeebags has also won a number of awards in Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and the USA."I was very excited to get some international recognition for my work and proud to get some positive exposure for my country and parents."Image caption Zymal believes her business has the potential to grow much larger Selling online has opened up her business to a new world of possibilities."In Pakistan it's thought girls cannot work independently but I haven't faced any difficulties and my aim is to continue my work."I want to become a businesswoman in the future and expand Zeebags through my website and showcase other people's products, too."The BBC's Innovators series reveals innovative solutions to major challenges across South Asia.Ever heard of the concept of "jugaad"?It's a Hindi term meaning cheap innovation.If you have created a life hack or innovation that you are proud of, or spotted one while out and about on your travels, then share your picture with us by emailing yourpics@bbc.co.uk, use the hashtags #Jugaad and #BBCInnovators and share your picture with @BBCWorldService, or upload your submission here.Learn more about BBC Innovators."My biggest ambition is to grow my project not just in Pakistan but also globally," she says.Kalsoom Lakhani is founder of Invest2Innovate, an organisation that helps start-up companies in Pakistan grow and attract funding.She says the country needs to think about the future for entrepreneurs."While we have this enormous potential we need to be always thinking, how we enable that potential and how we continue to not only allow young people to start a business but allow them to grow businesses."Pakistan has already begun to tackle its environmental problems through legislation, establishing government agencies and accepting technical help from international donors.But the response is still fragmented and not a particularly high priority in a country racked with more pressing security and political issues.Image caption Zymal has to balance her social enterprise with her schoolwork This gives Zymal's work even more urgency.She hopes her success will start to change people's minds about the seriousness of taking care of their environment."It is important so future generations can live in a clean and safe world," she says."I want to be able to say I've played my part but it's up to others to do something themselves, too."
How you could be Postman Pat for a day and earn extra cash:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Cartoon characters Postman Pat and Mr Plod represent a bygone era in deliveries A growing number of start-ups are trying to help retailers deliver goods to customers more quickly and at lower cost.But can they really compete with the big courier and postal firms?It was a road accident in the Norwegian mountains that inspired the idea for start-up delivery company Nimber.One of the founders was on his way to a ski-jumping competition near Lillehammer when he saw a postal truck had overturned on the road."No one was hurt, but all these cars were just passing by," says Nimber chief executive Ari Kestin, whose partner Knut Bjerke made the trip."He thought, why don't they stop and carry some of the parcels to their destinations?A light-bulb came on."Nimber was launched soon after, joining a wave of new apps aimed at shaking up the delivery market.The website connects people who want to send large, awkward-to-carry goods, with members of the public travelling in the same direction.These "crowdsourced couriers" name their own price, Mr Kestin says, but are usually cheaper than using a traditional courier service or postal firm, such as FedEx or Royal Mail.Image copyright Nimber Image caption Nimber's crowd-sourced couriers often transport large goods "If you're driving from London to Manchester anyway, you will probably accept a lower price to deliver a package than a big delivery firm would," he says."We are making use of spare capacity and allowing people to monetise their movements."The site, whose main markets are Norway and the UK, has more than 40,000 registered "bringers" and 80,000 senders.It handles hundreds of deliveries a day of things like bikes, car parts and furniture.So far it has focused on serving people selling second-hand goods on sites like e-Bay and Norway's finn.no, but it has just started working with several big retailers, including Norway's largest meat and eggs producer, Nortura."Nimber is a great choice because it is environmentally friendly and doesn't create more traffic or pollution," a Nortura spokeswoman tells the BBC.But using members of the public to deliver goods does have its drawbacks.Mr Kestin admits that his service may not be as economical as a traditional delivery service for smaller items.More Technology of Business Image copyright Getty Images Its crowdsourced couriers are not always available to handle deliveries, and, on occasion, pull out at the last minute - although "that's quite rare", he says.This isn't stopping other firms experimenting with the crowdsourcing model.Some, like Uber Rush, Deliveroo and Instacart are using crowdsourced couriers to deliver packages, groceries and hot food locally - often more cheaply and quickly than major couriers could.Belgium postal giant Bpost and DHL are among those to have experimented with crowdsourced couriers.And Amazon launched its "citizen delivery" service Flex in 2015.With global retail e-ecommerce sales forecast to rise 23% this year to $2.3tn (1.8tn), it's not surprising start-ups are trying to muscle in on a delivery market still dominated by national postal services and courier firms like UPS, DHL, FedEx, Blue Dart and PostNL.These account for more than 90% of e-commerce deliveries, not including food, estimates Alex le Roy, an analyst at consultancy Transport Intelligence."These start-ups are basically serving the needs that the larger delivery companies can't meet," he says."That's because typically, traditional postal companies can deliver packages more or less anywhere, but they can't do it quickly."And the big courier firms can deliver quickly, but charge much higher prices when they deliver to out-of-the-way places or carry awkwardly shaped goods."Nimbler start-ups can also help smaller retailers reach new markets.Image copyright Fetchr Image caption Idriss Al Rifai and Joy Ajlouny co-founded Middle East-based Fetchr Fetchr, for example, is a Dubai-based delivery company aiming to connect retailers with around four billion people worldwide who live in places without street names or house numbers."There is this huge demand for online shopping in emerging markets, but many big retailers are facing the same problem," says Fetchr co-founder Idriss Al Rifai."How can you grow if you can't deliver large numbers of parcels?"The firm uses a customer's smartphone GPS location as the address.As soon as one of Fetchr's couriers has picked up a package from a retailer, it notifies the customer, offering them a two-hour delivery slot.The customer then shares their location with Fetchr."Fifteen minutes before the firm delivers, we will ask the customer to share their location again - and if they have moved elsewhere, that's fine," Mr Al Rifai says."Even when there is an address, people don't want to be pinned down for hours to receive a package."The firm, which employs 2,000 of its own couriers, serves brands such as supermarket chain Carrefour and Gucci, in countries such as the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Saudi Arabia.It hopes to expand internationally, having raised $41m (31m) in investment in May, but will face competition from the likes of the UK's What3Words and South Africa's WumDrop, which are also addressing the "lack-of-address" issue.Image copyright Weengs Image caption Weengs collects retailers' goods, packs and delivers them Some start-ups, such as Red Stag Fulfilment in the US and UK-based Weengs, are offering one-stop-shop services aimed at taking the delivery hassle away from small businesses."Shipping companies expect you to have packed your items properly, have done an analysis of your shipping costs, and prepared your customs paperwork," explains Weengs co-founder Alex Christodoulou."But many small businesses don't have the expertise to do this efficiently - it costs time and money."Weengs manages the whole shipping process from end-to-end, collecting your items unboxed and packing them at its warehouse in Kings Cross, London."We then measure your item with a laser and create a box exactly fitting the dimensions of your goods," says Mr Christodoulou.This reduces costs because some delivery companies charge by volume, not weight, he says.Big retailers sending lots of parcels can often negotiate bulk discounts on delivery costs.Smaller retailers can't.So Weengs pools its customers' orders and shops around between 10 to 30 courier firms to bring down costs, says Mr Christodoulou.His firm has handled 200,000 orders since launch in 2015, but faces competition from more established comparison services, such as parcel2go.com."These firms are already re-distributing the share of delivery volume from traditional delivery companies to smaller ones and individuals," says e-commerce consultant Kunle Campbell."I think more delivery companies will adopt their approaches, and it could cut the costs of delivery across the board."That will be music to the ears of all e-commerce entrepreneurs.
Dolly Parton's nine-to-five approach to music:::::Image caption Dolly Parton is known as much for her business acumen as her song-writing skills Even when she's talking about cold, hard cash, Dolly Parton manages to seem down to earth.She's promoting her new children's album "I Believe in You" and is in top, self-deprecating form, talking to the BBC."It's hard for me to spend money on tonnes of stuff because I'm going to look the same, no matter what I wear.If I wear diamonds I'm still going to look like a rhinestone," she tells me.Still, if Dolly was inclined to buy diamonds, she could afford them.She's known as much for her business acumen as her song-writing skills.At the start of her career she took lessons from her dad, she says: "Even though he wasn't an educated man, he wasn't able to read and write, daddy had a great sense of business.Image caption Dolly Parton at Glastonbury - in the past year she's earned some $37m "He said, 'Don't let other people take advantage of you, keep your mind on your business.'So when I got into the music business I thought of it as a business."Early on she launched her own publishing company and hung on to the rights to her songs, and she says that other artists should do the same."As soon as you start making money, you should invest and get into other businesses that you can fall back on if you don't make it big, or if you make it big and you fall on hard times."That attitude has served her well over the years and continues to do so, according to Forbes magazine's Celebrity 100 list.It claims Dolly earned $37m (28m) in the year to June 2017, with most of this coming from her Pure and Simple concert tour and income from her Dollywood theme park in Tennessee.Image copyright Jason Davis Image caption Dolly visits Vanderbilt children's hospital in Tennessee Brian Warner, founder of website CelebrityNetworth.com, estimates her total fortune to be $500m (379m) but says this is conservative."We think that Dollywood alone is worth around $200m; $100m for the land itself and $100m for the brand - you could class it as an intangible asset."On top of that she makes a lot of money from touring and has had a 50-year career in which she's sold millions of records and has also written songs for other artists."Mr Warner says "I will always love you", a hit Dolly wrote and recorded in 1973, has made her more than $20m in total.He explains that although individual music contracts may vary, "as the writer of a song you might be keeping 50% of the revenue or more and as a writer and performer you could be getting 80%".Image copyright Wes Ramey for Dollywood Image caption The Barnstormer ride at Dollywood Dolly's own version of "I Will Always Love You" was a big commercial success, topping the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart twice, in 1974 and 1982.Whitney Houston made the song a hit all over again when she recorded a version for the 1992 film The Bodyguard.It was number one for 10 weeks in the UK charts and for 14 weeks in the US.The song had another resurgence in 2012 after Ms Houston's death.More The Boss features, which every week profile a different business leader from around the world: The proceeds from Dolly's latest album won't be adding to her fortune, though; instead they'll be going to the Imagination Library.Set up in 1995 it aims to improve child literacy by distributing free books to children in the US, Canada, the UK and Australia.Image copyright Keystone Image caption Dolly in London in 1977 Dolly says her own impoverished childhood in Tennessee inspired the library and has shaped her attitude to money in general."Being brought up poor means I don't take things for granted, and no matter how much money I make, I'll always count my blessings quicker and more often than I count my money.She has "always realised the value of a dollar", too."Even now if I go in a store it's hard for me to pay a huge amount of money for one item.I say 'good Lord', what could mummy and daddy have done with that!"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Dolly's Imagination Library scheme provides books for children At 71 years old, Dolly's career has spanned more than five decades and following her Glastonbury performance in 2014 she's reached a whole new audience.So what's the secret of her longevity?"I think a lot of people can relate to me, because of my upbringing and because I'm from a big family.I think people see me as an aunt, an older sister or a cousin.I've been around so long I'm part of their family."Dolly will be hoping that this loyal fan base will support ambitious plans to expand her empire.The DreamMore hotel at Dollywood, opened in 2015, is "doing well" and she is thinking of franchising it.She'd also like to do more kids projects and launch a line of wigs, cosmetics and clothes."I've still got a lot to do...I'm going to be an old lady before I get it done but at least I'm going to be working till I fall over dead!"Dolly Parton is a force of nature and a tremendously successful one at that; it's hard to imagine her ever stopping.
Is this the most influential work in the history of capitalism?:::::Image copyright Alamy Image caption Renaissance mathematician Luca Pacioli is seen as the father of double-entry bookkeeping In 1495 or thereabouts, Leonardo da Vinci himself, the genius's genius, noted down a list of things to do in one of his famous notebooks.These to-do lists, written in mirror-writing and interspersed with sketches, are magnificent."Find a master of hydraulics and get him to tell you how to repair a lock, canal and mill in the Lombard manner.""Draw Milan.""Learn multiplication from the root from Maestro Luca."Leonardo was a big fan of Maestro Luca, better known today as Luca Pacioli.Pacioli was, appropriately enough, a Renaissance Man: - educated for a life in commerce, but also a conjuror, a chess master, a lover of puzzles, a Franciscan Friar, and a professor of mathematics.Today he is celebrated as the most famous accountant who ever lived.50 Things That Made the Modern Economy highlights the inventions, ideas and innovations which have helped create the economic world in which we live.It is broadcast on the BBC World Service.You can find more information about the programme's sources and listen online or subscribe to the programme podcast.Pacioli is often called the father of double-entry bookkeeping, but he didn't invent it.The double-entry system - known in its day as "bookkeeping alla Veneziana," or "in the Venetian style" - was being used two centuries earlier, around 1300.The Venetians had abandoned as impractical the Roman system of writing numbers, and were instead embracing Arabic numerals.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Venice in the 1300s - when Marco Polo set off on his famous travels to the Far East - was already a sophisticated crossroads of trade and ideas They may have also taken the idea of double-entry book keeping from the Islamic world, or even from India, where there are tantalising hints that double-entry bookkeeping techniques date back thousands of years.Or it may have been a local Venetian invention, repurposing the new Arabic mathematics for commercial ends.Intricate transactions Before the Venetian style caught on, accounts were rather basic.Early medieval merchants were little more than travelling salesmen.They had no need to keep accounts - they could simply check whether their purse was full or empty.But as the commercial enterprises of the Italian city states grew larger, and became more dependent on financial instruments such as loans and currency trades, the need for a more careful reckoning became painfully clear.We have a remarkable record of the business affairs of Francesco di Marco Datini, a merchant from Prato, near Florence, who kept accounts for nearly half a century, from 1366 to 1410.They begin as little more than a financial diary, but as his business grew more complex, he needed something more sophisticated.Image copyright Alamy Image caption We can see how Datini tracked his increasingly intricate financial transactions Late in 1394, Datini orders wool from Mallorca.Six months later the sheep are shorn.Several months after that, 29 sacks of wool arrive in Pisa, via Barcelona.The wool is coiled into 39 bales.Of these, 21 go to a customer in Florence and 18 go to Datini's warehouse, arriving in 1396, over a year after the initial order.They are then processed by more than 100 separate subcontractors.Eventually, six long cloths go back to Mallorca via Venice, but don't sell, so are hawked in Valencia and North Africa instead.The last cloth is sold in 1398, nearly four years after Datini's original order.Fortunately, he had been using bookkeeping alla Veneziana for more than a decade, so was able to keep track of this extraordinarily intricate web of transactions.Enormous influence So what, a century later, did the much lauded Luca Pacioli add to the discipline of bookkeeping?Quite simply, in 1494, he wrote the book."Summa de Arithmetica, Geometria, Proportioni et Proportionalita" was an enormous survey of everything that was known about mathematics - 615 large and densely typeset pages.Image copyright Stockholm University Library Amidst this colossal textbook, Pacioli included 27 pages that are regarded by many as the most influential work in the history of capitalism.It was the first description of double-entry bookkeeping to be set out clearly, in detail and with plenty of examples.Pacioli's book was sped on its way by a new technology: half a century after Gutenberg developed the movable type printing press, Venice was a centre of the printing industry.Symmetry and balance His book enjoyed a long print run of 2,000 copies, and was widely translated, copied, and plagiarised across Europe.Double-entry bookkeeping was slow to catch on, perhaps because it was technically demanding and unnecessary for simple businesses.But after Pacioli it was always regarded as the pinnacle of the art.Image copyright Alamy Image caption This 1585 woodcut shows a German merchant's accountant doing double-entry bookkeeping As the industrial revolution unfolded, the ideas that Pacioli had set out came to be seen as fundamental to business life.The system used across the world today is essentially the one that Pacioli described.Pacioli's system has two key elements.First, he describes a method for taking an inventory, and then keeping on top of day-to-day transactions using two books - a rough memorandum and a tidier, more organised journal.Then he uses a third book - the ledger - as the foundation of the system, the double-entries themselves.Every transaction was recorded twice in the ledger.If you sell cloth for a ducat, you must account for both the cloth and the ducat.The double-entry system helps to catch errors, because every entry should be balanced by a counterpart, a divine-like symmetry which appealed to a Renaissance Man.Practical tool It was during the industrial revolution that double-entry bookkeeping became seen not just as an exercise for mathematical perfectionists, but as a tool to guide practical business decisions.One of the first to see this was Josiah Wedgwood, the pottery entrepreneur.At first, Wedgwood, flush with success and fat margins, didn't bother with detailed accounts.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Josiah Wedgwood used the insight gleaned from detailed accounts to weather a severe recession But in 1772, Europe faced a severe recession and demand for Wedgwood's ornate crockery collapsed.His warehouses began to fill with unsold stock and workers stood idle.Wedgwood turned to double-entry bookkeeping to understand where in his business the profits were, and how to expand them.He realised how much each piece of work was costing him - a deceptively simple-sounding question - and calculated that he should actually expand production and cut prices to boost business.Others followed, and the discipline of "management accounting" was born - an ever-growing system of metrics and benchmarks and targets, that has led us inexorably to the modern world.More from Tim Harford: How the invention of paper changed the world The warrior monks who invented banking How the world's first accountants counted on cuneiform What tally sticks tell us about how money works But in that modern world, accounting does have another role.It's about ensuring that shareholders in a business receive a fair share of corporate profits - when only the accountants can say what those profits really are.Here the track record is not encouraging.Image copyright AFP Image caption Enron's collapse in 2001 was the biggest in US corporate history A string of 21st century scandals - Enron, Worldcom, Parmalat, and the financial crisis of 2008 - have shown us that audited accounts do not completely protect investors.A business may, through fraud or mismanagement, be on the verge of collapse.Yet we cannot guarantee that the accounts will warn us of this.Complacency Accounting fraud is not a new game.The first companies to require major capital investment were the British railways of the 1830s and 1840s, which needed vast upfront investment before they could earn anything from customers.Investors poured in, and when railway magnates could not pay the dividends that the investors expected, they simply faked their accounts.The entire railway bubble had collapsed in ignominy by 1850.Perhaps the railway investors should have read up on their Geoffrey Chaucer, writing around the same time as Francesco Datini, the merchant of Prato.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Accountancy did not protect Chaucer's Shipman character from an audacious con In Chaucer's Shipman's Tale, a rich merchant is too tied up with his accounts to notice his wife being wooed by a clergyman.Nor do those accounts rescue him from an audacious con.The clergyman borrows the merchant's money, gives it to the merchant's wife - buying his way into her bed with her own husband's cash - and then tells the merchant he's repaid the debt, and to ask his wife where the money is.Accountancy is a powerful financial technology - but it does not protect us from outright fraud, and it may well lure us into complacency.As the neglected wife tells her rich husband, his nose buried in his accounts: "the devil take all such reckonings!"Tim Harford writes the Financial Times's Undercover Economist column.50 Things That Made the Modern Economy is broadcast on the BBC World Service.You can find more information about the programme's sources and listen online or subscribe to the programme podcast.
Will Australia's 'miracle economy' keep on winning?:::::Image copyright Getty Images It was the year Australia went to war in the Gulf, when Monica Seles and Boris Becker won tennis grand slams in Melbourne, and The Simpsons was first shown on Aussie television, while a swooning Bryan Adams was a hit with love-struck teenagers ("Look into your heart, baby").It was 1991, and the last time Australia tasted the bitter economic taste of recession, defined in these parts, at least, as two or more back-to-back quarters of negative growth in real gross domestic product, or the value of all services and goods.Since then, Australia has sidestepped the worst effects of the Asian financial crisis in 1997 and its more destructive big brother that hammered global markets a decade or so later.Australia's economy - the "wonder down under" - has somehow dodged the unstoppable forces that sent other wealthy countries tumbling into reverse.For this, a nation of 24 million people must thank not only sound judgement by those in charge but also good fortune, according to Shane Oliver, chief economist at financial services company AMP in Sydney."I certainly don't see Australia as being a miracle," he says."It has had a bit of good luck and good management, but it would be dangerous to assume that it is never going to have a recession again."Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Coal production helped the Australian economy stay afloat The economy is growing by about 1.9% per year, according to the Reserve Bank.In 2012, that figure was 3.7%.Weaker growth means that pay packets are shrinking for many workers when adjusted for the rising cost of living, and near-record levels of underemployment are stifling wage increases.In August, retail sales posted their biggest retreat in about four-and-a-half years, falling by 0.6%, with cafes and restaurants reporting declining turnovers.Period of transition?Rocks, coal and demand from China insulated this country from the global financial meltdown in 2008, as a red-hot mining industry delivered unprecedented wealth.Surging commodity prices fuelled the bonanza in Western Australia and Queensland, which propped up under-performing states in the south-east, where most Australians live.Shane Oliver says the situation has now "been turned on its head" and Australia is once again in transition.The mining boom has faded, but areas that once struggled have bounced back in part because of record low interest rates that have unleashed a frenzy into the housing market.Image copyright Getty Images Meanwhile, eye-watering wads of public money have poured into infrastructure projects, which are redefining parts of New South Wales, the most populous state.There was another critical factor that helped Australia to largely avoid the ravages of the global financial crisis - unprecedented spending by the Labor government that boosted public expenditure by a whopping 13% in an attempt to stimulate growth.It was a classic Keynesian economic manoeuvre to use billions of dollars to sustain household spending, demand and employment.Australia loves to win.Here international cricket matches are akin to "wars" and Olympic gold medals - or a lack thereof - are greeted with congratulatory back-slapping - or hand-wringing.If there was a podium for economic success, this is a country that would be bending forward to accept the award.More than 25 years of uninterrupted growth is a remarkable achievement, although there is debate about the competition.Some commentators believe the recent economic prosperity enjoyed by the Netherlands lasted for (only) 22 years, putting it firmly into silver medal position behind the Aussies.Right place, right time Tim Harcourt, an economics fellow at the University of New South Wales, believes Australia deserves the plaudits."This time the 'lucky country' made its own luck."The Hawke-Keating [government] reforms of the 1980s and 1990s - the currency float, tariff changes, and embrace of Asia - set up us up for a quarter of a century of growth."Australia found itself in the right place at the right time and embraced the Asia century," he argues.Image copyright Getty Images But as the economy has soared, some Australians have been left behind.At almost 13%, youth unemployment is more than twice the national average.Labouring work had left 21-year-old Mohammad Al-Khafaji, the son of an Iranian refugee, with endless back pain and homelessness soon followed."I was just trying to apply for jobs online, and then people were just putting me down saying 'you are never going to get that job', so I just stopped trying," he says.'Muddling along' Mohammad is now employed by a hire car company in Sydney, and has ambitions to one day be the boss.He works with Shiv Dhingra, an Indian migrant from Punjab.They are proof that much of Australia's economic might is down to immigration."I am the only one working in my family," Shiv explained."I am the main financial support they have.I am working seven days a week for the last year.I've got plans for my own business."Image copyright Charity Bounce Image caption Charity Bounce runs sessions in partnership with professional athletes Both young men were helped by Charity Bounce, a Sydney-based non-profit organisation that uses basketball to reach out to the disadvantaged and long-term unemployed, who, according to chief executive, Ian Heininger, also deserve a slice of Australia's prosperity."We find a lot of the young people are desperate to find work," he says, "desperate to find an opportunity that is going to get them into a place where they are contributing back to the world."But will they be part of an ever-expanding economy?Mr Oliver thinks Australia's luck will eventually run out, but not for a while."The Aussie economy is probably going to continue muddling along, not fantastically strong as housing slows and consumer spending remains a bit weak," he predicts."We are probably going to go for at least another few years before we have that recession some people say is inevitable."
How can you help your local online business go global?:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Online shopping has become a $2.3tn global business In 1995, someone sold a broken laser pen for $14 on a site called AuctionWeb.This was the rather inauspicious start for online shopping, an activity that now generates a colossal $2.3tn (1.75tn) in global sales.But these days, shoppers want to pay in any number of ways and this can cause headaches for retailers wanting to expand abroad; so what should they do?Nigel Whiteoak is the co-founder of LoveCrafts, a virtual hub for knitting and crochet enthusiasts to share their creations and buy supplies.Having a website rather than a bricks-and-mortar shop meant the team could sell their wares to the world.But taking payments for these international sales wasn't proving straightforward."One of the biggest realisations we had when looking to expand was that credit card penetration is generally much lower in most markets outside the UK and US," he explains."In Germany, open invoices are very common where you process the payment using a third party, deliver the goods directly to the customer, and then they pay that third party once we have delivered their crafts.Image copyright LoveCrafts Image caption LoveCrafts founder Nigel Whiteoak says selling abroad has significantly boosted sales "Whereas in Brazil and Turkey they tend to use local credit cards and pay in instalments."These regional quirks were difficult to cater for.But then he came across a Dutch payment company, Adyen, whose payment processing platform harnesses machine learning to customise the payment method depending on which country the buyer is in.Adyen's clients include heavyweights such as Netflix, Uber and Spotify, so Mr Whiteoak was surprised to find out how affordable its service was, with a minimum monthly invoice of $100 (75) and transparent per-transaction processing and commission charges."Before we started selling outside of the UK we had a turnover of around 6.5m," he says."Last year we posted 10.9 million, and with the bulk of our sales coming from overseas, this growth is directly linked to our ability to offer local payment methods."Sales have grown 125% over the last three years, he says, proving that knitting and crochet is big business.Image copyright LoveCrafts Image caption LoveCrafts has found that people in different countries like to pay in different ways Payment difficulties contribute to about 15% of online shoppers abandoning their virtual shopping baskets before completing the purchase, research suggests.That and difficult-to-navigate, fiddly websites.Research from Barclaycard finds that while customers demand faster, more innovative and mobile-friendly ways to pay, the reality is one of declined cards, verification delays and annoying hidden transaction fees."Remove the need for consumers to set up an account first," advises Greg Liset, Barclaycard's head of small business, "and partner with suppliers that have reliable payment systems that work first time."Also, with online cross-border sales expected to soar over the next few years, being able to offer multiple currencies is essential."Knowing what payment options locals prefer is crucial to e-commerce success.Research from 2Checkout finds that in the US, Visa, MasterCard, PayPal and American Express still dominate the payments landscape.But in other countries different favourite payment methods have emerged.For example, in China Alipay now accounts for 54% of online sales.In the Netherlands the iDEAL payment system is used for 44% of sales.In Japan, JCB and Konbini are popular.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Shoppers in different countries have their own favourite ways of paying But in India many shoppers still prefer paying in cash.So Indian start-up BookMyTrain is aiming to simplify the online purchase of rail tickets by offering a cash-on-delivery payment option with its app, as many people in India don't have payment cards.It is also using chatbots to take customers through the booking process one step at a time.Simon Johnson, general manager at software provider Freshworks, the firm providing the chatbots for BookMyTrain, says: "Most customers today use messaging apps such as WhatsApp or Facebook Messenger because they like how you can keep a conversation going with whatever device they are using."You don't have to be a massive company to personalise the experience more effectively and [smaller] retailers need to have that personal touch to compete with big e-commerce players."Other payment platforms besides Adyen helping online retailers sell globally with tailored experiences include 2Checkout (formerly Avangate), PayU, PayPal, Stripe and Braintree.More Technology of Business Image copyright Getty Images Costs are usually transparent and related to sales volume.With PayPal, for example, retailers can expect to pay 2.9 % of the transaction value plus about 23p per order.Similarly, Stripe doesn't charge extra for accommodating different cards or currencies with a flat rate of 1.4% plus 20p per transaction.But selling abroad isn't just about offering flexibility over ways to pay and support for multiple currencies, it's also about understanding local customs and cultures, argues Nir Debbi, co-founder of e-commerce platform Global-e. "A common pitfall for businesses marketing themselves abroad is a lack of awareness of the different cultural phenomena," says Mr Debbi.Planning for international shopping events such as Singles Day in China or Japan's "lucky shopping bags" at New Year "can improve international conversion rates dramatically", he says, "but you need the insight, local knowledge and access to these sales peaks to be able to plan and apply an appropriate strategy."Later in this e-commerce series we'll explore the best ways for online businesses to market themselves.
Milwaukee Bucks aim to bounce back on and off NBA court:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The Milwaukee Bucks' Giannis Antetokounmpo is an emerging star in the NBA What has historically made Milwaukee famous has been its beer and its motorcycles, but now NBA basketball side, the Bucks, is also hoping to fly the flag for the US city.Although the team situated on the western shore of Lake Michigan has picked up just one NBA national title, in 1971, in its 50th season it is now hoping to transform its fortunes.The club has wealthy owners in the shape of New York hedge fund billionaires, and has one of the top young players in Giannis Antetokounmpo.It has also signed a groundbreaking shirt sponsorship deal with Harley-Davidson, and as the current regular season gets under way it is moving into a new stadium.As well as being specifically designed for basketball and offering a better fan experience, the Wisconsin Entertainment and Sports Center stadium will also host music and entertainment events.And the playing season has got off to a bright start, with victory in the opening game over Boston Celtics.Championship dream "Our aims are sporting and financial," Bucks president Peter Feigin, who has previously worked in the theme park and executive jet industries, tells me.Image copyright Milwaukee Bucks Image caption The Wisconsin Entertainment and Sports Center stadium is due to open in August 2018 "Our owners are very motivated about the team winning on the court, and also about growing the business to be one of the best in US sport."At present the club is closer to breaking-even financially rather than making a profit, but it is hoped playing success can bring wider brand exposure and enhanced commercial revenues.Meanwhile, the new venue where the club will be the main leaseholder will also bring in increased match day income through executive boxes and improved catering.The team has high hopes for the season ahead.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The Milwaukee Bucks (green) won their opening match against the Boston Celtics 108-100 "There are four rounds of play-offs, we got to the first round last year and the expectation is to go at least one round better this time," says Mr Feigin, a former head of marketing for the New York Knicks NBA team."It is achievable - we are in the Eastern Division, which is not as strong as the Western Division, and if we are healthy for the season and have no injuries we will do great."He adds: "We are in these games to win a championship; it is all directed towards ultimately winning a championship."'International appeal' Central to any playing success is up-and-coming star Giannis Antetokounmpo, a 22-year-old born in Athens to Nigerian immigrant parents."We have the most-emerging star in the NBA, he is already in the top seven of uniform sales, and had tens of millions of video views," says Mr Feigin."He has gone from 'recognised' to superstar in less than 12 months.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Giannis Antetokounmpo sports a shirt with the fans' chant: Fear the deer "We have been able to grow our European appeal and our Asian appeal via Giannis."And the potentially exciting nature of the team has seen the Bucks double the number of live TV games they will be involved in this season, from nine to 18."That will be big for us not only on viewing impressions, but big for the brand too," adds Mr Feigin, who prior to joining the Bucks three years ago worked for Six Flags Theme Parks in the US.He was also previously president and chief operating officer of Marquis Jet, where he was the driving force behind Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway's NetJets acquisition of Marquis in 2010.Image copyright Milwaukee Bucks Image caption NBA rules allow teams to sign shirt sponsors for three years Mr Feigin says Milwaukee as at a city is at an "inflection point" between its industrial heritage past and a newly-modernised future, something which also applies to its shirt sponsors for the next three years - local motorbike brand Harley-Davidson."Harley are trying to reposition themselves for the next generations, and the NBA can help them do that," he says."They want to reach a young, diverse, more international market."Public funding Mr Feigin has been in London this month meeting to publicise the new stadium, pitching it as "a must-play for sports and entertainment" which will host 200 major events a year.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Post-industrial Milwaukee is in the midst of regeneration The $524m (395m) arena is a public-private partnership, with just over half the cash coming from hedge-fund club owners Marc Lasry, Wes Edens and Jamie Dinan, as well as $250m in public funding."It was very challenging to get this approved; especially at at time when there have been questions about the economy, and debates around healthcare and education," admits Mr Feigin."But a professional sports team can bring in much more than the stadium outlay, through income tax and sales tax."Image copyright Alamy Image caption Kareem Abdul-Jabbar led Milwaukee to their only title success in 1971 He says in return for that $250m outlay, the venue will help bring in more than $1bn over 15 years for the state."The stadium will also create a ripple effect in increasing nearby commercial and residential values," he adds.Bucks season-ticket holders and members will be offered deals on entertainment tickets.Conversely, it's hoped music fans will enjoy the stadium experience enough to come back for a Bucks game.Naming rights Building work began on the new stadium last June, with the club due to move into its new home on Labor Day weekend next year - the first weekend of September."The current venue was not built around basketball as the lead sport, but for ice hockey," says Raj Saha, the arena's general manager, and formerly on the management team of the O2 in London.Image caption Mr Feigin and Mr Saha have been in London to get support for the new stadium "The viewing sight lines where we currently play are not ideal for basketball," says Mr Saha, with only one third of the seats close to the action.The club is looking for six to eight long-term founding commercial partners for the new stadium, paying around $2m a year.Those who have signed up include multi-industrial firm Johnson Controls and bank BMO Harris.The search is on for a stadium naming rights partner, which would pay about $7m a year for 20 years."We are still looking for a naming rights partner.We would have loved to have finalised it by now but are in negotiations with a number of potential partners," says Mr Saha.Image copyright Populous Image caption The new stadium will host a variety of non-basketball entertainment As well as music acts, the arena will also host attractions such as UFC martial arts, boxing, Disney on Ice, and other events."We have an idea of how the first four weeks will look," says Mr Saha."Opening night is important and we'll go big for that, but the first 100 days will also be very important, too, to creating a success story."
The Chinese blockage in the global waste disposal system:::::Image copyright European Photopress Agency Image caption In Hong Kong, 2,500 tonnes of waste paper are piling up at its docks every day Imagine the world as a global waste disposal system.Now imagine it with a blockage.And what if that waste is backing up around the world, reappearing in places where you really don't want it to be.That blockage is about to happen in China and the flood is going to start seeping out into waste disposal operations around the world.Three months ago, China decided to ban 24 different grades of rubbish as part of its "National Sword" campaign against foreign garbage.Until now China has been importing millions of tonnes of the world's waste every year to feed its recycling industry.The Bureau of International Recycling China estimates that China last year imported 7.3 million tonnes of plastic scrap from Europe, Japan and USA, and 27 million tonnes of waste paper.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption China's action in halting various categories of waste imports will hit recycling around the world Robin Wiener, president of the US-based Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries, said: "More than 155,000 direct jobs are supported by the US industry's export activities, earning an average wage of almost $76,000 and contributing more than $3bn to federal, state, and local taxes."A ban on imports of scrap commodities into China would be catastrophic to the recycling industry."The new restrictions have yet to be agreed by the World Trade Organisation (WTO) and China could still change its mind, but the waste is already starting to back up.In Hong Kong, 2,500 tonnes of waste paper are piling up at its docks every day.Easy option For China the problem is simply one of pollution.Its submission to the WTO reads: "We found that large amounts of dirty wastes or even hazardous wastes are mixed in the solid waste that can be used as raw materials.This polluted China's environment seriously."Image copyright Jamie Robertson Image caption Mike Baxter says sending waste overseas was the easy option Western recyclers admit that China has been a cheap and easy waste bin for their industry.In theory the rubbish from your recycling rubbish bin is meant to be treated or sorted before it goes in the container overseas, but the rules have too often been ignored and rarely enforced.Mike Baxter, external affairs director at the recycler RPC Group, says: "The easiest option for years has been put it into a container and send it overseas where the labour is cheaper and it can be sorted by hand."But with the ban expected to come into full effect by the new year, if not before, the UK industry has written urging the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs to help with the expected overflow.Even so, Robin Latchem, editor of the recycling industry magazine MRW believes the recyclers are not spelling out the problems loudly enough, and says: "Why no mention of growing domestic stockpiles of waste and the danger of more fires or incidents of waste crime?"I don't think it is scare-mongering to set out such fears, along with concern that public perception of the recycling industry in its widest sense will be heavily scarred by greater fly-tipping, larger-scale dumping and more plumes of heavy black smoke crossing housing estates."Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Western recyclers admit that China has been a cheap and easy waste bin for their industry No minister from Defra was available for comment, but a spokesman told the BBC: "We are aware of this situation and are looking into the potential implications."Opportunities But there is flip side to the problem - an opportunity for the recycling industry.In the UK for example, a lot of the waste is high quality, such as off-cuts from plastic manufacturing and plastic bottles that have failed quality tests but can be reprocessed.That presents "a great opportunity", says David Wilson commercial manager of Vanden Recycling, a Hong Kong-based company with a new plastics recycling operation in Peterborough, in the UK."China has voluntarily given up a six million tonne a year industry.We'll be selective about it and we'll go for materials we understand and markets we understand, but some of that lost capacity will be rebuilt here," he says.Image copyright Jamie Robertson Image caption Vanden Recycling's David Wilson says the China ban creates new opportunities Low quality waste is a different matter, however, and it requires some drastic rethinking of the whole supply chain.As waste begins to back up through the system, like any commodity in oversupply, it loses value.In the UK, for example, local authorities have been able to generate useful income from selling that waste on to the recyclers.That income is going to fall sharply.Andrew Bird, chairman of the UK's Local Authority Recycling Advisory Committee (LARAC) says as demand from China disappears, other markets are emerging, especially in India and wider Asia.Nevertheless, "there is going to be a little bit of pinch point, to say the least, and that will have an effect on price - that's the biggest risk for local authorities".New technologies One answer to tackling the global oversupply of low quality waste is the development of new technologies.Recycling Technologies has developed a method of recycling the most unappetising mix of dirty plastic into something it calls Plaxx, a fuel oil which can be used for myriad applications, including as a source for new recycled plastic.Image copyright Jamie Robertson Image caption Adopting new technologies is one long-term solution, says Adrian Griffiths Adrian Griffiths, the company's chief executive, admits there's no shortage of "feedstock" - the term for all the raw material that feeds the process."We chemically recycle plastic.We take it back to the original material so it can become more plastic again: plastic, back to oil, and back to plastic again.Anything that goes to landfill currently is feedstock for us, and since the recycling figures are so low the vast majority of the plastic we want is not in recycling use anyway."Global Trade More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade: But tackling the global back-up of waste after China's changes will require investment.Surprisingly, it is waste paper recycling that can cost the most.A plastics recycling plant could require a 5m ($6.5m) investment to get it up and running, says Simon Ellin, chief executive of the Recycling Association.But a paper mill could cost up to 500m.However, RCP's Mr Baxter says investors are not going to step in unless there is a market for recycled goods, and he believes governments have a role to play."It's not just a case of recycling the material.It's having markets for the recyclates that are produced, and this is where government could come in."In the UK, he would like to see the government push local authorities and all government institutions to purchase recycled products.For Mr Bird, from LARAC, responsibility for tackling the long term problems of waste must lie throughout the global product supply chain, but especially with manufacturers.And he says one particular change could have a dramatic effect - the widespread adoption of Extended Producers' Responsibility."It means producers having to pay to ensure the products they are manufacturing can be dealt with in an effective, and environmentally cost-effective way."Meanwhile, the waste is piling up and the clock is ticking.Listen to Jamie Robertson's report on China's ban on waste imports here on BBC World Service's World Business Report programme.
The winemaker who battles temperatures as low as -25C:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption How the wines of Canadian winemaker Norman Hardie are winning fans around the world.With winter temperatures regularly dipping below -25C at his vineyard, winemaker Norman Hardie definitely didn't choose an easy place to grow his grapes."Minus 25 is the absolute death knell for vitis vinifera [the common grape vine], we actually have to bury our vines in the winter [to protect them].It's a huge job," says the 51-year-old."And then we can get snap spring frosts that can quickly ruin a crop.We lost more than 80% in 2015."While most of us associate winemaking with warm countries, Mr Hardie has since 2004 been making wine in Canada.Image copyright Johnny C Y Lam Image caption Norman Hardie Winery is currently continuing with its 2017 harvest Based in picturesque Prince Edward County, Ontario, a two-hour drive east of Toronto alongside Lake Ontario, the summers are more often glorious.The winters, on the other hand, are harsh, which means that the team at Norman Hardie Winery face a race against the cold weather every November."I have 80,000 plants today, so that is almost a quarter of a million canes [the vine's branches] that we have to tie down by hand, and then cover with a mound of earth," says Norman."Before we then carefully open up and untie in the spring."If that wasn't labour intensive enough, come April and May Norman and his team have to light fires and position wind turbines to try to drive away late frosts.But sometimes, such as in 2015, they just aren't that successful.Image copyright Johnny C Y Lam Image caption Norman Hardie says that Canada's cool weather helps him to make excellent wine Up against such challenges, you might question why Norman ever chose to plant vineyards and build a winery in Ontario.He says that despite the challenges, the combination of cool weather and the clay and limestone soil of Prince Edward County allow him to make world class wines."The great wines are always made on the edge, and we're certainly on the edge," says South African-born Norman, who prior to going into winemaking had been a sommelier (wine waiter) in Toronto."I'd rather be here than anywhere else in the world because the flavours we get out of these soils are unique."Image copyright Norman Hardie Winery Image caption While many wine regions around the world have cold winters, they aren't as cold as Canada's Primarily making white wines from chardonnay and red wines from pinot noir, Norman Hardie's wines now have a cult following in Canada, and are even said to be the favourite tipples of Canadian Prime Minster Justin Trudeau.But from day one, Norman - who studied winemaking in Burgundy, Oregon, California, South Africa, and New Zealand prior to establishing his own winery - wanted his wines to be sold internationally.This brought his next big challenge - how to persuade a sceptical world to take Canadian wine seriously, when even Norman admits that 30 years ago the country made "terrible wine".Image caption Canadian wine production remains a drop in the global ocean Norman's solution was to turn himself into a travelling salesman, and build up his wine's global reputation "one top sommelier one top buyer, and one top wine journalist, at a time flying around the world, pounding the pavement, speaking to people, changing people's ideas about Canada".So attending wine fairs, visiting wine importers, and knocking on the doors of Michelin-star restaurants, he started to slowly build up export orders.This is the first feature of a new 20-week series called Connected Commerce, which highlights companies around the world that are successfully exporting, and trading beyond their home market.Focusing particularly on the UK and New York, Norman says his personal, face-to-face approach enabled him to let some of the most influential people in the global wine world "understand what we're doing, why we're doing it, and how we are doing it".He adds: "You can only do that with face time, and once you have them they are your evangelists."From selling 6,000 bottles in 2004, Norman Hardy Winery produced 240,000 in 2016.From that 6,804 bottles were exported across eight countries - China, Denmark, Japan, New Zealand, Sweden, Taiwan, the UK, and the US.And he still is regularly overseas promoting his wines, including spending five to six days every year in the UK.Back at the winery, there are now six year-round employees, rising to 50 in the busy summer months and at harvest time in late September and October.The business now has annual revenues of 4.1m Canadian dollars ($3.3m; 2.5m).John Downes, a London-based wine expert, who has the top master of wine qualification, says that Norman was right to recognise the fact that as Canada is such a little known wine region he had to do a lot of marketing work to "stand out" on the global stage.Image caption Prince Edward County is now home to 40 wineries Mr Downes adds: "A lot of people in wine don't tell stories, they say 'here's my wine what do you think about it?'."But they don't tell the story behind the wine, and that gives the picture of the wine to the consumer.Norman does that very well."While exporting wine is not without its challenges, such as the need to produce different labels for each country, Norman says that building up a vibrant export business has also boosted his sales in Canada.Now preparing to bury the vines for another winter, Norman says: "That credibility, that international credibility, says you're doing something right."
The human cost of China's economic reforms:::::Image copyright AFP Luo Yanli is worried about the bad smell from the electric car factory over the road and what the fumes might be doing to her baby and toddler.Mr Yu is worried that millions of workers the Chinese government plans to lay off from failing state owned companies will be "abandoned" like he says he was 15 years ago.Mark Weinberger is worried about China's mountain of national debt, the possibility of bankruptcies and - ultimately - what it might mean for the thousands his multinational firm employs in China.All three tell me they support reforms to overhaul China's mammoth economy; but their stories, from three very different parts of China, reveal the consequences and anxieties associated with the changes.Health fears Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption What has China's president achieved so far?The early autumn nights are still warm and humid in Shenzhen where Yanli lives in the south of China.But she doesn't open the windows in her apartment because of the strong smell from the sprawling BYD electric car factory."Before we bought the apartment the developer told us the plant would move elsewhere" she says."After we moved here little seems to have changed."The factory was inspected last year after protests.Airtight seals were installed to contain the fumes.When we visited locals told us some production had been moved to another site.With her baby boy on her lap and her daughter playing with a plastic fork beside her, Yanli says: "The smell is very strong and it has severely affected out lives".They don't know if it's dangerous but, like most of their neighbours, they have plants in their apartment in the hope they'll absorb the smell seeping in.Image caption Luo Yanli has concerns about fumes from a local factory The complex is home to the world's biggest manufacturer of electric cars.BYD is a global leader in a technology that China hopes it can dominate; electric vehicles, and specifically the batteries that power them.The big push towards electric isn't just about industrial strategy, it's about trying to tackle China's immense pollution problems - the most obvious of which is dirty air.With incentives for infrastructure and aggressive quota demands for, mostly foreign, manufacturers, this is part and parcel of Beijing's effort to make China's economy less focused on government investment and cheap exports - and instead to one that is technologically advanced, with a sustainable base and driven by consumer spending.So is a bad smell and worries about fumes a price worth paying for this progress, I ask Yanli?Yes it is, she intimates.The windows are firmly shut, though.Survival of the fittest Almost 3,000km (1,800 miles) away in Shenyang, taxi driver Mr Yu points to where the lead smelting plant used to stand, where he worked.It's long gone, replaced by car dealerships and apartment blocks.You can buy a Cadillac where he used to walk through the now demolished main gate.It's 15 years since he was laid off in the wave of liberalising economic reforms with compensation of just over a year's salary - about $5,000 (3,700).Despite the years he gets visibly emotional when I ask if there's any part of the city that's still recognisable from his time as a steel worker.He says he was "abandoned" by the government.There was no training for a new job, no support aside from the pay-off.But two children and a taxi licence later he's a believer in reforms that bring competition to the market place.Image caption Mr Yu was laid off from his job as a worker and now drives a taxi "I think the rule 'survival of the fittest' should apply", he says as we drive around, "baggage should be cast aside" he adds.But there is also this, "isn't it true that the people should be properly settled?"They know a lot about "settling" workers in Shenyang.It's the capital city in China's weakest performing province.Liaoning was once the manufacturing heartland.Now it's trying to rescue the towns and cities around the coal mines and steel plants that help make up this country's "rust belt" and is about to get its first privately owned bank, called the "revitalisation" bank.Away from car dealerships and the mega malls we go to Linsheng on Shenyang's outskirts.Food and rubbish is dumped in piles on its main street.One ground floor apartment in a housing estate has a home-made pigeon coop in a bay window.Parts of the building are decaying.It's home for the workers at the nearby coal mine.As China tries to tackle chronic over-capacity in its traditional industries it's also moving away from dirty coal to heat homes and power its economy.Many mines are being mothballed.A bus driver outside Linsheng's pink-painted community hospital tells me he used to do 17 trips to the mine every day, now it's just seven."A lot of people have retired but the company is not able to hire new employees - nobody wants to come because the salary is low."Image copyright AFP Image caption A construction site in Shenyang, the capital of China's weakest performing economic province As the sun goes down a woman who runs a fruit stall says her business had taken a 30% hit in the last two years, which she puts down to workers' salaries falling.The market boss claims people are buying pork and making it last for two or three days instead of buying daily.A retired miner, who like most of the people we talk to in Linsheng doesn't want to go in front of a microphone, says income for some is down 50%.Still growing So what of taxi driver Mr Yu's call for "survival of the fittest"?President Xi Jinping shows little sign of going that far.It looks like his government's early pledge to enhance market forces - giving them a "decisive role" has remained just that, a pledge.Thousands of factories have been closed but that's as much about their polluting effect than their productive inefficiency.There have been consolidations in various sectors of the myriad state-owned enterprises.The (almost all state-owned) banks have come in with debt for equity deals - something close to a bail out - for the most troubled companies.But there hasn't been a wave of bankruptcies.Preserving social stability is likely to be the main reason for this.A wave of concentrated unemployment could see protests that could threaten order.Indeed 2016 actually saw increased cheap credit and a boost in government spending.Rather than an assault on inefficient state-owned entities, many going, only with increased - and cheaper - debt.Still, the world's second largest economy continues to grow, at rates many in the developed world would envy; 6.7% last year, but the rate of growth is slowing, a plateau is approaching.Debt bubble?Debt and risk are the two things that some think will combine to produce an economic catastrophe in China - but not Mark Weinberger, the CEO of EY, one of the big four accountancy firms."I don't see an impending catastrophe," he says, when we met in Shanghai: "The growth is still there to be able to pay off debt".Such optimism is perhaps not surprising from a man who advises the mayor of China's second city.But Mr Weinberger warns nobody should be complacent: "When the debt gets so large it crowds out growth because of the cost of that debt - that becomes a problem".And China's debt is huge; it is currently about 260% of annual economic output and is predicted to rise.What makes it particularly worrisome is that the bulk of this is held by state-owned corporate entities.Risky practice has been growing too, particularly around the so called "shadow banking" sector.So much so that Beijing cracked down on the insurance market in particular, and went after some of China's best known private firms who were deemed too risky in the way they raised money.Image caption EY chief executive Mark Weinberger says he doesn't see "an impending catastrophe" Firms who owned or had stakes in New York's Waldorf Astoria, Deutsche Bank, Club Med and Wolves FC were all targeted.It's steadied the boat, but that appears all.Other far more significant reforms have not yet happened; financial market reforms, substantial rural land reform, changes to the internal passport-like hukou welfare system.One thing that is happening though is a deepening of the role of "the party" at the top of China's state firms.There were reports this summer that foreign owned firms or joint ventures have been asked to give the Communist Party equal say over their major corporate decisions.Xi Jinping faces a multitude of challenges in his country's economy as he embarks on his second term at the top.Strengthening the party's hold on the means of production is one of Beijing's responses.
From torture victim to human rights student:::::Image caption Noura Al Jizawi has come to study in Toronto after escaping Syria's civil war Noura Al Jizawi has survived more than a decade of extreme risk.Now she's going back to her interrupted life as a student.Growing up in Homs in Syria, the 29 year old has been a student activist, experienced imprisonment and exile and has been a leader in Syria's opposition.Now eight months pregnant, she has gone back to her studies, beginning a master's degree at the University of Toronto's Munk School of Global Affairs.Noura's first awareness of human rights - and of their absence - came early: "I remember when I was just a kid, I was angry because we couldn't choose our notebooks."We could have only one type of notebook - one with a photo of Assad's father on it."Missing persons She soon learned that other, much worse things were wrong with her country.Image copyright Reuters Image caption Homs this summer showing the damage of war "Many of the students, a couple of years older than me, were mentioning their missing fathers.I became aware we had missing persons in Syria."While I was growing up, I remember hearing mothers supporting each other... they were the mothers of missing persons."Those guys were the detainees arrested by Assad's father in the 1980s.Some of them are still until this moment missing there were no bodies, there was nothing, just silence."Activism and arrests Noura came up against the regime as an undergraduate at the University of Homs - and reading books such as George Orwell's Animal Farm chimed deeply with her own experience.More from Global education Ideas for the Global education series?Get in touch.Noura's increasing activism, her work as a blogger, publishing imaginative allegorical fiction, and her readiness to speak out, led to two early arrests.Nevertheless she continued this dangerous work, accessing forbidden websites to distribute anti-regime articles, disseminating ideas of democracy and non-violent protest."We never believed there would be a real revolution in our lifetimes," she said.And then, in December 2010, the Arab Spring began in Tunisia, and spread rapidly, arriving in Syria with a demonstration in Damascus in March 2011.Image copyright Reuters Image caption A mother in Homs with a locket of her lost son "For me it was like a dream.We have a revolution."Noura was still in Homs, but was in touch with activists around the country, and abroad.She became an organiser of demonstrations and an advocate for the rapidly rising numbers of detainees.Social media In the response that followed, many of her friends were killed, many others imprisoned and tortured."To be honest we were not shocked, we knew too well that this regime would not allow people to demand their rights."They were more shocked, she said, by the lack of any effective response from the international community."We were saying, back in the 70s and 80s, when there were great massacres in Syria, there was no internet, there no media channels."But we thought, now we have the social media channels, hopefully this would protect us.But it did not protect us."Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Noura's young life has been against a background of war: A fighter in Homs Noura moved from city to city, organising, motivating, dodging the authorities - until in May 2012, she was ordered off a bus in Damascus by armed men and bundled into a car."It was not an arrest, it was abduction, a kidnapping," she said.Tortured in prison Noura emerged seven months later.During that time she was detained in some of Syria's most notorious prisons, and said she had been tortured with electric shocks and beatings.She plays this down, saying that so many have endured - and are still enduring - far worse.For her the hardest experience to bear was hearing the sounds of her fellow-prisoners being tortured.Her captors realised this psychological torture would be more effective in her case - but still she remained silent.Noura explained how she survived: "I was not afraid for myself, I didn't care about myself...I cared only about the revolution I cared about the people who were still continuing this revolution outside."Image copyright Reuters Image caption Homs this summer showing the damage of war "We were still a non-violent movement on the ground... and I kept thinking about them...I wanted to make sure that in the questioning I would not speak about any one of those activists.I would pray to my body not to break down."Noura was released late in 2012, and believes that an international campaign played a part in this: "For sure, all of those activities protected me.That is why we need this advocacy, all the time, for all detainees and for missing persons."For Noura, the torment continued, as her younger sister, Alaa, had also been imprisoned and was suffering even worse: "They tortured her harder than me, many times, because of me."Alaa was released in a terrible physical state; the family decided they had to leave Syria, and fled to Turkey to get urgent medical treatment."She was my only reason to leave Syria," said Noura."Otherwise I would still be there."Image caption Noura became a representative in peace talks in Geneva In four years of exile in Turkey, she joined the coalition of Syrian opposition forces, (SNC) and became its vice-president in 2014, as well as being elected to sit on its negotiation panel in Geneva.She joined because she realised this much-criticised group of mainly male, middle-aged "hotel revolutionaries" needed "the blood of youth" and also a strong female voice.Geneva was a real challenge for Noura: "I felt I had to be calm and clever, I had do everything I could do, to interact."She worked hard to get an agreement to break the two-year siege of Homs.Many of its surviving citizens were dying of starvation.'Scholars at risk' Noura resigned from the coalition in 2016, but continued working for an NGO she had created, Start Point, which provides advocacy and psychological support to Syrian women who have suffered torture and sexual violence in detention.She had also met her husband in Turkey, another Syrian activist in exile, who was one of a network of cyber-security experts working for the Munk School's Citizen Lab; hence the Toronto connection.Noura came to Canada as one of 24 international students with scholarships in the university's "scholars at risk" programme.With her daughter due to be born next month, Noura is aware of how this might change her activism.But she's determined not to give up the fight.She sees the master's degree as another step to help her continue her work to bring democracy to Syria."I feel also that being a mother makes me closer to the future... this baby is the future, and maybe will not have to live as our generation live."
From sweets to furniture: The secrets of selling online:::::Image copyright Geoff Pugh Image caption Lavinia Davolio says selling her luxury sweets on Amazon Marketplace has been good for business What are the best ways to sell online?And how do you make sure you have a website that really works?Part one in our eight-part series exploring all things e-commerce.Lavinia Davolio makes luxury handmade sweets inspired by her Italian heritage.She says her business received a boost when she opened a store on Amazon's Marketplace."It's easy for clients to discover something unique and handmade if it's available through such a trusted online platform," she says."And it means we can offer convenient next day delivery at a competitive price and give our boutique confectionary an incredible reach and visibility."Lavinia is one of thousands of small businesses who've decided to set up shop on an e-commerce marketplace - Amazon, eBay, Etsy, Alibaba's Taobao, Rakuten to name some of the largest - rather than go through the hassles of setting up their own websites.Amazon charges retailers a 15% commission, but in return even the very smallest entrepreneurs can get a slice of the retail titan's global pulling power just by uploading images and descriptions of their products and then setting their pricing.For an additional fee, Amazon will store and dispatch your goods - the kind of one-stop convenience that is ideal for newbies, suggests Alan Braithwaite, a visiting professor at Cranfield School of Management.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Despite the convenience of online shopping, people still love the physical store "Something like Amazon Marketplace is a no-brainer," he says."Entry costs are very low and straightaway you have a very wide marketplace at your fingertips."When you're starting out with your own website you're having to attract the traffic, which means a lot of search engine optimisation [SEO].This can be complicated and mean extra costs if you need outside help."Some e-tailers want more creative control over their online shops, however -

Can these beads stop 'history's biggest mass poisoning'?:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption A handful of these resin beads can save lives The beads of resin may not look like much but they could save hundreds of thousands of at-risk people in Bangladesh and parts of India.Human Rights Watch says up to 20 million people are at risk from arsenic poisoning in Bangladesh.Millions have already suffered from what the World Health Organisation calls "the biggest mass poisoning in human history".Millions of "tube-wells" have been dug across Bangladesh since the 1940s.The simple pumps were rolled out across the country by the government and NGOs from the 1970s onwards as a way of delivering cost-effective bacteria-free water.However during the 1980s cases of arsenic poisoning began to emerge.Arsenic can not be seen or smelt; the first signs of its impact are skin lesions which only emerge once the poisoning has taken place.The poisoning can set off a range of heart diseases and cancer and the external symptoms look a lot like leprosy, which can lead to victims and their families being shunned by the local community.A heavy price Image caption Siaton Nessa says arsenic poisoning has ruined her life and affected her family as well Siaton Nessa Meherpur has lesions on her skin from arsenic poisoning.She's in her mid-50s and she says the disease has blighted her entire family."Because of this well my whole skin is filled with black patches," she says."I am worried about my children because no one is prepared to marry them."While the government has made efforts to replace the wells, in many rural areas they are still the primary source of water especially as many families have dug their own tube wells.Human Rights Watch estimate 43,000 people die each year in Bangladesh from illnesses caused by arsenic poisoning.New solutions Image caption Minhaj Chowdhury's Drinkwell is offering an "entrepreneurial solution" to the water crisis Minhaj Chowdhury, 28, was raised in the United States but visited family in Bangladesh during school holidays."It shocked and deeply saddened me to think how we never had to worry about water being fatal in the US but here in Bangladesh one in every five deaths was associated with unsafe drinking water," Mr Chowdhury says.After his grandfather died due to a disease linked to water he decided to take action.The BBC's Innovators series reveals innovative solutions to major challenges across South Asia.Ever heard of the concept of "jugaad"?It's a Hindi term meaning cheap innovation.If you have created a life hack or innovation that you are proud of, or spotted one while out and about on your travels, then share your picture with us by emailing yourpics@bbc.co.uk, use the hashtags #Jugaad and #BBCInnovators and share your picture with @BBCWorldService, or upload your submission here.Learn more about BBC Innovators.In 2013 he founded Drinkwell, in partnership with Dr Arup K SenGupta who invented a particular type of resin technology and had already been active in implementing it in India.The resin removes arsenic and other harmful substances from water and once it has been used Drinkwell filters the water through a series of other tanks to take out other harmful substances.The water is sold locally by "Drinkwell" entrepreneurs and the money raised is used to maintain the system.The pricing is set depending on location but a monthly subscription costs anywhere between $0.05 (4p) and $0.12 for 20 litres (4.4 gallons) a day.Entrepreneurial opportunity According to the United Nations, 30% to 50% of all water projects fail after huge investments because of a failure to maintain the facilities.Image caption Drinkwell entrepreneur Habibur Rehman's plant in Manikganj, Bangladesh sells 150,000 litres a day Dr Khairul Islam, the country director for the charity Water Aid in Bangladesh' believes that social entrepreneurs have a role to play in tackling the arsenic poisoning.Dr Islam told the BBC that the main problem so far has been operation and maintenance.Because Drinkwell includes operational and maintenance costs at the centre of its model he says it is the kind of model "this country needs".The first Drinkwell plant began dispensing water in the Manikganj district in 2015.Today that one plant alone has 750 daily customers and dispenses 150,000 litres a day.The network has grown across the country, often by going into schools to deliver safe drinking water for students' meals, from there the word spreads across communities.There are now 30 Drinkwell filtration plants in India and Bangladesh serving more than 100,000 people.Mr Chowdhury believes this is just the start for Drinkwell.He hopes to eventually reach hundreds of millions of people across Asia.He is already talking to the Bangladesh government about rolling out the technology across the country.By involving the communities in the maintenance through their entrepreneur network Mr Chowdhury believes the system can provide clean water "forever".
The 'working class boy' who built a £1bn business:::::Image copyright RationalFX Image caption Mr Davdra's wife recently treated him to a new Harley Davidson Paresh Davdra is thrilled about the brand new Harley Davidson waiting for him in a friend's garage.It's not a sign of a mid-life crisis, he insists, but a wedding present from his wife who he married in August.He just has one more test to pass to get his motorcycle licence, then he can hop on the bike and whizz around London for meetings.The boss and co-founder of money exchange firm Rational FX, which reported revenues of more than 1bn ($1.3bn) last year, has a life that's worlds apart from his parents and grandparents.They were forced to flee Uganda in 1972 when dictator Idi Amin gave the Asian population just 90 days to leave the country."They came to the UK with just 50 between them," says the softly-spoken Mr Davdra."My grandfather had his own tailoring shop, but they had to leave everything behind."His family pulled together and bought a house in Harrow, north London, with his dad securing a job as clerk, and later as a financial controller, at a foreign exchange broker.Image copyright RationalFX Image caption Paresh Davdra co-founded RationalFX in 2005 Their fighting spirit rubbed off on the younger Davdra."We were never really given anything - if I wanted something, I had to earn it."From the age of 16, he spent the school holidays holding jobs in a mobile phone shop and in telesales, while out of term at Middlesex University, he worked at his dad's firm, taking up roles from filing to working in compliance.He studied marketing and computer science at university, but tells me that technology does not come naturally to him."If you told my team I had this degree, they wouldn't believe you.I'm always the one calling IT to connect the laptop to the printer," he laughs.As soon as Mr Davdra graduated, in 2003, he joined his dad's company as a foreign exchange dealer, helping clients to buy and sell large quantities of foreign currencies.He was in the role for just over a year, working with Indian-born Rajesh Agrawal, a friend of his father's who had arrived in the UK in 2001.But two factors would spur him to quit."I'd tried to buy a property with my dad but the bank rejected the mortgage application," Mr Davdra says."It deflated me."Image copyright RationalFX Image caption RationalFX is based in Canary Wharf, London At the same time, Mr Agrawal resigned from his IT manager role."When he decided to quit, I badgered him.I asked him to tell me what he was doing," Mr Davdra says.The two met for coffee and quickly agreed they wanted to set up a company together.The idea was to support customers buying property abroad with their currency needs."Everything we were doing at the old firm was manual, but we thought we could offer the same service online," Mr Davdra says.However, the duo faced a serious challenge: money.Mr Davdra was only a year out of university and had already taken out a personal loan to buy a BMW.When Mr Agrawal took their business plan to the bank and asked to borrow 10,000, he was swiftly rejected.But he returned a few days later and asked for 20,000 to buy a car.The bank said yes."I then sold my BMW and we were set," says 37-year-old Mr Davdra, who also moved into Mr Agrawal's home to save on rent.Image copyright RationalFX Image caption Mr Davdra's grandfather had to flee Uganda in 1972 With just 32,000 between them, the pair launched their foreign exchange brokerage, RationalFX, in 2005.Like many start-ups, the next difficult task was signing up customers."We got on the phones and started pitching to estate agents and attended every property industry event there was," recalls Mr Davdra."We'd be in the office all day from 8am, then we'd just be at it in the evenings."Their big breakthrough came when they signed a number of estate agents who were selling properties in Dubai.However, just two years after launching, the financial crisis hit.Mr Davdra reflects candidly on how it changed his young mindset.More The Boss features, which every week profile a different business leader from around the world: "I was 27 at the time and the business was doing great guns, and I was well on my way to being rich.That's all I thought about it."It wasn't really about building a business - that comes with time and maturity.But the crash brought that along.It was a good learning curve."Rational FX also felt the fall-out from the crash, with its growth slowing.But it weathered the storm and went on to diversify.Today, its clients range from high-net worth individuals, either buying property or making investments, to medium-sized businesses, such as firms exporting cars or importing textiles.Image copyright RationalFX Image caption RationalFX employs 110 people It reported revenues of 1.3bn in 2016, up from 1.1bn the year before, and pre-tax profits of 2.3m - largely because the firm reinvested heavily in its business, Mr Davdra says.After enjoying success with Rational FX, the founders had an idea for an offshoot company - an online money transfer platform aimed at individuals sending lower sums to family overseas."We felt that Rational FX was driving revenues, but Xendpay [the new company] was more of a social initiative, to try and bring the costs of remittance down for people working hard to bring their families out of poverty."Xendpay has a "pay what you want" model, although it does suggest a minimum commission of 0.3-0.4% of the transaction.Mr Davdra says that more than 70% of users pay the suggested fee, 10% hand over more, and the rest pay nothing.The platform isn't profitable yet, although Mr Davdra expects it to break even next year."It was a bit of gamble but a risk we were willing to take."'Still growing' Last year Mr Agrawal stepped down from the firm after he was appointed Deputy Mayor of London for Business.He still owns 70% of the business, and is a non-executive director, while Mr Davdra holds the remaining shares.Mr Davdra says he "misses him"."Apart from business, over the last 12 years we have developed a good relationship.He's a very very close friend."For now, there are no plans to sell RationalFX, although private equity firms approach the firm "an average of twice a day"."Our brands are still growing and are quite young.It's all about the right opportunity," Mr Davdra says.Headquartered at Canary Wharf, RationalFX and Xendpay together employ 110 members of staff.Despite his penchant for expensive bikes and cars, Mr Davdra - who still lives in Harrow - has his feet firmly on the ground."I think we're pretty humble.We're working class, and we just do normal stuff.It's the way we've been brought up."
How the humble S-bend made modern toilets possible:::::Image copyright Alamy "Gentility of speech is at an end," thundered an editorial in London's City Press, in 1858."It stinks!"The stink in question was partly metaphorical: politicians were failing to tackle an obvious problem.As its population grew, London's system for disposing of human waste became woefully inadequate.To relieve pressure on cess pits - which were prone to leaking, overflowing, and belching explosive methane - the authorities had instead started encouraging sewage into gullies.However, this created a different issue: the gullies were originally intended for only rainwater, and emptied directly into the River Thames.That was the literal stink - the Thames became an open sewer.Image copyright Alamy Cholera was rife.One outbreak killed 14,000 Londoners - nearly one in every 100.Civil engineer Joseph Bazalgette drew up plans for new, closed sewers to pump the waste far from the city.It was this project that politicians came under pressure to approve.The sweltering-hot summer of 1858 had made London's malodorous river impossible to politely ignore, or to discuss obliquely with "gentility of speech".The heatwave became popularly known as the "Great Stink".Unlikely figure If you live in a city with modern sanitation, it's hard to imagine daily life being permeated with the suffocating stench of human excrement.For that, we have a number of people to thank - but perhaps none more so than the unlikely figure of Alexander Cumming.50 Things That Made the Modern Economy highlights the inventions, ideas and innovations that helped create the economic world.It is broadcast on the BBC World Service.You can find more information about the programme's sources and listen online or subscribe to the programme podcast.A watchmaker in London a century before the Great Stink, Cumming won renown for his mastery of intricate mechanics.King George III commissioned him to make an elaborate instrument for recording atmospheric pressure, and he pioneered the microtome, a device for cutting ultra-fine slivers of wood for microscopic analysis.Image copyright Alamy Image caption Alexander Cumming's S-bend was crucial in the development of the flushing toilet But Cumming's world-changing invention owed nothing to precision engineering.It was a bit of pipe with a curve in it.In 1775, Cumming patented the S-bend.This became the missing ingredient to create the flushing toilet - and, with it, public sanitation as we know it.Simplicity Flushing toilets had previously foundered on the problem of smell: the pipe that connects the toilet to the sewer, allowing urine and faeces to be flushed away, will also also let sewer odours waft back up - unless you can create some kind of airtight seal.Cumming's solution was simplicity itself: bend the pipe.Water settles in the dip, stopping smells coming up; flushing the toilet replenishes the water.While we've moved on alphabetically from the S-bend to the U-bend, flushing toilets still deploy the same insight.Image copyright Alamy Rollout, however, came slowly: by 1851, flushing toilets remained novel enough in London to cause mass excitement when introduced at the Great Exhibition in Crystal Palace.Use of the facilities cost one penny, giving the English language one of its enduring euphemisms for emptying one's bladder, "to spend a penny".Hundreds of thousands of Londoners queued for the opportunity to relieve themselves while marvelling at the miracles of modern plumbing.If the Great Exhibition gave Londoners a vision of how public sanitation could be - clean, and smell-free - no doubt that added to the weight of popular discontent as politicians dragged their heels over finding the funds for Joseph Bazalgette's planned sewers.More than 170 years later, about two-thirds of the world's people have access to what's called "improved sanitation", according to the World Health Organization, up from about a quarter in 1980.That's a big step forward.Economic cost But that still means two and a half billion people don't have access to it, and "improved sanitation" itself is a relatively low bar.It "hygienically separates human excreta from human contact", but it doesn't necessarily treat the sewage itself.Fewer than half the world's people have access to sanitation systems that do that.More from Tim Harford: What the dynamo reveals about technological revolution Battery bonanza: From frogs' legs to mobiles and electric cars How the lift transformed the shape of our cities How air conditioning changed the world The economic costs of this ongoing failure to roll out proper sanitation are many and varied, from health care for diarrhoeal diseases to foregone revenue from hygiene-conscious tourists.The World Bank's Economics of Sanitation Initiative has tried to tot up the price tag.Across various African countries, for example, it reckons inadequate sanitation lops one or two percentage points off gross domestic product (GDP), in India and Bangladesh over 6%, and in Cambodia 7%.That soon adds up.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Open sewers are a common sight in Kibera, in Nairobi, Kenya The challenge is that public sanitation isn't something the market necessarily provides.Toilets cost money, but defecating in the street is free.'Positive externality' If I install a toilet, I bear all the costs, while the benefits of the cleaner street are felt by everyone.In economic parlance, that's a "positive externality" - and goods that have positive externalities tend to be bought at a slower pace than society, as a whole, would prefer.The most striking example is the "flying toilet" system of Kibera, in Nairobi, Kenya.The flying toilet works like this: you defecate into a plastic bag, and then in the middle of the night, whirl the bag around your head and hurl it as far away as possible.Replacing a flying toilet with a flushing toilet provides benefits to the toilet owner - but you can bet that the neighbours would appreciate it, too.Contrast, say, the mobile phone.That also costs money, but its benefits accrue largely to me.That's one reason why, although the S-bend has been around for 10 times as long as the mobile phone, many more people already own a mobile phone than a flushing toilet.If you want to buy a flushing toilet, it also helps if there's a system of sewers to plumb it into, and creating one is a major undertaking - financially and logistically.Image copyright Otto Herschan Image caption Joseph Bazalgette, standing top right, views the Northern Outfall sewer being built below the Abbey Mills pumping station in 1862 When Joseph Bazalgette finally got the cash to build London's sewers, they took 10 years to complete and necessitated digging up 2.5 million cubic metres (88 million cubic ft) of earth.Because of the externality problem, such a project might not appeal to private investors: it tends to require determined politicians, willing taxpayers and well-functioning municipal governments.And those, it seems, are in short supply.According to a study published in 2011, just 6% of India's towns and cities have succeeded in building even a partial network of sewers.The capacity for delay seems almost unlimited.Geographical quirk London's lawmakers likewise procrastinated- but when they finally acted, they didn't hang about.As Stephen Halliday recounts in his book The Great Stink of London, it took just 18 days to rush through the necessary legislation for Bazalgette's plans.What explains this sudden, impressive alacrity?Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The Houses of Parliament, photographed in 1858, the year of the Great Stink A quirk of geography: London's Parliament building is located right next to the River Thames.Officials tried to shield lawmakers from the Great Stink, soaking the curtains in chloride of lime in a bid to mask the stench.But it was no use.Try as they might, the politicians couldn't ignore it.The Times described, with a note of grim satisfaction, how MPs had been seen abandoning the building's library, "each gentleman with a handkerchief to his nose".If only concentrating politicians' minds was always that easy.Tim Harford writes the Financial Times's Undercover Economist column.50 Things That Made the Modern Economy is broadcast on the BBC World Service.You can find more information about the programme's sources and listen online or subscribe to the programme podcast.
What is happening with Japan Inc?:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Japan's reputation for precision manufacturing is coming under more pressure Japan has long been held up as a shining example of integrity, assured quality and reliable products.But the deepening scandal at Kobe Steel over falsified figures could further tarnish the Made in Japan brand.Kobe's troubles started when it admitted last weekend to faking data about the quality, strength and durability of some of the materials it delivered to more than 200 companies including Boeing, Nissan and Toyota.On Friday it said the number of firms involved had risen to 500.The news has wiped out about $1.8bn (1.3bn) off Kobe Steel's market value this week.But with at least half a dozen major Japanese companies admitting to fraud and misconduct in as many years, questions are being raised over why this keeps happening and if there's a systemic problem in Japan.'Cutting corners' Experts say the long term slowdown in economic growth from the 1990s onwards has been a major contributing factor.It has forced Japanese firms to change their business models, and this appears to have taken its toll."Large corporations used to live in a stable, predictable and growing market, but things have changed and some companies may have resorted to cutting corners," says Takuji Okubo, managing director and chief economist of Japan Macro Advisors, in Tokyo.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Kobe Steel's Hiroya Kawasaki apologised for the "tremendous trouble" the firm had caused Until two decades ago, Japanese firms were focussed on growth strategies but the realisation that their economy would no longer grow as strongly anymore meant companies had to concentrate on restructuring, cost-cutting and extreme efficiency.Speaking to the BBC, Martin Schulz, senior research fellow at Fujitsu Research Institute in Tokyo says these painful adjustments have seen some companies struggle "to adjust to the new rules of the game".The push to improve efficiencies made management desperate to show positive results, sometimes even testing the limits of quality control, he says.Mr Schulz adds core-employees and managers have been stretched to the limit, which in some cases, resulted in overwork and misconduct.But the need to open up new markets overseas to boost profits has created other problems for Japanese firms, especially at their subsidiaries abroad.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Kobe Steel is Japan's third largest steelmaker Florian Kohlbacher, director of the Economist Corporate Network for North Asia, says some companies tried to grow too quickly by expanding overseas without having enough experienced managers to supervise operations.Detecting fraud The misconduct at Kobe Steel follows scandals at carmakers Nissan Motor and Mitsubishi Motors, as well as car airbag-maker Takata Corp, which filed for bankruptcy in June after a global recall sparked by 16 deaths and many injuries.Just two weeks ago, Nissan Motor recalled 1.2m vehicles that had been certified by unauthorised technicians.And the electronics giant Toshiba Corporation is still reeling from the consequences of an accounting scandal in which its profits were inflated.Despite the prevalence of such high profile cases, experts say quality and compliance remain paramount in Japan.But they still expect more scandals involving fraud and misconduct to be uncovered in future.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Manufacturers of cars, trains and planes are checking if they used sub-standard Kobe Steel materials Mr Kohlbacher says this is partly because new technology such as the internet of things and sensors have made it easier to detect wrongdoing, errors and fraud, while digitisation has helped to spread information about problems and improve transparency.While it is still unclear how the data tampering at Kobe Steel was uncovered, "in a more transparent corporate environment, companies have to come clean on mistakes and misconduct much earlier," says Mr Schulz.Expect more scandals Furthermore, more fraud and misconduct scandals are also expected to be uncovered as a result of laws to protect whistleblowers that came into effect in 2006.The most explosive case came to light five years later when Michael Woodford, the British president of Olympus, became the most senior corporate figure in history to blow the whistle on his own company.His revelations uncovered a $1.4bn (880m) accounting fraud scandal in which the Japanese medical and equipment firm hid investment losses dating back to the 1990s.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Quality control questions at Kobe Steel could further erode trust in Japanese firms Mr Kohlbacher says more people have reported wrongdoings since the laws were enacted but it is difficult to confirm exactly how many people have been able to use the legislation to raise the alarm about wrongdoing in their companies.And debate still rages in Japan on whether whistleblowers are adequately protected because the laws do not provide for penalties against companies that punish staff by dismissing or demoting them.Some argue there are further safeguards from wrongdoing provided by Japan's Consumer Affairs Agency, which opened in 2009.Image copyright Reuters Image caption The news has wiped out about $1.8bn off Kobe Steel's market value It was created following several accidents caused by substandard products and a number of food poisoning scandals including a case involving Chinese dumplings."Any manufacturer that had a defective product would once have been dealt with by a government ministry but the Consumer Affairs Agency took over these responsibilities," says Keith Henry from the consultancy firm Asia Strategy.Mr Henry adds that the new reporting system focuses much more on the consumer rather than the manufacturer, with regulatory authorities willing to investigate and prosecute cases of misconduct.Rebuilding the brand Some people believe the unwanted spotlight on Japanese firms could actually have a positive effect."There seems to be wide agreement now that just focusing on costs and increasing profitability won't be sufficient as future strategies," says Mr Schulz.Mr Kohlbacher says he now expects "companies to have a close look at their operations and make sure they amend any problems before they turn into something major".But some warn tougher penalties are needed for companies that fail to meet government standards because self-regulation does not always appear to work.Citing the recent Dentsu case last week in which the Japanese advertising giant was only fined 500,000 yen (US$4,400; 3,321) for breaching labour regulations, Mr Okubo says "I think there's something very wrong here."But rather than highlighting a systemic problem in Japan, Mr Okubo says the prevalence of misconduct cases was evidence that "corporate governance in Japan is working" because firms are reporting internal problems so that they can be dealt with.As for companies that want to distance themselves from the fraud and misconduct, he says: "It is about time that each manufacturer stops branding itself as 'Japanese' and instead starts to build their own brand".
Formula One teams' costs rocket after rules changes:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Lewis Hamilton during the Japan F1 Grand Prix Next weekend Britain's Lewis Hamilton could secure his fourth Formula One title at the United States Grand Prix.His Mercedes team is a staggering 145 points ahead of arch-rivals Ferrari despite the sport introducing rules this year which aimed to put the brakes on the dominance of a single outfit.They came at a hefty cost.The new regulations were designed to make for closer racing by increasing aerodynamic and mechanical grip through the introduction of wider tyres and wings.According to one of the teams it has "rewritten" the rulebook and the impact is just as noticeable off track as on it.But if some had hoped the rules might stop Mercedes from running away with the F1 championship they will have been disappointed.Ironically, they have also forced up its rivals' costs.Only the frontrunners have had the resources to foot the bill from their cashflow whilst one of the outfits lower down the grid even had to get a driver to cover the cost.Research has revealed that new regulations fuelled a 167.6m increase in the F1 teams' costs in 2016.They rose 14.5% to hit a combined 1.3bn - the highest-ever total recorded in the sport.F1 cars are designed the year before they race so the bulk of the investment in them is paid for then, too.It means that the cost of this year's campaign is reflected in the teams' 2016 accounts and the final one of them was filed last week.Eight of F1's ten teams have to file publicly-available accounts - the only exceptions are Ferrari as its outfit is run by the car manufacturer itself, and Swiss-based Sauber where firms don't have to release their finances.The costs of the teams' operating companies came to an average of 165.9m in 2016, topped by Northamptonshire-based Mercedes which spent 274.9m excluding the investment in its engines.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption F1 teams' costs rose 14.5% to hit 1.3bn last year It is the highest ever total recorded on the accounts of a British F1 team and even eclipses the turbocharged spending levels before the 2008 economic crash which drove Toyota and Honda out of the sport.At the other end of the spectrum is last year's new entrant Haas F1 which spent a third as much as the championship leaders.Haas has managed to keep its costs down by taking advantage of a new rule allowing teams to buy in more parts than before.Haas uses a Ferrari engine with a chassis created by Italian manufacturer Dallara which also makes the cars for the F2 junior series.Relying on suppliers reduces research and development expenditure which, along with staffing and engine costs, is one of their biggest costs - it rose across the board in 2016 as teams had to design cars to meet the new regulations.They were introduced by F1's governing body the Federation Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) to address criticism that the outcome of races was clear before they started due to the dominance of Mercedes.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Haas has kept costs down by buying in more parts than before With Hamilton at the wheel it has won both the constructors' and the drivers' championship for the past three years running.This year is set to be no different but there has been a far higher price to pay.Writing in the introduction to its accounts Mercedes' team boss Toto Wolff notes that there has been "an increase of 27.9m in operating costs mainly due to the impact of technical regulation changes and movement in foreign exchange rates".The 2016 accounts for Force India, also based in Northamptonshire, give more insight into the effort required to meet the new rules.It says that combined with the change in tyre-sizes "our traditional method of retaining 50% of the previous season's car and updating the remaining 50% is not possible for 2017".Over 90% of Force India's car this year is completely new.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Force India has helped cover its increased costs with cash from driver Nikita Mazepin The team planned to cover its increased costs with income from an unlikely source: a driver contract signed with Russian youngster, Nikita Mazepin, "secured a cash injection ahead of significant regulation changes ahead of the 2017 season", said Force India.Mazepin was just 16 when he signed up last year and he has tested for the team twice since then, most recently in July after the Hungarian Grand Prix.He has ample resources to pay as his father Dmitry became a billionaire through owning the mineral fertiliser producer Uralchem.Despite this, Force India still chalked up a net loss of 11.6m - the largest of any team in 2016.The regulation changes even dented the bottom line of British manufacturing giant McLaren.Its went from a net 3.4m profit in 2015 to an after-tax loss of 3.2m the following year.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption For F1 teams, victory on the track is more important than making a profit Overall the teams made a combined net loss of 2m last year.Perhaps surprisingly this is nothing new as unlike most businesses, profit is not the barometer of success in F1.Instead teams judge their performance on racing results and tend to spend all of their income on this in a bid for victory.Some even pump in more than they make, with additional funds usually coming from owners' pockets or debt.The theory is that it is better to win and make no profit than make money and finish low in the standings.Victory on track increases a team's ability to bring in more sponsorship,, as brands are prepared to pay more to be associated with a winner.The teams' revenue generally comes from three sources with two providing the lion's share.They are fuelled by F1's huge television audience (390m viewers last year).The first key revenue source is sponsorship which comprises around a third of the teams' revenue, Another third comes from prize money.F1's parent company, which is owned by American investment firm Liberty Media, pays the teams around 66% of its annual profits as prize money and it came to $985.5m (742m) in 2016.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Despite numerous failed attempts there are new proposals to introduce a budget cap for F1 teams Payments from owners represent around half of the teams' remaining revenue and the marketing benefit from the exposure on TV compensates for this investment.If costs increase these payments often rise to compensate and last year Red Bull poured in four times more money into its flagship team.Its investment into Red Bull Racing hit 40.6m as costs surged 9.2% to 197m.As its owner has deep pockets Red Bull Racing doesn't need to rely on drivers who pay but income from them is the remaining source of revenue for F1 teams.They are a hallmark of teams at the bottom of the grid but their days could be numbered.Despite numerous failed attempts F1 hasn't given up on introducing a budget cap and recent reports suggest that Liberty Media will shortly present plans to the teams for introduction in 2021 when their current race contracts expire.But it will be the sport's governing body, the FIA, that will ultimately decide on any changes A limit of 114m has been suggested and this would level the playing field as the smallest teams are already below this whilst the frontrunners would have to scale back.Although it may seem like a logical direction for the sport to go in it would make the recent boost in spending seem all the more pointless.
Interest rate rise to cause 'some pain', says bank deputy:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Ben Broadbent is the bank's deputy governor for monetary policy The rise in UK interest rates will cause "some pain" for homeowners, but should be kept in context, a Bank of England deputy governor has said.Ben Broadbent told the BBC that the rate rise announced on Thursday was "moderate", and that interest payments on debt were still at record lows.The Bank raised rates from 0.25% to 0.5%, the first hike in 10 years.Mr Broadbent also said that the Bank's signal of two more rate rises in the next three years was "not a promise".Almost four million households face higher mortgage interest payments after the rate rise.Households on variable or tracker mortgages will see their monthly costs increase by about 15, according to Nationwide.Savers will see a modest lift in their returns, although Barclays, HSBC and Lloyds are yet to announce if they will pass the full rise on to customers.'Pain' Asked if households - already seeing inflation outpace wage growth - would suffer some "pain" from the rate rise, Mr Broadbent agreed they would.But he told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme: "I think one should keep the scale of this in context."Not all home owners have variable mortgages, and interest payments on debt are "lower than they've ever been relative to income", he said.Virgin Money chief executive Jayne-Anne Gadhia, was also reassuring.She told the Today programme: "People shouldn't worry - I don't think that credit card rates will go up.It's not quite so directly associated with the bank rate as mortgages are."I think that what this particular base rate increase does is just say to customers be thoughtful about what you're spending and manage your own financial position well."Two more Mr Broadbent was one of seven members on the Bank's nine-person Monetary Policy Committee to vote for a rate rise.He said he had changed his mind because of rising inflation and unemployment hitting record lows.Bank governor Mark Carney signalled on Thursday that rates were likely to rise twice more over the next three years.Mr Broadbent repeated that prediction, saying the rises could be needed to "get inflation back on track while at the same time supporting the economy".But he added: "That is not a promise, and it never could be a promise."The Bank estimated in its Quarterly Inflation Report, released with the announcement on rates, that inflation was likely to peak this month at 3.2%.
Interest rates: What will the rise mean for you?:::::Image copyright Getty Images The rise in base rates will produce both winners and losers.The winners will include 45 million savers, who are likely to see higher returns from savings accounts.A number of providers have already announced they will be increasing savings rates in line with the rise.Those planning on buying an annuity to finance their retirement will also benefit.But for at least four million households with variable rate mortgages, monthly payments are set to rise immediately.So how will you be affected?Variable rate mortgages Across the UK, 9.2 million households have a mortgage.Of these, around half are on a standard variable rate (svr) or a tracker rate, amounting to between four and five million households.These are the people who will be most affected, as their monthly payments will increase.Those on such variable rates tend to be older, and with relatively small outstanding mortgage balances.On average, such households owe 89,000, and will face rises of between 11 and 12 a month, according to UK Finance.Change on variable rate mortgages Outstanding balance current monthly payment increase 50,000 225 6 100,000 450 13 150,000 675 19 200,000 900 25 250,000 1,125 32 300,000 1,350 39 Source: UK Finance Base: current mortgage rate 2.53% 25 year term Fixed rate mortgages The vast majority of new mortgage loans - 94% - are on fixed interest rates, typically for two or five years.Currently half of all outstanding loans are on fixed rates, equating to around 4.5 million households.While such rates have already started to increase, in expectation of the rate hike, borrowers will see no immediate rise.However, when such borrowers reach the end of their term, they may find they have to make higher monthly payments.That said, they could - depending on when they took out their loan - end up on a cheaper deal.Lenders offering fixed rates tend to be especially competitive.Image copyright Getty Images Savers The average easy-access savings account is currently paying 0.14% in annual interest, according to the Bank of England.So someone with 10,000 worth of savings is earning 14 a year.If the rate rise is fully passed on, they would earn an extra 25 a year, making 39 in total.A saver with 10,000 in a typical cash Individual Savings Account (ISA) would see their income rise from 30 a year to 55.Following the Bank's decision, Nationwide, TSB, Skipton and Yorkshire Building Society have promised to increase their variable savings rates.Mark Carney, the Bank's governor, said he expected other providers to follow suit.However, as the chart below shows, that is still a long way from the annual returns that were available just two years ago.One problem in recent years has been that banks and building societies have been able to borrow money from the Bank of England very cheaply, so they haven't needed to compete for deposits from savers.The Funding for Lending Scheme (FLS) and the Term Funding Scheme (TFS) have therefore helped to depress returns for savers."The good news for savers is that both the FLS and TFS are ending at the beginning of 2018, so perhaps providers will start to need funds from savers once more," said Anna Bowes, a director of Savings Champion."This will hopefully really make a difference."Annuities The rate rise is also good for retirees buying an annuity - or income for life.Annuity rates follow the yields - or interest rates - on long-dated government bonds, otherwise known as gilts.With the expectation of rising base rates, these yields have also been rising, giving retirees better value for money when they buy an annuity.Back in November 2011, a 65 year-old buying a join annuity for 100,000 would have got an annual income of 5,404.Last year that had dropped by 1318 to 4086.However this month the figure has risen back to 4468.Depending on how the market views the likelihood of further base rate rises, annuity rates may continue to creep up.According to Willliam Burrows, of Better Retirement, a 1% rise in gilt yields translates into an 8% rise in annuity rates.But we are still a long way from the heady days of the 1990s, when a 100,000 pension pot would have bought an annual income of around 15,000 a year.Long-term impact As Mark Carney is fond of reminding us, future rises in base rates will be small, and the pace will be gradual.So while the impact of the first hike may be small, someone with a mortgage advance of 150,000 could eventually find themselves paying as much as 161 a month more, according to figures supplied by the Halifax, Britain's largest lender.
We challenged 10-year-olds to explain a system that baffles many adults…:::::Video Would you be able to explain what the Bank of England Monetary Policy committee is?Or what interest rates are?Thats the challenge we gave to a group of ten year olds from Sale in Greater Manchester.Kate, Dylan and Nate were born in 2007, the year that interest rates last rose.The Bank of England base rate peaked at 5.75% in July 2007 before falling to a record low of 0.25%.WARNING!Sadly several jelly bankers WERE harmed in the making of this video.This clip is originally from 5 live Breakfast on Wednesday 1 November 2017.
UK interest rates rise for first time in 10 years:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The Bank of England may lift rates twice more over three years For the first time in more than 10 years, the Bank of England has raised interest rates.The official bank rate has been lifted from 0.25% to 0.5%, the first increase since July 2007.It is likely to rise twice more over the next three years, according to Bank of England governor Mark Carney.The move reverses the cut in August of last year, which was made in the wake of the vote to leave the European Union.Almost four million households face higher mortgage interest payments after the rise, but it should give savers a modest lift in their returns.As well as many of the country's 45 million savers, anyone considering buying an annuity for their pension will also see better deals.The main losers will be households with a variable rate mortgage.Mr Carney expects banks to pass on the rate rise to savers, but said many mortgages, loans and credit cards would not see an immediate impact.He said that British households have been "savvy" with their finances and have mostly taken out fixed-rate mortgages, which means it will take some time before the rise has an impact on them.The Bank estimates that almost two million mortgage holders have not experienced an interest rate rise since taking out a mortgage.Of the 8.1 million households with a mortgage, 3.7 million - or 46% - are on either a standard variable rate or a tracker rate - which generally move with the official bank rate.The average outstanding balance is 89,000 which would see payments increase by about 12 a month, according to UK Finance.The panel which sets interest rates, called the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), justified the rate increase by pointing to record-low unemployment, rising inflation and stronger global economic growth.Seven out of the nine members voted in favour of higher rates.Mr Carney told the BBC that the Bank expected the UK economy to grow at about 1.7% for the next few years, which he said would require "about two more interest rate increases over the next three years".Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption We challenged some ten year olds to explain a system that baffles many adults The pound fell about 1% against the dollar and euro, as some investors had hoped to see hints of more rate rises.Sterling dropped more than a cent against the two currencies to $1.3130 and 1.1280 respectively.Brexit impact The financial markets are indicating two more interest rate increases over the next three years, taking the official rate to 1%.Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club consultancy, said: "The Bank of England seemingly sees the hike to 0.50% as more likely to be a case of 'one and a little more to come' rather than 'one and done'."The MPC also said that the decision to leave the European Union is having a "noticeable impact" on the economic outlook.Mr Carney said "Brexit-related constraints" on investment and workers appeared to be holding back the potential growth of the economy.Looking ahead, he said: "The biggest determinate of our outlook is going to be those negotiations ongoing on Brexit - both a transition deal to a new arrangement and what is the longer form arrangement with the European Union."The Bank of England is tasked with keeping consumer price inflation at around 2%.However, inflation has been running higher than that since February, and in September it hit 3% - the highest rate since April 2012.Mr Carney said inflation was unlikely to return to 2% without raising rates, because the economy was growing at levels "above its speed limit".Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Where were you when interest rates last went up?Business bodies said the rise was expected, but warned that companies could be hit if further increases came too soon.The Federation of Small Businesses said some would struggle to "absorb more hikes in the short term", while the CBI said "what's important is the pace of any future rises".Economists said the rise was unlikely to have a big effect on the economy, because rates are still at the lows seen since the financial crisis.Lucy O'Carroll, chief economist at Aberdeen Standard Investments, said: "The symbolism of this hike is more significant than its economic impact."Price pressures The Bank has been reluctant to raise interest rates until now, arguing that inflation had been boosted by the fall in the value of the pound since the Brexit vote in June of last year.That weaker pound has driven up the costs of imported food, fuel and other goods.The Bank says this effect is probably at its peak at the moment.The other issue holding back the Bank has been the weakness in wage growth.While inflation hit 3% in September, wage growth was only 2.1%.However, the Bank sees wage growth "gradually" increasing over the 2018 and says there are signs of that happening already.In its Quarterly Inflation Report, released with the announcement on rates, the Bank estimated inflation was likely to peak this month at 3.2%.Do you have a question about the interest rate change?What do you need to know about the change?E-mail us at haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk.You can also contact us in the following ways:

Interest rates: How the MPC voted:::::Image copyright PA There was quite a change to the voting profile of the nine experts that make up the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) headed by Bank of England governor Mark Carney.Five members of the panel changed their position compared with the previous interest rate meeting in September.Here's the full list of who voted and how.Mark Carney, Bank of England Governor In late September Mr Carney hinted that he might be inclined to raise interest rates, having previously voted to keep them on hold.But Mr Carney has hinted at interest rate increases in the past, but then not voted for them, which has earned him the nickname "unreliable boyfriend".This time he did make the switch.Ben Broadbent, Deputy Governor of Monetary Policy Mr Broadbent switched his position to support a rate increase.Always measured with his words, it has been hard to discern his position.But he is seen as a strong supporter of the Bank governor.Andy Haldane, Chief Economist Mr Haldane said in June that the Bank needed to "look seriously" at raising interest rates.So his decision to support a rate rise is not a big surprise.Silvana Tenreyro, external MPC member Ms Tenreyro was only appointed to the MPC in June.She voted to keep rates on hold in September, but has switched.At her appointment hearing in October she said that if slack continued to disappear within the economy then she would be "minded" to vote for an increase.Gertjan Vlieghe, external MPC member Mr Vlieghe also changed his view.In September he said: "We are approaching the moment when Bank Rate may need to rise".Those five were joined by two MPC members who had previously voted for an interest rate increase.Ian McCafferty, external MPC member Mr McCafferty has voted for rate increases frequently over the last few years.In July, he said that an interest rate increase would be the "prudent thing to do".Michael Saunders, external MPC member Mr Saunders has been voting for a rate increase since June.In August he said "a modest rise" in interest rates was needed to curb high inflation.Sir Jon Cunliffe, Deputy Governor, Financial Stability Two members of the MPC voted to keep interest rates on hold.Sir Jon was one of them.Minutes from the latest meeting showed that he and Sir Dave Ramsden argued that there was a lack of evidence that wage growth was accelerating at a significant pace.Last month he said he did not see "sustained signs of domestic inflation pressure".In an interview with BBC Radio Wales he said that the timing of possible future interest rate increases as an "open question".Sir Dave Ramsden, Deputy Governor, Markets and Banking Sir Dave was the other MPC member who voted to keep rates on hold.Speaking to MPs on the Treasury Committee last month, he said he did not believe a rate rise would be needed "in the coming months" because wage growth showed few signs of picking up.
