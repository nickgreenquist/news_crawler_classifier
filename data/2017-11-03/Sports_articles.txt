Jets play their style of football in 34-21 victory:::::EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- There was one team that looked like a playoff contender Thursday night.It wasn't the Buffalo Bills.Buffalo's pursuit of AFC East kingpin New England was stymied by the New York Jets, who controlled the line of scrimmage on both sides in a 34-21 win that never was close in the second half.Matt Forte ran for two touchdowns four days after complaining the Jets didn't run the ball enough, and an overwhelming defense sacked Tyrod Taylor seven times."We played to what we do best," Forte said."Our offensive line likes to come off the line straight ahead and hit guys in the mouth and wear guys out like that.I think we started to wear them out as the game went on, and you saw some runs pop here and there."Buffalo (5-3) came in having scored 64 points in its last two wins, but self-destructed with turnovers and miscues.New York (4-5) snapped a three-game slide in which it held leads in each defeat."We've got a high ceiling," defensive tackle Leonard Williams said."We showed we can get takeaways, we showed we can get sacks, we showed we can stop the run.This is our first game putting it all together in a complete game.I feel like now that we showed it and put in on film, we'll definitely challenge ourselves to keep progressing."Forte scored on runs of 10 and 5 yards and had 14 carries for 77 yards.Augmenting that was Bilal Powell with a 51-yard burst and 74 yards on nine carries.Quarterback Josh McCown got in on the fun with a 10-yard scramble to open the scoring, and New York rushed for 194 yards overall.Jordan Jenkins had two of the Jets' sacks as they never allowed Buffalo's offense to get on track.Indeed, mistakes were the Bills' trademark."We came into their house and they just outplayed us," Taylor said."They were really aggressive today and played to their strengths."We have to stop the negative plays.Tonight we had turnovers on offense and that's not our style of play."Buffalo made a key error on New York's second touchdown drive.Cedric Thornton sacked McCown, but grabbed his face mask.The 15-yard penalty, which followed a 20-yard pass to Jermaine Kearse and a 22-yard run by Forte, led to Robby Anderson beating double coverage for a 25-yard TD reception.Forte's 10-yard run made it 24-7 and came one play after Powell broke four tackles on his 51-yard jaunt that featured slick moves and plenty of speed.The Bills hurt themselves further when Nick O'Leary fumbled on a strange play.The tight end caught Taylor's third-down pass and fell to the ground untouched.He delayed, heard no whistle, and got up.But the ball then was stripped by Marcus Maye and recovered by fellow rookie safety Jamal Adams.Adding to the miscues, Bills defensive end Jerry Hughes drew a 15-yard unsportsmanlike conduct penalty for mouthing off to an official -- during a timeout, no less -- on the ensuing Jets drive.Taylor also fumbled when sacked for the sixth time, and Forte's 5-yard TD run followed.And even when the Bills recovered a late onside kick, they were flagged for offside.New York opened the scoring -- the fourth straight game it has led early -- after some strong defense pinned Buffalo near its goal line.A punt set up the Jets near midfield and they used eight plays to score.McCown, looking very spry for a 38-year-old QB, went in untouched around the left side on a scramble for a 7-0 Jets lead.Buffalo matched that, aided by Taylor's 18-yard scramble on third down.Rookie Zay Jones caught his first pro TD, an 11-yarder when he got wide open over the middle.An offensive pass interference call on Austin Sefarian-Jenkins' touchdown catch negated the tight end's TD early in the second quarter and the Jets settled for Chandler Catanzaro's 45-yard field goal to retake the lead.He later hit a 32-yarder.The Jets found a pass rush that was missing in action most of the year.They came in with 11 sacks, which was last among teams that had played eight games.Buffalo scored two late touchdowns to make the final margin less lopsided."We were outplayed fundamentally.We weren't very good," coach Sean McDermott said.J-E-T-S Fireman Ed, once the team's unofficial cheerleader, led the J-E-T-S chant for the first time this season.It got pretty loud, too, even though there were several thousand empty seats at MetLife Stadium.INJURIES Bills: Jones, who was having a fine first half with four catches for 40 yards and a touchdown, was tripped by cornerback Buster Skrine and injured his right leg and was helped off.Jones, Buffalo's second-round draft pick, returned for the second half, but aggravated the leg.Running back Taiwan Jones hurt his left arm in a scramble for a fourth-quarter onside kick.Jets: WR Jeremy Kerley left in the first quarter with an ankle injury.LB Bruce Carter (hamstring) was sidelined in the second half.UP NEXT Bills: Host New Orleans on Nov. 12.Jets: Visit Tampa Bay on Nov. 12.
Ducks meet Predators looking to get back on track:::::TUNE IN: When: 7:00 PM PT Where: Honda Center TV: Fox Sports San Diego/Prime Ticket As always, game will be streaming live on FoxSportsGO ANAHEIM, Calif -- The first regular-season matchup between last season's Western Conference playoff finalists, the Nashville Predators and the Anaheim Ducks, finds the teams in an unaccustomed position.Entering a Friday matchup at Honda Center, the teams are playing mediocre hockey and struggling to find consistency.Nashville (5-5-2) plays the middle contest of its three-game California road trip after dropping a 4-1 decision to the San Jose Sharks on Wednesday.Despite possessing a power play that executes among the best in the Western Conference, the Predators rank next to last in overall goal production.The San Jose loss was a microcosm of the Predators' early-season play, as Nashville managed only 19 shots and got no production from its forwards.Winger Filip Forsberg is the lone Predator to register double-digit points with eight goals and five assists, with more than half of his production coming on the man advantage (five goals, two assists).Predators coach Peter Laviolette discussed his team's shortcomings after the San Jose loss.The inability to finish chances and coupled with the propensity to commit penalties resulted in a fourth loss in five games."We had opportunities to execute in the offensive zone and we didn't capitalize," Laviolette said."Not a lot of opportunities for them, but the ones they did get they made the most of.We continue to shoot ourselves in the foot with the penalties."Predators defenseman Roman Josi concurred with his coach, citing the procession to the penalty box as an continuing issue."Once again, we took way too many penalties," Josi said."We had some momentum, we scored on the one shift and then we take two, three penalties and it just kills our momentum.We have to be way more disciplined than that."Anaheim has been besieged with injuries since the start of the season, but Ducks coach Randy Carlyle refused to use the injuries as the primary reason for the club's 6-5-1 start.The lineup that fell to the Toronto Maple Leafs 3-1 on Wednesday was missing Ryan Getzlaf and Kevin Bieksa, both on injured reserve.The Ducks have 62 man-games lost, the most in the NHL entering Thursday and a primary reason the team has played inconsistent hockey through the first month.The Ducks' normally high-powered offense has struggled with absences of Getzlaf and power-play quarterback Cam Fowler, who is expected to miss three to seven weeks with a knee injury.The Anaheim power play has taken the brunt of the injury woes, converting only 10.8 percent of its attempts, which ranked 30th in the NHL through Wednesday.With a bit more puck luck, the Ducks could have emerged with at least a point against Toronto, but a potential game-tying goal by Jakob Silfverberg with 1:38 remaining in regulation was waved off due to a distinct kicking motion."It looked like he turned his foot, so the referee felt he directed the puck with a kicking motion.If that's the way he deemed it, then it's no goal," Carlyle said."As far as we are concerned, you can turn your foot, but I don't know if that deems it a distinct kicking motion."Ducks defenseman Hampus Lindholm was dissatisfied with the defeat knowing his team has to fight through the rash of injuries to stay competitive in the Pacific Division."We have to build from this effort," Lindholm said."You cannot be satisfied not scoring goals.We have to go out and work even harder."The Swede was sidelined for the first seven games of the season recovering from offseason shoulder surgery."I'm feeling better and better, but there are parts of my game I still need to work on," he said."I can be better getting to the puck in my defensive zone, and my shot needs to get through more often to create second chances at the net."
Federal appeals court states Elliott can play vs. Chiefs:::::NEW YORK (AP) -- Dallas Cowboys running back Ezekiel Elliott can play in Sunday's home game against Kansas City while a federal appeals court considers a challenge to his six-game suspension.The 2nd U.S.Circuit Court of Appeals in New York City issued a one-page order Friday temporarily blocking a lower-court ruling that cleared the way this week for Elliott to begin serving the disciplinary penalty.Circuit Judge Susan Carney granted a request from the NFL Players Association for Elliott to be allowed to play Sunday.In the meantime, a three-judge panel will decide whether the appeal will be handled in expedited fashion and whether Elliott will continue to be allowed to play before the appeal is decided.The suspension was imposed in August after the NFL investigated several alleged physical confrontations in the summer of 2016 with Elliott's girlfriend at the time.The NFL submitted papers to the 2nd Circuit on Thursday, arguing that the appeals court should not block the suspension any longer because the union has no chance of winning its appeal.It said "swift discipline" should not be manipulated by players and teams seeking to strategically time court challenges so that suspensions are served when they play weaker opponents or when an injury would already require a player to remain off the field.Lawyers on both sides did not immediately return messages seeking comment Friday.U.S. District Judge Katherine Polk Failla ruled Monday that the 22-year-old player must begin the suspension.Lawyers for the players' union said Failla was the first judge ever to have "concluded that professional athletes with short career spans do not face irreparable harm" when suspensions are enforced before appeals options have been exhausted.The NFL said about 100 players have been suspended for approximately 500 games over the past season and a half.The Cowboys (4-3) are in second place in the NFC East.They face a Chiefs team that is 6-2 and leads the AFC West.

Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce is among NFL's best receivers:::::KANSAS CITY, Mo.(AP) -- The list of the league's most productive receivers since the midway point of last season reads as what you might expect, highlighted by Pittsburgh's Antonio Brown right on top.Mike Evans is there.So are T.Y.Hilton and Brandin Cooks.But the second-most productive pass-catcher is not Julio Jones or Odell Beckham Jr., DeAndre Hopkins or Stefon Diggs.In fact, the name right behind Brown on the list isn't a wide receiver at all.It happens to be Travis Kelce.The Chiefs tight end has a team-high 44 catches for 556 yards and four touchdowns this season, giving him 102 catches for 1,405 yards going back to Week 8 last season.By comparison, Brown has 115 grabs for 1,527 yards over that span, and Evans is third with 95 catches for 1,295 yards."He's a freak.That guy's a freak athlete and he's a great guy," said Broncos defensive tackle Derek Wolfe, who was roommates with Kelce during their college years at Cincinnati."He's out there making plays.He's an emotional guy.And he's a great guy to have in the locker room."Indeed, there are few players who generate more energy in the locker room than Kelce, whose ability to catch passes, block in the run game and do the dirty work doesn't go unnoticed.The rest of the team seems to feed off him, a rarity for a position that for years was underappreciated.But the emergence of Rob Gronkowski in New England, Jimmy Graham in New Orleans and Seattle and Kelce in Kansas City has brought renewed focus -- and importance -- to the tight end position.In many ways, Kelce is redefining it."We put a lot on his plate and move him around and do a lot of different things," said quarterback Alex Smith, adding that the Chiefs offense essentially runs through Kelce."He's involved in the run game, he's involved in the pass game, he's involved in protection a lot of times, too.There is no other position where you are involved in all three of those, really."Kelce isn't without his faults, of course.That exuberance has produced more than one personal foul over the past couple of years, including a costly one during the Chiefs' playoff loss to Pittsburgh last season.More than once, Chiefs coach Andy Reid has had to grab Kelce coming off the field and give him a father-to-son dressing-down.His dancing ability leaves a lot to be desired, too.He unveiled a particularly goofy jig after scoring in Monday night's victory over Denver, bringing chuckles from fans and teammates alike.Kelce finished the game with seven catches for 133 yards, despite turning an ankle -- the only consistent production Kansas City could muster against the league's top-ranked defense."I want the ball every single play.That's just how I grew up playing," Kelce said."I was a quarterback because I loved having the football in my hands when I was growing up, and sure enough, when I moved to tight end in college, I've always been the same way."What makes Kelce an especially dynamic pass-catcher is his versatility.He can run the underneath routes like a slot receiver, has enough speed to beat linebackers and safeties down the field, and his size makes him a comfortable target for his quarterback in the red zone."He's just a matchup problem," Smith said."Bigger than most corners.Route running-wise he's a tough matchup for safeties and linebackers, so it's a little bit, `Pick your poison.'He's had success throughout his career versus all three of those matchups, just finding a way."It doesn't matter that defenses have planned to stop him, either."Obviously he does a heck of a job understanding what they're doing to him, how he combats it," Smith said."He always seems to have a comeback move off of it.He knows how teams play him."His consistency may be what is most impressive.He surpassed 3,000 yards receiving earlier this season, moving past Fred Arbanas for second among tight ends in Chiefs history, and he's hauled in a catch in 56 straight games to trail only Stephone Paige (83) and Tony Gonzalez (131) among Chiefs players.In fact, Kelce is setting his sights on a lot of the records that Gonzalez, one of the best to ever play the position, set during his time in Kansas City."He's one of the best," Reid said, "if not THE best in the business."

Off-Beat Badgers preview: I love Drunch:::::If you are looking for hard-hitting analysis, yeah, this aint it.But if you want a fun, entertaining read, youve found the right place.For more of Brandon Rifkin, please head to his blogor follow him on Twitter.Surprise, surprise: 8-0 Wisconsin is 9th in the playoff rankings, behind a bunch of one-loss teams.THIS IS NOT SURPRISING.Stay the damn course, win like you've never won before, and everything will fall into place.It is known, Khaleesi.There are too many damn things to stress about in life, and our ranking in early November is not on that list.No time to dwell any further.Let's get on with it and beat IU.RANDOM MUSIC WE'RE DIGGING HARD THIS WEEK Caught them at Bottom Lounge for the second time and these guys are officially on must-see threat level purple status when they come to town.There's really not anyone like them out there right now based on my non-existent research.Someone called their frontman a combo of Freddie Mercury and Steven Tyler and that seems oddly appropriate.Big time expectations on their second album.Can't wait.BIG TENFEAR RANKINGS 1.Ohio State, 7-1 (5-0).I guess we can all agree it was good for the conference that OSU/PSU was essentially decided by the home-field advantage, right?Both teams look really good.Wait.Maybe it's BAD for Wisconsin if OSU and PSU look really good?Isn't the enemy of our enemy supposed to be our friend?Ugh.2.Penn State, 7-1 (4-1).I think just to be safe we root for PSU to lose again and 11-1 OSU to meet us in Indy.Because OSU in Indy usually works out really well for us.3.Wisconsin, 8-0 (5-0).The Illinois game was mindlessly boring, but it was all worth it for Deiter's touchdown.That was the fattest fat guy touchdown the world could ever give us.Possibly the best fat guy touchdown since B.J.Raji was shimmying in the end zone at Soldier Field what feels like 15 years ago.More Badgers coverage 4.Michigan State, 6-2, (4-1).Not sure how they lost to the nerds, but we can assume Evanston had something to do with it.Pissed-off MSU hosts pissed-off PSU this week and someone's gonna be SUPER pissed off once that one's over.5.Michigan, 6-2 (3-2).We are also officially rooting for Michigan to clean up every game except in Madison in a few weeks.I hate rooting for them as much as you do.Trust me.6.Nebraska, 4-4, (3-2).Switching gears to UW hoops for a second because they just pollywopped Northern Iowa in an exhibition game by 30 bones.I won't pretend to tell you a single thing about this year's Northern Iowa team, but that school is usually pretty legit.All you need to know as hoops season comes into focus: KOBE!Seriously, we have a Kobe!I'm so excited to yell KOBE every time he launches a shot.I want to name a child or a dog Kobe.What a great name.Kobe Rifkin, stud city.Brad Davison is going to be that guy other teams think has been in college for 12 years.Since I'm socially required to compare a white basketball player to only other white basketball players, Davison is essentially a more talented Josh Gasser.And I say that as a HUGE Gasser fan.Davison is simply more skilled offensively and+/- one standard deviation from Gasser defensively depending on how he pans out.He and Kobe are gonna be pretty damn fun to watch together.I'm still not sure what to expect from the bigs not named Happ.They're all in various states of intrigue, but nothing is jumping out and making me feel warm and fuzzy.Even though this laptop on my lap is currently 500 degrees.Solid contributions from Iverson, AVV, or Thomas will go a long way in making this team successful.Happ(y) hit a three: 7.Northwestern, 5-3, (3-2).I don't really understand the allure of sitting directly behind home plate at a baseball game.You are on TV the entire game and if your brain shuts off for ONE SECOND the entire internet has a GIF of you picking your nose.I just can't imagine that's worth the risk.It's 2017, I am 31 years old and few things scare me more than becoming a bad mm.8.Rutgers, 3-5 (2-3).No one is as upset as I am to see the end of the Rutgers Winning Streak.Life had meaning while they were winning.The sun was shining a little more brightly.Now it's cold and rainy and all we're left with is a top-5 undefeated team we actually care about.9.Maryland, 4-4 (2-3).OMG, I was the victim of THIEVERY this week!Some butthole stole a package from the front of my building!LET'S CHECK THE TAPE: I've been completely obsessed with this since the second my neighbor shared the video: WHO DOES THIS?What a lame kind of criminal: the one that sneaks onto your property and shakes a box to make a decision about whether or not the contents are probably worth taking.AND GUESS WHAT MR. CRAPPY THIEF: you stole yourself a book on dog reactivity, chicken flavored dog treats, doggy dental chews and a nifty little pouch to carry dog treats and poop bags on walks.Fortunately this doesn't look like one of the annoying bums that have dogs, so I hope you enjoyed that adrenaline rush before opening up a doggy goody bag.I immediately joined all the neighborhood watch groups I could and posted the video just in case someone recognized the perp.I quickly learned thatthere's a lot of package theft in Chicago.This sucks.I also sent the video the local police department and their response was basically "meh, you can file a report if you want."COOL THANKS GUYS.I guess I didn't really expect much from them but I was hoping they would promise me they'd put their BEST guys on it.Have I spent the previous two days imagining all the ways I'd catch him in the act and tail him while talking to the police and then call out "SWARM SWARM" when we had him cornered?Or what I'd do if I saw him cruising around the neighborhood?My imaginary justice is SWIFT.The only scary thing is that he CLEARLY cased the joint first.Knew that package was up there and rode on over while I was walking my dog.Was he waiting for me to leave?Did he know I was working from home while that package was delivered?WHY couldn't I catch him in the act!"A-HA!I HAVE CAUGHT YOU PACKAGE THIEF!"This is basically Dwight Schrute's dream.No I haven't considered leaving a fake package with dog poop in it, that's a crazy thing to do.Doo doo.10.Iowa, 5-3, (2-3).If you can't tell, the package theft has consumed my life.My eyes are officially OPEN every time I step outside now.Hey package thief, I GON' FINNNND YOU, I GON' FINNNND YOU Badgers all-time databases 11.Minnesota, 4-4, (1-4).I'm pretty sure my biggest culinary dream is to be able to cook chicken and not need to constantly probe with a thermometer to feel confident it is cooked and will not give me salmonella and e. coli and chicken rabies.Undercooked chicken haunts my dreams.Someone teach me the ways.12.Purdue, 3-5 (1-4).I'm like 2/3 the way through "Stranger Things," and while it's a relief that the second season is still quite good, the episode where Eleven joins the motley crew in Chicago was a little too much.Trying too hard to give her something to do before she rushes back to save everyone.Also: Dustin and Steve is a freaking dream team, and the Jonathan/Nancy shipping is cliche blah trash.Double Also: Max's brother is just an angrier, more athletic version of Andy from Wet Hot American Summer.And not NEARLY as funny.13.Indiana, 3-5 (0-5).As I'm writing this I see that the naked chicken chips are BACK at Taco Bell!That's an immediate must-add as a complementary item in your TB order.This is also zero percent surprising since they've been stuffing them in quesadillas for the last few months.p.s.-- I need to know if I can get a CGC with those in there instead of beef.NCCCGCwCRS sounds a little too good to be true, the 21st century flying too close to the sun on wings made of tacos.14.Illinois, 2-6 (0-5).I have nothing to say about Illinois, so I'll instead state the obvious in noting how much of a bummer Game 7 of the World Series was after the previous six games.What a letdown, but good for Houston.No one neutral actually wanted the Dodgers to win, that's crazy talk.THIS WEEK'S GAME IN HAIKU No time for let ups Gotta stay undefeated Too soon for heartbreak YOUTUBE It's EMOTIONAL TRIBUTE LIVE PERFORMANCE WEEK.First up we are getting choked up despite not being huge Linkin Park fans as they perform Numb with a spotlight on the mic.The crowd belting out every word is amazing.Love it.Now we skip over to a different tribute and listen as thousands sing Cornell's vocals to Like A Stone, which is a certifiably badass song.Lastly we go to one of my favorite covers of all-time: George Michael filling in more than admirably for a deceased Freddie Mercury.Too good, too sad.#FOODPORN Ooooo it was DRUNCH night and TOTCHOS WERE ON THE MENU.We are talking about tater tots, crumbled sausage, peppers, onions, jalapeos, and cheese baked to perfection and topped with some fresh pico.AND fresh, crispy fried eggs.WHAT MORE COULD A HUMAN WANT oh how about some challah french toast with a dash of cinnamon.GOD BLESS YOU DRUNCH I LOVE YOU.p.s.-- Drunch was initially our invented brunch for dinner concept which I concede makes little to no sense.Most people assumed it meant drunk brunch, which makes equally as little sense.Drunch is what you make it.Drunch is what you believe it to be.p.p.s.-- My brunch gameplan is always maximizing my drink selection, and drunch followed in those footsteps: Zombie Dust, ros, a latte, and some agua because drunch can be healthy!#allthedrinks PREDICTION CITY Now is not the time.Bloomington is not the place.IU is not the team.The inevitable heartbreak remains on the horizon, but it cannot be now.It cannot be.(I)U SHALL NOT PASS.THE PICK: WISCONSIN 43, Indiana 13 *** ON WISCONSIN
Week 10 preview: Bedlam at its best; Heisman RB rebounds:::::The first College Football Playoff rankings are out and seven games matching ranked teams this weekend have the potential to make the second rankings look much different.The seven ranked vs. ranked games match a record for one week in the history of the AP poll.It's happened five times previously, the last in 2015.Also, unlike many Saturdays, the best games aren't stacked up in one time slot.Usually, the television networks stuff the prime-time window with most of the day's best games.Last week, the 3:30 ET window was overloaded and had fans wearing out their remotes and firing up multiple screens.On Saturday, a fan can watch games matching ranked teams from noon (No.3 Ohio State at Iowa) until whenever (hash)Pac12AfterDark (No.23 Arizona at No.17 Southern California) ends.Things to know about week 10 of the college football season.BEST GAME No.8 Oklahoma at No.11 Oklahoma State Two of the top five offenses.Two Heisman Trophy contender quarterbacks.Two teams with playoff hopes that can't afford another loss.When it comes to Bedlam, it doesn't get much better than this one.Baker Mayfield and the Sooners have won the last two meetings against Mason Rudolph and the Cowboys, though Rudolph hardly played in the 2015 meeting.In the last five meetings, both teams have scored at least 20 points and the winner has reached 33 points in all those games.By the numbers, the Cowboys have the advantage on the defensive side, ranking 19th in the country in yards allowed per play (4.79).The Sooners defense has been a problem, ranking 71st in the nation (5.63 yards per play).HEISMAN WATCH Mayfield and Rudolph both have a chance to make Heisman statements, but two running backs trying to bounce back are the pick here.Penn State's Saquon Barkley was held to 44 yards on 21 carries last week in a loss to Ohio State, though he did have a 97-yard kickoff return for a touchdown and another long scoring run.The seventh-ranked Nittany Lions try to rebound from their first loss of the season against No.24 Michigan State and its stingy run defense, allowing 2.83 yards per rush.Later, No.20 Stanford hopes to have Bryce Love back in action against No.25 Washington State.The Cardinal played without the nation's leading rusher last week against Oregon State, and barely escaped with a last-second victory.NUMBERS TO KNOW 6 -- No.1 Alabama's winning streak against LSU, the longest in the series since the Crimson Tide won 11 in a row from 1971-81.13 -- Seasons in which Miami has been a member of the Atlantic Coast Conference without reaching the league championship game.The ninth-ranked Hurricanes can clinch their first division title by beating No.13 Virginia Tech at home and having Georgia Tech lose at Virginia.Even if the Yellow Jackets don't help, the Hurricanes will be in great shape with a victory to earn a trip to Charlotte.36 -- Number of plays of at least 30 yards for Arizona, the most in FBS.That includes four runs of at least 70 yards from quarterback Khalil Tate.75 -- J.T.Barrett's completion percentage during Ohio State's six-game winning streak.UNDER THE RADAR Can Florida and Florida State get bowl eligible?Both need November winning streaks to get there, and that includes a game against each other.Any chance the Gators (3-4) and Seminoles (2-5) have to salvage their disappointing seasons starts Saturday with games that before the season would have appeared to be gimmes.Florida plays its first game under interim coach Randy Shannon at Missouri.Florida State hosts Syracuse.Both Florida and Florida State had games cancelled by the hurricanes in September and, for now, will play only 11 games.HOT SEAT WATCH Kevin Sumlin, Texas A&M The Aggies are in danger of another second-half swoon after losing at home to Mississippi State last week to drop to 5-3.Now, No.14 Auburn comes to College Station.The road team has won each meeting between these teams since A&M joined the SEC in 2012.Sumlin has not been able to get over the eight-win hump in his last three seasons and Aggies fans want more.To do so, Texas A&M needs to upset the Tigers.11 View Gallery Mark D.

Federal appeals court: Cowboys' Elliott can play Sunday:::::NEW YORK (AP) -- Dallas Cowboys running back Ezekiel Elliott can play in Sunday's home game against Kansas City while a federal appeals court considers a challenge to his six-game suspension.The 2nd U.S.Circuit Court of Appeals in New York City issued a one-page order Friday temporarily blocking a lower-court ruling that cleared the way this week for Elliott to begin serving the disciplinary penalty.Circuit Judge Susan Carney granted a request from the NFL Players Association for Elliott to be allowed to play Sunday.In the meantime, a three-judge panel will decide whether the appeal will be handled in expedited fashion and whether Elliott will continue to be allowed to play before the appeal is decided.The suspension was imposed in August after the NFL investigated several alleged physical confrontations in the summer of 2016 with Elliott's girlfriend at the time.The NFL submitted papers to the 2nd Circuit on Thursday, arguing that the appeals court should not block the suspension any longer because the union has no chance of winning its appeal.It said "swift discipline" should not be manipulated by players and teams seeking to strategically time court challenges so that suspensions are served when they play weaker opponents or when an injury would already require a player to remain off the field.Lawyers on both sides did not immediately return messages seeking comment Friday.U.S. District Judge Katherine Polk Failla ruled Monday that the 22-year-old player must begin the suspension.Lawyers for the players' union said Failla was the first judge ever to have "concluded that professional athletes with short career spans do not face irreparable harm" when suspensions are enforced before appeals options have been exhausted.The NFL said about 100 players have been suspended for approximately 500 games over the past season and a half.The Cowboys (4-3) are in second place in the NFC East.They face a Chiefs team that is 6-2 and leads the AFC West.
Ascending Pacers hope for Turner's return vs. 76ers:::::The surprising Indiana Pacers hope to have more good news before Friday night's road game against the Philadelphia 76ers.Center Myles Turner, out since the season opener with a concussion, is hoping to return.Turner warmed up before Wednesday's 124-107 victory over the Cleveland Cavaliers and will be re-evaluated prior to Friday's game, according to the Indianapolis Star."I can't wait to get out there, filling in as that missing piece," Turner told the newspaper.Without him -- not to mention four-time All-Star Paul George, who was traded to the Oklahoma City Thunder in the offseason -- the Pacers have gone 5-3.Their victory in Cleveland was their third straight.All five starters scored in double figures in that game, led by ex-Sixer Thaddeus Young with 26 points.The Pacers also shot 54.4 percent from the field, including a blistering 61.5 percent (16 of 26) from 3-point range.Darren Collison added 25 points, Victor Oladipo had 23 and Bojan Bogdanovic contributed 17.Domantas Sabonis, who has been filling in for Turner, generated 15 points, 12 rebounds and six assists for his third straight double-double."A win like this shows we're coming together as a team," Collison told the Star."This early in the season, it's kind of surprising, you know.But if we stick together and play the way we've been playing, the right way, we'll be around in every single game we play."With Turner out, Young has been the only starter back from last year's 42-40 team.Oladipo and Sabonis came over from Oklahoma City in the George trade, while Collison and Bogdanovic were signed as free agents.32 View Gallery Kelley L Cox-USA TODAY Sports | Kelley L Cox The Sixers (4-4) ran their winning streak to three with a 119-109 victory over the Atlanta Hawks on Wednesday night as Robert Covington scored 22 points.Joel Embiid added 21 points, 12 rebounds and six assists, and Ben Simmons had 19, 13 and nine, respectively, helping Philadelphia reach the .500 mark for the first time since Nov. 15, 2013."At times, we are great at both ends -- at times," Simmons said."For us to get better, we have to be consistent.Communicating and knowing where the ball is at certain times is important."Simmons, the top overall pick in the 2016 draft, missed last season with a broken foot."I'm finding where I can score, where I can be effective," Simmons said."I'm still learning that part of the game.It's coming to me a lot more."He added that he has "a lot more" to offer."I have to keep working hard and staying in the gym," he said."In a few years it's going to be fun."In Embiid's mind, it's not all that bad now."We're just getting better," he said."We're a young team and, like I always say, that's not an excuse, but we just have to keep on going and getting better."The Sixers hope to have backup center Richaun Holmes (broken wrist) for the first time this season against the Pacers.Guard Markelle Fultz (shoulder) has missed the last four games and the No.1 overall draft pick is out indefinitely.
Preview: Heat begin six-game road trip in Denver:::::TV: FOX Sports Sun TIME: Coverage begins at 8:30 p.m. DENVER -- A visit by the Miami Heat used to come with a lot of fanfare when the Big Three were on the roster and leading the club to four straight NBA Finals appearances.On Friday, when the Heat descend on Denver to face the Nuggets, LeBron James and Dwyane Wade are in Cleveland and Chris Bosh is gone, so the biggest news is that Hassan Whiteside will play.And that is good news for a Miami team that has been up and down in the first seven games of the season."Oh, man, it always feels good to get our heart back, man," Heat forward James Johnson told the Miami Herald of Whiteside's return Wednesday in a 97-91 win over the visiting Chicago Bulls.Miami Heat on FOX Sports Sun Whiteside is emerging as the face of the franchise, and he proved it with 13 points and 14 rebounds in 26 minutes against Chicago.Whiteside missed the previous five games with a left knee bone bruise but came back with authority.Even with those strong numbers, he is still working his way back.He acknowledged he was fatigued Wednesday."A little bit, a little bit toward the end," Whiteside said."But I expected that to come, because I've just been running in the pool, so it's hard to duplicate an actual NBA game."Things don't get any easier for the Heat (3-4).A game at altitude is tough enough when fully healthy, but the thin air can be harder for a player trying to get his stamina back.And Miami will need Whiteside to help battle Denver's strong frontcourt that had a good showing in a 129-111 win over the Toronto Raptors on Wednesday.Forward Paul Millsap had a season-high 20 points and center Nikola Jokic flirted with a triple-double with 16 rebounds, 10 assists and eight points.The Nuggets (4-4) posted a season-high point total, and their offense has been clicking after an uneven start to the season.Since scoring 93 points in a loss to the Charlotte Hornets on Oct. 25, the Nuggets are averaging 117 points per game and are 3-1 in that stretch."Slowly but surely it's coming back to us," Denver guard Gary Harris said of the offense."We know how to play and we know what works for us and what doesn't, and we'll continue to play to our strengths."The Nuggets are in the midst of a six-game homestand, their longest of the season, and they want to establish home-court dominance that wasn't there last season.They finished 22-19 at Pepsi Center in 2016-17, a mark that cost them a chance to make the playoffs for the first time since 2013.One of the things they concentrated on was playing better defensively, and outside Toronto's 40-point fourth quarter when the game was long decided, the Nuggets' defense was solid against the Raptors."Last year, I don't think we played good defense, but this year our defense is getting a lot better," Jokic said."We want to play defense this year.Everyone is out there playing really aggressive on defense."If Denver can keep scoring and shoring up its defense, it will have a successful homestand and get Miami's six-game trip off to a rough start.
Cavs look to bounce back vs. Wizards:::::WASHINGTON -- On the surface, a meeting between the Cleveland Cavaliers and Washington Wizards means a matchup of arguably the two best teams in the Eastern Conference.On the court, neither side is playing at that level.Coverage of Cavs vs. Wizards begins Friday night at 7:30 on FOX Sports Ohio The revamped Cavaliers (3-5) dropped their fourth game in a row Wednesday, a 124-107 home loss to the Indiana Pacers.They also lost center Tristan Thompson for possibly a month with a calf strain.It was another blow for a team that is allowing 111.9 points per game, the fourth-highest total in the league."We can't sustain effort for 48 minutes," said James, who had 33 points, 11 assists and eight turnovers against the Pacers.Wizards coach Scott Brooks lamented a similar story after the team's 122-116 home loss against the Phoenix Suns on Wednesday.Washington (4-3) held the Suns to 15 points in the first quarter, led by as many as 22 and received 40 from Bradley Beal, yet allowed 107 points over the final three quarters."I tell our team all the time, the easy part is to play hard, the hard part is to play well," Brooks said after his squad lost for the third time in four games."We have some really good players that make the hard part pretty good also.Fortunately for me, our staff, and our group, it never has to be talked about a lot.Hopefully we can get back to playing with some toughness, some physicality for 48 minutes instead of 24."Phoenix forward TJ Warren scored a career-high 40 points on 16-of-22 shooting against Washington, which played funky lineups due to foul trouble and the absence of Otto Porter (illness).The Wizards passed on making excuses for the deflating loss while recognizing the need for sustained effort.They have blown double-digit leads in five of their seven games this season."We score enough points every game to win the game.It is just a matter of us stopping guys, getting stops.We do not do that," Beal said."We get so caught up in missed shots and not getting the ball or whatever it may be and we are not defending.When we do not defend, we cannot outscore everybody."Teams have been doing just that to the Cavaliers, especially with 3-point shooting.Cleveland is allowing a league-worst 14 treys per game.The Pacers finished 16 of 26 from long distance."Some of it was turnovers," Cavaliers coach Tyronn Lue said."Some they made tough shots.We contested, we were right there, and teams have been making shots against us.I thought we did a good job of trying to contest all shots."The Wizards contested a James 3-point attempt in the closing seconds of an epic matchup in Washington with the Cavaliers in February, but the four-time league MVP banked home the game-tying shot in regulation.Cleveland eventually won 140-135 in overtime in what some considered the league's regular-season game of the year.The Wizards won the final regular-season meeting in Cleveland but came up one game shy of a postseason rematch with a Game 7 loss to the Boston Celtics in the Eastern Conference semifinals.Porter returned to practice Thursday and will start Friday alongside Markieff Morris, who will play in his first game since undergoing hernia surgery on Sept. 22.On Wednesday, Morris served a one-game suspension for leaving the bench area during a brief scuffle in the second quarter of Washington's loss at Golden State on Oct. 27.Brooks anticipates using Morris 15-16 minutes against Cleveland.Cavaliers forward Jae Crowder, acquired from Boston in the blockbuster offseason trade for Kyrie Irving, is expected to start in place of Thompson.
Disabled Navy vet refuses to receive award from Saints over national anthem protests:::::A disabled Navy veteran said he declined to accept an award at a New Orleans Saints game due to the controversy over players protesting during the national anthem.The Saints organization was going to honor retired Cmdr.John Wells, the executive director of Military Veterans Advocacy, with the Peoples Health Champion award during last weeks game in New Orleans, according to The Advocate.On Wednesday he told the organization he was unable to accept the award at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome because of the anthem protests.Saints players have been seen kneeling before the anthem and some continue to do so during the national anthem.Although I am touched and honored to be selected for such an award, the ongoing controversy with NFL players' disrespect for the national flag forces me to decline to participate in the presentation, Wells said."I am unable, in good conscience, to enter an NFL stadium while this discourtesy prevails.Since this award is tainted with the dishonorable actions of the NFL and its players, I cannot accept it.Wells served in the Navy from 1972 to 1994 and afterward became an attorney concentrating in military and veterans law, according to the New Orleans Times-Picayune.He was set to receive the award given by Medicare to senior citizens who have made significant accomplishments.The Saints said in a statement Thursday that they were disappointed by Wells decision.We will not allow Mr. Wells' decision and subsequent media appearances to distract our players and organization from continuing to honor and support our military and veterans," the statement read."We, as an organization, have decided to move on from this sad and divisive discourse and focus our attention on supporting our military and veterans.Each NFL team has protested in some form during the national anthem since President Trumps comments about Colin Kaepernick prior to Week 3 of the season.Trump has encouraged owners to punish players who kneel during the anthem.
Kings hold off Toronto after taking 5-goal lead early:::::Tyler Toffoli scored two goals, Michael Amadio got his first NHL goal and the Los Angeles Kings beat the Toronto Maple Leafs 5-3 on Thursday night for their eighth victory in 10 games.Amadio, Michael Cammalleri and Trevor Lewis scored during a three-goal first period for the Kings.Jonathan Quick made 33 saves as they pulled even with St. Louis atop the Western Conference standings in their impressive start to the season.Los Angeles was up 5-0 late in the second period before Auston Matthews scored on his first career penalty shot.Morgan Rielly and Connor Brown also scored for the Maple Leafs, who have lost four of five.Matthews got a second penalty shot in the final minutes after Los Angeles defenseman Jake Muzzin knocked the net off its moorings, but Matthews missed the net.Curtis McElhinney stopped 23 shots in just the second appearance of the season by Frederik Andersens backup.The Kings looked sharp as they returned from a six-game road trip to begin 2 1/2 weeks spent entirely in Southern California.Under new coach John Stevens, Los Angeles has improved its offensive play while getting a strong season from a healthy Quick, the 2012 Conn Smythe Trophy winner and two-time Stanley Cup champion.The Kings are also integrating young talent into their lineup, and the latest contributor is Amadio, a 21-year-old former third-round pick from Sault Ste.Marie, Ontario.He scored just 2:34 into his fourth NHL game, capitalizing on a Toronto turnover and slipping a shot underneath McElhinney.Cammalleri doubled the lead 2 1/2 minutes later with a tap-in after good work by Dustin Brown, who scored the 13th point of his revitalized season.Lewis scored with 36 seconds left in the Kings dominant first period, hitting the net on a tight-angled wrist shot after an exceptional cross-ice pass from Nick Shore.Toffoli got his sixth goal of the season in the second period during a power play, and added another 2:01 later after Adrian Kempe did the hard work of taking the puck to the net under pressure.Tanner Pearson had three assists for the Kings.
After Series, focus on free agents, plus Stanton and Otani:::::LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Baseball's business season began Thursday when 149 players became free agents just nine hours after the Houston Astros won their first World Series title.Rather than opt out of his contract and go on the market again, All-Star outfielder Justin Upton agreed to a $106 million, five-year deal with the Los Angeles Angels.He signed a $132.75 million, six-year contract with Detroit before the 2016 season and could have terminated the agreement, forfeiting the remaining $88.5 million he was due.While executives and fans are looking ahead to next autumn's free agent class -- which includes Bryce Harper, Manny Machado, Dallas Keuchel and potentially Clayton Kershaw -- the more immediate focus is on this year's group.Among the pitchers is Yu Darvish, who lost Games 3 and 7 of the World Series for the Los Angeles Dodgers."Personally I want to come back to the Dodgers," he said after allowing five runs and getting just five outs in Wednesday night's 5-0 loss in Game 7.Miami also could be a focal point of the offseason.Slugger Giancarlo Stanton said last week he had not yet decided whether he would prefer to be traded by the Marlins' new ownership group, which put former New York Yankees star Derek Jeter in charge of baseball and business operations.Stanton is owed $275 million over the final 10 seasons of his record $325 million, 13-year contract, and he's not sure whether Miami will pursue a trade."I've had thoughts on both sides," Stanton said.Yankees pitcher Masahiro Tanaka must decide whether to opt out of the remainder of his contract, which calls for him to receive $67 million over three seasons.Japanese star Shohei Otani, prized as a right-handed pitcher and outfielder, also could be a factor in the market if he tries to come to the major leagues.MLB's current rules limit his signing bonus, with Texas able to pay $3,535,000 and the Yankees $3.25 million.He's talented enough to command more than $100 million if he waits two years.As for this year's free agent class, Jake Arrieta, CC Sabathia, Alex Cobb and Brandon Morrow are among the pitchers available, along with closer Wade Davis.Kansas City has a large number of talented offensive players who can leave, among them third baseman Mike Moustakas, first baseman Eric Hosmer, shortstop Alcides Escobar and outfielder Lorenzo Cain.Outfielders available include Jay Bruce and J.D.Martinez, and among the catchers are Jonathan Lucroy and Alex Avila.About three dozen players have options that must be exercised before Monday, when clubs decide whether to make $17.4 million qualifying offers to free agents, which attaches draft-pick compensation.In option decisions Thursday: -- Boston exercised closer Craig Kimbrel ($13 million) and left-hander Chris Sale ($12.5 million) -- Seattle declined right-handers Yovani Gallardo ($2 million buyout instead of $13 million salary) and Hisashi Iwakuma ($1 million buyout instead of $10 million salary) -- Oakland exercised second baseman Jed Lowrie ($6 million) -- Washington said a mutual option had been declined on first baseman-outfielder Adam Lind ($500,000 buyout instead of $5 million salary).-- The Chicago White Sox declined backup catcher Geovany Soto ($250,000 buyout instead of $3 million salary)
Vasilevskiy's 9-game win streak ends in OT:::::TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- The New York Rangers were a determined group from the opening puck drop, and the result was a win over one of the NHL's best.J.T.Miller scored 1:19 into overtime and the Rangers beat the Tampa Bay Lightning 2-1 on Thursday night.Miller skated around defenseman Anton Stralman and beat Andrei Vasilevskiy.New York also got a goal from Chris Kreider, and Henrik Lundqvist stopped 27 shots."I think the key going into this game was to control the top guys and we did a really good job," Lundqvist said."It was a fun game to play.We followed our game plan and that's something we have to focus on."Tampa Bay's top line of Steven Stamkos, Nikita Kucherov and Vladislav Namestnikov was held off the scoreboard.The trio finished with eight shots.The Rangers have won consecutive games for the first time this season.Yanni Gourde had a goal and Vasilevskiy made 33 saves for the Lightning (10-2-2).Vasilevskiy had won nine consecutive decisions."He clearly got us the point," Tampa Bay coach Jon Cooper said of Vasilevskiy, who is 10-1-1.Kreider opened the scoring during a 3-on-1 at 18:34 of the first.Gourde tied it at 1 with a short-handed goal off a nifty pass through the slot by Victor Hedman 11 minutes into the second.Vasilevskiy stopped Kevin Shattenkirk's breakaway shot and made a stick save on Jesper Fast's in-close rebound after Michael Grabner's shot hit the post in the first.He also made several strong saves in the third following Tampa Bay turnovers.Lundqvist turned aside Stamkos' left-circle power-play shot during the first and the Lightning captain's in-close backhander early on in the second.Stamkos, playing in his 600th NHL game, was held pointless for just the second time in 14 games.Grabner had a goal early in the second disallowed because the puck was kept in the offensive zone by a high stick.Tampa Bay had Alex Killorn's goal three minutes into the third disallowed due to goalie interference.The call was confirmed by a video review following a Lightning challenge."I wanted to come out and I can't come out," Lundqvist said."I can't play the position.Sometimes players think they have to bump the goalie but he comes in there and I can't come out.It's the right call, for sure."Cooper disagreed, saying "It was a bad call."NOTES Rangers coach Alain Vigneault got his 619th NHL win, moving within one of tying Bryan Murray for 12th place on the all-time list.Tampa Bay D Dan Girardi, who spent parts of 11 seasons with the Rangers, faced his old team for the first time.Rangers D Ryan McDonagh was in the lineup a day after sitting out practice.Lightning C Cedric Paquette (upper body) missed his seventh straight game but might return next wee UP NEXT Lightning: Host Columbus on Saturday night.
Houston family, businesses benefit from World Series run:::::HOUSTON (AP) -- The Houston Astros' victorious World Series run has not only given an emotional boost to a city still recovering from Hurricane Harvey.It has provided an economic lift as well.And for one Houston family, the journey to a championship led to a financial opportunity that will help their grandparents rebuild after the devastating storm.Brianne Bueno's family had bought two tickets for Game 3 of the World Series in Houston but didn't use them to watch their beloved Astros.Instead, the family raffled them off last week on Facebook and raised enough money to help repair the Houston-area home of Bueno's grandparents."During Game 6, I got a text from one of the ladies who purchased a ticket.She put, `Glad it went well with the raffle.Was bummed to not win the tickets but really hope you guys were able to help out your folks,'" Bueno said."This is like a whole week since the raffle and people are still showing their support for us, which is pretty amazing."Local businesses saw increased sales, with people spending more money at restaurants, bars and hotels."It's obvious more people were out on the streets, and more people were out spending money that they wouldn't have spent otherwise," said Patrick Jankowski, regional economist for the Greater Houston Partnership."It's like a shot in the arm for the city."He said Houston's economy had been rebounding after bottoming out in August 2016 due to falling oil prices -- and then Harvey hit.That recovery will likely be delayed about three months because of the hurricane.Bueno said after Harvey's torrential rainfall in late August flooded her grandparents' home about 44 miles (70 kilometers) south of Houston in the city of Angleton, her father bought the World Series tickets with the purpose of raffling them off to raise money.Her grandparents, both 70 years old, lost most of their possessions and now live in the grandfather's small law office.Bueno said when her father "saw that the tickets for Game 3 were on sale, there was no hesitation for him to buy those and use them for a better purpose rather than fulfilling a desire he had to go to the World Series himself."She promoted the $20-a-ticket raffle on social media as well as in her classes at the University of Houston.One of her professors bought five tickets.Bueno was surprised so many people found out about the raffle and wanted to buy a ticket."I didn't expect this reaction honestly," she said.The tickets were given away on Oct. 26.With the raffle being a success, having the Astros win the World Series "was definitely the icing on the cake," Bueno said.Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner said Harvey highlighted the "can-do spirit" of the city's residents."It almost seems as though the greater the challenge, Houstonians see the greater the opportunity," Turner said at a news conference Thursday."So we meet challenges and then we turn around and take advantage of the opportunity."Marcus Davis, owner of The Breakfast Klub, said the popular restaurant's sales slowed down because of Harvey.But business picked up a lot when the Astros started their playoff run.The Breakfast Klub even hosted Dodgers fans who traveled to Texas from Los Angeles."It's not that our spirits are dampened.We just wanted to communicate to the world how strong Houston is and the Astros winning was just symbolism for us," Davis said."It verified and validated that yes we are strong.We've gone from underwater to the mountain top."
Panthers routed at home in loss to Blue Jackets:::::SUNRISE, Fla. (AP) -- Oliver Bjorkstrand and Josh Anderson each scored twice to lift the Columbus Blue Jackets over the Florida Panthers 7-3 on Thursday night.Boone Jenner, Tyler Motte and Markus Hannikainen also had goals for the Blue Jackets, and Sergei Bobrovsky made 31 saves.Seven goals are a season-high for Columbus, which won for the eighth time in 11 games.Vincent Trocheck had a goal and two assists for the Panthers.Ian McCoshen and Mark Pysyk also scored.James Reimer allowed four goals on 19 shots before being replaced by Antti Niemi at 10:46 of the second period.Niemi stopped 18 shots.The Panthers lost their third straight and have given up 15 goals in their past two games.After Trocheck's short-handed goal tied the score 3-all at 8:43 of the second, the Blue Jackets reclaimed the lead 28 seconds later on a power-play goal by Bjorkstrand when his shot went into the top of the net.Reimer was replaced by Niemi after that goal.Bjorkstrand's second goal, a shot from in front, beat Niemi and stretched the Blue Jackets' lead to 5-3.Motte made it 6-3 at 3:45 of the third.The goal was Motte's second in two games since being recalled from Cleveland of the AHL on Monday.Jenner's power-play goal, a deflection of a shot by Artemi Panarin at 6:12 of the third, made it 7-3.Columbus took a 3-2 lead on Hannikainen's goal at 5:21 of the second.Hannikainen grabbed a loose puck in the slot and slid it between Reimer's pads.The Panthers tied the score 2-all 35 seconds into the second on McCoshen's slap shot from the point.Anderson's second goal gave the Blue Jackets a 2-1 lead on his wrist shot from the right circle that beat Reimer to the stick side with 3:33 left in the first period.The Panthers took a 1-0 lead on the goal by Pysyk when he swept in a rebound off a shot by Trocheck at 4:57.The Blue Jackets tied it on Anderson's first goal.Brandon Dubinsky passed from the goal line to Anderson in front and he pushed he puck past Reimer with 8:28 left in the first.NOTES:Blue Jackets RW Cam Atkinson missed the game with a lower-body injury.Bjorkstrand's power-play goal was the first on the road for Columbus this season in 15 tries.Panthers LW Connor Brickley missed his third game with an upper-body injury.UP NEXT Blue Jackets: Visit the Tampa Bay Lightning on Saturday.Panthers: Host the New York Rangers on Saturday.Columbus Blue Jackets 7, Florida Panthers 3
Watson, Luck both out as Texans host Colts:::::HOUSTON (AP) -- The Houston Texans and Indianapolis Colts will both start backup quarterbacks when they meet on Sunday after Deshaun Watson sustained a knee injury in practice on Thursday and is heading to injured reserve with Andrew Luck.Watson suffered a torn anterior cruciate ligament in one of his knees and is out for the season, two people familiar with the situation told The Associated Press.The people spoke on the condition of anonymity because the team hadn't announced the injury.His injury comes on the same day that the Colts placed Luck on injured reserve.The move wasn't that surprising considering Luck hasn't played since undergoing shoulder surgery in January.The Colts (2-6) have struggled in his absence, and have lost three straight.On Sunday when the Texans look for their fourth straight win over the Colts, they'll do it with Tom Savage at quarterback.Jacoby Brissett, who has appeared in each game for the Colts this season and has started the past seven after being traded from the Patriots on Sept. 2, will start for Indianapolis.Watson's injury is a huge blow for a team which looked to have finally solved years of problems at quarterback with the emergence of the talented 22-year-old.Watson's 19 touchdown passes are tied for the league lead and are the most in NFL history through a player's first seven games.He leads all quarterbacks this season with 21 touchdowns overall and has thrown four or more touchdown passes in three games this season to join Fran Tarkenton as the only rookies in NFL history to do so.Now they'll have to rely on Savage, who started the season opener but was benched at halftime after managing just 62 yards passing and losing two fumbles, one of which was returned for a touchdown, in a 29-7 loss to the Jaguars.Watson's injury is the latest setback for a team that lost three-time NFL Defensive Player of the Year J.J. Watt and linebacker Whitney Mercilus to season-ending injuries on Oct. 8.Houston is in third place in the AFC South with a 3-4 record, behind the Tennessee Titans and Jacksonville Jaguars who are tied for the lead at 4-3.Savage will have to perform much better than he did in the opener if the Texans hope to reach the playoffs for the third straight season.Some things to know about the Colts and Texans.NUMBER WATCHING: Kicker Adam Vinatieri needs one point to break a tie with Gary Anderson for second on the NFL's career scoring list (2,434 points).Receiver T.Y.Hilton needs nine catches to pass Bill Brooks (411) for No.6 in franchise history, and Frank Gore has moved within 193 yards of Jerome Bettis for No.6 on the NFL's career rushing chart.But the most important number might be four.The Colts have lost three straight for the first time since 2015 and only the third time in Chuck Pagano's 5 seasons with the Colts.They have never lost four in a row under Pagano.HI AND BYE: The Texans welcomed veteran left tackle Duane Brown back last week after he missed the first six games holding out only to trade him to the Seahawks on Monday.Chris Clark, who missed last week with a calf injury, should return this week to start in place of Brown.RED DAWN: One of Indy's most consistent problems has been finishing drives.While their scoring percentage inside the 20 is 87 percent, about the middle of the league, Indy's TD percent (43.5 percent) is No.29.Only nine teams scored fewer red zone touchdowns than the Colts (10), and six of those nine have played one fewer game than Indy.Clearly, the Colts know that needs to change."You've got to execute," Pagano said."Guys got to win matchups.You've got to protect, you've got to throw, you've got to catch.Mix in some runs and things like that."Again, having some early down success down there, having some opportunities and getting some looks that you normally might not get on shorter distances down there would help."TEXAS TWO-STEP: Colts linebacker John Simon spent his first four seasons with the Texans, and right guard Le'Raven Clark grew up in Texas and played at Texas Tech.It's unclear if either will play Sunday.Simon, one of the Colts' best offseason acquisitions, sat out last week with a stinger he suffered in the previous game.He didn't practice Wednesday.Pagano was non-committal about his availability against Houston.Clark returned home after his father died last Sunday, missed practice Wednesday and was expected to work out with his teammates Thursday and Friday.He was scheduled to go back home Friday night -- before Saturday's team flight."It's unfortunate and our thoughts and prayers are with him in a trying time like this," Pagano said."As far as the lineup, we'll practice accordingly and we'll get him back and then we'll make decisions from there."
Paths of surprising Saints, sagging Bucs clash in Superdome:::::NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- The New Orleans Saints and Tampa Bay Buccaneers are both defying expectations, albeit in markedly different ways.Their divergent paths cross in a pivotal NFC South Division matchup on Sunday, with the Saints (5-2) aiming to consolidate their surprising hold on first place, and the Bucs (2-5) desperate to prevent their season from looking lost at the halfway point."We've been beating ourselves too often and somebody said a long time ago, more games in the NFL are lost than won, so it starts with not beating ourselves," said Tampa Bay coach Dirk Koetter, whose team was widely expected to be a playoff contender after narrowly missing the postseason last season.The Bucs have turned the ball over 12 times -- tied for eighth most in the NFL.Tampa Bay has thrown eight interceptions -- six by battered starting quarterback Jameis Winston -- and has lost four fumbles."We have to win the turnover margin and we have to out-execute our opponent," Keotter said."We've played well in spurts, but we just haven't been consistent enough and the teams that have been beating us have beat us because they played better."While Saints quarterback Drew Brees had done a lot of winning in his 17-year career, he's riding his first five-game winning streak since 2013, which is also the previous time the Saints made the playoffs.The previous six-game winning streak came in 2011, when the Saints fielded the league's most potent offense.This year's Saints offense doesn't look quite as dynamic as the '11 edition, which set an NFL record with 7,474 yards.It has looked more like the more balanced attack New Orleans had in 2009, which was good enough to propel the Saints to their only Super Bowl.But Brees contends the Saints still have plenty of potential to fulfil."We're doing a lot of good things, but man just really scratching the surface in some areas," Brees said."I feel like a lot of things can really bump us to the next level I think on both sides of the ball and yet we're still finding ways to win games and we're doing enough things well."That's encouraging, but you also realize the games are only getting tougher and more important and more at stake and we've got to continue to fine tune and get better."Here are some other things to know about the Buccaneers and Saints: MIXED FEELINGS: The Bucs have the NFL's second-most productive passing attack in the NFL and are fourth in total offense, yet they're 18th in scoring at 21 per game and off to a 2-5 start.The team has totaled 2,636 yards this season, most in franchise history through seven games.Part of that can be attributed to playing from behind much of time."With the statistics we have on offense, you can't even imagine that we would be sitting in this position," quarterback Jameis Winston said."But if we were sitting at 5-2, and we had worse stats, there really wouldn't be a conversation."SECONDARY AMBITIONS: Saints safety Kenny Vaccaro sounds eager to see if New Orleans' pass defense, which was statistically among the NFL's worst the previous three seasons, can build on a string of solid performances throughout his club's five-game winning streak.That will mean containing receivers Mike Evans and DeSean Jackson, and tight end Cameron Brate, who've helped the Bucs gain 295.4 yards per game through the air."Our mentality is we've moved past that bend-but-not-break thing where you give up yards and still win.We want keep stopping people," Vaccaro said."This will be our biggest test to date.We want to prove a point.We want to challenge these guys and we'll find out exactly what type of secondary we have."CLOSING GAPS: The Saints' defensive front has been susceptible to giving up sporadic big gains on the ground in recent weeks.Two games ago, they allowed a 46-yard TD run to Green Bay's Aaron Jones.Last week, Chicago's Jordan Howard had a 50-yard run and QB Mitchell Trubisky scrambled for 46.Now New Orleans faces Bucs running back Doug Martin , who has 247 yards and two TDs rushing in three games since serving a four-game drug suspension.DEFENDING BREES: Containing Saints quarterback Drew Brees is a challenge everywhere, but Tampa Bay has had a particularly difficult time slowing him and the Saints in the Superdome.In his past six home games against the Bucs, Brees has thrown for 1,871 yards, 14 touchdowns and five interceptions for a 102.6 passer rating.Tampa Bay has the league's 30th-ranked pass defense and is last in the NFL with seven sacks."Anytime you're playing a really good quarterback and he is able to stay in rhythm, it's going to be a tough out," said Bucs defensive coordinator Mike Smith, who also had plenty of experience facing Brees as Atlanta's head coach."It's going to be imperative that we try to get him flustered a little bit, whether it's by changing up the coverage, whether it's by adding extra rushers.There are different ways you can do it."
The Unspeakable Greatness of Giannis Antetokounmpo:::::Visitors to Milwaukee, however, quickly discover that its no exaggeration to describe Antetokounmpos future as the least of the Bucks concerns in their bid to become a credible contender for the first time in nearly two decades.It also doesnt hurt that, by virtue of his speedy ascension to All-N.B.A.status and contention for other top individual honors, Antetokounmpo is on a course to be eligible for a so-called supermax contract extension from the Bucks via the leagues new Designated Player Exception during the 2020 off-season, which would put him in line for a new deal well in excess of $200 million.As he tweeted in July, to the presumed glee of every Milwaukeean, I got loyalty inside my DNA.An Unexpected Loss The connective tissue that links this star, team and city runs as dense as youll find on the N.B.A.map, perhaps surpassed only by Nowitzkis two decades worth of roots in Dallas or maybe the deep bonds shared in San Antonio by Tony Parker and Manu Ginobili.Milwaukee hasnt simply been the backdrop for Antetokounmpos fairy tale rise to American stardom; it has been home for virtually his whole family for all but the first few months of his N.B.A.life.Antetokounmpo admits, furthermore, that the unexpected death of his father just over a month ago has him leaning on his adopted hometown more than ever.Charles Antetokounmpo died of a heart attack on Sept. 29 at age 54.I can feel the love from the city every day I step on the floor, Giannis Antetokounmpo said.For me, what Im going through now, I appreciate it even more.Charles and Veronica Antetokounmpo, who moved from Nigeria to Greece as undocumented immigrants in 1991 in search of a better life, secured the necessary paperwork to relocate to Milwaukee along with Gianniss two younger brothers halfway through his rookie season.Kostas Antetokounmpo is a redshirt freshman at the University of Dayton now, but the rest of the family moved into a new downtown complex before this season, with Giannis and Alexandros Antetokounmpo (a high school sophomore) housed on the fifth floor and Charles and Veronica on the fourth.After years of well-chronicled struggle for the family in a northern section of Athens known as Sepolia, they have found Milwaukee as idyllic as it was portrayed to be in the sitcom Happy Days, where not even the frigid winters can detract from the comfort theyve experienced as a unit.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Only now, as they confront the passing, even more responsibility has been heaped on the ever-widening shoulders of the Bucks phenom.Veronica Antetokounmpo, meanwhile, has moved up a flight to be with her sons on the fifth floor in the wake of her husbands death.Leading your family is a lot tougher than basketball, Antetokounmpo said.Especially right now.But Ive got to be strong for my family.Things, he continued, are going to get better.Places to Improve The areas for on-court improvement are obvious for Antetokounmpo even as he stuffs box score after box score.His outside shot still needs copious amounts of work he is not close to trusting it in times of need and there is room for growth in reading the game at both ends, consistently making his teammates better and refining his decision-making.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Yet its also ridiculous, and rather cold, to nitpick what is missing from Antetokounmpos blossoming game given the level he is consistently hitting with that 7-foot-3 wingspan of his.Doubly so at a time of profound grief.Hes like a plane that just started taking off, Kidd said.Hes at 10,000 feet.When he arrived in Wisconsin, via the 15th overall pick in the 2013 N.B.A.draft, Antetokounmpo was measured at 6 feet 9 inches and weighed less than 200 pounds.A half-decade later, he is closing in on 240 pounds, and coaches and teammates routinely refer to him as a 7-footer.The Milwaukee assistant coach Frank Johnson, noting Antetokounmpos bulked-up body and added strength, said, He gets bumped now and he loves it.As for his perimeter game, Johnson preaches patience, pointing to the countless nights of extra shooting he is getting alongside the mentoring Coach Sweeney the Bucks assistant coach Sean Sweeney.The way Johnson talks about the work-in-progress jumper is reminiscent of what league observers said for years about Shaquille ONeals persistent free-throw woes.If he had that already, Johnson said, it wouldnt be fair.Terry, the Bucks guard, said: Of course he has to keep working on his outside game.But Giannis just has a peaceful confidence about himself.You can see it.Last year, he didnt have that.The legendary Kobe Bryant, now in his second season of retirement, had seen enough coming into training camp to challenge Antetokounmpo via Twitter in late August to make a bid for the leagues Most Valuable Player Award.Asked why he set such a high target, as part of his #MambaMentality campaign, Bryant said he was moved by Antetokounmpos rare physical gifts that are matched by a rare inner passion.
The N.F.L.s Most Valuable Player Might Be ... a Punter?:::::Ask Hekker about his dopeness, and he deflects it.He subscribes to the Zen concept of mushin, imparted to him by Fassel, which means a mind cleared of all distraction.Hekker has forgotten many of his punts, and when the long-snapper Jake McQuaide asks whether he liked a snap, he remembers only that he caught it.Advertisement Continue reading the main story I would like to think Im a top-10 guy in the league, Hekker said, but really I have a lot more work to do.During the spring, Hekker grew disgusted when he reviewed all 98 of his punts from last season and determined that many did not land where he wanted them.Again, this was the best punting season in history.Fassel said Hekker has yet to peak, which only reinforces Sneads claim that he might be the best punter ever.That claim is not drenched in hyperbole, and does not insinuate any bias from a man who in September tacked two more years onto the six-year, $18 million deal Hekker signed in 2014.John Turney, a prominent football historian, is working on a project about punting, and he said Hekker, three times a first-team All-Pro, has produced a statistically overpowering trail that places him on a trajectory to join Ray Guy as the only full-time punters in the Pro Football Hall of Fame.I dont know what else you can ask of a specialist, Turney said.For the influence that Hekker wields on a game, his capacity for maximizing field position, diminishing scoring probabilities and running a fake, Turney considers Hekker the best special-teams player in the league.Quite a compliment, but what if Hekker is even more than that?He does not pass like Tom Brady or run like Kareem Hunt or catch like Antonio Brown, or come close to playing nearly as many snaps as they do.Hekker, who also holds for Zuerlein, has taken only 31.9 percent of the Rams special-teams snaps.Hekker Stands Apart Johnny Hekker of the Rams leads in two of puntings most important statistics: net yards and pinning the opponent inside their 20.Net punting yards 50 Hekker Vogel Martin Sanchez Palardy King Bosher McAfee Anger B. Colquitt Haack 40 Jones Wing D. Colquitt Locke Schmidt Lee 30 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% Percent of punts not returned to opponents 20-yard line Net punting yards 50 Hekker Vogel Martin Palardy King McAfee Anger B. Colquitt Haack 40 Wing D. Colquitt Locke Schmidt Lee 30 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% Percent of punts not returned to opponents 20-yard line But when Hekker jogs onto the field on fourth down, his mind uncluttered and his limbs loose, and with 1.2 seconds to catch the snap and rotate the ball and drill it toward a small target area some 45 yards away, he almost never makes mistakes discernible to the naked eye.And because of that, maybe, just maybe, Hekker does his job better than anyone else in the league.Sustaining Excellence Sitting in his office, arms folded, brows furrowed, Snead pondered that possibility.He inherited a 2-14 team in February 2012, two and a half months before the draft.The Rams needed receivers and defensive linemen and cornerbacks.They also needed a punter.Fassel attended Hekkers pro day at Oregon State and wanted him.Early in the seventh and final round, Snead mulled picking Hekker.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The guy actually had a punt in college that went backward, Snead remembered saying that day.Figuring that the 31 other teams had seen it, he decided to take a linebacker.Hekkers friends remind him all the time of the punt, against Wisconsin during his senior season.It traveled minus-4 yards.It keeps him grounded, as does what happened after the season, when he went searching for an agent because none deemed him worth contacting.After signing with the Rams, Hekker began watching film of punters he respected, an exercise that endures.He marveled at the technique used by Thomas Morstead of New Orleans, quiet and refined.He gaped at how purely Dustin Colquitt of Kansas City strikes the ball, especially in a venue as unforgiving as Arrowhead Stadium.He admired the misdirection deployed by Sam Koch of Baltimore, how he would show left, then crush the kick right.I revere these guys, Hekker said.I need their posters on my wall.They keep me humble.I watch them punt and I think Ive got a long way to go.Photo The craft has evolved since Sammy Baugh let em rip 75 years ago, Turney said, cycling through several phases until this current era, which rewards those few punters who can kick consistently with power and precision.The two most revealing indicators, Turney said, are net average (how far the ball travels minus return yardage or touchbacks) and the ratio of inside-the-20 punts to touchbacks.Hekker holds the career record in each, according to the Elias Sports Bureau.(Those statistics began being tracked in 1976.)To sustain that excellence, Hekker relies on a catalog of punts.A sampling: the end-over-end one that swaps distance for control, the dastardly knuckler, the directional spiral and the famed banana, adapted from Australian rules football.Spinning sideways, the banana fooled Indianapolis returner Quan Bray in its regular-season debut, in Week 1, skidding at the 11 before helicoptering out of bounds at the 7.Many punters mess with the banana in practice, but few have the confidence or audacity to try it in a game.Hekkers next trick could be the punt he has been fiddling with: It spins as if kicked with his left foot.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.I dont think Johnnys afraid of anybody, said Jeff Feagles, the N.F.L.career leader in punts.I think theyre afraid of him.Sometimes they are afraid he wont punt at all.By his own admission, Hekker was a quarterback who punted at Bothell High School in suburban Seattle.And the Rams capitalized on his passing talent immediately.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Against San Francisco as a rookie, Hekker completed a 21-yard pass from his own end zone.Then, with about five minutes left and the Rams trailing by 4 points, he connected on a 19-yarder that keyed a go-ahead scoring drive.In all, his 13 passes since 2012 with eight completions, all for first downs or touchdowns are 11 more than any other punter has attempted, according to Sportradar.(He has also passed for a 2-point conversion.)Fassel said the Rams have called about 40 other fakes with Hekker that they checked out of at the line of scrimmage.His versatility vexes opposing coaches who every week struggle with how to set up a runback and guard against a fake.Weve been really vanilla against him, said Brian Schneider, the Seahawks special-teams coach, whose team has been foiled by Hekker twice on fakes, after a September practice.We dont have much of a choice.Demanding Standards Hekker developed that arm, and a fierce competitive streak, playing football with his four older brothers.His fear of losing motivated him across his childhood, when he would turn household chores like carrying grocery bags into the house into contests.After high school, once he had committed to pursuing punting in college, Hekker learned fundamentals at a camp in Alabama run by Mike McCabe, a former all-American punter at Illinois State.He wasnt very good, McCabe said.As a walk-on at Oregon State, Hekker beat out Ryan Allen (now the Patriots punter) as a freshman for the starting job.Throughout college, Hekker returned to Alabama to train with McCabe, who said he now learns from him.On the practice field, competing against himself, Hekker is no less demanding.This season he is trying for three or fewer touchbacks (he has one so far) and for what he considers excellent direction on

Most of the Time.:::::Its been a lot easier to focus on something else, McInerney said during an interview Tuesday.The tournament, which debuted in 1983 with the first million-dollar purse in PGA Tour history, has attracted a field that includes eight major winners.The two-time Masters champion Bubba Watson had not planned to make his next official Tour start until the Phoenix Open in February.But after the shooting, he changed his mind and decided to add this event.Why would you not want to come here and support this place and show love?said Watson, whose last competed here in 2007.Charley Hoffman, like McInerney, starred on the golf team at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.He has lived in Las Vegas for 20 years, and he is donating his entire paycheck from this weeks event to help those affected by the shooting.Every year before this event, Hoffman organizes a charity tournament to benefit his foundation.His amateur participants this year included Aaron DeView, whom Hoffman invited after hearing about his actions on the night of the shooting.DeView, 49, turned his Toyota Tacoma into a makeshift ambulance, transporting victims he came across while fleeing the gunfire to a triage center set up by paramedics not far from the concert grounds.Photo By pure happenstance, McInerney, a late addition to the event, played the pro-am alongside DeView, and they spent the round sharing their stories about the night of the shooting.It helps a lot to talk about it with people who were there, McInerney said, adding, The 22,000 people who were there, we can meet each other, and its like we were friends for 10 years.Advertisement Continue reading the main story DeView, who described the past month as the highest of highs and the lowest of lows with nothing in between, said: I started talking to A. J. and I thought, My gosh, were not golfing.Were healing.To prepare for the pro-am, DeView, a 13-handicapper, played a practice round at TPC Summerlin and was randomly assigned a cart No.58.Nothing, though, seems random to DeView after he survived a torrent of bullets by sheer luck.The cart and being paired with McInerney, he said, feel like a message that everythings going to be O.K.DeView, a bartender, returned to work on the Strip four days after the shooting, though by his own admission he was not ready to be back in the midst of crowds.Its still hard, said DeView, whose truck still has a bullet hole in it.McInerney understood.For three days after the shooting, he was unable to sleep.On the fourth, he also returned to his job, sort of.It was his 24th birthday, and McInerney and seven friends who had attended the music festival met at a par-3 course downtown, about two miles from the site of the concert.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.That was the first time any of us had been out since it happened, he said.We used golf as a way to have fun again.A bigger test for McInerney came on Oct. 10, when the N.H.L.expansion franchise, the Vegas Golden Knights, held their home opener against the Arizona Coyotes at T-Mobile Arena, roughly a mile from the site of the shooting.McInerney attended the game with friends who had also been at the concert.McInerney said he was fine once he got inside with the capacity crowd of more 17,000 people.The wait to enter the arena was another story.I felt really uncomfortable standing in line and waiting to go through the metal detectors, he said.Theres hundreds of people in a couple different lines, and theres buildings all around, and I was like, there could be someone in that parking garage and hes got 200 people in line that he could be targeting.Photo The night was a huge success, and not just because the skaters in the home jerseys won.That was the first time I had been in a public place like that since the shooting, McInerney said, and I think it was important for me and my friends to be there and kind of get that out of the way.Because you cant live your life in fear.Advertisement Continue reading the main story A week after the shooting, McInerney returned to the concert grounds, which were still cordoned off from the public.As best he could, he tried to retrace the steps of his escape to the MGM Grand parking lot, about a mile away, where he had parked his truck.I was just trying to piece it together, he said.That was one coping way for me to kind of put everything in perspective.No matter where McInerney is, certain triggers instantaneously send him back to the scene.They include any noise, like the one from the ball-washing machine here, that sounds like firecrackers; a helicopter flying overhead; or his favorite Jason Aldean song, When She Says Baby, which he was performing when the first shots rang out.Those are the things that bring back the memories, McInerney said, but it also helps me remember those who were killed and helps me to say a prayer for those families.Golf has provided a welcome refuge for McInerney, who said he was dealing with that guilty feeling of Why did I get so lucky to live?Part of the coping process for me, he added, is being able to come out to the golf course and throw my headphones in and just kind of forget about everything for a couple hours.He knows there are survivors who are still struggling.My girlfriend being one of them, he said.A few days after the shooting, Martine flew to New Jersey, where she has family, to escape the emotional triggers that loomed around every corner of this city.Two weeks later, she posted on her Twitter account that she experiences anxiety just seeing a concert on Snapchat.McInerney appreciates that his life will never be the same as it was before Oct. 1.Nor should it be, he said.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Im playing for Las Vegas, and that whole Vegas Strong slogan that weve kind of coined, he said.As golfers, its easy to get locked up in your own little bubble, so thats kind of bigger picture, I guess.
More Anxiety, and More Police, Expected at New York City Marathon:::::Photo Two days after a pickup truck struck and killed eight people in Lower Manhattan in what the authorities called a terrorist attack, runners preparing for the New York City Marathon on Sunday sought to beat back anxiety as the police announced additional security measures.Competitors picking up their race materials on Thursday chatted excitedly about the course and the doughnuts, beer, pizza and other rewards they would treat themselves to after they crossed the finish line.But many also admitted that the attack, which occurred on a bike path along the Hudson River, rattled them and left them hoping race organizers and the police were doing everything possible to keep the event safe.Being that I always run the West Side Highway, it is sad, said Callie Gates, an entrant from New Jersey who will be running the race for the first time.It was people just coming into town, taking a bike ride.Thats really sad.You just never know.Thats the scary part.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Jeanine Ibrahim, 37, who is running in her first New York City Marathon said, It did cross through my mind.What if somebody tries to do something at the marathon?She added, At the same time, Im still going to run the marathon.
Astros George Springer, the Series M.V.P., Has Come a Long Way:::::Springer comes from an athletic family.His sisters were standout softball players.His paternal grandfather moved to the United States from Panama to play baseball.His father, George Jr., played baseball in the Little League World Series and then college football at Connecticut.It was at school that George Jr. met his wife, Laura, a college gymnast from Puerto Rico.Photo George Springer IIIs parents chose to raise their children in New Britain.It allowed them to grow up around their grandparents, aunts and uncles, and in a diverse community.Our kids, from a very early age, were connecting with kids that many of them didnt look like them or spoke a different language, said Springers father, who is a lawyer.And if you watch George now, you see how he interacts with everybody.Early in high school, Springer was 5-foot-2.By his senior year, a growth spurt added nearly a foot.In college, he developed into a coveted prospect.Yet even as he flourished on the field, he had to contend with a stutter that was evident at a young age.Self-conscious of it, he became withdrawn and avoided speaking in school or other public situations.It was only when Springer was called up to the big leagues for the first time, in April 2014, that he learned to accept himself, adopted new techniques to help with his speech and later became a spokesman and fund-raiser for the Stuttering Association for the Young.It took a lot of courage, his father said, adding: This didnt happen overnight.It was hard work, most of which, quite frankly, George did.We were there to guide, assist, coach and support, but he was the one that had to be comfortable in his own skin.He was the one that had to adopt all the techniques.I give him all the credit.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Even now, Springer occasionally stammers during interviews, but he speaks with poise and earnestness.In his first All-Star Game, over the summer, he wore a wireless microphone in the outfield for a national television interview during the game.Photo I cant spread a message to kids and adults if Im not willing to put myself out there, he said then.On the field, Springer grew, too.He hit 20 home runs in his rookie season, in 2014, but struck out 114 times in 78 games.He cut down on his strikeout rate each season after that, and improved the quality of his at-bats so much that the Astros made him their everyday leadoff hitter in May 2016.Hes dynamic, Astros catcher Brian McCann said.Hes a free safety playing baseball.He can hit the ball 450 feet, play Gold Glove center field, score from first every time theres a double.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Springer might not be a typical choice for center field because of his size (he is listed at 6-foot-3, 215 pounds) or the leadoff spot because of his power (he hit 29 home runs in 2016 and 34 in 2017).But Astros Manager A.J.Hinch has loved the spark Springer provides at the top of the order, and it showed in the playoffs, especially in the World Series.When hes hot, were hot, Hinch said.He started off the game with a ton of energy in the most critical game of the year.With the Astros leading the Dodgers, 3-0, in the second inning of Game 7, Springer hit a 96-mile-an-hour fastball from starter Yu Darvish over the center-field fence for a two-run home run.That made him the first player to hit a home run in four consecutive games in a single World Series.His five home runs tied Reggie Jackson (1977) and Chase Utley (2009) for the most in a World Series.In all, he hit .379 (11 for 29) with seven runs batted in, eight runs scored and a World Series record eight extra-base hits.Given how he ended, it was easy to forget that he sputtered in the American League Championship Series against the Yankees after a strong showing in the first round, and that he struck out four times in Game 1 of the World Series.
N.F.L. Picks: Cowboys Should Survive, but Eagles May Falter:::::Still, Dallas was a top-10 running team in each of the two years before Elliott arrived, largely because of stellar offensive line play.If Darren McFadden and Alfred Morris can provide 70 percent of Elliotts production, Prescott should be able to make up the rest.On defense, the Cowboys have more long-term concerns, but the Chiefs (6-2) have cooled off considerably in recent weeks.An offense that has been relying on its kicker for a large portion of its scoring is not a good bet to keep up with Prescott, regardless of who is at running back.Pick: Cowboys Broncos at Eagles, 1 p.m., CBS Line: Eagles by 8.5 The reality of life in the N.F.L.is that all streaks end.The Eagles (7-1) have won six consecutive games and scored 20 or more points in 12 straight.They have started to be referred to as the N.F.C.s best team, and they have a fearsome defense and a talented young quarterback to back up that talk.While they may keep up their winning and scoring streaks for another week, a desperate opponent cannot be overlooked.The Broncos (3-4) certainly qualify as a team that can play better than it has in recent weeks, which might make the matchup competitive.Pick: Broncos Falcons at Panthers, 1 p.m., Fox Line: Panthers by 1 If the Panthers (5-3) had no plans to re-sign him in the off-season, then trading Kelvin Benjamin was probably a good move.But it leaves the team awfully thin at wide receiver.Passes underneath to Christian McCaffrey, the teams rookie running back, are supposed to be a safety valve when bigger plays fail to develop; they are not supposed to be the offensive strategy.If the Falcons (4-3) got out of their rut with a win over the Jets last week, then Carolina could be in trouble at home.Pick: Falcons Redskins at Seahawks, 4:05 p.m., Fox Line: Seahawks by 7.5 It is hard to say if Deshaun Watson and the Texans gave the N.F.L.a blueprint for attacking the secondary of the Seahawks (5-2), or if Watson is just that good, but the rookie threw aggressively against them and would have won if not for a herculean effort by Russell Wilson and the Seattle offense.Kirk Cousins may not be as gifted as Watson, but he does not lack for confidence, and it would not be surprising for the Redskins (3-4) to go into attack mode to see if the Legion of Boom has truly developed some cracks.Pick: Redskins Second-Tier Games Photo Colts at Texans, 1 p.m., CBS Line: Texans by 7 (Preview updated to reflect injury news) It was a huge loss for the Texans (3-4) in Week 5 when J. J. Watt was declared out for the season, but that was nothing compared to the blow the team took on Thursday when Deshaun Watson, Houstons star rookie quarterback, tore his anterior cruciate ligament during practice and was lost for the season.Watson had been sensational in recent weeks, transforming a team that had relied entirely on its defense into the highest scoring offense in the N.F.L.To reach the heights Watson reached, and to now tumble back to the reality of Tom Savage being the Texans starting quarterback is a blow to morale that is almost unfathomable.Houston, which was favored by 13 points before the injury, is still favored by seven, which is a fairly stunning indictment of the Colts (2-6).But oddsmakers are drastically shortchanging how much of the Texans turnaround was owed directly to Watsons talent.Pick: Colts Rams at Giants, 1 p.m., Fox Line: Rams by 3.5 The Rams (5-2) emphasized this week that the team should not be complacent against the injury-riddled Giants (1-6).Both teams are coming off bye weeks, though the Rams are doing so with the optimism of consecutive wins in which they scored a combined 60 points.The Giants limped through the break and then suspended their top cornerback, Janoris Jenkins, for this game for a violation of team rules.Keeping pace with the Seahawks at the top of the N.F.C.West should provide Los Angeles with the motivation they need to stay focused.Pick: Rams Bengals at Jaguars, 1 p.m., CBS Line: Jaguars by 4.5 The Jaguars (4-3) have yet to win consecutive games this season, but their defense may have fixed its weak link.The unit has been sensational at every aspect of the game besides run defense, and the team has tried to fix that by trading for Marcell Dareus, a run-stuffing defensive tackle who is familiar with Coach Doug Marrones way of handling things.If Dareus can lift the front sevens efforts against the run from awful to mediocre, the Jaguars, who rush the passer and defend the pass incredibly well, could finally find some consistency.That is terrible news for the Bengals (3-4).Pick: Jaguars Advertisement Continue reading the main story Buccaneers at Saints, 1 p.m., Fox Line: Saints by 7 The Saints (5-2) are riding a five-game winning streak, and always play better at home, but the Buccaneers (2-5) are a tougher team than their record indicates.The Saints are right to be optimistic about their playoff chances (The Upshot gives them a 79 percent chance of making the playoffs and a 59 percent chance of winning their division), but a lot of breaks have gone their way to keep their winning streak alive, and sloppy play is bound to come back to haunt them eventually.Asking them to win is reasonable, but demanding they win by 7 may be unrealistic.Pick: Buccaneers Bottom-Tier Games Photo Bills at Jets, 8:25 p.m. (Thursday), NFL Network and CBS in New York Line: Bills by 3 Buffalo fans love to point out that they root for the only N.F.L.team in New York, but even if you include the Jets and the Giants, they clearly have New Yorks most talented team.Against the Jets (3-5), the Bills (5-2) will stick to the script of running the ball, passing enough to keep the defense honest and playing hard-nosed defense.It is a formula that just might end their long playoff drought.Pick: Bills Ravens at Titans, 1 p.m., CBS Line: Titans by 4 The Ravens (4-4) did not take kindly to their quarterback, Joe Flacco, being brutalized on an illegal hit last week, and they responded with the entire team emulating Jefferson from Fast Times at Ridgemont High, piling on in a 40-0 blowout against Miami.Going on the road against the Titans (4-3), who got healthy during a well-timed bye week, is a much tougher task than slowing down the Dolphins.Pick: Titans Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Cardinals at 49ers, 4:05 p.m., Fox Line: Cardinals by 2 The 49ers (0-8) are off to the worst start in franchise history, but they are not without hope, as the teams general manager, John Lynch, has shown a knack for savvy moves.His latest was to get Jimmy Garoppolo from the Patriots for a second-round pick.Garoppolo, a 26-year-old career backup, may not make anyone forget Joe Montana or Steve Young, but under Coach Kyle Shanahan he could turn into a franchise quarterback.Unfortunately, C. J. Beathard is expected to start this week against the Cardinals (3-4).Pick: Cardinals Raiders at Dolphins, 8:30 p.m., NBC Line: Raiders by 3 Im tired of this offense being awful, Miamis Coach Adam Gase told reporters this week.Were the worst offense in football.Its hard to get lower than that.It is not clear how the Dolphins (4-3) got better by trading away Jay Ajayi, a 24-year-old running back who has 1,662 rushing yards in 19 career starts, and thats one of the many reasons Miami is an underdog at home against the struggling Raiders (3-5).It would be hard to make a case for a less appealing Sunday night game.Pick: Raiders Mondays Matchup Lions at Packers, 8:30 p.m., ESPN Line: Lions by 2.5 The Lions (3-4) have lost three consecutive games, but they will feel a lot better about their season if they get a road win against a division rival.The Packers (4-3) are coming off a bye week in which they tried to fix an offense that has been horrendous since Aaron Rodgers was injured, but this is a particularly difficult matchup: Green Bays offense has been reduced to a running game powered by Aaron Jones and Brett Hundley, and the Lions do their best work stopping the run.Pick: Lions.
Deshaun Watson of Texans Is Said to Have Torn A.C.L.:::::Photo In a crushing blow to the Houston Texans, Deshaun Watson, the teams record-setting rookie quarterback, sustained a torn anterior cruciate ligament in practice on Thursday and is most likely out for the remainder of the season.Ian Rapoport of NFL Network was the first to report the injury, and it was subsequently confirmed through multiple news media reports.Watson, the 12th overall pick in this years draft out of Clemson, has been a breakout player for the Texans (3-4) and was a leading candidate for the Rookie of the Year Award.His 19 touchdown passes 16 of which came over the last four games are tied for the league lead, and he has been the catalyst for an offense that leads the N.F.L.with an average of 30.7 points a game.Watsons 19 touchdowns are a record for a player in his first seven games, and he also has two rushing touchdowns.On Thursday, before the practice in which he was injured, Watson was named the A.F.C.s Offensive Player of the Month.He is the first rookie quarterback to receive the award.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The injury to Watson means the Texans will be without their best offensive player and their best defensive player: The defensive end J. J. Watt sustained a season-ending injury in Week 5.Coming out of training camp, Watson, who won a national championship during his final year at Clemson, was tabbed as the backup to Tom Savage, but his apprenticeship did not last long as Houston fell woefully behind the Jacksonville Jaguars in Week 1, and Watson replaced Savage for the second half.Watson was not able to rally them to victory, but he won his next start and has been off to the races since.
Jets Defense Overwhelms Bills in Win:::::Photo EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. Matt Forte ran for two touchdowns four days after complaining the Jets did not run the ball enough, and an overwhelming defense sacked Tyrod Taylor seven times Thursday night in the Jets 34-21 win over the Buffalo Bills.Buffalo (5-3) came in having scored 64 points in its last two wins, but the Bills self-destructed with turnovers and miscues.The Jets (4-5), who snapped a three-game slide in which they held leads in each defeat, looked more like a challenger to New England in the A.F.C.East.Forte scored on runs of 10 and 5 yards and had 14 carries for 77 yards.Augmenting that was Bilal Powell with a 51-yard burst and 74 yards on nine carries.Quarterback Josh McCown had a 10-yard scramble to open the scoring and the Jets rushed for 194 yards over all.Jordan Jenkins had two of the Jets sacks as they never allowed Buffalos offense to get on track.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Indeed, mistakes were the Bills trademark.Buffalo made a key error on the Jets second touchdown drive.Cedric Thornton sacked McCown but grabbed his face mask.The 15-yard penalty, which followed a 20-yard pass to Jermaine Kearse and a 22-yard run by Forte, led to Robby Anderson beating double coverage for a 25-yard touchdown reception.
When Astros Needed to Improvise, Charlie Morton Was Ready:::::Im way better than the way Im pitching right now, Giles said after Game 2 at Dodger Stadium, when he blew a lead in the 10th inning of an eventual 7-6 victory.Im not pitching to my expectations and Im beating myself up about it.The cracks had started showing in the American League Championship Series at Yankee Stadium when Giles who had 34 saves in 38 chances in the regular season lost a two-run lead in Game 4.He never pitched after the fourth game of the World Series, when the Dodgers battered him for three runs in the ninth inning to break open a tie game.By then, Hinch had already shown a willingness to find other pitchers for crucial spots, eschewing the crutch that managers often depend on.Stubbornly hoping for the summer version of a reliever now fading in the fall had contributed to other teams World Series downfalls notably the Boston Red Sox in 1986 and the Philadelphia Phillies in 1993.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Hinch refused to bury the Astros in that same graveyard.At three critical points in this postseason, he liked what he saw from a pitcher already in the game and let him finish it.Youve got to go with the hot hand, and it worked, said the Astros owner, Jim Crane, an old college pitcher.And it worked more than once.In Game 7 of the A.L.C.S., Hinch used starter Lance McCullers Jr. to relieve Morton for the final four innings.That decision clinched the pennant for Houston.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.In Game 3 of the World Series, starter Brad Peacock relieved McCullers with one out in the sixth, Hinch stuck with him the rest of the way, too.And when McCullers could not survive the third inning of his start on Wednesday night, Hinch used three relievers to get the game to Morton for the bottom of the sixth.Two former Cy Young Award winners, Dallas Keuchel and Justin Verlander, got loose for the Astros in the bullpen.But Morton was stifling the Dodgers, and Hinch did not stop him.I was comfortable with him closing the game around three innings, but he did it with four, Hinch said, adding that he knew he had reinforcements if needed.As much as I scripted this game, it never plays out the way you expect.The Astros did not expect Giles to falter in October, but they protected themselves by engineering their staff to be fresh through the postseason.Not a single pitcher on the team worked 162 innings the minimum to be considered for the E.R.A.title as an Astro this season.Mike Fiers led the team in innings, with 153, and he was left off the postseason roster.Photo Of course, the Astros did trade for the prototypical leading man: Verlander, who worked 206 innings between playing for Detroit and Houston and fired a complete game in the A.L.C.S.But McCullers, Peacock and Morton each made at least 22 starts in the regular season while pitching between 115 and 150 innings enough of a workload to be available for multiple innings in October, but not so much to be exhausted by the World Series.I have to give props to our medical team, General Manager Jeff Luhnow said.They kept our guys healthy and playing.At this point in the season, the difference between medical teams could win the World Series.Our doctors, our trainers, our strength guys, they kept these guys out there.Advertisement Continue reading the main story In the end, there was Morton, sturdy and strong, defying his history as a pitcher perhaps best known for injuries.He had left hip surgery in 2010, Tommy John surgery in 2012 and right hip surgery in 2014.In 10 seasons, he has never reached 30 starts or 175 innings.Last year was especially grim.Traded to Philadelphia after seven seasons with the Pittsburgh Pirates, Morton tore his left hamstring running to first base in April.He spent the next several months making lonely morning drives from his home in Bradenton, Fla., to the Phillies complex in Clearwater, recovering from an injury he knew had ended his season.Its not a good feeling, because youre watching your team on TV and youre a thousand miles away and you cant do anything, Morton said.But you start to appreciate it, because it becomes your responsibility as a professional.Its not glorious; nobody knows whats really going on except the guys youre working with.But its my job.Its my job to approach each situation professionally, and I tried to do that.The Astros saw enough in Mortons statistical profile to sign him to a two-year, $14 million contract last November.They believed in his curveball, which Morton threw more than ever this season, and thought that mechanical changes could help his fastball.They were right.Morton was 14-7 with a 3.62 E.R.A.in the regular season, with a career-best 10 strikeouts per nine innings.Then he became the first pitcher in baseball history to win two Game 7s in the same postseason.Im still not a 200-inning guy, Morton said.But Im part of something special.He thought some more and turned philosophical while teammates smoked cigars and flung beer around the locker room.You just dont know, Morton said.You could bunt a ball, be running down to first base and your season could be over.Or you could be here, and be fortunate to be part of this.Thats how I look at it, because Ive been everything: Ive been the guy you couldnt count on, Ive been the guy that gets hurt all the time, and Ive been a guy you can rely on in a crucial situation.There is no more crucial situation than the bottom of the ninth inning of Game 7 of the World Series, trying to bring your team its first championship ever.Morton delivered.He stopped dreaming, but the dream never gave up on him.

Ezekiel Elliott Can Play Sunday After Court Ruling:::::Photo Hes playing.Hes not playing.Hes playing.Hes not playing.Well, now Ezekiel Elliott whose suspension by the N.F.L.has run into a dizzying series of court rulings is playing again.For now.A federal appeals court in New York on Friday morning temporarily blocked an earlier ruling and said Elliott, a running back for the Cowboys, could play, at least this Sunday against the Chiefs.The ruling does not resolve the case, but merely allows Elliott to play while it proceeds.Elliott was suspended by the league for six games before the season after the N.F.L.investigated domestic-assault allegations.He was the leading rusher in the N.F.L.as a rookie last season and ranks third this year.He is a crucial offensive weapon for the Cowboys, who are 4-3 and in the hunt for a wild-card berth.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Here are all the twists and turns of the case: August: The N.F.L.suspends Elliott six games after his ex-girlfriend Tiffany Thompson accused him of assaulting her five times in Columbus, Ohio, where he played at Ohio State.(He was not arrested, after prosecutors decided her statements conflicted with those of some witnesses.)Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Sept. 5: A league-appointed arbitrator upholds the suspension.Sept. 8: A federal judge in Texas halts the suspension while he hears the case.
Your Race Against Time: How Climate Affects the Marathon:::::And while the biggest impacts show up in the performances of amateurs and weekend warriors, elite runners are not immune to these effects.When considering the top 20 finishing times at the largest marathons, the assessment found that temperatures in the 50s did not slow them, relative to days in the 40s.But temperatures in the 60s and the 70s increased their times by three and four minutes, respectively.Photo Since temperature has such a big effect on times, would it make sense to adjust official records for the weather?If this were done, five of the 25 fastest mens marathon times through the 2016 marathon season would beat the current adjusted world record.Indeed, three of them would be more than two minutes faster.The current world-record holder is Dennis Kimetto from Kenya, but the temperature-adjusted record-holder would be Kenenisa Bekele from Ethiopia, who would move up from No.3 on the list.The second-fastest time would belong to the Ethiopian Tamirat Tola, who would move up from No.18.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Adjusting times for temperatures would lead to smaller changes among women.Paula Radcliffe of Britain (who has won the New York race three times) would remain the record-holder.The interactions between climate and a sport like long-distance running are only going to get more pronounced as the climate changes.Over the last 50 years, the temperature has exceeded 60 degrees on just 5 percent of the days during the first week of November, when the New York race is typically held.By 2050, this is projected to rise to 18 percent of days, and by 2090 it is expected to be 38 percent.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.How will runners and organizers react?National governments, city planners and large corporations are all realizing that a warmer world will force them to change the ways they do business.Marathons will be no exception.The organizers of the New York race will probably not want their event to be one where it is difficult, or perhaps even impossible, for people to set their personal best or to lower the world record.So they may want to adapt by moving the marathon to later in the year.At the same time, runners may switch from the New York City Marathon to others held in cooler climates to find the perfect temperature at just the right time of year.Could a Montreal Marathon be among the worlds most prestigious by 2050?Athletic equipment companies will surely develop new technologies to aid adaptation as well.For runners, the breathable mesh and cooling towels of today could easily be traded in for shirts with built-in air-conditioners.Seem far-fetched?They already exist.Indeed, I was one of the authors of a recent study of just how powerful a role technology can play in helping people adapt to warmer temperatures.For example, the rise of air-conditioning has reduced the mortality consequences of extremely hot days in the United States by more than 70 percent since 1960.Marathons and marathon runners appear likely to be able to adapt to climate change with relative ease through changes in when, where and how.But in many other areas of our lives, the costs of climate change are expected to be greater.More intense hurricanes, and the increased occurrence of extremely hot days, will elevate risks to life and property, which can only be offset through costly adaptation efforts.These include building more expensive housing, accelerating the deployment of air-conditioning and making painful decisions to move away from current homes as well as acceptance of increased risks.In this way, the climate choice in front of us is similar to the one faced by people training for a marathon.More time spent training makes for a faster marathon.Its not a great idea to show up on the day of the race without having invested much in your performance.The time for that is well in advance of the big day.In the case of climate change, we can devote resources now to reducing greenhouse gas emissions so that we face lower costs in the future.As with so many things in life, both marathons and the climate problem are subject to an old rule no pain, no gain.
How I Helped a Blind Marathoner Reach the Podium, Above the Arctic Circle:::::But my journey began closer to home, with the New York City Marathon in which I was first supposed to guide Oidvin.Achilles International is a nonprofit that matches guides with disabled athletes.You can get paired just for race day.Becoming a guide is a bit like applying for college.Write an essay.Instead of test scores, you submit race results.Then, a few months beforehand, you may get matched.I was selected as one of several guides for Oidvin.Advertisement Continue reading the main story We exchanged countless emails leading up to the race.The benefits of technology: Oidvin relies on an iPhone voice-recognition app for messaging.She was born in South Korea, and adopted by a family living by one of Norways picture-postcard fjords.Her family raised her to believe that she could do anything.She went to college, became a physical therapist, and now lives with her husband and two daughters near where she was raised.She began running longer distances after she met a veteran guide who persuaded her to try.For the first time in my life, I felt I could do sports, she said.The feeling was amazing.Oidvin has since relied on dozens of guides, including a doctor, a scientist and a pastor, to compete in races.She dislikes the tethers preferred by some blind runners.Instead, she wants guides to run beside her and describe what lies ahead.As I prepared for the big day, I found myself looking at roads differently, thinking how I could quickly tell her what she needed to know, hoping I didnt get tongue-tied as fatigue set in.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.New York was her dream marathon, and she invested her savings to make the trip.Then Hurricane Sandy struck.She understood that the race might need to be canceled.But Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg insisted it would go on, so she flew to New York.Less than two days before the start, the mayor finally canceled the event.Oidvin was inconsolable over losing months of training with other guides and much of her savings.She was unsure she would get another chance.That night I worked on an alternative and secured the last slot in a small Pennsylvania marathon.Her disappointment was erased.I wrote about Oidvins travails, and the Norwegian news media picked up on the saga.Local businesses sponsored her return for the next New York City Marathon.Oidvin performed so well she qualified for the Boston Marathon, and when we ran there in 2015, despite bitter cold and cramps, she won as the fastest blind woman.Perhaps we should not have been surprised.She had already twice won the Oslo half-marathon in her division.Photo Last winter she won an essay contest to run in Spitsbergen.But her previous marathon had not gone well.She was hospitalized for dehydration, and now she was questioning her abilities.Advertisement Continue reading the main story She asked if I would work with Hakon Fram Stokka, a Norwegian cycling team veteran, to guide her.I had bad news: An injury had sidelined me for months, and I was uncertain I could do the job.She encouraged me to give it a try.Now, running in Spitsbergen, reaching a stretch where the road became quiet and there were few people, I reached for a water bottle for Oidvin.The dry air left us parched, and in this small race, there were few fluid stations.Though the temperatures were hovering a little above freezing, the climate was comfortable.The wind was still.The sun was beginning to warm us.We cut along the fjord heading out of town, then looped back along the harbor and by an icebreaker ship.Now the hard part.A long grind up a hilly gravel road, past machinery that moved coal mined on the island, and then a quick descent to where we had started.We were only halfway done.We had to complete the circuit again.Oidvin was doing well.Stokka was strong.But after 20 miles, on the climb back up the hill, I was struggling.The calf I had injured was in pain.One thing I had learned about guiding was to worry only about how my runner was doing.The experience is a rare moment when running truly does not feel like an individual pursuit.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The last thing I wanted was to slow down Oidvin.I told Stokka and Oidvin to go on.I would meet them at the finish.The last part of any marathon is unpredictable.Its why many disabled athletes have more than one guide in an endurance race.They can keep going.But Oidvin refused.We finish together, she said.I was surprised and guilt stricken.Stokka gave me a hand as I worked out the worst of the cramps.Once more we passed the mining machinery and reached the top of the hill.The clouds had mostly dissipated.We descended into town.Somehow we crossed the finish line together.Oidvin later ascended the podium.She finished second among women in her age group.
Big Ten Hockey, at Age 5, Learns That Rivalries Are Hard to Manufacture:::::Youre not just adding another school youre adding Notre Dame, Michigan State Coach Danton Cole said.The Big Ten also scrapped its neutral-site postseason tournament after four years of lackluster attendance at N.H.L.arenas in Detroit and St. Paul, Minn.Instead, all postseason games will be held on campus, hosted by the higher seed.There are signs of resurgence on the ice.In the most recent USCHO.com poll, five Big Ten teams were ranked in the top 17: No.5 Minnesota, No.7 Wisconsin, No.10 Notre Dame, No.16 Ohio State and No.17 Penn State.Michigan received the most votes of any unranked team.I think were a conference thats really on the rise, said Minnesota Coach Don Lucia, now in his 19th year.The Golden Gophers have won the first four Big Ten regular-season titles, but their fans have not embraced the new league.The rocky start for the conference can be attributed, in part, to old rivalries proving more powerful than new ones.When the Big Ten hockey conference was formed, Minnesota and Wisconsin abandoned the Western Collegiate Hockey Association, which began in 1951.Michigan, Michigan State and Ohio State left the 62-year-old Central Collegiate Hockey Association, which soon disbanded.The two Michigan teams cut ties with four in-state rivals.For Minnesota, the separations created even greater anxiety.Gone were multiple games a year each against Minnesota-Duluth, Bemidji State, St.Cloud State and Minnesota State, all within four hours of the Gophers campus.Their bitter border rival, North Dakota, was no longer a conference rival or a regular opponent.Photo Since the first season of Big Ten play, Minnesotas season-ticket base has declined from 7,271 to 5,511 this season.Another indicator of the ties that bind is that last season Minnesota charged record ticket prices for the two home games against North Dakota, and this year North Dakotas most expensive single-game ticket ($99) was for Minnesotas first visit to Grand Forks since January 2012.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Weve lost some of the passion of our die-hard fans, and thats not easy to get back, said Joel Maturi, a former Minnesota athletic director and a past chairman of the N.C.A.A.mens Division I hockey committee.They didnt like North Dakota.They dont feel the same way about Ohio State or Penn State.And a lot of Minnesota people dont feel the league has been successful because we havent done well in the postseason.Since joining the Big Ten, the Gophers have reached only one N.C.A.A.regional final, when they got to the Frozen Four in 2014 but lost the championship game to Union.The most recent of Minnesotas five national titles came in 2003.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Maturi said he thought the Big Ten teams should have transitioned more slowly to a stand-alone conference rather than make such a drastic break.Asked if he thought a hockey league should have been created so quickly, he said: My honest answer?No.But I think it will right itself over time.The Big Ten is taking steps to strengthen rivalries and build interest.The conference schedule was expanded to 24 games to accommodate Notre Dame, and more conference games are being played early in the season.Ohio State opened its season at Wisconsin on Oct. 6, and by this weekend all seven teams will have begun Big Ten play.All six two-game series played thus far have resulted in splits, speaking to the competitiveness of the league.Ohio State Coach Steve Rohlik, a Wisconsin alumnus, said he enjoyed playing the Badgers opening weekend.It gets you into the season earlier, he said.Early-season series against rivals also build story lines and animosity for later in the season when points are critical.Wisconsin forward Ryan Wagner said he welcomed the opportunity to get some hate going.Despite being new to the Big Ten, Notre Dame is an old rival of its leaguemates as a former member of the W.C.H.A.and the C.C.H.A.Lucia, who played at Notre Dame, said the Irish joining the conference is kind of like going back to the future.Notre Dame plays its first Big Ten series this weekend at Ohio State.Wisconsin Coach Tony Granato said he remembered traveling from his home outside Chicago as child to see Notre Dame play the Badgers.Advertisement Continue reading the main story There were no bigger games than those, he said.Winning, of course, solves many problems in sports.The recent struggles of Wisconsin, a six-time national champion, did not help the fledgling Big Ten.The Badgers won only 12 games combined in the two years before Granato arrived last season.Wisconsin is now on the upswing, having reached the Big Ten championship game, where it lost to Penn State in double overtime, in Granatos first season.In addition to Penn State winning its first N.C.A.A.tournament game, Ohio State last season reached the tournament for the first time since 2009.It takes a strong conference and strong teams to forge those rivalries, said Michigan Coach Mel Pearson, who took over for the retired coaching legend Red Berenson.Brad Traviolia, a deputy commissioner of the Big Ten, said he expected at least three or four Big Ten teams to make the N.C.A.A.tournament this season.If not, he said, were not living up to expectations.No team currently in the Big Ten has won a national championship since Michigan State, then of the C.C.H.A., in 2007.But first things first, which is a conference season that awakens former passions and develops new ones.As a conference moving forward, Lucia said, we need to embrace the new and forget about the old.

New Candidate and Palace Intrigue Shake Up U.S. Soccer Election:::::He added, And to take it to the next level, we need a new form of leadership.Cordeiros platform includes a call for increased transparency within U.S. Soccer and a separation between the federations financial and soccer responsibilities.He also pledged to follow through on the push to host the 2026 World Cup in the United States and begin a new one to win the rights to the 2027 Womens World Cup.He is merely the latest but perhaps the best connected candidate to enter the race, joining a field that includes Steven H. Gans, a Boston lawyer who was the first to announce a challenge to Gulati, and Eric Wynalda, the Fox Sports analyst and former national team striker.And while those are perhaps the outsiders that Cordeiro referred to when he mentioned people who want a revolution at U.S. Soccer, Cordeiro himself is best described as the consummate insider.Photo Cordeiro has been a member of the federations board of directors since 2006, serving as treasurer at one point, and last year he was elected to a four-year term as executive vice president.Cordeiro frequently travels with Gulati on his overseas trips, and he was part of U.S. Soccers failed bid to host the 2022 World Cup.He was careful to emphasize that his candidacy was not a rebuke of Gulati personally or of the job Gulati has done over the past decade.U.S. Soccers influence globally and its revenues have grown exponentially during Gulatis tenure as president, and he has overseen significant investments in player development.But it is difficult not to see implicit criticism of Gulati in Cordeiros call for increased transparency, as well as in his belief that the role of president should be more limited.Dont confuse being president of U.S. Soccer with being C.E.O.of U.S. Soccer, Cordeiro said, alluding to the role held since 2000 by Dan Flynn, a salaried executive in charge of the federations day-to-day affairs.The unpaid job of the president, Cordeiro said, is nonexecutive, meaning it is not full time.He called it the equivalent of the chairman of the board.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.The U.S. Soccer board apparently sees the post the same way, and in recent weeks, several of its members have mounted an effort to ensure that the next president hews more closely to the definition of the role as laid out in the organizations bylaws, and by Cordeiros platform.It is unclear how exactly the duties of the position would be circumscribed, or if the board is merely signaling that it plans more rigid limits on the portfolio and authority of the president whoever that is in the future.But the effect could be that future U.S. Soccer presidents may find themselves occupying a significantly less powerful position than the one Gulati currently holds.Gulati declined to comment for this article, and he has not announced whether he will run for re-election to a fourth term.His current term, which included a victory in the Womens World Cup in 2015, nonetheless has been marred not only by the failed World Cup qualification by the mens team but also by a bitter (and expensive) fight with the womens national team over pay equity and working conditions and a federal lawsuit filed against U.S. Soccer by the North American Soccer League.Still, Cordeiro decried as absolute garbage whispers that he or any other board members had pressed Gulati to step aside.Candidates have until Dec. 12 to announce their intention to run and submit the required nominations to become eligible.Both Cordeiro and Gans say they have the required support lined up.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The winner of the presidential election will immediately face a number of important decisions.First and foremost will be to begin creating a structure to choose a new mens national team coach to lay the groundwork for the 2022 World Cup qualifying cycle.Then, in March, U.S. Soccer and its partners Mexico and Canada must submit to FIFA their completed bid to host the 2026 World Cup in North America.FIFA will vote for the winner of that contest in June.

Howard Hyman, a dentist, and the former Merle Brayer.After graduating from a private high school in New Jersey, she attended the University of Michigan, where she earned a bachelors degree in English and met her husband, a fellow student.When friends ask me about going to football games every Sunday, Mrs. Tisch told The New York Times in 1997, after Bob Tisch had bought his half interest in the Giants, I tell them I have been going to football games every weekend since 1946.They graduated and married in 1948.Mr. Tisch helped bring the Democratic National Convention to New York in 1976 and 1980, lobbied on New Yorks behalf in Washington during the citys fiscal crisis in the mid-1970s, generated support for what became the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center on Manhattans West Side, and was a good-will ambassador for the city.He died in 2005.In addition to their son Jonathan, who is also a philanthropist, with a gallery named after him and his wife, Lizzie, at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Mrs. Tisch is survived by their other children, Steve, a film producer and chairman of the Giants, and Laurie, a philanthropist and president of the Laurie M.

Jets Defense Overwhelms Bills in Win:::::Photo EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. Matt Forte ran for two touchdowns four days after complaining the Jets did not run the ball enough, and an overwhelming defense sacked Tyrod Taylor seven times Thursday night in the Jets 34-21 win over the Buffalo Bills.Buffalo (5-3) came in having scored 64 points in its last two wins, but the Bills self-destructed with turnovers and miscues.The Jets (4-5), who snapped a three-game slide in which they held leads in each defeat, looked more like a challenger to New England in the A.F.C.East.Forte scored on runs of 10 and 5 yards and had 14 carries for 77 yards.Augmenting that was Bilal Powell with a 51-yard burst and 74 yards on nine carries.Quarterback Josh McCown had a 10-yard scramble to open the scoring and the Jets rushed for 194 yards over all.Jordan Jenkins had two of the Jets sacks as they never allowed Buffalos offense to get on track.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Indeed, mistakes were the Bills trademark.Buffalo made a key error on the Jets second touchdown drive.Cedric Thornton sacked McCown but grabbed his face mask.The 15-yard penalty, which followed a 20-yard pass to Jermaine Kearse and a 22-yard run by Forte, led to Robby Anderson beating double coverage for a 25-yard touchdown reception.
Deshaun Watson of Texans Is Said to Have Torn A.C.L.:::::Photo In a crushing blow to the Houston Texans, Deshaun Watson, the teams record-setting rookie quarterback, sustained a torn anterior cruciate ligament in practice on Thursday and is most likely out for the remainder of the season.Ian Rapoport of NFL Network was the first to report the injury, and it was subsequently confirmed through multiple news media reports.Watson, the 12th overall pick in this years draft out of Clemson, has been a breakout player for the Texans (3-4) and was a leading candidate for the Rookie of the Year Award.His 19 touchdown passes 16 of which came over the last four games are tied for the league lead, and he has been the catalyst for an offense that leads the N.F.L.with an average of 30.7 points a game.Watsons 19 touchdowns are a record for a player in his first seven games, and he also has two rushing touchdowns.On Thursday, before the practice in which he was injured, Watson was named the A.F.C.s Offensive Player of the Month.He is the first rookie quarterback to receive the award.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The injury to Watson means the Texans will be without their best offensive player and their best defensive player: The defensive end J. J. Watt sustained a season-ending injury in Week 5.Coming out of training camp, Watson, who won a national championship during his final year at Clemson, was tabbed as the backup to Tom Savage, but his apprenticeship did not last long as Houston fell woefully behind the Jacksonville Jaguars in Week 1, and Watson replaced Savage for the second half.Watson was not able to rally them to victory, but he won his next start and has been off to the races since.
N.F.L. Picks: Cowboys Should Survive, but Eagles May Falter:::::Still, Dallas was a top-10 running team in each of the two years before Elliott arrived, largely because of stellar offensive line play.If Darren McFadden and Alfred Morris can provide 70 percent of Elliotts production, Prescott should be able to make up the rest.On defense, the Cowboys have more long-term concerns, but the Chiefs (6-2) have cooled off considerably in recent weeks.An offense that has been relying on its kicker for a large portion of its scoring is not a good bet to keep up with Prescott, regardless of who is at running back.Pick: Cowboys Broncos at Eagles, 1 p.m., CBS Line: Eagles by 8.5 The reality of life in the N.F.L.is that all streaks end.The Eagles (7-1) have won six consecutive games and scored 20 or more points in 12 straight.They have started to be referred to as the N.F.C.s best team, and they have a fearsome defense and a talented young quarterback to back up that talk.While they may keep up their winning and scoring streaks for another week, a desperate opponent cannot be overlooked.The Broncos (3-4) certainly qualify as a team that can play better than it has in recent weeks, which might make the matchup competitive.Pick: Broncos Falcons at Panthers, 1 p.m., Fox Line: Panthers by 1 If the Panthers (5-3) had no plans to re-sign him in the off-season, then trading Kelvin Benjamin was probably a good move.But it leaves the team awfully thin at wide receiver.Passes underneath to Christian McCaffrey, the teams rookie running back, are supposed to be a safety valve when bigger plays fail to develop; they are not supposed to be the offensive strategy.If the Falcons (4-3) got out of their rut with a win over the Jets last week, then Carolina could be in trouble at home.Pick: Falcons Redskins at Seahawks, 4:05 p.m., Fox Line: Seahawks by 7.5 It is hard to say if Deshaun Watson and the Texans gave the N.F.L.a blueprint for attacking the secondary of the Seahawks (5-2), or if Watson is just that good, but the rookie threw aggressively against them and would have won if not for a herculean effort by Russell Wilson and the Seattle offense.Kirk Cousins may not be as gifted as Watson, but he does not lack for confidence, and it would not be surprising for the Redskins (3-4) to go into attack mode to see if the Legion of Boom has truly developed some cracks.Pick: Redskins Second-Tier Games Photo Colts at Texans, 1 p.m., CBS Line: Texans by 7 (Preview updated to reflect injury news) It was a huge loss for the Texans (3-4) in Week 5 when J. J. Watt was declared out for the season, but that was nothing compared to the blow the team took on Thursday when Deshaun Watson, Houstons star rookie quarterback, tore his anterior cruciate ligament during practice and was lost for the season.Watson had been sensational in recent weeks, transforming a team that had relied entirely on its defense into the highest scoring offense in the N.F.L.To reach the heights Watson reached, and to now tumble back to the reality of Tom Savage being the Texans starting quarterback is a blow to morale that is almost unfathomable.Houston, which was favored by 13 points before the injury, is still favored by seven, which is a fairly stunning indictment of the Colts (2-6).But oddsmakers are drastically shortchanging how much of the Texans turnaround was owed directly to Watsons talent.Pick: Colts Rams at Giants, 1 p.m., Fox Line: Rams by 3.5 The Rams (5-2) emphasized this week that the team should not be complacent against the injury-riddled Giants (1-6).Both teams are coming off bye weeks, though the Rams are doing so with the optimism of consecutive wins in which they scored a combined 60 points.The Giants limped through the break and then suspended their top cornerback, Janoris Jenkins, for this game for a violation of team rules.Keeping pace with the Seahawks at the top of the N.F.C.West should provide Los Angeles with the motivation they need to stay focused.Pick: Rams Bengals at Jaguars, 1 p.m., CBS Line: Jaguars by 4.5 The Jaguars (4-3) have yet to win consecutive games this season, but their defense may have fixed its weak link.The unit has been sensational at every aspect of the game besides run defense, and the team has tried to fix that by trading for Marcell Dareus, a run-stuffing defensive tackle who is familiar with Coach Doug Marrones way of handling things.If Dareus can lift the front sevens efforts against the run from awful to mediocre, the Jaguars, who rush the passer and defend the pass incredibly well, could finally find some consistency.That is terrible news for the Bengals (3-4).Pick: Jaguars Advertisement Continue reading the main story Buccaneers at Saints, 1 p.m., Fox Line: Saints by 7 The Saints (5-2) are riding a five-game winning streak, and always play better at home, but the Buccaneers (2-5) are a tougher team than their record indicates.The Saints are right to be optimistic about their playoff chances (The Upshot gives them a 79 percent chance of making the playoffs and a 59 percent chance of winning their division), but a lot of breaks have gone their way to keep their winning streak alive, and sloppy play is bound to come back to haunt them eventually.Asking them to win is reasonable, but demanding they win by 7 may be unrealistic.Pick: Buccaneers Bottom-Tier Games Photo Bills at Jets, 8:25 p.m. (Thursday), NFL Network and CBS in New York Line: Bills by 3 Buffalo fans love to point out that they root for the only N.F.L.team in New York, but even if you include the Jets and the Giants, they clearly have New Yorks most talented team.Against the Jets (3-5), the Bills (5-2) will stick to the script of running the ball, passing enough to keep the defense honest and playing hard-nosed defense.It is a formula that just might end their long playoff drought.Pick: Bills Ravens at Titans, 1 p.m., CBS Line: Titans by 4 The Ravens (4-4) did not take kindly to their quarterback, Joe Flacco, being brutalized on an illegal hit last week, and they responded with the entire team emulating Jefferson from Fast Times at Ridgemont High, piling on in a 40-0 blowout against Miami.Going on the road against the Titans (4-3), who got healthy during a well-timed bye week, is a much tougher task than slowing down the Dolphins.Pick: Titans Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Cardinals at 49ers, 4:05 p.m., Fox Line: Cardinals by 2 The 49ers (0-8) are off to the worst start in franchise history, but they are not without hope, as the teams general manager, John Lynch, has shown a knack for savvy moves.His latest was to get Jimmy Garoppolo from the Patriots for a second-round pick.Garoppolo, a 26-year-old career backup, may not make anyone forget Joe Montana or Steve Young, but under Coach Kyle Shanahan he could turn into a franchise quarterback.Unfortunately, C. J. Beathard is expected to start this week against the Cardinals (3-4).Pick: Cardinals Raiders at Dolphins, 8:30 p.m., NBC Line: Raiders by 3 Im tired of this offense being awful, Miamis Coach Adam Gase told reporters this week.Were the worst offense in football.Its hard to get lower than that.It is not clear how the Dolphins (4-3) got better by trading away Jay Ajayi, a 24-year-old running back who has 1,662 rushing yards in 19 career starts, and thats one of the many reasons Miami is an underdog at home against the struggling Raiders (3-5).It would be hard to make a case for a less appealing Sunday night game.Pick: Raiders Mondays Matchup Lions at Packers, 8:30 p.m., ESPN Line: Lions by 2.5 The Lions (3-4) have lost three consecutive games, but they will feel a lot better about their season if they get a road win against a division rival.The Packers (4-3) are coming off a bye week in which they tried to fix an offense that has been horrendous since Aaron Rodgers was injured, but this is a particularly difficult matchup: Green Bays offense has been reduced to a running game powered by Aaron Jones and Brett Hundley, and the Lions do their best work stopping the run.Pick: Lions.
Fantasy Football: Who to Start in N.F.L. Week 9:::::Here are players to strongly consider starting in Week 9.Quarterback Drew Brees (NO vs.Buccaneers) Week 8 was the first game that Brees failed to throw for at least one touchdown this season, and his 17.1 fantasy points per game average is not top-5 QB material (its good for 10th best).But a matchup with the Buccaneers should bring out a nice, vintage Brees performance for his patient fantasy owners.Tampa Bay allows the seventh most F.P.P.G.(18.9) to the quarterback position, with four of the seven opposing quarterbacks topping 22 fantasy points.Dak Prescott (DAL vs. Chiefs) Before Week 8, Prescott had been cruising in terms of fantasy production, averaging 26.3 F.P.P.G.over the previous four weeks, and never falling below 15 points on the season.But the Redskins held him to 143 passing yards and no touchdowns, by far his poorest performance of 2017.He should bounce back in a big way against the once-stingy Chiefs defense, which is the fifth worst passing defense in the N.F.L.Three different quarterbacks have absolutely shredded the Chiefs secondary this season, including Deshaun Watsons 35.5 fantasy points in Week 5 and Derek Carrs 30.2 points in Week 7.Also Consider: Jacoby Brissett (IND at Texans) Running Back Lamar Miller (HOU vs. Colts) Overshadowed by the meteoric rise of Texans quarterback Deshaun Watson, Miller quietly has the 11th most fantasy points among backs in seven games played.The truth is, Watsons play has increased the fantasy value of all of Houstons offensive players.Millers recent usage seems to indicate that hes reestablished himself as the teams clear top back ahead of DOnta Foreman, and he has one of the easiest schedules for a fantasy running back the rest of the season.The Colts have allowed a league-high 8 rushing touchdowns (10 total to the position) and the third most F.P.P.G.to the opposing backs (22.5).Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Adrian Peterson (ARI at 49ers) After a stunning debut with the Cardinals in Week 6, Peterson looked like the Big Easy edition in Week 7.Fresh off a bye week, look for him to get back on track against the 49ers, who defend the run as if they only have five players on the entire defense.Nine different backs have scored at least 10 fantasy points against them in eight games, and on the season San Francisco has yielded the most fantasy points total to the position.Also Consider: Orleans Darkwa (NYG vs. Rams) Wide Receiver Dez Bryant (DAL vs. Chiefs) It hasnt been a stellar fantasy season for Bryant thus far, but its been far from a disaster.His four receiving touchdowns are tied for ninth best among receivers and hes still being heavily targeted by Prescott with 64 targets (11th, N.F.L.).Hes been dealing with a knee injury but is on track to be practicing in full by the end of the week.This could be the week he finally breaks through with a big performance against the Chiefs, who have given up the most fantasy points to receivers so far this season.While the Chiefs do have one stellar cornerback in Marcus Peters, ProFootballFocus.com projects that Kenneth Acker will be Bryants primary defender this week (though dont be surprised to see Peters moved around some to help cover Bryant).Will Fuller (HOU vs. Colts) With an incredible seven touchdowns over the past four games, its time to start paying attention to Fuller, if you havent been already.His seven touchdowns have come on just 13 receptions, which is a ratio that seems unlikely to maintain, but he should continue to be a big play threat, as hes averaging 21.6 yards per target.The Colts allows a league-high 16.0 yards per reception, and the fifth most F.P.P.G to the position.Also Consider: Marquise Goodwin (SF vs. Cardinals); T.Y.Hilton (IND at Texans) Tight End Jack Doyle (IND at Texans) Doyle has 25 receptions and two touchdowns over the past three games and has emerged as Brissetts top receiving option in the Colts offense.The young quarterback should continue to lean on Doyle this week against the Texans, who are one of the weaker defenders of the tight end position, allowing the sixth most F.P.P.G.Defense/Special Teams Jaguars vs. Bengals; Rams at Giants Kicker Harrison Butker (KC at Cowboys); Blair Walsh (SEA vs. Redskins)
The N.F.L.s Most Valuable Player Might Be ... a Punter?:::::Ask Hekker about his dopeness, and he deflects it.He subscribes to the Zen concept of mushin, imparted to him by Fassel, which means a mind cleared of all distraction.Hekker has forgotten many of his punts, and when the long-snapper Jake McQuaide asks whether he liked a snap, he remembers only that he caught it.Advertisement Continue reading the main story I would like to think Im a top-10 guy in the league, Hekker said, but really I have a lot more work to do.During the spring, Hekker grew disgusted when he reviewed all 98 of his punts from last season and determined that many did not land where he wanted them.Again, this was the best punting season in history.Fassel said Hekker has yet to peak, which only reinforces Sneads claim that he might be the best punter ever.That claim is not drenched in hyperbole, and does not insinuate any bias from a man who in September tacked two more years onto the six-year, $18 million deal Hekker signed in 2014.John Turney, a prominent football historian, is working on a project about punting, and he said Hekker, three times a first-team All-Pro, has produced a statistically overpowering trail that places him on a trajectory to join Ray Guy as the only full-time punters in the Pro Football Hall of Fame.I dont know what else you can ask of a specialist, Turney said.For the influence that Hekker wields on a game, his capacity for maximizing field position, diminishing scoring probabilities and running a fake, Turney considers Hekker the best special-teams player in the league.Quite a compliment, but what if Hekker is even more than that?He does not pass like Tom Brady or run like Kareem Hunt or catch like Antonio Brown, or come close to playing nearly as many snaps as they do.Hekker, who also holds for Zuerlein, has taken only 31.9 percent of the Rams special-teams snaps.Hekker Stands Apart Johnny Hekker of the Rams leads in two of puntings most important statistics: net yards and pinning the opponent inside their 20.Net punting yards 50 Hekker Vogel Martin Sanchez Palardy King Bosher McAfee Anger B.

Colquitt Locke Schmidt Lee 30 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% Percent of punts not returned to opponents 20-yard line But when Hekker jogs onto the field on fourth down, his mind uncluttered and his limbs loose, and with 1.2 seconds to catch the snap and rotate the ball and drill it toward a small target area some 45 yards away, he almost never makes mistakes discernible to the naked eye.And because of that, maybe, just maybe, Hekker does his job better than anyone else in the league.Sustaining Excellence Sitting in his office, arms folded, brows furrowed, Snead pondered that possibility.He inherited a 2-14 team in February 2012, two and a half months before the draft.The Rams needed receivers and defensive linemen and cornerbacks.They also needed a punter.Fassel attended Hekkers pro day at Oregon State and wanted him.Early in the seventh and final round, Snead mulled picking Hekker.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The guy actually had a punt in college that went backward, Snead remembered saying that day.Figuring that the 31 other teams had seen it, he decided to take a linebacker.Hekkers friends remind him all the time of the punt, against Wisconsin during his senior season.It traveled minus-4 yards.It keeps him grounded, as does what happened after the season, when he went searching for an agent because none deemed him worth contacting.After signing with the Rams, Hekker began watching film of punters he respected, an exercise that endures.He marveled at the technique used by Thomas Morstead of New Orleans, quiet and refined.He gaped at how purely Dustin Colquitt of Kansas City strikes the ball, especially in a venue as unforgiving as Arrowhead Stadium.He admired the misdirection deployed by Sam Koch of Baltimore, how he would show left, then crush the kick right.I revere these guys, Hekker said.I need their posters on my wall.They keep me humble.I watch them punt and I think Ive got a long way to go.Photo The craft has evolved since Sammy Baugh let em rip 75 years ago, Turney said, cycling through several phases until this current era, which rewards those few punters who can kick consistently with power and precision.The two most revealing indicators, Turney said, are net average (how far the ball travels minus return yardage or touchbacks) and the ratio of inside-the-20 punts to touchbacks.Hekker holds the career record in each, according to the Elias Sports Bureau.(Those statistics began being tracked in 1976.)To sustain that excellence, Hekker relies on a catalog of punts.A sampling: the end-over-end one that swaps distance for control, the dastardly knuckler, the directional spiral and the famed banana, adapted from Australian rules football.Spinning sideways, the banana fooled Indianapolis returner Quan Bray in its regular-season debut, in Week 1, skidding at the 11 before helicoptering out of bounds at the 7.Many punters mess with the banana in practice, but few have the confidence or audacity to try it in a game.Hekkers next trick could be the punt he has been fiddling with: It spins as if kicked with his left foot.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.I dont think Johnnys afraid of anybody, said Jeff Feagles, the N.F.L.career leader in punts.I think theyre afraid of him.Sometimes they are afraid he wont punt at all.By his own admission, Hekker was a quarterback who punted at Bothell High School in suburban Seattle.And the Rams capitalized on his passing talent immediately.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Against San Francisco as a rookie, Hekker completed a 21-yard pass from his own end zone.Then, with about five minutes left and the Rams trailing by 4 points, he connected on a 19-yarder that keyed a go-ahead scoring drive.In all, his 13 passes since 2012 with eight completions, all for first downs or touchdowns are 11 more than any other punter has attempted, according to Sportradar.(He has also passed for a 2-point conversion.)Fassel said the Rams have called about 40 other fakes with Hekker that they checked out of at the line of scrimmage.His versatility vexes opposing coaches who every week struggle with how to set up a runback and guard against a fake.Weve been really vanilla against him, said Brian Schneider, the Seahawks special-teams coach, whose team has been foiled by Hekker twice on fakes, after a September practice.We dont have much of a choice.Demanding Standards Hekker developed that arm, and a fierce competitive streak, playing football with his four older brothers.His fear of losing motivated him across his childhood, when he would turn household chores like carrying grocery bags into the house into contests.After high school, once he had committed to pursuing punting in college, Hekker learned fundamentals at a camp in Alabama run by Mike McCabe, a former all-American punter at Illinois State.He wasnt very good, McCabe said.As a walk-on at Oregon State, Hekker beat out Ryan Allen (now the Patriots punter) as a freshman for the starting job.Throughout college, Hekker returned to Alabama to train with McCabe, who said he now learns from him.On the practice field, competing against himself, Hekker is no less demanding.This season he is trying for three or fewer touchbacks (he has one so far) and for what he considers excellent direction on eight of every 10 punts.He aims for a narrow alleyway two or three yards from the sideline.
Ezekiel Elliott Will Serve Suspension After Injunction Is Blocked:::::Photo Dallas Cowboys running back Ezekiel Elliotts last bid to stave off a six-game suspension was denied on Tuesday when a federal judge in New York declined to block his ban while he appealed the case.The decision, which blocked an emergency motion for an injunction for Elliotts suspension, was made by Judge Katherine Polk Failla of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.Judge Failla had ruled on Monday that the N.F.L.had the right to suspend Elliott after accusations of domestic violence made by a former girlfriend in July 2016.Elliott was not arrested or charged by prosecutors, but the N.F.L.used statements by the woman, along with photos of the injuries he is accused of inflicting upon her, to justify the six-game suspension.Six games is the baseline punishment for a player who is involved in a domestic violence case for the first time.The players union on Tuesday also filed an appeal of the ban in the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, but that may take weeks or even months to process.Thus Elliott will begin serving the suspension starting Sunday, when Dallas is scheduled to host the Kansas City Chiefs.
Patriots Trade Quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo to the 49ers:::::Garoppolo, a second-round pick in 2014, is in the final year of his contract.By acquiring him now, San Francisco gets a head start on negotiating a long-term deal to keep him or can use the franchise tag on him in free agency.Garoppolo started in place of a suspended Tom Brady at the start of the 2016 season.He completed 42 of 59 passes for 496 yards, four touchdowns and no interceptions and won both games.He was hurt in the second quarter of his second start and has thrown only four passes since then.I have a tremendous amount of respect for Jimmy, Patriots Coach Bill Belichick said.I couldnt ask for him to give us any more than hes given us.The 49ers are getting a good player, and theyre getting a good person and theyre getting a great teammate.And theyre getting a good quarterback.And Jimmys getting a good coach.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.His career is moving forward.Hes a talented individual.He was a great person to coach.I met with him weekly, and again I have a tremendous amount of respect for him.But as his career moves forward we have to look to our team, both this year and beyond.The Niners hope Garoppolo can be the quarterback to lead the franchise out of its recent cycle of losing that started when Jim Harbaugh was let go as coach after the 2014 season.San Francisco won seven games the past two years with Colin Kaepernick and Blaine Gabbert sharing quarterback duties.The 49ers are off to the worst start in franchise history this season, Shanahans first year at the helm.the veteran Brian Hoyer, who also began his career as Bradys backup in New England, started the first six games, and the third-round rookie C.J.Beathard has struggled as the starter the past two weeks behind a patchwork offensive line.Beathard has completed only 52.7 percent of his passes in his limited time, averaging 5.9 yards per attempt with two touchdowns, three interceptions and a 65.2 passer rating.He has been sacked 11 times on his 110 pass attempts and hit several others, with the Niners injury-riddled line giving him little time to succeed.Garoppolo is the second backup quarterback to be traded by the Patriots this season.They dealt Jacoby Brissett to Indianapolis last month for receiver Phillip Dorsett.New England now has no backup on the roster for the 40-year-old Brady, and no quarterback of the future for whenever Brady decides to retire.Advertisement Continue reading the main story We had probably had, in my opinion, the best quarterback situation in the league for the last, call it two and a half years, Belichick said.Its just not sustainable given the way that things are set up.Its definitely not something that we wanted to walk away from and I felt like we rode it out as long as we could.We, over a period of time, explored every option possible to try and sustain it.But at this point felt like we had to make a decision.
Dolphins Trade Jay Ajayi to Eagles for Fourth-Round Pick:::::The Eagles (7-1) have the fifth-ranked run offense and have won six straight games.Coach Doug Pederson wasnt sure the team needed any help.It has to be the right fit, Pederson said Monday.It cant just be anybody.From my standpoint, you dont want to disrupt the chemistry that is going on in the dressing room right now.Those guys are playing with a lot of confidence and theyre rallying around each other so it would have to be a pretty special fit to make it work.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Ajayi fits the special category despite his inconsistent season.He had 122 yards rushing in Week 2 and 130 in Week 6.Last year, Ajayi was lauded for his durability and ability to break tackles.He helped the Dolphins reach the playoffs for the first time since 2008, and joined O.J.Simpson, Earl Campbell and Tiki Barber as the only players to rush for 200 yards three times in a season.The London-born Ajayi wasnt drafted until the fifth round in 2015 because of a knee issue, but he has averaged 18 carries a game the past two seasons and has made 19 consecutive starts.Ajayi has been held out of practice a lot this year to protect his knees, and the Dolphins may have doubts about his longevity.The Dolphins (4-3) needed a shake-up.Theyre in the playoff race even though they rank last in the N.F.L.in points and yards.With Ajayi gone, Damien Williams and Kenyan Drake are expected to share duties at running back Sunday against Oakland.The Eagles have to make a roster spot for Ajayi.Wendell Smallwood, Corey Clement and Kenjon Barner are the other running backs on the roster.They lost Darren Sproles for the season in Week 3.

Ezekiel Elliott Likely to Serve Suspension After Ruling:::::Judge Faillas ruling stated that the N.F.L.s arbitrator had given Elliott ample opportunity to challenge the decision and that the N.F.L.P.A.has failed to demonstrate a substantial question warranting the extraordinary remedy of injunctive relief or a balance of hardships that decidedly weighs in its favor.The next step would most likely be for Elliott and the players union to appeal the decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and ask for Judge Faillas ruling to be stayed until he can receive a hearing from that court.Cowboys Coach Jason Garrett held his weekly news conference earlier Monday and said that the team would not have a comment after the ruling, but he acknowledged that the Cowboys had planned for all eventualities.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.We have some veteran running backs, he said.We have some depth at that position.Its not like were just living this day and we dont think about the future at all you have to do that.I think you build your team that way at all positions.Elliott began the season with the suspension hanging over his head, and initially it seemed to be affecting him.He had just 277 rushing yards through the first four games, and the Cowboys were 2-2 after ending last season 13-3.He seemed to rediscover his form in a Week 5 loss to Green Bay, and in the past two weeks he exploded for 297 rushing yards and five touchdowns total, re-establishing himself as the centerpiece of the teams offense and leading the Cowboys back over .500.His absence, if he is not able to further delay the suspension, would drastically affect his teams playoff hopes.Elliotts challenge of the suspension, which has come through legal action by the players association, rested on the argument that the investigation and appeal had been unfair to him.A federal judge in Texas agreed with that notion, issuing an injunction in early September that blocked the suspension from starting.The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit threw out that injunction this month in a 2-1 ruling, saying that the lawsuit on Elliotts behalf was premature because all the procedures available under the leagues collective bargaining agreement had yet to be exhausted.The district court had issued a temporary restraining order on Oct. 19 to give Judge Failla time to set a hearing date, but with her decision on Monday, Elliott is quickly running out of options before the N.F.L.is able to enforce the suspension.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Dallas is scheduled to host the Kansas City Chiefs on Sunday, and if Elliott is not available the team will turn to the veteran backups Darren McFadden and Alfred Morris.
Bears Zach Miller Needed Emergency Surgery After Negated Touchdown:::::Photo Tight end Zach Miller of the Bears suffered a serious knee injury on Sunday and had surgery for an artery tear the same day.In the third quarter, Miller caught an apparent 25-yard touchdown pass in the end zone.As he landed, he became tangled with Saints defensive back Rafael Bush.Millers left leg could be seen bending in the wrong direction as he landed.After landing, he rolled over before dropping the ball.The play was reviewed and the pass was ruled incomplete.The call was controversial, but the Bears had other concerns: Miller was grievously injured.Teammates quickly realized the seriousness of the injury and rushed to his side.He left the field on a cart and was taken to the hospital.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Miller underwent urgent vascular surgery in New Orleans to repair a torn popliteal artery, which is near the knee, according to a statement by the team.The operation was described as successful by the Bears on Monday.There was no immediate word on Millers future in the sport.Social media accounts of the Bears and their players filled up with messages of concern and support.The injury was severe enough that some wondered if amputation had been an option.While the team did not say if amputation was considered, Coach John Fox told reporters on Monday that the possibility had occurred to him.
In the Jets Hands, a Late Lead Yields a Third Straight Loss:::::The Jets (3-5) had their chances.After taking a 7-0 lead on McCowns 20-yard pass to Eric Tomlinson on their opening series, they recovered a botched snap by Matt Ryan at the Falcons 34.Three plays netted 6 yards, and a 46-yard field goal attempt by Chandler Catanzaro was wide right.That was one of two misses by Catanzaro, and after each, Ryan led Atlanta to a touchdown, the second coming on a go-ahead 8-yard pass to Mohamed Sanu with 12 minutes 22 seconds to play.The Falcons (4-3) did not trail again, outscoring the Jets by 12-3 in the second half.Theres no excuse, Catanzaro said.My teammates are counting on me to put it through the two yellow pipes, and I didnt do that today.Not only did Catanzaro cost his team 6 points, returner Jeremy Kerley muffed a punt at the Jets 15 with 6:42 to play.That allowed Atlanta to extend its lead to the final 5-point margin.It sailed a little bit, said the usually sure-handed Kerley.It was wet, raining, and the ball was more slippery than I thought it was.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Coach Todd Bowles said the Jets played hard, for the most part.Its disappointing not to win, Bowles said.Its disappointing we didnt close it out.Too many mistakes in the fourth quarter.Cant happen.Cant put the ball on the ground.Cant have timely mistakes.Everybody has to play their brand of ball.Hard enough, not good enough.What happened Sunday is nothing new.The Jets blew an early 14-0 lead against New England here two weeks ago, then squandered a 28-14 fourth-quarter lead in a 31-28 loss to the Dolphins in Miami.Linebacker Demario Davis said the circumstances have been different in each game.I dont think you can look at it and say its that simple, that it is the same thing over and over and over, he said.We just have to find a way to make those big plays, whether its defense, whether its offense, whether its special teams, or whatever the case.We have to find a way to make those plays down the stretch.Running back Matt Forte went in another direction, saying that the Jets offensive coordinator, John Morton, got away from the game plan by not sticking with the running game more with the rain falling so hard.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Im surprised by that, Forte said after the Jets rushed 22 times for 43 yards.We knew the weather was going to be like this, and then it continued to rain the entire game.He went on: It should have been one person getting 20 carries, or something like that.However, that is part of learning for the Jets.They were 5-11 last season and were generally thought to be one of the leagues worst teams coming into the season.Its been tough, said receiver Robby Anderson, who had six catches for a career-best 104 yards and a touchdown.Weve been right there.Were just not finishing it out, so its been tough, honestly.Its just growing pains, so were going to get over this hump.
A Big Turnover in the N.F.C.: The Top Teams at Midseason:::::The Saints (5-2), meanwhile, have won five consecutive games.The winning streak for the Vikings (6-2) is at four games, and the dominant Eagles (7-1) have won six in a row.The Rams (5-2) had a bye Sunday, but they have won their past two games and have scored 74 more points than they have given up, which is the second-best point differential in the N.F.L.(The Eagles are at plus 76.)Theres also something fresh and invigorating about the four upstarts that have climbed atop the N.F.C.s four divisions.Were having fun and not listening to people telling us what were not supposed to be able to do, Minnesotas Case Keenum, a backup quarterback, said after the Vikings 33-16 victory over Cleveland (0-8) on Sunday.Weve got a lot of weapons, and were cutting it loose.Cutting it loose?Sounds like a mantra for the quartet trying to crash the N.F.C.playoff party.There are some common threads to the successful paths these teams have followed.Combined, they are 11-3 on the road, which may be the best measuring stick for excellence in the N.F.L.Also, the Vikings, the Rams, the Eagles and the Saints have defenses that disrupt opposing offenses and distract opposing quarterbacks, something that was on display in Sundays games.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Consider, for example, that New Orleans won Sunday without Drew Brees, the starting quarterback, throwing a touchdown pass, which had not happened in eight seasons.The Saints stellar running back, Mark Ingram, nearly gave the game away to the Chicago Bears twice with fumbles in the fourth quarter, but Ingrams defensive teammates bailed him out each time.There have not been many games in recent years when the New Orleans defense outshined the offense.But except for one 50-yard carry by Chicago running back Jordan Howard, the Saints held the powerful Howard to 2.36 yards per carry.The Vikings were trailing Cleveland at halftime and led by only a touchdown entering the fourth quarter.Then Minnesotas front seven sacked Browns quarterback DeShone Kizer three times in the next three Cleveland possessions, and Keenum deftly led the Vikings to a runaway victory.As for the Eagles, even when not playing their best and that was the case in a 33-10 romp over the San Francisco 49ers (0-8) on Sunday they still make winning look easy.Having a defense that held the 49ers to 238 yards and sacked the quarterback four times helps considerably.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The Eagles are living a charmed existence so far.As quarterback Carson Wentz said: Being 7-1?Its a good place to be.Granted, some of the current N.F.C.division leaders have not yet weathered the more challenging portions of their schedules.Then again, as teams that did not make the playoffs a year ago, they generally have less arduous schedules than those of teams that bulled their way into last years postseason.Its called the spoils of parity.But as the N.F.L.schedule rounds the halfway pole and churns toward a still distant finish line, there are new contenders, a couple of surprising, conspicuous laggards and some struggling old powerhouses desperately trying to catch up.Which may not be as new and startling as it may seem.Last season, two-thirds of the teams that qualified for the N.F.C.postseason (Giants, Lions, Falcons and Cowboys) had not been in the playoffs during the previous season.This year may produce the same kind of turnover.
Carson Wentz Is Fueling Eagles Hype. Not That Hes Noticed.:::::No one here has anointed Wentz as an amalgam of Andrew Luck and Brett Favre, or petitioned to rename the state as Wentzylvania, or pricing flights to Minneapolis site of a certain big game that rhymes with Grouper Roll for early February.Nah, nothing like that.Witness the power of Wentz, whose development in his second season has accelerated the Eagles revival.His obliviousness to the mounting attention, not just Hasselbecks second act in broadcasting is what can sustain it.I dont want to say robotic, right tackle Lane Johnson said, but hes just consistent really, really consistent.Before Sunday, when Philadelphia kept the San Francisco 49ers winless by bludgeoning them, 33-10, under steady rain at Lincoln Financial Field, Wentz had thrown at least three touchdown passes in each of his last three games.He mustered only two in what he called a sluggish performance against San Francisco, running his season total to 19, staying on pace to shatter the franchises season record of 32.Sonny Jurgensen set the mark in 1961, and the Eagles have had some pretty fair quarterbacks since then: Ron Jaworski, Randall Cunningham and, best of them all, Donovan McNabb, who in his prime with rare exceptions afforded the Eagles at least one certainty heading into every game: that they would have the advantage at quarterback.Wentz has not earned that distinction yet, but the Eagles are enamored with how quickly he seems to be getting there.In truth, they are enamored with most things now, from their win-loss record to their red-zone efficiency (68 percent) to their ferocious defense, which sacked 49ers quarterback C. J. Beathard four times, hit him 12 more, and also forced a three-and-out or a turnover on eight of San Franciscos 14 possessions.On one of those takeaways, Jalen Mills returned an interception 37 yards for a touchdown.Photo If youre enjoying your first real dominant season as a team, no ones going to show up on Sunday and take it for granted, defensive end Chris Long said.We havent been here before, so lets build on it.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The Eagles joy ride in this muddled N.F.C., where the Los Angeles Rams and Minnesota Vikings are soaring and the Atlanta Falcons and Dallas Cowboys are sagging, has been tempered by several injuries: linebacker Jordan Hicks, running back Darren Sproles and the All-Pro left tackle Jason Peters are all done for the season.Philadelphias defense, which entered Sunday as the leagues stingiest against the run, is capable of continuing to mitigate these absences.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.So is Wentz.In discussing Wentz, Hasselbeck recalled a spirited conversation he had with his ESPN colleague, the Hall of Fame quarterback Steve Young.Hasselbeck has come to espouse Youngs evaluation of quarterbacks: How a quarterback fares between the 20-yard lines doesnt matter.You earn your money on third down and then the red zone, Hasselbeck said.On third down, this team is relying on you to be this amazing marinara sauce on yesterdays pasta.Guess what, we dont have a good answer.Heres the answer: You make a perfect throw.Through Week 8, Philadelphia ranks second in third-down conversion rate (47.8) in large part because of Wentzs improved precision his placement in tight spaces, in particular but also because of his ability to prolong plays with his elusiveness, whether by finding open receivers when coverages break down or scrambling to extend the drive.His eight touchdown tosses and 118.8 passer rating on third down lead the N.F.L., according to the sports data service Sportradar.In the red zone, his 13 touchdowns including a 1-yarder to Zach Ertz, his favorite target, on Sunday also lead the league.The Eagles demonstrated conviction in moving up to draft Wentz with the No.2 pick in 2016.Their trade partner, the Cleveland Browns, did not think Wentz would be a top-20 N.F.L.quarterback.In a somewhat related note, the Browns are 1-26 in their last 27 games.(Should we mention that on draft night this year Cleveland traded the No.12 pick to the Houston Texans, who selected Deshaun Watson, who as a rookie has thrown 19 touchdowns in seven games?No?O.K.)All told, though, the Eagles talent on offense at the time of the 2016 draft was comparable to that of Clevelands, maybe even worse.They responded by surrounding Wentz with better players, adding running back LeGarrette Blount and receivers Torrey Smith and Alshon Jeffery, who contorted to catch a jump ball along the sideline Sunday that turned into a 53-yard touchdown.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Wentz has also benefited from a full off-season of preparation within Coach Doug Pedersons system.Remember: Just 14 months ago, before being elevated after Philadelphia shipped Sam Bradford to Minnesota, Wentz ranked behind Chase Daniel on the depth chart.A career understudy, Pederson became so adept at decoding defenses from the sideline, Hasselbeck said, that Brett Favre dubbed him The Front Doctor.From backing up Favre and also Dan Marino, Steve Bono and Jim McMahon Pederson said he had observed how they communicated with coaches, talking about play calls and game situations.Pederson welcomes that continuing dialogue with Wentz, who carries enough influence and has engendered enough trust that not only can he recommend plays from his time at North Dakota State he said he had to call there to get the film but execute them for touchdowns, as he did on a madcap third-down throw to Corey Clement last week against Washington.The Eagles victory Sunday lacked such scintillating moments.The weather was ugly, at times the play was, too, and some of Wentzs poor throws he missed an open Jeffery in the end zone could have prompted the fatalists in the crowd to lapse into that familiar emotion roused whenever something good happens in Philadelphia sports: enthusiasm tinged by the resignation that Wentz will soon be walking beneath a plummeting piano.Eight games in, seven victories, one piano.The good news for Wentz, and the Eagles, is that if another does fall, he probably wouldnt even realize it.
N.F.L. Week 8: Texans Kneel, but Seahawks Steal the Show:::::The 2008 Detroit Lions might have some company.Both the Cleveland Browns and the San Francisco 49ers reached the seasons midpoint with 0-8 records, and neither team has seemed to show much improvement along the way.They have a chance of joining those 2008 Lions as the N.F.L.s only 0-16 teams, though three other teams since 1944 have finished seasons winless in fewer games.Texans kneel during anthem to protest owners inmates remark.In what is sure to reinvigorate the debate about N.F.L.players protesting or demonstrating during the playing of the national anthem, an overwhelming majority of the Houston Texans players knelt during the playing of the song.Coming into the game, the Texans had been widely expected to engage in a mass demonstration after their owner, Bob McNair, was quoted as saying we cant have the inmates running the prison.McNair apologized to the players for the comment, and subsequently claimed he had actually been discussing the relationship between team owners and the league office led by Commissioner Roger Goodell, but players were unconvinced of his sincerity and several discussed potential plans for how to handle the anthem on Sunday.DeAndre Hopkins and DOnta Foreman reportedly walked out of the teams practice on Friday after hearing of the remarks.CBS, which was broadcasting a golf event until 4 p.m. Eastern, did not air the anthem.Pictures and video showed more than 40 members of the team kneeling, with only a few standing.On Friday, Texans offensive lineman Duane Brown told reporters the team would respond to McNairs words.I think it was ignorant, Brown said.I think it was embarrassing.I think it angered a lot of players, including myself.We put our bodies and minds on the line every time we step on that field, and to use an analogy of inmates in prison, thats disrespectful.Thats how I feel about it.Advertisement Continue reading the main story On the opposite

knee.- Want exclusive sports news, highlights and analysis from a rotating cast of New York Times journalists, delivered to your inbox once a week?Click here to receive our weekly Sports newsletter.- Photo Seahawks score last in back-and-forth battle with Texans.Distinguishing between the rookie quarterback on one side from the Super Bowl winner on the other was difficult all game, but it was veteran Russell Wilson, not Deshaun Watson, who walked away with a win.In an entertaining shootout, the Seattle Seahawks beat the Houston Texans, 41-38.Watson set a tone for the game early with a soaring 59-yard touchdown pass to Will Fuller on the games opening drive in which the speedy young wide receiver simply outran the entire Seattle defense.He would continue to be aggressive throughout the game, not letting Seattles vaunted secondary, or his three interceptions, change his approach.But despite becoming the first quarterback to have 400 passing yards, 50 rushing yards, and four passing touchdowns in the same game, Watson found himself a hard-luck loser thanks to Wilsons late-game heroics and a few of his own mistakes.Wilson ended up completing 26 of 41 passes for 452 yards and four touchdowns, the last of which was an 18-yarder to Jimmy Graham with 21 seconds left that gave the Seahawks the victory.Seattle looked like it would lose when Wilson was intercepted with just under three minutes left in the game.In the end, it was a handful of rookie mistakes by Watson that provided the scoring difference, as he was intercepted three times, with Richard Sherman accounting for two and Earl Thomas taking his back 78 yards for a touchdown.But even in the loss, the rookie proved he belongs in the N.F.L.and that his prolific passing in the last few weeks was not a case of picking on bad teams.Seattle will have another tough test next week when the Washington Redskins come to town, but their 5-2 record has them tied with the Los Angeles Rams for the best record in the N.F.C.West.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Cowboys feed Elliott the ball, and run away from Redskins.Ezekiel Elliott ran for 150 yards and two touchdowns and the Dallas Cowboys took advantage of a blocked field goal return and three turnovers to beat the Washington Redskins 33-19 Sunday and move into sole possession of second place in the N.F.C.East.Playing in a driving rainstorm that made it difficult to hold onto the ball, let alone throw it, Dak Prescott completed 14 of his 22 passes for 143 yards as Dallas (4-3) heeded the message on Elliotts cleats to Feed Zeke.With another hearing on his N.F.L.suspension coming Monday, Elliott carried the ball 33 times, scored twice for the second consecutive game and surpassed 100 yards for the third in a row.The game turned in the second quarter when Dallas Tyrone Crawford blocked Nick Roses field goal attempt and Orlando Scandrick returned it 86 yards to set up a 1-yard Elliott TD run two plays later.Instead of the Redskins (3-4) leading 16-7, the Cowboys went up 14-13 and never trailed again.Associated Press Photo Patriots take advantage of Chargers miscue.New Englands offense sputtered some on Sunday, but they got some help from the Chargers in a 21-13 victory.It was a day of stalled out drives and costly penalties for both teams, but the key play for the Patriots came early in the second quarter when Ryan Allens punt was muffed by Travis Benjamin of the Chargers inside Los Angeles 10-yard line.Hoping to get something started in a 7-7 game, Benjamin recovered the ball and tried to cut back through his own teams end zone to find room for a return, but he was tracked down by the Patriots gunners and crushed to the ground for a safety.The Patriots got a field goal after the free kick, and the five-point surge gave New England a lead they would never surrender.Tom Brady moved the ball with ease for most of the game, completing 32 of 47 passes for 333 yards, but other than a first-quarter touchdown pass to Rob Gronkowski, New Englands offense had to settle for four field goals and four punts.In a game where the Patriots offense could not finish drives, their much-maligned passing defense did a solid job of containing Philip Rivers and the Chargers.New England opened the season allowing 300 or more passing yards to each quarterback they faced in the first six weeks, but now have had their secondary play a big part in consecutive wins.Rivers completed 17 of 30 passes for 212 yards and one touchdown.The Chargers best play of the game came on an 87-yard touchdown run by Melvin Gordon early in the first quarter, which tied the Chargers franchise record for longest run.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the

Eagles got off to a slow start, punting on six of the teams first eight possessions, but they found their offense and crushed the San Francisco 49ers 33-10.The game was hardly competitive, as the Eagles, playing at home, improved to an N.F.L.-best 7-1 without a hint of a comeback from a 49ers team that fell to 0-8 for the first time in franchise history.In familiar fashion, Carson Wentz was efficient and occasionally electric, completing two touchdown passes, one of which went for 53 yards to Alshon Jeffrey.It was Wentzs fifth touchdown pass of 50 or more yards this season and he finished the day with a modest 211 yards thanks to the lopsided score.C.J.Beathard was not able to keep up, completing just 17 of 36 passes for 167 yards.He had one touchdown and two interceptions, one of which was returned for a touchdown, as he dealt with four sacks and 12 quarterback hits.Philadelphia will stay at home to face the Denver Broncos next week, while the 49ers will try to find their first win in a home game against the Arizona Cardinals.Niners continue their national anthem protests.Seven members of the San Francisco 49ers knelt during the national anthem before the game

Monica Lewinsky and efforts by Congress to impeach him, it fell on Joe Lockhart, then the White House spokesman, day after day to defend his boss.But unlike many of his predecessors, he did not just take his marching orders.In countless meetings with the president and his advisers, Lockhart helped shape the message he would convey, and he aggressively pressed it to reporters.Last year, Lockhart took his pugnacious style to another embattled institution, the National Football League.Read Ken Belsons story on Lockhart here.
The Battle-Scarred West Wing Veteran Scripting the N.F.L.s Anthem Message:::::It is a curious career moment for a man who cut his teeth on the campaign trail and spent part of his post-White House days working for corporate titans like Oracle and Facebook.But, as Sosnik and others who know him attest, Lockhart is a wartime general, not a peacetime general for institutions facing conflict.Thats not to say the troops are always in agreement.In interviews with about a dozen league and team executives all of whom refused to speak on the record several owners seemed pleased with his approach to addressing the anthem controversy, which was to strive for a way for the N.F.L.to appear patriotic while respectful of its players who were kneeling to raise awareness of racism and police brutality toward African-Americans.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Race/Related Newsletter Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of New York Times journalists.But there has been friction.Some owners were upset with a comment by Lockhart a few days after President Trump criticized the league and its players over the kneeling during the anthem.Lockhart told reporters that talking about police brutality is what real locker room talk is.The statement was viewed as a flagrant jab at the president, who had dismissed as locker room banter comments he made about forcing himself on women, heard in a video leaked during the campaign.Advertisement Continue reading the main story In a meeting at N.F.L.headquarters the next day, the Dallas Cowboys owner, Jerry Jones, and the Washington Redskins owner, Dan Snyder, confronted Lockhart to tell him that his remarks would inflame an already fiery issue.Lockhart confirmed the exchange, which was first reported by ESPN, but said his goal was to react quickly and forcefully, not to craft the perfect rejoinder.In interviews, several owners, team executives and league officials said that Lockhart had helped amplify the leagues message, even if they questioned whether more could have been done to anticipate problems before they turned into crises.The attacks by the president, though, were so unusual that you cant dump this at his feet, one team executive said of Lockhart.Lockhart said that he understood why the owners were frustrated, but that his job was to keep pushing the leagues view, and pushing back at those who opposed it.Thats why they allow me to sit up there and promote it and defend the narrative that football is a great game, brings great values and its a great business, he said.The owners criticism, he said, is just part of the job.Given the continuing heated debate inside the league on the issue, there is from time to time speculation on whether Lockhart is long for the job.But if there is a movement to oust him, it is a quiet one.At events like the Super Bowl, Lockhart is often within arms reach of the leagues commissioner, Roger Goodell, the pair a study in contrasts.Goodell is tall, athletic and prim.Lockhart is slumped, stocky and tousled.He was so used to the casual dress style in Silicon Valley that he reluctantly resumed wearing neckties when he joined the button-down N.F.L.Unlike his boss, who has worked more than four decades at the league office, Lockhart has thinner links to football.Growing up in Rockland County, northwest of New York City, he rooted for Joe Namath and the Jets, he said, but colleagues remember him more as a baseball fan, with a picture of the 1986 Mets hanging in his West Wing office.In high school, he played basketball, not football.Advertisement Continue reading the main story On Sundays during the season, if Lockhart is not at a stadium, he typically watches games in his Manhattan apartment with his two young children, whom he had with his second wife, Giovanna Gray, a former aide to Senator Kirsten E. Gillibrand of New York.(His first marriage, to the television journalist Laura Logan, ended in divorce.)His political genes developed early.Dinnertime conversation growing up was more likely to be about politics and journalism than sports.His parents worked in television, and his father was a longtime producer at NBC News.Every four years, the Lockhart family spent the summer wherever the presidential conventions were being held.His skills in choppy political waters have been put to the test in the month since Trump lashed out at players who did not stand for the national anthem.From the start of the crisis in late September, Lockhart used tactics he had honed in Washington.He has pushed the leagues case by reaching out to reporters with statements and near-daily conference calls.Through his bidding, the league has publicized positive things that the players are doing in their communities, promoted the idea that the players and owners are united (despite evidence on the field to the contrary), and tried to avoid addressing the presidents remarks directly.Photo Some of the tone and messaging of the leagues statements, which Lockhart helped craft, have also been in line with a Democratic progressive, a point some owners, a group that includes several staunch supporters of the president, have not missed.They seemed to seek a third way, a famously Clintonian way of compromise.The leagues initial 87-word statement, issued the day after the president first attacked the league, came after Goodell, Lockhart and other league executives called owners to sound them out.Most N.F.L.statements are bland, but this one was notable for its directness as well as for what it left out.Goodells statement did not explicitly defend the players right to protest during the anthem, or even mention racism, the core issue that started the sitting and kneeling demonstrations last season, but it included an unusually strong rebuttal to the president.Divisive comments like these demonstrate an unfortunate lack of respect for the N.F.L., our great game and all our players, and a failure to understand the overwhelming force for good our clubs and players represent in our communities, it said.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Many owners, including several who are donors to Democratic causes, soon followed with similar statements of their own.But other owners issued statements lamenting the leagues getting pulled into political debates.After weeks of back and forth, and owners flirting with requiring players to stand, fewer players are kneeling during the anthem.Lockhart has kept his assertive posture.In a talk with reporters, he was asked about the president, who said the N.F.L.should force all players to stand for the anthem.Hes exercising his freedom to speak, and Im exercising my freedom not to react, Lockhart replied dryly.As the N.F.L.and social media have grown, the league has become a lightning rod for a host of social issues, including bullying and domestic violence, that stretch its capacity to control the narrative.Lockhart began advising the league as a consultant in 2014, after video surfaced showing the former running back Ray Rice knocking out his fiance in an elevator.When Lockharts predecessor, Paul Hicks, left the N.F.L.at the end of 2015, he was a logical replacement.Lockhart was interested in returning to New York and, he said, taking on a complex challenge to make the N.F.L.more fleet-footed and assured in responding to controversy.(It is unclear what he is paid, but according to N.F.L.tax filings, Hicks earned $1.5 million in his last year at the league.)Lockhart, who worked on political campaigns dating to Jimmy Carters re-election bid in 1980, has quickly changed the metabolism in the leagues communications office.When The New York Times published an article last year that compared the N.F.L.s approach to the concussion crisis to tactics used by the tobacco industry, Lockhart issued a long and detailed rebuttal, and said the league would consider taking legal action.(None has been taken.)Some reporters are not buying what it is being pushed.Jim Trotter, the president of the Pro Football Writers of America, took exception to Lockharts assertion that the league had tried to become more transparent.Lockharts conference calls were initially not open to all writers, and Goodell and other top executives have not been made available, Trotter said.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Theres no question they have been more proactive, and thats part of Joe Lockharts approach to it, Trotter said.They will respond to things quicker than in the past.Does that mean its accurate?No, but its their opinion.Still, to a certain extent, he is still seen as a political animal, and a few owners, who by and large lean right, have questioned whether a lifelong Democrat like Lockhart (who sold his house in Washington to former President Barack Obama) is the best person to speak on behalf of the league.Lockhart said his politics had little to do with his job.My work is about making sure that people understand what it is were doing, why that is and what impact it is having, he said.Thats devoid of a political agenda.It doesnt mean I dont have political views.But my overriding view when I come to work is, Whats good for the N.F.L.?
Texans Owner Bob McNair Apologizes Again and Meets With His Team:::::Players across the N.F.L.have reacted strongly to McNairs inmates remark, some of them suggesting they would never play for the Texans.The conflict came at a critical time for the N.F.L., which has been in talks with players to address some of the concerns that led them to abstain from standing for the anthem, including racial injustice and, more specifically, the treatment of African-Americans by the police and the criminal justice system.A handful of owners and players have met in recent weeks to see if the league can help support the players in their causes.Under withering criticism from President Trump and from many fans, the owners are also eager for the players to consistently stand during the anthem.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Race/Related Newsletter Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of New York Times journalists.The players and owners may meet again Monday or Tuesday, but there has been confusion about the location, the agenda and whether Colin Kaepernick, the former San Francisco 49ers quarterback who last season started the practice of not standing for the anthem, will attend.Kaepernicks lawyer said Saturday that Kaepernick had not received an invitation to the meeting.Its obvious that Colin is being invoked for purposes other than playing football, the lawyer, Mark Geragos, said in an interview.Everyone seems to have an agenda other than putting Colin on the football field.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Officials at the N.F.L.said it was up to the players to invite him.Earlier this week the players union, which is helping coordinate the meeting, did not appear to be sure it would take place and had not firmed up a guest list.On Saturday, Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Malcolm Jenkins, who has been active in the talks, invited McNair, Commissioner Roger Goodell and Kaepernick to meet in Philadelphia, according to ESPN.Eric Reid, a safety on the 49ers who knelt with Kaepernick during the anthem last season, and has also participated in talks with the league, was also confused by Jenkinss invitation because he, too, was unaware of any meeting in Philadelphia.Im not sure why a press release was sent out saying theres a meeting when theres no confirmation the N.F.L.would attend the meeting, Reid said.There needs to be better communication.Kaepernicks attendance would be noteworthy.Now a free agent, he has been unable to secure a new contract from another team.This month, he filed a grievance in which he claimed the owners had colluded to keep him out of the league.
Texans Owner Bob McNair Apologizes for Inmates Remark:::::Photo Houston Texans owner Bob McNair apologized on Friday for a remark he made last week about inmates running the prison if N.F.L.owners allowed players to continue to sit or kneel during the national anthem, but the apology appears to have done little to appease his own players.McNair made the comment among a handful of other owners who were together at a New York hotel after a meeting with about a dozen players, many of them African-Americans who have demonstrated during the anthem to highlight a lack of attention to racial oppression.The players and owners were seeking common ground on the issue when they met at the N.F.L.headquarters in Manhattan.When a group of owners later discussed whether the league ought to clamp down on the protests, McNair suggested it should, because we cant have the inmates running the prison.The comment, which ESPN reported, was taken as insensitive and demeaning to the players.I never meant to offend anyone, and I was not referring to our players, McNair said in a statement on Friday.I used a figure of speech that was never intended to be taken literally.I would never characterize our players or our league that way, and I apologize to anyone who was offended by it.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Some players on the Texans, though, were having a hard time accepting McNairs apology.They considered walking out of practice on Friday, and one player, DeAndre Hopkins, did not attend, according to The Houston Chronicle.
World Series Ratings Decrease Slightly From 2016:::::Photo LOS ANGELES The Houston Astros seven-game World Series win over the Los Angeles Dodgers averaged 18.9 million viewers on Fox, down by 19 percent from the 23.4 million average for the Chicago Cubs seven-game victory over the Cleveland Indians last year for their first title since 1908.The total audience for the Series across Foxs three outlets averaged 19.56 million, the network said Thursday.That included an average of 476,000 viewers on Fox Deportes, up 34 percent from 355,000 last year, and a digital audience average of 183,000 on Fox Sports Go, an increase of 4 percent.The number of viewers on Fox was up by 37 percent from San Franciscos seven-game win over Kansas City in 2014, which averaged 13.8 million on Fox.This years Series averaged a 10.7 rating and 20 share, down from a 13.1 and 23 last year.That was the highest-rated World Series since 2004, when the Boston Red Sox defeated St. Louis for their first title since 1918.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The rating is the percentage of television households tuned to a broadcast, and the share is the percentage tuned in among those television households with sets on at the time.
Astros George Springer, the Series M.V.P., Has Come a Long Way:::::Springer comes from an athletic family.His sisters were standout softball players.His paternal grandfather moved to the United States from Panama to play baseball.His father, George Jr., played baseball in the Little League World Series and then college football at Connecticut.It was at school that George Jr. met his wife, Laura, a college gymnast from Puerto Rico.Photo George Springer IIIs parents chose to raise their children in New Britain.It allowed them to grow up around their grandparents, aunts and uncles, and in a diverse community.Our kids, from a very early age, were connecting with kids that many of them didnt look like them or spoke a different language, said Springers father, who is a lawyer.And if you watch George now, you see how he interacts with everybody.Early in high school, Springer was 5-foot-2.By his senior year, a growth spurt added nearly a foot.In college, he developed into a coveted prospect.Yet even as he flourished on the field, he had to contend with a stutter that was evident at a young age.Self-conscious of it, he became withdrawn and avoided speaking in school or other public situations.It was only when Springer was called up to the big leagues for the first time, in April 2014, that he learned to accept himself, adopted new techniques to help with his speech and later became a spokesman and fund-raiser for the Stuttering Association for the Young.It took a lot of courage, his father said, adding: This didnt happen overnight.It was hard work, most of which, quite frankly, George did.We were there to guide, assist, coach and support, but he was the one that had to be comfortable in his own skin.He was the one that had to adopt all the techniques.I give him all the credit.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Even now, Springer occasionally stammers during interviews, but he speaks with poise and earnestness.In his first All-Star Game, over the summer, he wore a wireless microphone in the outfield for a national television interview during the game.Photo I cant spread a message to kids and adults if Im not willing to put myself out there, he said then.On the field, Springer grew, too.He hit 20 home runs in his rookie season, in 2014, but struck out 114 times in 78 games.He cut down on his strikeout rate each season after that, and improved the quality of his at-bats so much that the Astros made him their everyday leadoff hitter in May 2016.Hes dynamic, Astros catcher Brian McCann said.Hes a free safety playing baseball.He can hit the ball 450 feet, play Gold Glove center field, score from first every time theres a double.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Springer might not be a typical choice for center field because of his size (he is listed at 6-foot-3, 215 pounds) or the leadoff spot because of his power (he hit 29 home runs in 2016 and 34 in 2017).But Astros Manager A.J.Hinch has loved the spark Springer provides at the top of the order, and it showed in the playoffs, especially in the World Series.When hes hot, were hot, Hinch said.He started off the game with a ton of energy in the most critical game of the year.With the Astros leading the Dodgers, 3-0, in the second inning of Game 7, Springer hit a 96-mile-an-hour fastball from starter Yu Darvish over the center-field fence for a two-run home run.That made him the first player to hit a home run in four consecutive games in a single World Series.His five home runs tied Reggie Jackson (1977) and Chase Utley (2009) for the most in a World Series.In all, he hit .379 (11 for 29) with seven runs batted in, eight runs scored and a World Series record eight extra-base hits.Given how he ended, it was easy to forget that he sputtered in the American League Championship Series against the Yankees after a strong showing in the first round, and that he struck out four times in Game 1 of the World Series.
Dodgers Yu Darvish Confronts His Very Bad World Series:::::Darvishs decision was based in part on the number of reporters looking to get answers from him, and his desire not to create a traffic jam in the somber Dodgers clubhouse.But there also seemed to be a measure of accountability in his choice, as if he felt it was incumbent on him to sit in the spotlight and answer all of the questions about why he had pitched so poorly.Photo I had bad days, he said, and that means somebody else had a great day.I try to think of it that way, and sometimes it works.Maybe this time it didnt work because I let my teammates down.Darvish, who came to the major leagues in 2012 amid a good deal of fanfare and joined the Dodgers in July in a trade designed to fortify their chances to win a championship, is hardly the first player to stumble so profoundly in the Series.There have been many of them over the decades and, as it turns out, Darvishs awful performance is a perfect match for the one turned in by Art Ditmar of the Yankees in the 1960 World Series against Pittsburgh.Ditmar started Games 1 and 5 for the Yankees and lost both of them, matching Darvishs 0-2 record.He also ended with the same, ugly 21.60 E.R.A.now on Darvishs rsum.And like the Dodgers in 2017, the Yankees lost that Series in seven games.In the aftermath of Game 7 on Wednesday night, Darvishs teammates did their best to keep him from feeling that he was the biggest reason they had lost the Series.Its never about one guy, Justin Turner nobly insisted.Its about 25 guys, and we lost as a team.And Turner had a point.If Kenley Jansen had not blown a save in Game 2, if Clayton Kershaw had not blown two leads in Game 5, the Series might have turned out differently.And yet Darvishs failures were particularly glaring because they put the Dodgers in big holes so early in two games, holes that the Dodgers couldnt get out of.On Wednesday night, with the fans in Dodger Stadium looking on, perhaps a little nervously, Darvish was unable to rebound from his struggles in Game 3.The leadoff hitter, the Astros George Springer, doubled, and by the time the top of the first was over it was already 2-0, Houston.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The top of the second was no better.With a runner on base and the score, 3-0, Darvish shook off a sign from his catcher, Austin Barnes, who had called for a slider, and instead threw a fastball to Springer, who drilled it into the left-field pavilion for a home run.The Astros had a 5-0 lead that was both demoralizing and insurmountable.Photo The home run by Springer, that was a tough blow, said Kershaw, the Dodgers ace, who pitched four scoreless innings in relief after Darvish departed, to no avail.Dave Roberts, the Dodgers manager, dismissed questions afterward about whether Darvish should have even started Game 7, considering how poorly he had done in Game 3.Some wondered if Alex Wood might have been a better choice, or even Kershaw, who would have been starting the game on just two days rest.But Roberts didnt think either of those options was realistic.And even after the Dodgers had fallen behind, 3-0, in the second inning, Roberts said, he thought Darvishs pitches were good enough to allow him to face Springer for the second time in the game.It was a decision that might haunt Roberts for some time, but at least he had the right analysis of the outcome.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.I think anything other than a homer, he said dryly, would have been considerably better.The one thing Darvish did do successfully was retire Yuli Gurriel to end the first inning.It was Gurriel, the Astros first baseman, who made the racist gesture about Darvishs facial appearance after he homered off him in Game 3.The gesture initiated an uproar that led to Gurriels receiving a five-game suspension for the start of the 2018 season.It also put Darvish in the uncomfortable position of having to respond to a mess he didnt create, which he did with grace and without anger.In turn, Gurriel, perhaps taking a cue from Darvish, tipped his helmet to him before he batted for the first time on Wednesday night.I just tried not to hit him, Darvish said.Many of Darvishs teammates rallied to his support after the incident created by Gurriel, most notably Rich Hill, the starting pitcher for the Dodgers in Game 6.When Gurriel came to bat for the fist time in that game, Hill fidgeted on the mound before throwing a pitch so that the booing from Dodgers fans could resonate longer.After Game 7, Hill expressed his admiration for Darvish, and for any athlete who has the courage to compete, and potentially fail, in public.Whether Hill and Darvish remain teammates is not certain.Darvish will become a free agent, and while he said on Wednesday that he would like to return to the Dodgers, free agency can go in unpredictable directions.What is certain is that Darvish remains undeterred by what happened to him in the last week.I would like to come back in the World Series, he said.And I want to pitch better.
When Astros Needed to Improvise, Charlie Morton Was Ready:::::Im way better than the way Im pitching right now, Giles said after Game 2 at Dodger Stadium, when he blew a lead in the 10th inning of an eventual 7-6 victory.Im not pitching to my expectations and Im beating myself up about it.The cracks had started showing in the American League Championship Series at Yankee Stadium when Giles who had 34 saves in 38 chances in the regular season lost a two-run lead in Game 4.He never pitched after the fourth game of the World Series, when the Dodgers battered him for three runs in the ninth inning to break open a tie game.By then, Hinch had already shown a willingness to find other pitchers for crucial spots, eschewing the crutch that managers often depend on.Stubbornly hoping for the summer version of a reliever now fading in the fall had contributed to other teams World Series downfalls notably the Boston Red Sox in 1986 and the Philadelphia Phillies in 1993.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Hinch refused to bury the Astros in that same graveyard.At three critical points in this postseason, he liked what he saw from a pitcher already in the game and let him finish it.Youve got to go with the hot hand, and it worked, said the Astros owner, Jim Crane, an old college pitcher.And it worked more than once.In Game 7 of the A.L.C.S., Hinch used starter Lance McCullers Jr. to relieve Morton for the final four innings.That decision clinched the pennant for Houston.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.In Game 3 of the World Series, starter Brad Peacock relieved McCullers with one out in the sixth, Hinch stuck with him the rest of the way, too.And when McCullers could not survive the third inning of his start on Wednesday night, Hinch used three relievers to get the game to Morton for the bottom of the sixth.Two former Cy Young Award winners, Dallas Keuchel and Justin Verlander, got loose for the Astros in the bullpen.But Morton was stifling the Dodgers, and Hinch did not stop him.I was comfortable with him closing the game around three innings, but he did it with four, Hinch said, adding that he knew he had reinforcements if needed.As much as I scripted this game, it never plays out the way you expect.The Astros did not expect Giles to falter in October, but they protected themselves by engineering their staff to be fresh through the postseason.Not a single pitcher on the team worked 162 innings the minimum to be considered for the E.R.A.title as an Astro this season.Mike Fiers led the team in innings, with 153, and he was left off the postseason roster.Photo Of course, the Astros did trade for the prototypical leading man: Verlander, who worked 206 innings between playing for Detroit and Houston and fired a complete game in the A.L.C.S.But McCullers, Peacock and Morton each made at least 22 starts in the regular season while pitching between 115 and 150 innings enough of a workload to be available for multiple innings in October, but not so much to be exhausted by the World Series.I have to give props to our medical team, General Manager Jeff Luhnow said.They kept our guys healthy and playing.At this point in the season, the difference between medical teams could win the World Series.Our doctors, our trainers, our strength guys, they kept these guys out there.Advertisement Continue reading the main story In the end, there was Morton, sturdy and strong, defying his history as a pitcher perhaps best known for injuries.He had left hip surgery in 2010, Tommy John surgery in 2012 and right hip surgery in 2014.In 10 seasons, he has never reached 30 starts or 175 innings.Last year was especially grim.Traded to Philadelphia after seven seasons with the Pittsburgh Pirates, Morton tore his left hamstring running to first base in April.He spent the next several months making lonely morning drives from his home in Bradenton, Fla., to the Phillies complex in Clearwater, recovering from an injury he knew had ended his season.Its not a good feeling, because youre watching your team on TV and youre a thousand miles away and you cant do anything, Morton said.But you start to appreciate it, because it becomes your responsibility as a professional.Its not glorious; nobody knows whats really going on except the guys youre working with.But its my job.Its my job to approach each situation professionally, and I tried to do that.The Astros saw enough in Mortons statistical profile to sign him to a two-year, $14 million contract last November.They believed in his curveball, which Morton threw more than ever this season, and thought that mechanical changes could help his fastball.They were right.Morton was 14-7 with a 3.62 E.R.A.in the regular season, with a career-best 10 strikeouts per nine innings.Then he became the first pitcher in baseball history to win two Game 7s in the same postseason.Im still not a 200-inning guy, Morton said.But Im part of something special.He thought some more and turned philosophical while teammates smoked cigars and flung beer around the locker room.You just dont know, Morton said.You could bunt a ball, be running down to first base and your season could be over.Or you could be here, and be fortunate to be part of this.Thats how I look at it, because Ive been everything: Ive been the guy you couldnt count on, Ive been the guy that gets hurt all the time, and Ive been a guy you can rely on in a crucial situation.There is no more crucial situation than the bottom of the ninth inning of Game 7 of the World Series, trying to bring your team its first championship ever.Morton delivered.He stopped dreaming, but the dream never gave up on him.
9 Weeks After Harvey, Houston Celebrates World Series Win:::::Its not so much lifting Houston up it sends you in a different direction for a while, said Rabbi Amy Weiss, an unapologetically fair-weather fan who got caught up in Astros-mania and who watched Game 7 at her new home because her old one was wrecked by Harvey.You can climb into the game, into the television, and youre not thinking about your flooded house.Other wounded cities have used professional sports as large-scale therapy.The New York Yankees reached the World Series just weeks after terrorists flew planes into the twin towers of the World Trade Center on Sept. 11, 2001.(They lost the Series, 4-3, to the Arizona Diamondbacks.)After Hurricane Katrina in 2005 damaged the home, then known as the Louisiana Superdome, of the New Orleans Saints, the teams first game back at the stadium in 2006, a 23-3 victory over the Atlanta Falcons, seemed to capture New Orleanss resilience.In 2012, the Saints unveiled a bronze statue outside the Superdome memorializing the dramatic blocked punt in that game by the Saints safety Steve Gleason.The statue was called Rebirth.In Houston, a sport that is sometimes referred to as a game of inches captivated a city defined by them.Residents measured the personal devastation from the worst rainfall in United States history in inches the high-water marks that still stain walls and kitchens and cars and spirits.Photo So the Astros were cheered on by Rabbi Weiss, who had 31 inches of floodwater in her home.And Mr. Doucett, who had roughly 72 inches.And Bob Heyl, who had 15.And Josh and Katie Halburn, who considered themselves lucky with a mere four.And Bob Dunston, who had 180 in his two-story townhome on the San Jacinto River, his third flood in 16 months.Advertisement Continue reading the main story We think its awesome that they keep getting knocked down and keep getting back up, Mr. Dunston, 58, said of the Astros, whom he watched on Wednesday at his new rental home.Its a good distraction, because at the end of the day, after the Series is over, were still going to have to go back in and look at that property and its just going to be a screwed-up mess.From the garage floor to five feet into the second floor is 180 inches.Fifteen feet.I walked out the door.I had my computer, a bottle of Crown, a bundle of cigars, two changes of clothes and my fathers flag from his funeral.That has been the Houston way lately: to blend talk of the Astros with talk of Harvey, so that conversations go from Jose Altuve to Justin Verlander to drywall to FEMA and back again.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Mr. Heyl, 69, recalled the night Harvey seeped into his world.It totaled his familys two cars.It forced him to make a sudden decision to help keep his quadriplegic 41-year-old son safe, assembling a makeshift wheelchair ramp that he used to push him onto a turned-over cabinet.A stranger in a canoe who paddled along their street-turned-river offered to help, and the two men carried Mr. Heyls son, Rich, to a bed on the second floor.In recent weeks, the radio chatter of Astros games provided the low-volume soundtrack of their Harvey recovery, as Mr. Heyl and his wife repaired their home in the upper-middle-class neighborhood known as Meyerland.Photo Youre going to see people referring to this World Series as uplifting the city for years to come, Mr. Heyl said.Its going to be, Remember the Astros.They did it.We can do it.The Astros hometown fans have been loyal, but extraordinarily distracted.Rabbi Weiss followed the team while helping to distribute one million pairs of underwear to storm victims throughout Texas, as part of the mission of the nonprofit group she runs, Undies for Everyone.Mr. Doucett watched the games at night after repairing dozens of nearby homes, handing out food and clothes to the neighborhood and helping form a group in response to Harvey called S.O.S., or Save Our Selves.As Mr. Doucett sat on his porch Wednesday watching the game with his fiance, Samantha Locke, and their friends, there was a brief interruption.Lake Forest Boulevard, with its stray dogs, curbside debris and homes in various stages of repair, felt haunted by Harvey, even two months later.Volunteers from a community group called West Street Recovery pulled up and announced they had a donation for Mr. Doucett.Advertisement Continue reading the main story It was a typical post-Harvey World Series watch party.Some of the guests set down their beers and helped carry panels of Sheetrock to the driveway, in the middle of the fifth inning.
Astros Outlast Dodgers to Clinch First World Series Title:::::LOS ANGELES If the Houston Astros had plenty on their minds and the weight of history on their backs it hardly seemed like a burden when they arrived at Dodger Stadium on Wednesday.A franchise that hadnt won a championship since joining the major leagues in 1962 faced the daunting task of playing Game 7 of the World Series in front of a boisterous crowd supporting the Dodgers.But the Astros appeared oddly at ease.Manager A. J. Hinch kept his pregame news conference light, shortstop Carlos Correa and second baseman Jose Altuve lounged on the grass as they awaited batting practice, and the scene inside the clubhouse was reassuring: Music played, game plans were reviewed and no one was staring into his locker.I was thinking, well, lets see how everyone looks, said Carlos Beltran, one of the veteran leaders.If I feel like were tight, we might need to say something.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Words were not necessary, only deeds.The Astros, playing coolly and confidently from the first pitch, got some big offensive contributions early from their leadoff hitter, George Springer, and used five pitchers to hold off the Dodgers for a 5-1 victory that had little of the drama that had defined the rest of the Series.
Carlos Correa Proposes to Girlfriend During World Series Celebration:::::Photo How do you top winning the World Series?Carlos Correa did it by proposing.Interviewed after the game on Fox, Correa, the Astros shortstop, said of their World Series title, Its one of the biggest accomplishments of my life, and right now I want to take another big step in my life.Producing a ring from his back pocket, Correa turned to his girlfriend and said, Daniella Rodriguez, will you make me the happiest man in the world?Will you marry me?Rodriguez answered affirmatively.Rodriguez was Miss Texas USA in 2016 and got to throw out the first ball at an Astros game in August.Her effort was not especially memorable.It was probably the most high-profile post-sports event proposal since at least 2007, when Ian Johnson of Boise States football team proposed to his girlfriend, Chrissy Popadics, after the Broncos wild Fiesta Bowl win over Oklahoma.Earlier on Wednesday, Correa showed no sign of pre-proposal nerves, as he playfully tossed a cup of water in the face of the actor Ken Jeong, who was waving a giant Dodgers flag atop the Astros dugout.Correa was 1 for 4 on the night.
Mets Promote Pat Roessler to Hitting Coach:::::To help fill the coaching staff of new manager Mickey Callaway, the Mets promoted Pat Roessler to make him the teams new hitting coach, a person in baseball familiar with the situation confirmed.The person did not want to be publicly identified because the move was not yet official.Roessler, 57, had been the Mets assistant hitting coach since the start of the 2015 season.He is a longtime hitting instructor who has held similar positions in other organizations, and had strong relationships with various Mets players.He succeeded Kevin Long, the Mets hitting coach for the past three seasons, who, along with Roessler, helped Daniel Murphy develop into an elite hitter.Long had his sights set on the Mets managerial job that went to Callaway last month.The Mets had hoped that Long would still remain in the organization, but he had drawn interest for other hitting-coach positions and managerial vacancies, including the job in Washington.(That ultimately went to Dave Martinez.)Ricky Bones is expected to remain as the Mets bullpen coach, while Dave Eiland, a former Yankees and Kansas City Royals pitching coach, is reportedly the Mets choice to fill that role for them.
How the Astros Won World Series Game 7, Inning by Inning:::::Bregman had advanced to second on the error, and he showed some aggressiveness by stealing third.The move paid off, as he was able to score on a groundout by Jose Altuve, making it 2-0.Darvish, who lasted just five outs in his Game 3 start, was able to get out of the inning by retiring Carlos Correa on a grounder to first and winning a 13-pitch battle with Yulieski Gurriel, who flew out to right.It could be another short night for Darvish if he does not improve considerably in the second inning.Waldstein: All that pumping up by the fans, the P.A.and the Dodger players came to a crashing thud when the Astros plated a run before there was an out.A lot of people expect to see Clayton Kershaw come into the game early.I spoke to Mark Teixeira on the field before the game and he had an interesting point.He thinks Kershaw was only so-so in Game 5 and if he gets into this game it will be the third time the Astros have seen him.Too risky.Teixeira also thought Darvish was rusty from a long layoff before game 2 and should be sharper tonight.Someone, maybe Kershaw, was jogging around and loosening up in the bullpen in the first inning, and at one point Darvish looked up and saw it.- Want exclusive sports news, highlights and analysis from a rotating cast of New York Times journalists, delivered to your inbox once a

struck out, but McCullers hit two batters with pitches, sandwiching Cody Bellingers latest strikeout between the beanballs.But McCullers stayed cool with the bases loaded and induced a grounder to

and a mammoth two-run home run from the front-runner for World Series M.V.P., George Springer, who became the first player in Series history to homer in four consecutive games.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Brian McCann started the inning by drawing an eight-pitch walk.Marwin Gonzalez, who has been in a terrible slump for most of the World Series, followed that by hitting a double to the wall that would have scored any runner on the Astros beyond McCann.With runners on second and third and no outs, Darvish got the first out of the inning on a soft grounder to second from Josh Reddick, but that brought up McCullers and the American League pitcher was swinging away rather than trying to bunt the slow-footed McCann home, and that strategy worked just fine as he hit a soft grounder to second that gave his battery-mate plenty of time to score.Darvish would last just one more batter, as Springer worked a full-count before getting a fastball he liked, and then he gave it a ride for his fifth home run of the World Series.In what should surprise absolutely no one, Brandon Morrow, who had pitched in each game of the World Series, and 13 of the Dodgers 14 playoff games, got the call to replace Darvish, and he struck out Alex Bregman on just three pitches.Photo Bottom 2nd: Double play ends Dodgers rally.Lance McCullers put two more runners on base, but once again got out of the inning without allowing a run.Logan Forsythe singled to left to start things off and he advanced to second on a groundout by Austin Barnes.With a runner in scoring position and one out, Dave Roberts sent up Kike Hernandez to pinch-hit for Brandon Morrow, and he reached base on a walk.But Chris Taylor lined out to short, and Carlos Correa was able to throw behind Forsythe to double him off at second after making the catch.With Morrow out of the game, the relievers World Series is complete, and he became just the second pitcher to appear in seven World Series games in a single season, joining Darold Knowles of the 1973 Oakland As.Morrow had a disastrous appearance in Game 5, but recovered with scoreless appearances in Games 6 and 7.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Waldstein: Well, even though Mark Teixeira kind of talked me out of it, Kershaw is going to pitch early in this game, as many of us thought he would.But this is not how the Dodgers envisioned it.They wanted to see Darvish go four, or so, innings and leave with a lead before handing it over to Kershaw, who would then give the ball to Kenley Jansen.Now the task is for Kershaw to keep the Astros at bay until the Dodgers can crack McCullers.Theyve been close to breaking through in the first two innings.Its looking like a matter of time.The question remains, though, how much?Top 3rd: Dodgers give the ball to Kershaw, who delivers.With their backs against the wall, the Dodgers went to their biggest gun early, and brought in Clayton Kershaw as a reliever to start the third.He needed just 10 pitches to get three outs.The left-hander got Jose Altuve to fly out to center, Carlos Correa to fly out to right, and then caught Yulieski Gurriel looking at a 95 mile-per-hour fastball that was low in the zone but high enough for home plate umpire Mark Wegner to call strike three.Photo Bottom 3rd: Astros turn to their bullpen to get out of trouble.Both teams are into their bullpens as Lance s once again started the inning by allowing a pair of base runners and was removed after getting one out.Brad Peacock got Houston out of the jam and the Dodgers have yet to score despite having had seven players reach base in the game.Corey Seager hit a ball to right-center that looked like it might be a double, but Seager wisely pulled up to stay at first when he realized George Springer had tracked the ball down quickly.McCullers reacted to the base-runner by hitting Justin Turner with a pitch for a second time it was McCullers World Series record-setting fourth hit batter but he got some help from Cody Bellinger when the rookie struck out on five pitches.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Looking to keep the game scoreless, A.J.Hinch decided McCullers, who had thrown just 49 pitches, was done, and he brought in Peacock who got a long flyout from Yasiel Puig and then got out of the inning by striking out Joc Pederson.Waldstein: Gone are the days of Jack Morris and Sandy Koufax going the distance in a Game 7.Both of the starting pitchers are gone from this game in only the third inning.This is the first time in a World Series Game 7 that both starters did not pitch at least three innings.I expected A.J.Hinch to go longer with McCullers, but he hit four batters (Justin Turner twice) and it seemed like the Dodgers were on the verge against him during his two and one-third innings.Brad Peacock was brilliant in Game 3, but the stakes are much higher now.Top 4th: Kershaw pitches two clean innings.Clayton Kershaw worked around a one-out single to Marwin Gonzalez to pitch a second scoreless inning.He is due up to bat in the bottom half of the inning, so his day could be done.Photo Bottom 4th: Peacock just what the Astros needed.After three innings of the Dodgers getting on base, Brad Peacock threw Houstons first 1-2-3 inning of the day.He got Logan Forsythe to ground out to third, Austin Barnes to pop out to third, and then struck out Clayton Kershaw, who was allowed to bat because there were two outs.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Top 5th: Kershaw finally silences Springers bat.Clayton Kershaw has pitched three scoreless innings and it is pretty clear that he would have been a better option at starter than Yu Darvish was.He started the fifth by becoming the first Dodgers pitcher of the day to retire George Springer when he got the red-hot hitter to strike out on a slider up in the zone.He struck out Alex Bregman as well and then ended the inning by getting Jose Altuve to fly out to Cody Bellinger in foul territory.Waldstein: I spoke to former Dodgers outfielder Shawn Green before the game and he said the rule of thumb at Dodger Stadium is that when there is moisture on the grass, outfielders should take five steps in, because that means there is moisture in the air, which tamps the ball down.Yasiel Puigs fly ball to center earlier might have been an example.Astros center fielder George Springer took a few steps back and then had to run in to catch it.Photo Bottom 5th: Dodgers leave two more runners on base.It took three pitchers, but Houston got through another scoreless inning, with the Dodgers stranding two more runners bringing them to an ugly eight for the game.Brad Peacock got the first out, but after a walk and an infield single his day was done.Francisco Liriano was summoned to face Cody Bellinger, and got him to hit into a force-out, and then Chris Devenski was brought in to face Yasiel Puig, who hit a line drive right to first baseman Yuli Gurriel to end the inning.Waldstein: It has been amazing how the Dodgers have been unable to break through with men on base, even when hitting the ball hard.In the second inning they had runners at first and second with one out, but Chris Taylor lined into a double play.In the fifth, Yasiel Puig lined out to first with runners at first and third with two outs.How long can the Astros keep escaping these predicaments?Top 6th: Kershaw keeps it clean.Clayton Kershaw gambled to get a matchup he liked better, and the risky move paid off, resulting in a fourth scoreless inning.Carlos Correa led off with a single to left and he advanced to third base on a pair of groundouts.Marwin Gonzalez and pinch-hitter Evan Gattis were both intentionally walked, and with two outs and the bases loaded, Kershaw ended the inning by getting Cameron Maybin to pop out to third.Photo Bottom 6th: Dodgers finally get a runner across.Charlie Morton became Houstons fifth pitcher of the day and he was immediately in trouble.Joc Pederson singled, Logan Forsythe walked and after Morton got an out on a pop-up by Austin Barnes, the Dodgers got on the board with a run-scoring single by pinch-hitter Andre Ethier, making it 5-1.Morton did not allow any further damage, striking out Chris Taylor and inducing a grounder to short by Corey Seager, which means the Dodgers have now stranded ten runners in six innings.Advertisement Continue reading the main story With Ethier having pinch-hit for Clayton Kershaw, the Dodgers bullpen will have to try to follow the example he set with four scoreless innings of relief.Waldstein: Charlie Morton is making just the second relief appearance of his career and first since his rookie season of 2008 with the Braves.But he has the temperament for it.Astros people say he is very calm and has the ability to slow things down.He certainly looked calm with that shard of Corey Seagers bat coming at him at about 50 miles per hour.He stepped aside to avoid it, but the bat still clipped him in the leg.Unfazed, he turned and watched Carlos Correa scoop up the ball and throw Seager out for the final out of the sixth inning.Calm, indeed.Photo Top 7th: Jansen comes in early and gets job done.It is all hands on deck for the Dodgers, with the teams closer, Kenley Jansen, coming in for the seventh inning.It is an open question how long he can go, but he worked around a two-out walk to pitch a scoreless inning.Jansen got the first out on a long fly ball to center from George Springer that a sliding Chris Taylor was able to track down.He struck out Alex Bregman on seven pitches, but walked Jose Altuve.Altuve got Houstons second stolen base of the Series by taking second on a first-pitch ball to Carlos Correa, but he was left there when Correa popped out to short.Photo Bottom 7th: Dodgers cant build any momentum.Charlie Morton had an incredibly quiet seventh.The right-hander got Justin Turner to pop out to first, struck out Cody Bellinger and then ended things with a groundout to short by Yulieski Gurriel.Top 8th: Dodgers bullpen keeps rolling.Alex Wood replaced Kenley Jansen and pitched a 1-2-3 inning, retiring Yulieski Gurriel, Brian McCann and Marwin Gonzalez.The Dodgers relievers have been incredible since Yu Darvish came out of the game in the second inning, but the offense has yet to offer them much help.Waldstein: Strange only using Jansen for one inning.If that were the case, then why not save him for later in case you get a lead?Meanwhile, Charlie Morton was on deck swinging with a jacket on.He would have been the fourth pitcher to hit in this game, and only one was a starter, Lance McCullers, who collected a run batted in.Clayton Kershaw and Brad Peacock also batted.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Bottom 8th: Morton blanks Dodgers again.Charlie Morton has successfully atoned for the run he allowed in his sixth inning by following it up with two scoreless innings.He struck out Joc Pederson, got Logan Forsythe to fly out to right, and sent the game to the ninth inning when he got Austin Barnes to fly out to center.Top 9th: Wood keeps Astros lead at four.Alex Wood was able to prevent the Astros from tacking on any insurance runs in a scoreless ninth.He struck out Charlie Morton on three pitches, Cameron Maybin on five pitches and then finished the half-inning by getting George Springer to fly out to center.The Astros are three outs away from the first championship in franchise history.Photo Bottom 9th: Dodgers go down without a fight.A.J.Hinch had showed a preference for sticking with a hot hand in terms of his relievers, and he lived up to that by sending Charlie Morton out for a fourth inning of relief.The right-hander slammed the door on the Dodgers.He struck out pinch-hitter Chase Utley, and then got matching groundouts to second from Chris Taylor and Corey Seager to end the game before he was mobbed in the middle of the field by his teammates.
A Dodger Steps Back as Fans Deliver Their Own World Series Justice:::::Gurriel, 33, apologized for his actions, and Darvish quickly forgave him.But Gurriel was hit with a five-game suspension by Commissioner Rob Manfred the next day.It will be served at the start of the 2018 season.In a World Series filled with drama and headed to a Game 7 on Wednesday night, it seems almost preordained that the Dodgers will now send Darvish to the mound to start the game, which means he will be pitching again to Gurriel, with everything on the line.Photo Before Tuesdays game, Darvish spoke to reporters about Gurriel and said he had sent a message to him stating that a face-to-face apology for what he had done was not necessary, although Gurriel had expressed a desire to make one.I told him, Hey, you dont have to do that because you made a comment, and Im not that mad, Darvish said through an interpreter.So like I really didnt care much about that.Gurriels gesture in Game 3 overshadowed a jagged outing by Darvish that night.After allowing only one run in each of his previous two starts in the postseason, Darvish coughed up four runs on six hits in just one and two-third innings.It was the shortest outing of what has been a standout major league career.But after a rough 24 hours for Darvish, his teammates huddled around him in the dugout before Game 4 of the Series and told him, Were going to win this game for you.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.The Dodgers kept their word in a 6-2 victory.And despite dropping Game 5 the epic 13-12 slugfest they beat Justin Verlander in Game 6.So now its Darvish on the mound for the Dodgers in Game 7 with Gurriel batting fifth for the Astros.On Tuesday, the loud boos for Gurriel meant he had replaced Astros right fielder Josh Reddick as the villain for Dodgers fans.Reddick had heard catcalls earlier in the Series for his comments about fans in Los Angeles not supporting him after his trade to the Dodgers midway through last season.But Gurriels actions in Game 3 turned Reddick into a footnote.Instead, the fans booed Gurriel loudly before Hills first pitch to him and between each pitch.And when Gurriel popped out, the boos were loud all over again.So it went for Gurriel in every one of his at-bats, including his single in the sixth inning.If the forceful reaction from fans bothered Gurriel, he did not seem to show it.But after the game, he left the clubhouse without speaking to reporters.The Astros designated hitter, Carlos Beltran, had counseled Gurriel after the incident but said he did not feel the need to say anything to him after Game 6.Advertisement Continue reading the main story He asked for forgiveness and theres not much left to talk about, Beltran said.Asked about the booing, Beltran said, Baseball is like that.And it is likely to be like that again in Game 7.
Another Game 7 Provides a Perfect Ending for the Astros:::::The Astros hopes for a Game 7 blowout stalled when the Dodgers quickly lifted starter Yu Darvish, who faced just 10 batters and allowed half of them to score.After that, the pitchers on both sides took over, making for a tense finale, if not a classic, in the first World Series Game 7 ever held at Dodger Stadium, the third-oldest venue in the majors.The Astros had never even played in a World Series seventh game; their only other trip was a four-game loss to the White Sox in 2005, which had been part of that string of abbreviated Series.Photo For historical resonance, nothing could have topped last year, when the Chicago Cubs won their first championship since 1908 against a Cleveland Indians team that had the second-longest title drought, dating to 1948.That series went seven games, with the Cubs blowing a late lead but prevailing, after a rain delay, in the 10th inning.Now, another Series between two desperate teams has gone all the way.The Dodgers were seeking their first World Series title in 29 years, and the Astros an expansion team in 1962 their first ever.Im sure M.L.B.is probably sitting back and kicking their feet up, the Dodgers third baseman, Justin Turner, said before Game 7.Counting the money?a reporter asked.Im not going to say that, but definitely enjoying it, Turner said, laughing.And knowing that its going to Game 7 is appropriate, with these two teams.This is the first season that baseball has awarded home-field advantage in the World Series to the team with the better record.The Dodgers earned the right to be the host by leading the majors in victories with 104, the most in their six decades in Los Angeles.But the Astros were not far behind, with 101 wins, making this a particularly high-powered matchup.Advertisement Continue reading the main story To find the last time a World Series between 100-win teams stretched to Game 7, you have to reach back to 1931, when the St. Louis Cardinals thwarted the Philadelphia Athletics attempt at a third consecutive championship.It was so long ago that the winning pitcher, 38-year-old Burleigh Grimes, threw spitballs.The pitch had been banned for years, but since Grimes had already been throwing it, he was allowed to continue.In this World Series, according to Verlander and others, the balls arrive pre-slicked.He insisted again after Game 6 that the World Series baseballs were slippery, making it hard for a pitcher to pull down on the slider for a reliable late slash.That could partly explain the power surge that has helped make this World Series memorable though not every game has been a slugfest.Photo Indeed, Game 6 mirrored the opener: a 3-1 Dodgers victory, with the starter allowing a solo homer and Kenley Jansen perfect at the end.In Game 1, Clayton Kershaw worked seven innings for the win, but on Tuesday, Dodgers Manager Dave Roberts pulled Rich Hill in the fifth, before he could face a batter for the third time.Robertss aggressive bullpen usage, a reflection of the teams analytically minded front office, has lent another intriguing sidebar to this World Series, with fans not even waiting to second-guess.They booed Roberts when he called for the bullpen in Game 6, and Hill knocked over a few cups of water in the dugout.But the Dodgers relievers were superb, after looking hopelessly trapped in a Houston fun house in Game 5 on Sunday.That game had ended up 13-12, a score so odd for a baseball game that it had not happened anywhere in the majors in almost three years.The Astros won on a single by Alex Bregman, but the game included seven homers, a total exceeded only once in World Series history by the eight homers in Game 2 of this very series, a 7-6 Astros victory here.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Just when I thought I could describe Game 2 as my favorite game of all time, I think Game 5 exceeded that and more, Astros Manager A.J.Hinch said on Sunday.Its hard to put into words all the twists and turns.Reggie Jackson thought of a few.During Game 5, when the Astros Jose Altuve crushed a game-tying homer, Jackson the Hall of Famer and two-time World Series most valuable player texted the Astros owner, Jim Crane.Altuve, the best player in the game, read the message.Says who?Says Mr. October.Altuves homer came on the first at-bat after Kershaw was pulled from Game 5.The Dodgers had given Kershaw leads of 4-0 and 7-4, and with a chance to send his team back home with a lead, Kershaw fizzled.He spun four shutout innings in Game 7, but with his team behind, he could not quite match the signature performance of a division rival.That effort, by San Franciscos Madison Bumgarner, came in 2014 and began this stretch of three Game 7s in four years.Pitching on just two days of rest after throwing a shutout, Bumgarner blanked the Royals for the final five innings of Game 7, stranding the tying run on third base at the end.Photo The Royals followed up the next year by beating the Mets, coming back in all four victories of an entertaining five-game World Series.It was the first championship for the Royals in 30 years and, of course, they were happy to wrap it up when they did, despite leaving two games not played.Advertisement Continue reading the main story In their clubhouse after Game 6 on Tuesday, the Astros were hardly despondent, and seemed energized by the chance to play one more game.Yes, they had been leading on Tuesday heading into the bottom of the sixth, but in a World Series like this, 12 outs were a lot to assume.Verlander had allowed just one hit through five innings, but did not feel close to victory with a tenuous 1-0 lead.Absolutely not, he said.Not the way these games have gone, not the way these guys lineup is.If we could have squeaked across a run or two more, I maybe would have changed my mentality.But Ive played this game too long.He has played it in the majors since 2005, all with the Detroit Tigers until a trade to Houston in August.Verlander helped lead the Tigers to the World Series in 2006, when he lost the first and last games to St. Louis.He made it back in 2012, but got flattened by the Giants Pablo Sandoval in the opener of a forgettable sweep.Those were two of the 10 World Series between 1998 and 2013 that lasted only four or five games.A few moments stood out in that time, of course; Carlos Correa, the Astros shortstop, cited two of the best when asked for his favorite memories as a fan.Luis Gonzalez off the Yankees and David Freese off the Rangers, Correa said, referring to the Arizona Diamondbacks Gonzalez, who had the winning hit in Game 7 in 2001, and the St. Louis Cardinals Freese, who homered to win Game 6 in 2011 to set up a Game 7.Both were among the previous 38 best-of-seven World Series that extended to the final game.And before now, just one other World Series had followed the pattern of the home team winning Games 1, 3, 5 and 6 and losing Games 2, 4 and 7: the spellbinding clash in 1975 between the Boston Red Sox and the Cincinnati Reds, who won Game 7 at Fenway Park.This World Series had the same kind of rapid momentum shifts, and was a new phenomenon for everyone: None of the 50 active players had taken part in a Game 7 of the World Series.Yet they had spent their lives waiting.Its what you sign up for, said Springer, who was drafted seven years ago, when the Astros were the worst team in baseball.For us to go from where we were a long time ago to Game 7 of the World Series against the Dodgers here its an honor.
World Series 2017: How the Dodgers Won Game 6, Inning by Inning:::::Top 3rd: Springer gives Astros the lead.Rich Hill was cruising, having retired seven consecutive batters.But with two outs in the third, he made a mistake on a pitch to George Springer, and the poorly-located fastball was deposited into the stands in right to give the Astros a 1-0 lead.Hill got out of the inning when Alex Bregman grounded out to short, but Hill has made the mistake of giving Justin Verlander a run to work with.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Waldstein: With Springers home run, these teams have now hit 23, extending the World Series record.It was also the 16th to either break a tie or give the team a lead.Heres an interesting tidbit about all the home runs in Game 5.The Astros had 5.The only other teams to do that in the World Series were the 1989 Athletics and the 1928 Yankees.Babe Ruth hit 3 in Game 4 of 28 and Lou Gehrig and Cedric Durst each hit one.(The Big Three, right?)Bottom 3rd: Verlander notches his fifth strikeout.It was a remarkably quiet inning for Justin Verlander.Austin Barnes grounded out to second, Rich Hill struck out on a foul-tip into Brian McCanns mitt, and Chris Taylor watched strike three sail right by him to end the inning.Verlander now has five strikeouts, but has seen his pitch-count creep up to 43.Waldstein: Justin Verlander is looking good so far, especially with that called third strike breaking ball to Joc Pederson in the second inning.If he is getting that pitch over for strikes, he will be hard to beat.Incredible to believe, but Verlander is searching for his first World Series win.He is 0-3 in three World Series appearances, two for the Tigers.His earned run average in those games is 6.43.He looks better than that tonight.Top 4th: Hill settles in after giving up home run.With the exception of the solo homer he allowed in the third inning, Rich Hill has matched Justin Verlander.It was more of the same in the fourth.He retired Jose Altuve on a grounder to short, got Carlos Correa to fly out to center, and after Yulieski Gurriel was once again greeted with heavy booing, Hill got him to fly out to right to end the inning.Photo Bottom 4th: Verlander mows down Dodgers big hitters.Through four innings it is almost surprising that the Dodgers have a hit.Justin Verlander continued to dominate, retiring Corey Seager on a fly to left and then fooling Justin Turner on a cutter for strike three.With two outs, Verlander got his seventh strikeout of the game when Cody Bellinger swung right through a fastball to end the inning.Waldstein: Verlander looks really sharp, as expected.He gets Justin Turner on a 92 miles-per-hour cutter and then gets Cody Bellinger on a 97 miles-per-hour fastball perfectly located up and in.He is pitching without the same kind of safety net that Rich Hill is.That is because the Astros are really out of good options in the bullpen.Everyone is either worn out or ineffective, or both.The supposed closer, Ken Giles, may not even pitch any more because he has been so bad.Keep in mind that before the game, Astros manager A.J.Hinch said that he would do whatever is necessary to win tonight, including possibly using Lance McCullers to close it out.I think if you complicate it and try to manage two games at once, youll find yourself having two games, he said.Photo Top 5th: Dodgers go to bullpen early ... again.Brandon Morrow, who has pitched in each game of the World Series, was called on once again because Rich Hill had loaded the bases with two outs.The Dodgers setup man, who faltered badly in Game 5, got out of the inning when Alex Bregman grounded out to short to end what looked like a Houston rally.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Brian McCann led off the inning with a single to right and went to third when Marwin Gonzalez doubled past a diving Alex Bregman.Hill chose to pitch to Josh Reddick despite first base being open and the pitcher being on deck, and was rewarded for it when Reddick struck out.Justin Verlander also struck out, and after George Springer was intentionally walked to load the bases, Hills night was over.With Los Angeles into its bullpen for the remainder of the game, Hills final line was 4 2/3 innings, four hits and one run.He struck out five and walked one.He threw just 58 pitches.Waldstein: Dodgers Manager Dave Roberts did what he has been consistently doing with Rich Hill, pulling him before the third time through the Dodgers batting order.Hill did his job, keeping the Dodgers in the game.The fans did not like it when Hill came out, but it worked to perfection.Brandon Morrow, who looked completely gassed in Game 5, came in with the bases loaded and got the Astros out of the jam.Bottom 5th: Verlander gets eighth strikeout.Justin Verlander is still working with a one-run lead, but he continues to cruise.In the fifth he needed just one pitch to retire Yasiel Puig on a fly ball to right, threw three pitches to Joc Pederson, getting him to fly out to left, and then battled a bit with Logan Forsythe before striking him out on seven pitches to end the inning.Verlander has eight strikeouts on 69 pitches.He has the endurance to throw 120 or more if the Astros can avoid a situation where they need to pinch-hit for him.Photo Top 6th: Dodgers bullpen gets out of another jam.Brandon Morrow has been almost comically overused, with tonight representing the relievers 13th postseason appearance this year the record is 14, which was set by Paul Assenmacher of the Cleveland Indians in 1997.He was not perfect, allowing a two-out single to Yulieski Gurriel, but pressed into duty for his sixth World Series game this year, he got three critical outs for Los Angeles.Tony Watson took over for him after Gurriels hit, and immediately hit Brian McCann with a pitch.But he finished off the inning without allowing a run, getting Marwin Gonzalez to line out to second, erasing the two base runners.Photo Bottom 6th: Dodgers find Verlanders number.Justin Verlander got himself into trouble and the Astros are now trailing 2-1.Austin Barnes stroked a leadoff single into left, which brought up pinch-hitter Chase Utley.Despite Utley being 0 for 14 in this years postseason, Verlander pitched him very carefully before hitting him with a pitch.That brought up Chris Taylor, who lined a double into to right, bringing Barnes home and tying the game 1-1.Advertisement Continue reading the main story With runners on second and third, Corey Seager hit a long fly to right that seemed as if it might leave the park, but eventually ended up as a sacrifice fly when the ball landed in Josh Reddicks glove and Utley scored.Verlander stopped the bleeding by getting a foul-out from Justin Turner and a strikeout from Cody Bellinger, but he will be done with six innings of work because he is due up second in the next inning.Photo Waldstein: Justin Verlander will not do a Josh Beckett in Game 6.He is out of the game for pinch-hitter Evan Gattis in the top of the 7th.What an interesting inning.Verlander certainly looked like he had reached his limit.Even the first out Corey Seagers sacrifice fly ball to right was hit hard enough to have been a home run in Yankee Stadium, anyway.Although Verlander walked off without the chance to get his first World Series win in three separate trips to the Fall Classic, he did well to limit the damage when the Astros had already evened the score and had runners at second and third with no out.Now this game is all about the bullpens, and the Dodgers have the marginal advantage.Photo Top 7th: Astros threaten, but come up short.The Astros got the situation they wanted, with Jose Altuve at the plate with a runner in scoring position, but the Dodgers got out of the inning unscathed, maintaining their 2-1 lead.Josh Reddick walked to lead things off, which brought up the pitchers spot, and Justin Verlander was removed for a pinch-hitter.Kenta Maeda came on in relief to face Evan Gattis, and induced a force-out at second.George Springer singled, at which point Houston replaced Gattis on the bases with Derek Fisher, and the speedy pinch-runner advanced to third on a flyout to center by Alex Bregman.With runners on the corners and two outs, Altuve came up, and was hacking away from the first pitch, but he ended up grounding out to third to end the inning, with the throw just barely beating him at first.Walstein: The Dodgers are doing a great job on Jose Altuve and Calros Correa, who are a combined 0 for 7.Astros manager A.J.Hinch waited to pinch run for Evan Gattis until Gattis reached second base, which is often done by managers.But if he had immediately sent Derek Fisher in to run after Gattis reached first on a fielders choice, he might have made it to third base on George Springers single, which got past Corey Seager at shortstop and dribbled into left field.It would have been close, but if a runner did make it there, he definitely would have scored on Bregmans deep fly ball out.Would have, could have.Photo Bottom 7th: Pederson goes deep.Joe Musgrove was given the unenviable task of coming in for Justin Verlander.The right-hander retired Yasiel Puig on a pop-out to short, but Joc Pederson, who has been on fire recently, crushed a 1-2 fastball for an opposite-field home run that increased the Dodgers lead to 3-1.Musgrove recovered to retire pinch-hitter Andre Ethier on a fly to left and he struck out Austin Barnes to end the inning, but the Dodgers will be handing the game over to Kenley Jansen for a six-out save, and he has a two-run cushion to work with.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Waldstein: Wow, that was some home run trot by Joc Pederson.I dont recall seeing a player skip down the third base line pointing to his dugout in the 7th inning.It looked like something out of the movie Major League.More important, his home run gives Kenley Jansen a cushion.Remember, Jansen blew the save in Game 2 in his second inning of work and took the loss in Game 5 when he gave up a run, also in his second inning of work.And the Astros dont ever concede.Then again, neither do the Dodgers.Top 8th: Jansen gets three easy outs.Kenley Jansen is halfway through a six-out save.He got Carlos Correa to fly out to left, got Yulieski Gurriel to pop out to first and then struck out Brian McCann to end the inning.Los Angeles will now try to add some insurance to their two-run lead.Bottom 8th: No more insurance runs for the Dodgers.A two-run lead will have to suffice for the Dodgers.Charlie Culberson led off the inning against Luke Gregerson with a single to left, and he advanced to second on a groundout by Chris Taylor.Corey Seager worked a full-count, but struck out on a slider that cut in on him.With a man on base, Justin Turner walked, which ended Gregersons day.Francisco Liriano came in to face Cody Bellinger, and the 12-year veteran, who was making his first career World Series appearance, struck out the rookie slugger in a grueling 9-pitch at-bat.The Dodgers are three outs from forcing a Game 7.Photo Top 9th: Jansen closes the door on Astros.Kenley Jansen had a long wait between innings, but the Dodgers closer was just as dominant in the ninth, shutting the door on the Astros and securing a six-out save.He started things off by getting Marwin Gonzalez to pop out to first.He then took care of things himself, striking out Josh Reddick and pinch-hitter Carlos Beltran to end the game, needing just 19 pitches to complete two

Brandon Morrow Just Might Do It:::::On Sunday, when the Los Angeles Dodgers called yet again for Morrow in Game 5, he served up four runs, including two homers, in just six weary pitches.His stuff was missing the mystical quality all pitches need: life.Thats like the last 1 percent of what you can get on the ball, kind of like the life on your arm translates out and through the baseball, Morrow said in the Dodgers somber clubhouse at Minute Maid Park after Game 5 ended in a 13-12 crusher won by the Astros in 10 innings.Even though I felt good, I guess I just didnt have as much life in my arm as I was hoping.As the rehab pitching coordinator for the Toronto Blue Jays, Knowles is especially familiar with Morrows arm.When Knowles coached the Blue Jays Class A team in Dunedin, Fla., Morrow made annual visits while recovering from injuries each season from 2011 through 2014.Along the way, Morrow said, he came to learn Knowles claim to fame.Knowles came to respect Morrows determination to overcome injuries and manage Type 1 diabetes to fashion a productive major league career.He had a lot of injuries when he was a starter with the Blue Jays, but it looks like hes found his niche, Knowles said.He always threw hard.I wouldnt have thought hed be able to go two or three days in a row, but obviously thats not a problem.It had not been a problem when Knowles spoke, just before Game 5.By then, Morrow had thrown more than 12 postseason innings, with a 1.46 earned run average, as the primary setup man for Kenley Jansen.But Game 5 was Morrows 12th outing in the Dodgers 13 postseason games, and by the time he was done, an 8-7 Los Angeles lead had become an 11-8 deficit after a homer by George Springer, a single by Bregman, a double by Jose Altuve and another homer by Carlos Correa.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Dave Roberts, the Dodgers manager, had said before Game 5 that while Morrow was available, he hoped not to use him.But Clayton Kershaw could not survive the fifth inning, and Roberts deployed Kenta Maeda and Tony Watson to get through the sixth.He still had four other relievers besides Jansen for the seventh, but Morrow had sent word from the bullpen insisting he was ready.When I saw where the game was at in the 7th, I was getting loose and I was feeling O.K., Morrow said.Probably selfish on my part to call down and push to let them know Im ready and want to get in.They had a plan were obviously very plan-oriented and try to stick to that and I made them deviate away.Roberts called it a credit to him that Morrow asked to pitch, and said it would have been hard to turn him down.Morrow, who signed a minor-league contract in January for just $1.125 million, had a 2.06 e.r.a..with no home runs allowed over 45 games this season, averaging more than five and a half strikeouts per walk.He was very good in spring training, Roberts said.You see the plus, plus velocity, and you always think, in a shorter stint, will his stuff play up?So he really embraced coming out of the pen this year, and he did that for our Triple-A club.Morrow, who had pitched a decade with Seattle, Toronto and San Diego, yearned for the intensity that comes with the major leagues.But he had pitched just 18 games for the Padres last season after shoulder surgery in 2015 had ended his career as a starter.I was obviously hoping to get a major league deal, said Morrow, who had a 1.69 e.r.a.in 18 games for San Diego.I thought I threw the ball really well, but the swing-and-miss stuff wasnt there, and the velocity wasnt quite back all the way.Picking up the ball this year, though, something was different, like I knew I was stronger, ready to go.I felt like myself again.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Morrow has always had the stuff to dominate.Seattle drafted him fifth over all in 2006, out of the University of California, passing on Andrew Miller and three future Cy Young Award winners Kershaw, Tim Lincecum and Max Scherzer who went in the next six picks.The Mariners never found a steady role for Morrow.Traded to Toronto in December 2009, he periodically flourished as a starter, and lost a no-hitter with two outs in the ninth inning in 2010, finishing with a 137-pitch, 17-strikeout one-hitter.In 2012, he threw three shutouts through the first week in June.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Then an oblique injury cost him more than two months.Forearm problems and a torn tendon in his hand hampered him in other seasons.No wonder, then, that with good health this season, Morrow has been eager to contribute as much as possible.Knowles can relate.In 1972, he was an eight-year major leaguer on an Oakland team bound for the World Series but a broken thumb in late September ended his season.The next year, the As won a five-game American League Championship Series without using Knowles at all.I just wanted to get into a World Series game; everybody dreams of that, Knowles said.I was just thanking God I got into the first game, and I happened to get the save.In that game, against the Mets, Knowles relieved closer Rollie Fingers with one out and one on in the ninth inning, protecting a 2-1 lead.The Mets had announced the left-handed Rusty Staub as a pinch-hitter against the right-handed Fingers, a future Hall of Famer.But when Oakland Manager Dick Williams called for the left-handed Knowles, the Mets manager, Yogi Berra, countered with a righty, Jim Beauchamp.Knowles retired Beauchamp on an infield pop, and then got the left-handed Wayne Garrett to fly out to end the game.From there, Williams just kept calling for Knowles, who had 12 days of rest from the end of the regular season to the start of the World Series.He collected five outs in Game 2, and then faced 15 batters across the next three games at Shea Stadium.Facing elimination at home in Game 6, Williams used Knowles to replace another future Hall of Famer, Catfish Hunter, with a 2-0 lead, one out and one on in the eighth inning.Garrett and Felix Millan singled, cutting the lead to a run, but Knowles recovered to strike out Staub.Yogi Berra said that was the biggest out of the series, Knowles said.It took giving up back-to-back hits for that to happen, so it wasnt ideal.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Fingers got the final four outs of Game 6, and on the morning of Game 7, Knowles learned that no pitcher had ever worked all seven games of a World Series.He knew he might have a chance to be the first, but it almost never came.Fingers entered Game 7 with one out in the sixth, and held a 5-1 lead with two outs in the ninth.But when first baseman Gene Tenace booted a grounder by Ed Kranepool, scoring a run, the left-handed Garrett came to the plate as the potential tying run.Knowles got his turn, retiring Garrett on a pop fly to short for the final out.I told Dick Williams after Game 7, Youre the dumbest manager I ever played for you took out Rollie Fingers and you brought me in!Knowles said.But he played everything by the book, and it worked out.Knowles and Garrett are friends now; both live in Florida, and they sometimes golf together.Every time he sees him, Knowles said, he reminds Garrett of that final out which he got without even using his left-on-left advantage.I threw him three Nolan Ryan fastballs, Knowles said, laughing.I pitched all seven games and I think I threw only one slider all series.I was having trouble with it, so I junked it.I was not a power guy, but I had movement.All pitchers learn to improvise when their best weapons betray them, and Morrow could not do it in Game 5.But on Tuesday he helped get the World Series to Game 7, where he could a record.You just try to dig inside, Morrow said, and pull everything out that youve got.
Baseball, Hot Dogs and Apple Pie. Washed Down With Champagne.:::::As Major League Baseballs postseason is nearing the biggest celebration of all the Houston Astros need one more victory to win the World Series, the Dodgers need two it seems appropriate to ask: Where does this ritual come from?Great question, but I have no idea, said Cubs reliever Pedro Strop, who celebrated a lot last year when his team snapped a 108-year drought and finally won the Series.He was speaking during a slippery and sticky moment this month after the Cubs beat the Washington Nationals in a five-game division series.Its been like this for years, he added.Its actually really fun.Its like its raining and youre running around to avoid getting wet.Few, if any, sports seem to celebrate achievements as much as baseball teams do.In the other major professional sports leagues in North America, teams do not usually pop the corks until they win an actual championship.Photo But that may be because other major sports do not play nearly as many games as baseball teams do.The 162-game regular season in baseball is twice as voluminous as the seasons in the N.B.A.and the N.H.L., and has about 10 times as many games as the N.F.L.season.So if a team clinches a playoff spot during the season even if it is just the right to play in the win-or-go-home wild-card game it is usually reason enough to break open the champagne and beer.I always think its silly to do it celebrating a division or getting the wild card, McCarthy said.But then I thought about that.You might never get back there.If thats the only time when youre first up, why not?Advertisement Continue reading the main story If a major league team clinches a wild-card spot, wins the wild-card game, captures a division series and the league championship series, and then prevails in the World Series, that means five raucous, alcohol-filled celebrations in perhaps five or six weeks time.Four of them could occur within the span of three weeks in the postseason.Its extreme to go from nothing to four celebrations if you win, said Los Angeles outfielder Curtis Granderson, who has reached the World Series three times in his career with the Dodgers, Tigers and Mets.Its always been interesting to me.Baseball championship celebrations involving champagne and beer have their roots in amateur baseball, dating back to the 19th century, according to research by John Thorn, the official historian of Major League Baseball.In the 20th century, there are instances of rambunctious festivities that go back to at least the 1940s.One involved the Brooklyn Dodgers, who in 1941 won their first National League pennant in 21 years.The clinching victory came against the Braves in Boston.Afterward, Larry McPhail, the Dodgers president, arranged for champagne to be stocked on the train for the teams ride back to New York.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.By the time the train reached its destination, the Dodgers were hilarious and the train was a wreck, according to a newspaper account of their arrival.One of the Dodgers coaches, Chuck Dressen, had his shirt ripped off in the merriment, the article said.Two players, Pee Wee Reese and Pete Reiser, prowled up and down the aisles squirting everybody with champagne.Alcohol was also part of the postgame celebration after the legendary home run that Bobby Thomson hit in 1951 to allow the New York Giants to snatch the pennant from the Dodgers.And after the Dodgers won the 1956 N.L.pennant, their celebration was described as such in The New York Times: Beer and champagne were being poured over the heads and into the hip pockets of those who still had uniforms on.Photo The celebrations have continued since then, but with various twists.Many players now use goggles, regardless of what Kershaw thinks.Not surprisingly, the New Era Cap Company, which makes the official caps for Major League Baseball, is now in the goggle business, too.One goggle-wearer is Josh Reddick, the Astros right fielder, who is notorious for his champagne-drenched reveling while wearing only stars-and-stripes briefs.He does not care if he looks ridiculous.Advertisement Continue reading the main story I love it, he said in an interview last week.For as long as I can remember, this is the way its been, so thats what Im accustomed to and Ive gotten used to.So I dont look at it from that perspective, like it being awkward, but its just what Ive known and look forward to as a player.Major League Baseball has tried to curb over-the-top celebrations with periodic guidelines concerning such things as the quantity of alcohol available or transportation provided for players and staff.Some players and baseball executives acknowledge they have not really thought about alternative ways to whoop it up.Karim Garcia, a retired outfielder from Mexico who spent parts of 10 seasons in the major leagues, said he was surprised when he first took part in a division-clinching celebration with the Dodgers in 1995.As it does now, most of the alcohol, including some expensive champagne, ended up on the floor or sprayed on the ceiling, and went unconsumed.It was a great experience, and then you realize: Why are you spraying and wasting it?Better to drink it, he said.We probably should have just sprayed beer.Its just one of those traditions thats been around awhile and you just follow it.I think its the only place that we do it like this.After winning titles in Mexican League baseball, Garcia said, his teams celebrated only with beer because it was cheaper.Astros reliever Tyler Clippard, a veteran of 11 major league seasons, said: It is weird.But what else would you do?In the Indy 500, they drink milk.Thats way weirder.What should you do?Spray orange juice?Farhan Zaidi, the Dodgers general manager, said spraying so much beer and champagne was probably not the greatest bang-for-the-buck expense that we have as an organization, but its a tradition and this sport is full of it.If the celebration for winning different rounds of the playoffs was an elaborate high five, thats what everybody would do and then go home, he added.Its just what people have always done.But if aliens landed from another planet and saw this, they would think it was pretty bizarre.
Anything Can Happen in Baseball, and Most of It Did in Game 5:::::Now, it seems, the Astros have learned to play the modern game better than anyone else.In a major league season that included more home runs than ever before, the Astros led all teams in slugging percentage while also having the fewest strikeouts.In that way, Game 5 was their masterpiece.The Astros got homers from Yuli Gurriel, Jose Altuve, George Springer, Carlos Correa and Brian McCann, and fanned just six times in 47 trips to the plate.The final batted ball was a two-out single to left by Alex Bregman off the Dodgers Kenley Jansen.Derek Fisher, a rookie pinch-runner, had been inserted just before that pitch for the first time in the series.He dashed home from second, slid his orange spikes across the plate, ahead of the throw, and popped up to embrace McCann, the veteran who had told him he would do something special.You never know when your times going to be, but youre going to have a time, Fisher said McCann had promised him.And its going to be an important time.For the winning run to score on such a play a first-pitch line drive, a two-base sprint and a smooth final slide was oddly reassuring.Most of what came before was another home run derby, the second of the series.In Game 2 at Dodger Stadium last week, the teams combined for a record eight homers in a comeback victory for the Astros, by 7-6, in 11 innings.I didnt think that would ever be topped, said Bregman, who debuted in the majors last year.I thought that would be the best game I ever played in my career.Who knows where this one ranks?Right up there with that game.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The teams have combined for 22 homers in five games, breaking the World Series record of 21 set in seven games in 2002, the last year before baseball began testing for steroids.One theory for the new power surge is that hitters have learned to tailor their swings to launch more fly balls, reasoning that fly balls produce more runs than grounders.Many pitchers, though, suspect the balls are juiced because baseball wants more offense, as the Astros Dallas Keuchel asserted after the Game 2 slugfest.Before Sundays game, another Astros pitcher, Justin Verlander, told a roomful of reporters that the balls for this World Series were slicker, making them harder to grip and leading to erratic location.McCann who hit last in the Astros lineup on Sunday despite 12 seasons as one of the best slugging catchers in baseball gave a more nuanced explanation.
Astros Down the Dodgers in a Dramatic and Dizzying Slugfest:::::Then it was the Dodgers turn, rallying for three runs to tie it in the ninth inning, the last of which came on Chris Taylors two-out, two-strike single that scored Austin Barnes.But it was the Astros who had the last word in the 10th inning, and while their clubhouse was a mixture of exhaustion and elation afterward, the Dodgers were resolute.This is not going to be finished on Tuesday, said Los Angeles outfielder Yasiel Puig.There is going to be a Game 7.In a World Series that has come to be defined by the unpredictable and unexpected, it was only fitting that one night, after a lights-out pitchers duel between the heretofore unremarkable Alex Wood and Charlie Morton, a slugfest would unfold that sent the Cy Young Award winners Clayton Kershaw and Dallas Keuchel to early exits.And Puigs two-run homer off Chris Devenski in the ninth inning, which brought the Dodgers within 12-11, was the 22nd of the Series, breaking the previous record, set in 2002 by the San Francisco Giants and the Anaheim Angels over seven games.Photo I cant tell you how many times Ive said this is the craziest game of my life, said Musgrove, who blanked the Dodgers in the 10th inning to get the win.I mean, again, tonight, this is the craziest game of my life.In this series, the Astros have shown not only lockdown starting pitching, dynamic defense and the type of prodigious power that invites bat flips.They have also flaunted the resilience of a champion.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Twice the Astros have rallied against one of baseballs best closers, Kenley Jansen, and twice on Sunday they rallied against the best pitcher in baseball, Kershaw, who had dominated the Astros in a 3-1 victory in Game 1.Nobody better exemplified that bounce-back than Springer, the Astros center fielder.The Dodgers had taken an 8-7 lead in the seventh when Springer made a running dive and missed Cody Bellingers liner, which bounced past him and allowed Enrique Hernandez to score all the way from first.A more cautious and prudent play for Springer would have been to pull back and concede the base hit.But one reason the Astros are here is their superlative defense, which had rescued them moments earlier when reliever Brad Peacock threw out Justin Turner at third on Hernandezs bunt.But Springer atoned on the first pitch of the bottom of the seventh, hammering a fastball from Brandon Morrow far over the left-field wall.Photo Thats about as low to about as high as you could probably feel, Springer said.I made a bad decision.I tried to make a play, but I should have stopped.But then to come out and tie it, thats a feeling that I dont think I can ever describe to anybody.Springers was the third home run of the game for the Astros at that point and both of the previous two, a three-run blast by Yuli Gurriel in the fourth off Kershaw and a three-run drive by Jose Altuve in the fifth off Kenta Maeda, had also tied the score.This was by far the craziest game Ive ever been a part of and will probably ever be a part of, said Bellinger, who hit a three-run homer in the fifth off Collin McHugh that gave the Dodgers a lead.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.The Astros were not done after Springers home run.Bregman followed him with a sharp single, and Altuve added a drive into the left-center gap, chasing Bregman home to put the Astros ahead for the first time, 9-8.With the crowd still on its feet, Carlos Correa hit a towering fly ball to left that seemed to scrape the roof of the ballpark, the type of shot that would be a home run in an elevator shaft or, as it turns out, in Minute Maid Park.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Left fielder Joc Pederson drifted to the wall, but the ball landed in the first row of the Crawford Boxes the left-field seats that abut Crawford Avenue outside the ballpark.When the ball settled in the stands, Correa who had stopped near first base pounded his chest and pointed to his teammates in the first-base dugout as the orange-clad crowd erupted again.Photo In a span of six pitches, the Astros had gone from trailing by a run to seizing an 11-8 lead.Of course, with the Astros beleaguered bullpen, it would not be enough.Corey Seagers double in the eighth closed the gap to 11-9, but Peacock stranded two runners to keep the Dodgers at bay.McCann added a solo homer in the bottom of the inning to restore the three-run lead, but again it was not enough.After Puigs one-out homer in the ninth brought the Dodgers within one, Barnes followed with a double and advanced to third on a groundout.Taylor then delivered, lining a 2-2 changeup from Devenski up the middle.He shook his fist as he reached first base, signaling that the Dodgers were not done.Neither, though, were the Astros.In the 10th, McCann was hit by a pitch from Jansen, advanced to second on a walk to Springer and then was pinch-run for by Fisher, who crossed the plate to end it.Drama is at an all-time high, McCann said.Youre on every pitch, your focus is through the roof.You have to be ready for anything, thinking two, three steps ahead, constant communication.Its more mentally exhausting than physically.But for a 13-year veteran playing in his first World Series, there were no complaints.A good nights sleep and a trip to Los Angeles awaited.This is what I signed up for, McCann said.Ive been waiting my whole life for this moment.
Are the World Series Balls Too Slick? Some Say Yes:::::Photo HOUSTON No World Series has had as many home runs through the first four games as this one.Heading into Game 5 on Sunday, the Los Angeles Dodgers and the Houston Astros had smashed 15 of them, putting the teams on pace to break the World Series record of 21, set in 2002.Naturally, perhaps, pitchers are citing the baseball as a culprit.I know Mr. Manfred said the balls havent changed, but I think theres enough information out there to say thats not true, said the Astros Justin Verlander, referring to Commissioner Rob Manfred.I think the main complaint is that the balls seem a little bit different in the postseason, and even from the postseason to the World Series balls, Verlander said Theyre a little slick.You just deal with it.But I dont think its the case of one pitcher saying, Hey, something is different here.I think as a whole everybody is saying, Whoa, something is a little off here.After Game 2, which included a single-game World Series-record eight home runs, the Astros Dallas Keuchel said the balls were juiced because Major League Baseball wanted more offense.In an online report Sunday, several pitchers told Sports Illustrateds Tom Verducci that the slickness of the World Series balls has kept them from throwing their best sliders.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Slicker leather affects a pitchers ability to pull down on an off-speed pitch, and the loss of friction would affect the tightness of the spin.The Dodgers Yu Darvish and the Astros Ken Giles are pitchers who rely on sliders, and both have struggled in the World Series.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Darvish and others told Verducci the balls were slicker, though not all pitchers are convinced.The Dodgers Rich Hill, who will oppose Verlander in Game 6 and throws more curveballs than sliders, said he thought the balls felt the same.
Astros Make a Routine of the Extraordinary Out at the Plate:::::Gonzalez got credit for the throws from the outfield that nabbed Bostons Mitch Moreland in Game 4 of the division series and Greg Bird of the Yankees in Game 1 of the A.L.C.S.Bregman was the one who threw from third to cut down Bird in Game 7 of the A.L.C.S.and the Dodgers Austin Barnes on Saturday.In both of the plays involving Bregman, there were runners on first and third with one out.Each time, Bregman fielded a grounder and threw quickly to McCann to beat the runner.Photo Two first-and-third plays, McCann said, marveling after the play on Barnes.You dont see that but a couple of times a year.For it to happen twice in the postseason is just phenomenal.The Dodgers went on to win Game 4, 6-2, to even the World Series at two games apiece.But at the time that Bregman and McCann made the play, it was a scoreless game in the top of the sixth inning.With Charlie Morton pitching for the Astros, Chris Taylor hit a slow bouncer toward third and Bregman charged it, short-hopped the ball with his glove, exchanged it quickly into his throwing hand and threw to McCann while on the run.His throw arrived so quickly that Barnes stopped in the base path and tried to turn back toward third, but he fell and had no chance as McCann tagged him out.Bregman then hit a home run in the bottom of the inning to give Houston a 1-0 lead that wound up being temporary.Bregman said the foundation of the play on Saturday night was the same as the one in Game 7 of the A.L.C.S., when he gunned down Bird of the Yankees with a remarkable throw that met McCanns glove at the exact point where Bird was sliding into the plate.Advertisement Continue reading the main story In that game, the Yankees Todd Frazier was at the plate with Houston leading, 1-0, in the top of the fifth inning in a decisive Game 7.Bregman looked into the Astros dugout at the infield coach Alex Cora, who will become the Red Sox manager after the World Series.Cora put his finger to his head, signaling that Bregman should think before the play about what he would do if the ball was hit to him.If the ball was hit hard, he could gamble and go for an inning-ending double play while the runner at third raced home.But if the ball was hit more slowly, leaving no chance for a double play, Bregman would throw home and let McCann try to tag the runner.Which is what he did.Frazier hit a chopper, Bregman grabbed it and threw, and Bird was out.The Astros went on to widen their lead and clinch the American League pennant.Photo In Saturdays game, Bregman said, he knew there was a good chance that he would see another slow ground ball off Mortons pitches, so he cheated a bit by moving a few steps toward the plate.But the communication with Cora was the same.Exact same thing, Bregman said.I looked into the dugout and Cora said, Think.The thought process is, Hey, if its not absolutely rocketed at you, lets take the out at the plate and keep the game 0-0.McCann said his role in those plays was simply to catch the ball and lay down the tag, but it is more than that.The sequences occur rapidly: With a player on the other team bearing down on him at full speed, he must look for a baseball being thrown to him while also making sure he is allowing the runner a path to the plate.Something can easily go wrong.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.After all, the Yankees, who traded McCann to the Astros after last season, had considerable difficulty making these same kinds of plays in the postseason because their catcher, Gary Sanchez, could not hold on to the ball.I was lucky to hold on to the one with Bird, McCann said of the play during Game 7 of the A.L.C.S.Those guys just put it on the money, and all I have to do is tag the runner out.Marwin has a great arm and he charges the ball really well.Alex, he doesnt hesitate even for an instant.Beltran agreed that what had impressed him the most about Bregman on the two throws he made to McCann was his unwavering commitment to the play his guts, as Beltran put it.Making quality throws in intense moments is not always easy.Just ask the Mets, who lost the final game of the 2015 World Series in part because their first baseman, Lucas Duda, made a poor throw to the plate that allowed Eric Hosmer to score the trying run in the top of the ninth inning.Advertisement Continue reading the main story And making quality tags at the plate in huge moments is tough, too.But McCann, Gonzalez and Bregman are pulling it off, creating an unusual subtext to the postseason with more games still to go.
World Series 2017: How the Astros Won Game 5, Inning by Inning:::::A.J.Hinch followed through on his promise not to use his teams struggling closer, Ken Giles, in a high-leverage situation, but the result was roughly the same despite the team coming away with a win.Chris Devenski, who pitched the ninth inning in what would typically be Giless assignment, surrendered what had been a three-run lead.Joe Musgrove earned the victory with a scoreless 10th inning, thus becoming the only Astros reliever to record more than one out in the game without allowing a run.- Want exclusive sports news,

the Dodgers in Game 5, inning by inning: Photo Top 1st: Dodgers get to Keuchel early ... again.Dallas Keuchel spotted Clayton Kershaw three runs in a matchup of aces.Houstons top starter gave up a leadoff single to Chris Taylor and then with one out, he issued back-to-back walks to Justin Turner and Kike Hernandez.He struck out Cody Bellinger, but Logan Forsythe laced a two-out single to left that brought in two runs.An inning where the control artist Keuchel could not find the strike zone got even weirder when Forsythe left too soon on a stolen base attempt and Keuchel threw to first to try to pick him off.Forsythe was caught between bases and Yulieski Gurriel threw wildly to Jose Altuve at second.As Altuve struggled to get the ball and then get back to the bag to tag Forsythe, Hernandez raced in from third to score, increasing Houstons lead to 3-0.The call was challenged by Houston but was upheld.Keuchel got out of the inning when Yasiel Puig hit a dribbler in front of the plate and was thrown out at first by Brian McCann, but at that point he had already spotted baseballs best pitcher a three-run lead and had thrown 32 pitches.Bottom 1st: Kershaw takes over with a 3-0 lead.Clayton Kershaw answered Dallas Keuchels hectic first inning with an incredibly quiet one on his end.He needed just two pitches to retire George Springer on a grounder to third.Alex Bregman popped out to center and then Jose Altuve struck out on a slider that went through the heart of the strike zone to end the inning.As reported on the broadcast, Kershaws career record in games in which he is spotted a three-run lead is 124-19.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Waldstein: The Astros have some work to do offensively after an uncharacteristically sloppy top of the first.Two walks and two hits given up by Keuchel, a muffed ball by left fielder Marwin Gonzalez and a terrible throw to second base by Yuli Gurriel combined to hand the Dodgers three runs.Is this really the Astros?This team can catch it and throw it, as old-timey baseball folks like to say, and Keuchels lack of command was puzzling, too.Tall order to have to score three runs against Kershaw, but the sliver lining of falling behind early is that they have nine innings to work with ... make that eight.Astros go down in order in the first.Photo Top 2nd: Keuchel finds the strike zone.The real Dallas Keuchel showed up for the second inning, as he needed just 13 pitches to deal with the bottom of the Dodgers order.Keuchel ran the count full against Austin Barnes but eventually got the catcher to fly out to right.Charlie Culberson grounded out to short, and Chris Taylor grounded out to third to end the inning.Bottom 2nd: Kershaw cruises through Astros order.Another 1-2-3 inning for Clayton Kersaw.The Dodgers ace induced a grounder to first from Carlos Correa, got Yulieski Gurriel to pop out to first, and then finished things off by getting Josh Reddick to fly out to center.He has thrown 24 pitches to Dallas Keuchels 45.Top 3rd: Dodgers go down quietly as Keuchel settles in.The Dodgers had no answer for Dallas Keuchel in the third.Corey Seager grounded out to first, Justin Turner flew out to Jose Altuve in short right field and Kike Hernandez hit a comebacker to Keuchel for the final out of the inning.Thirteen consecutive batters have been retired between the two pitchers since Logan Forsythes two-run single in the first.Waldstein: Tom Verducci of Sports Illustrated reported that some of the pitchers have complained that the leather on the baseballs in this World Series is slicker than it was during the regular season, making it hard to throw certain pitches, especially sliders.Baseball denies there is a difference, but the balls have been at issue all year, with many pitchers complaining they are juiced and travel farther than normal.It does not seem to be bothering one Clayton Kershaw.Photo Bottom 3rd: Astros get a hit, but Kershaw closes the door.The Astros finally got a hit off Clayton Kershaw when Evan Gattis lined a single to center, but the momentum was short-lived as Marwin Gonzalez grounded into a double-play.With two outs, Brian McCann grounded out weekly to second to end the inning.Photo Top 4th: Keuchel is done after Dodgers add an insurance run.Dallas Keuchel had two outs and a runner on second, having settled into a quiet pitchers duel with Clayton Kershaw after a rough top of the first inning.But Austin Barnes, perhaps the Dodgers worst hitter, singled on a liner to left which brought Logan Forsythe home from second, extending the Los Angeles lead to 4-0.Charlie Culberson got an infield single, and A.J.Hinch decided enough was enough, pulling his starter from the game after he recorded just 11 outs.Advertisement Continue

innings, but he started the fourth with a walk to George Springer.He was able to retire Alex Bregman on a fly to left, but then Jose Altuve singled, Carlos Correa doubled and Yulieski Gurriel hit a three-run homer and suddenly the Astros and Dodgers were tied, 4-4.Kershaw settled down to retire Josh Reddick on a pop-out to first, and got out of the inning when Evan Gattis flew out to left.Gurriels home run is especially intriguing after Commissioner Rob Manfreds decision to suspend him for a racist gesture he made in the dugout in Game 3.The suspension could have gone into effect immediately, which would have kept him out of this game, but Manfred decided to have him remain eligible for the World Series and have his suspension start at the beginning of the 2018 season.Waldstein: Many people, especially Dodger fans, were arguing that Yuli Gurriel should have been suspended for one World Series game for his racist gesture on the bench in Game 3, instead of five regular season games next year.He did nothing in Game 4, but in Game 5 he came through with the hit of the series so far, smashing a Kershaw slider over the plate.The ball hit the signs over the seats in the left field bleachers.Maybe Kershaw cant grip the ball properly, after all.Photo Top 5th: Bellingers blast puts the Dodgers back on top.Collin McHugh replaced Luke Gregerson to start the inning, and the counterintuitive move to use a reliever who has barely pitched in the postseason backfired as he allowed two walks and then gave up a three-run home run to Cody Bellinger that gave Los Angeles a 7-4 lead.McHugh, who started 12 games for Houston during the regular season, had just one previous appearance in this years postseason.He pitched four shutout innings in the Astros Game 3 loss to the Yankees in the A.L.C.S.Advertisement Continue reading the main story McHugh recovered from Bellingers blast to retire Logan Forsythe on a fly to right and ended the half-inning by striking out Yasiel Puig on a high fastball that the slugging outfielder simply waved at.Waldstein: Biggest no-nos in pitching: Dont walk the leadoff batter in an inning and dont give back a lead after your batters have worked to tie a game or go ahead.McHugh did it all and the Houston fans are quiet and depressed again.Photo Bottom 5th: Astros chase Kershaw, then Altuve ties the game.The fifth inning finally ended, but not before the Houston Astros tied the game at 7-7.Clayton Kershaw was pulled from the game with two men on and two out, but Kenta Maeda, one of the Dodgers top relievers, could not get the job done, allowing Jose Altuve to crush a three-run homer to center.Maeda followed up the home by run giving up a single to Carlos Correa with Correa advancing to second on a bad throw but got out of the inning when Yulieski Gurriel grounded out to short.Kershaws final line for the night was 4 2/3 innings, four hits and six earned runs.He struck out two and walked one.Photo Waldstein: Its hard to adequately describe the complete energy shifts that have taken place in this building, first with Gurriels 3-run homer, then Bellingers 3-run homer dampening it down, and then Altuves reigniting the thunderous cheers.The fans were chanting M.V.P.with a deep, throaty insistence, and Altuve put everything he had into one mighty swing from his diminutive body.The ball went about 450 feet down the left field line, but foul.Then, on the next pitch from Kenta Maeda, Altuve straightened it out.Swinging as hard as he could again, he blasted the ball about as high as it was long and the fans, led by base runner George Springer with his arms aloft, erupted.Quite a buzz in here now.Everyone knows they are witnessing a remarkable game in a fun World Series.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Top 6th: McHugh gets the job done for Astros.Collin McHugh got bailed out after allowing three runs in the fifth inning, and he responded to that support by working around a one-out walk in a scoreless inning.He finished off the frame by freezing Corey Seager on a 90 mile-per-hour fastball on the outside corner for strike three.Waldstein: This time, Collin McHugh doesnt hand back the lead, so better job by him.Its funny, as colleague Billy Witz noted, when Charlie Morton and Alex Wood squared off in Game 4, it was a shutout pitching duel through five, and when the Cy Young Award winners Clayton Kershaw and Dallas Keuchel take the mound for Game 5, there are two touchdowns on the board after five innings.I think those guys are gassed here on October 29.Bottom 6th: Astros bats quiet down some.The chess game of relievers continues.Kenta Maeda had Josh Reddick flailing at strike three to start the half-inning, but he walked Evan Gattis so Dave Roberts chose to pull him.The move to Tony Watson made Marwin Gonzalez bat right-handed, and that proved beneficial as Gonzalez, who is a much better left-handed hitter, flew out to right.Brian McCann then grounded a ball right into the shift for the third out of the inning.Photo Top 7th: Bellinger puts the Dodgers on top again.Brad Peacock, who was the anchor of Houstons bullpen in Game 3, was out to start the seventh even though Manager A.J.Hinch had intended to give him the day off.The right-hander started off poorly, allowing Justin Turner to rap a double off the center field wall, but he showed some defensive versatility by fielding a sacrifice bunt attempt from Kike Hernandez and wheeling around to throw Turner out at third.The good fortune did not last.The next batter was Cody Bellinger and the rookie lined a ball up the middle that a diving George Springer could not come up with.Hernandez scored from first and Bellinger ended up with a stand-up triple.With one run in and one out, Peacock got a called strike three against Logan Forsythe and then got out of the inning when Yasiel Puig flew out to left.Waldstein: There was a lot to digest in the top of the 7th.First of all, why would the Dodgers have Enrique Hernandez, batting fourth, drop down a bunt in the seventh inning of a game where runs are coming in bunches?He put down a terrible bunt and Brad Peacock, without hesitation, spun and fired to third base to get Justin Turner easily.But the Astros go from crisp defense to a really bad blunder when George Springer lets a sinking liner get behind him for a run-scoring triple by Cody Bellinger (scoring Hernandez from first).If Springer played that ball on a hop, the Dodgers are at first and second with out and a double play ball gets them out of the inning.Its doubtful this game will end with this score, anyway.Photo Bottom 7th: Astros lead after Springer and Correa go long.Brandon Morrow had been a reliable reliever for the Dodgers all postseason, but pitching on a third consecutive day for the first time in his career, the right-hander Morrow allowed a deep home run to George Springer on his first pitch of the game, gave up a single to Alex Bregman on his second pitch, and then watched as Jose Altuves long fly ball sailed over Joc Pedersons head for a double, allowing Bregman to score.He threw a wild pitch to Carlos Correa, which allowed Altuve to get to third, and then Correa made that irrelevant by crushing a 96 mile-per-hour sinker over the wall in left for a two-run homer.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Now trailing 11-8, Dodgers Manager Dave Roberts came out to the mound to replace Morrow with Tony Cingrani, who stopped the bleeding by getting three quick outs, including strikeouts of Yulieski Gurriel and Josh Reddick.Waldstein: Coming into the game, both teams had 20 home runs in the postseason.The Dodgers now have 21 and Houston has 24.The record for one postseason is 27 by the 2002 San Francisco Giants.The 04 Astros hit 25.These teams have also combined for 20 home runs in the World Series, and 14 of those have either tied the game or produced a lead.The record for most home runs in a World Series is 21, set in 2002 with Barry Bondss Giants and the champion Angels.Photo Top 8th: Dodgers get one back.The Astros used three relievers in the inning to face six batters, and while they allowed a run on a double by Corey Seager, they kept Houston on top 11-9.Houston will try to get a few insurance runs in the bottom of the 8th inning, but it is a mystery how the team will handle the top of the 9th since A.J.Hinch said before the game that he would not use his closer, Ken Giles, in a save situation.Photo Bottom 8th: McCann stretches Astros lead to 12-9.Considering the state of the teams bullpen, Houston needed some insurance, and they got it when Brian McCann hit a solo homer that stretched the teams lead to 12-9.That was all they got as Ross Stripling came in for the Dodgers to settle things down.Houston is now three outs away from going back to Los Angeles with a 3-2 lead in the best-of-seven series.Photo Top 9th: Puig homers as Dodgers tie the game again.The Astros stayed away from Ken Giles, and instead had Chris Devenski come out for the ninth after hed recorded one out in the eighth.It did not work out as Devenski allowed three runs to send this game to the bottom of the ninth tied 12-12.Devenski walked Cody Bellinger, struck out Logan Forsythe, and then allowed a one-handed home run to Yasiel Puig that cut the deficit to 12-11.Austin Barnes made things interesting with a double, but Joc Pederson grounded out to short which brought up Chris Taylor.Taylor got into a 2-2 count, but he stayed alive and singled to center, scoring Barnes.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Corey Seager flied out to center to end the inning, but the Dodgers have come back from their third deficit of three or more runs in one game.Bottom 9th: Jansen works a scoreless inning.Kenley Jansen pitched a scoreless half-inning, though Yulieski Gurriel made him sweat on a two-out double to center that caromed off the wall before falling onto the warning track.Jansen was able to erase the threat by retiring Josh Reddick on a fly ball that fell into Andre Ethiers glove for the third out of the inning.Photo Top 10th: Musgrove holds Dodgers to one base runner.Joe Musgrove became the seventh pitcher for the Astros.He allowed one hit when Andre Ethier took advantage of the shift to poke the ball into left for a single, but he otherwise kept the Dodgers bats quiet.His teammates now have another chance to win it with a single swing in the bottom half of the inning.Waldstein: Something to keep an eye on if Jansen stays in the game: the Astros have been getting good swings on him and he has not been as automatic in this World Series as he normally is.Plus, this game has been a launching pad, as it is.Bottom 10th: Bregman gets the last laugh.Kenley Jansen appeared to be cruising.The Dodgers closer got two quick outs but then unraveled.He hit Brian McCann with a pitch, walked George Springer and then lost the game when Alex Bregman lined a single to left that was deep enough to bring home pinch-runner Derek Fisher.It was a game defined by home runs, but won through patience and hustle.
Next! Dodgers and Astros Are Quick to Pull Pitchers:::::The Astros Charlie Morton faced the minimum 15 batters through five innings, and allowed just three hits and a run in six and one-third innings.It was the only matchup in World Series history in which both starters allowed four or fewer base runners.Yet despite efficient pitch counts 84 for Wood, 76 for Morton both starters were gone by the seventh-inning stretch.Its always in your best interest to take the pitcher out a hitter too early rather than a hitter too late, and Ive always tried to give the reliever a little bit of a leash, Astros Manager A. J. Hinch said.I always try to give the starter a job well done when he walks off the mound.But the context of the game is always going to shift and change.Photo Since the Mets Matt Harvey faltered in the ninth inning of the final game of 2015, managers have refused to let starters go deep in the World Series.The starters in Game 3 of the Series last fall the Chicago Cubs Kyle Hendricks and the Cleveland Indians Josh Tomlin were both removed in the fifth inning of a scoreless tie.No starter recorded an out past the sixth inning of that World Series, and through four games of this one, the only starter to complete seven was the Dodgers Clayton Kershaw in Game 1.Kershaw, who threw just 83 pitches that night, was scheduled for a rematch with Dallas Keuchel in Game 5 here on Sunday.The idea, Dodgers Manager Dave Roberts said, is to predict when trouble might happen and avoid it, upending the traditional notion of riding a starter until he gets tired.Baseballs very reactionary, Roberts said, explaining that he tries to be proactive and get ahead of something that potentially might happen and to go a direction that might increase your chances marginally.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The Dodgers have done this all year.In the regular season, they had the fewest starts in the majors of at least 100 pitches, with their pitchers reaching that threshold just 24 times half by Kershaw.In the 12 games the Dodgers had played in this postseason entering Sunday, only Kershaw had thrown 85 pitches in a start.Were very into analytics here, and numbers say the third time through the order, things kind of fall apart sometimes, Morrow said.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.I dont think we necessarily anticipated that with Woody throwing the ball as well as he was.Even though he gave up a home run there, hes more than able to come back and throw two or three more innings, Im sure.Games like this, you make the decision.Robertss decisions guided the Dodgers to 104 victories in the regular season, the most in the franchises six decades in Los Angeles.They now have a chance to finish this World Series at Dodger Stadium on Tuesday or Wednesday, so they might be on to something.Yet, for Wood and his fellow starter Rich Hill who was pulled after four innings, one run and just 60 pitches in Game 2 the numbers do not spike drastically after the second time through the order.Photo In the regular season, Hill kept hitters to a .162 average when facing them for the third or fourth time in a game.Against Wood in such situations, the average was .222.Then again, Roberts and Hinch he of the similarly analytics-minded Astros have reams of proprietary data to prepare them for nearly every possible in-game decision.They work closely with their front offices in a manner that the Yankees, who dismissed Joe Girardi last week after 10 winning seasons, will seek from their next manager.Roberts invited scrutiny in Game 2 after pulling Hill so early.The game went into extra innings, and by the time it reached the top of the 11th, Roberts was down to one reliever, Brandon McCarthy, who had not pitched in the entire postseason.McCarthy faltered, and the Dodgers lost.But those circumstances arose only because Kenley Jansen, who is normally infallible, blew the save in Game 2 after being handed a two-run lead in the eighth inning by the four Dodgers relievers who preceded him.Advertisement Continue reading the main story When the other relievers hold a lead for Jansen, Roberts has essentially done his job, regardless of the final outcome.Even with meticulous planning, it is the players, not the manager, who control the results.So it was in Game 4 of the Series, when Morton left with a 1-0 lead in the seventh inning but the bullpen gave up six runs behind him.It was natural to wonder what might have been had Morton stayed in the game, and Hinch understood.You can draw it out perfectly and map it out, but you never know how the other outcome would have been, he said.Everybody in baseball thinks that the other way would have been perfectly good, and we dont know.We do know that bullpen usage is changing, and starters rarely determine the outcome on their own anymore.They have gotten to the World Series this way, and accept it.We havent really had to work too hard so far in the playoffs, Wood said, paying tribute to the Dodgers bullpen.Theyve been absolutely nails.
Cody Bellinger Breaks Through, Leading the Dodgers Past the Astros:::::The Dodgers battered the Astros bullpen in the ninth inning on Saturday night, with Bellinger delivering a double off closer Ken Giles to put Los Angeles ahead, 2-1.And after a sacrifice fly by Austin Barnes made it 3-1, Joc Pederson blasted a three-run homer off Joe Musgrove to end any suspense.The Astros managed only two hits all night solo homers by George Springer with two outs in the sixth and by Alex Bregman with two outs in the ninth.Photo The late Dodgers outburst came after an unlikely pitchers duel between the teams No.4 starters, Alex Wood of the Dodgers and Charlie Morton of the Astros.Wood carried a no-hitter into the sixth on Saturday, when Springer produced the games first run with his homer.Morton was only slightly less flawless, facing the minimum number of batters through five innings.Thus far, each game has delivered an unexpected element.Game 1 came with extreme 103-degree heat.Game 2 brought a rare blown save by Dodgers closer Kenley Jansen and late, no-quit, home run-fueled comebacks by both teams.And Game 3 was marred by a racist gesture by Astros first baseman Yuli Gurriel.Gurriels act, in which he stretched the side of his eyes after hitting a home run off the Dodgers Japanese pitcher Yu Darvish, provided the backdrop for Game 4.On Saturday afternoon, Commissioner Rob Manfred suspended Gurriel for five games at the start of the 2018 season, but chose not to discipline him for this Series, in part because he did not want to penalize the rest of the Astros.His decision drew support from Roberts, whose mother is Japanese.I think that it gives us all some closure in the sense that it was something that happened, Roberts said.The way that it was dealt with, I support.Gurriel, who received modest cheers from Astros fans when he came to the plate for his first at-bat on Saturday, was not a factor as Game 4 proceeded.But Bellinger was.Photo Bellinger, who made his Dodgers debut when veteran Adrian Gonzalez was injured this season, generally carries himself well beyond his years, owing to a reserved personality and the preparation provided by his father, Clay, who won two World Series rings with the Yankees.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Hes got no pulse; he really doesnt have a memory, either, said Dodgers shortstop Corey Seager, who is 23 and in his third postseason.He forgets things.Things go away.Thats what you have to do in baseball you have to forget the past, forget your last AB and move onto the next one.Thats what he did tonight.But Bellingers breakout night did come with a thought process on his part.He was hitless in 13 at-bats, including eight strikeouts four in Game 3 as he came to the plate with one out in the seventh inning against Morton, who was nursing a 1-0 lead.Earlier, an insight had came to Bellinger when he went out to take batting practice: His teammates Andre Ethier and Logan Forsythe regularly hit the ball the opposite way when taking their pregame swings.So why not do the same?Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.I was always told these really good hitters hit the ball the other way in B.P., and I had never done it and I wanted to try it, said the left-handed hitting Bellinger, who proceeded to hit every ball to left field during the practice session.The struggles Bellinger endured in the Series were not unlike those of another ballyhooed rookie the Yankees Aaron Judge who emerged from a postseason slump midway through the American League Championship Series against the same Astros team Bellinger was now facing.I watched and we were identical, striking out a lot, swinging at a lot of off-speed pitches that we dont normally swing at, Bellinger said of Judge.I think thats the pressure of the postseason sometimes.Photo The Astros had put Bellinger in a funk by throwing him back-foot breaking balls and fastballs away pitches that are difficult to pull.But when Morton threw a 3-2 curveball to him in the seventh, he left it over the plate and Bellinger drove it the opposite way.Left fielder Marwin Gonzalez gave chase, but could not track it down.As Bellinger coasted into second with a double, he raised his hands and gazed upward as if to give thanks for his first hit of the series.It was also enough to chase Morton.He had survived the top of the sixth after Astros third baseman Alex Bregman threw Barnes out at home to keep the game scoreless.It was almost identical to a pivotal play Bregman made in Game 7 of the A.L.C.S., when he gunned down the Yankees Greg Bird at home to preserve a 1-0 lead.Advertisement Continue reading the main story But after Bellingers double an inning later, Astros Manager A. J. Hinch had a brief conversation with Morton on the mound and then called on his rested bullpen.Will Harris came on to retire Yasiel Puig on a deep fly to right field, but Forsythe followed by lining a 2-0 fastball for a single that easily scored Bellinger.The Dodgers werent done.In the ninth, Giles who surrendered a two-run lead in Game 2 gave up a single to Seager and a walk to Justin Turner.Bellinger followed by driving a 1-0 fastball into the left-center gap for a double that scored Seager and sent Turner to third.The double he hit to left-center, he stayed on that curveball pretty good, Astros catcher Brian McCann said of the first double.And the one in the ninth, he cheated on the heater.They were not the swings of an overmatched youngster, or of someone weighed down by the moment.Instead, they were taken by someone who understood what to remember and what to forget, and the result was a World Series that might end up going the distance.
Manfred Makes His Choice: Punish Gurriel, but Leave the World Series Alone:::::Obviously, Manfred said, World Series games are different than regular-season games.Among the other reasons Manfred cited for delaying the suspension, this stands out: I felt it was unfair to punish the other 24 players on the Astros roster, he said.I wanted the burden of this discipline to fall primarily on the wrongdoer.Denying Gurriel a chance to help his team in the World Series would have severely affected him.It would also have allowed a fleeting gesture an ugly one, for sure, but one that was done in the dugout, not on the field, and that did not appear to be premeditated to unduly influence the World Series.Photo And yet, given that reasoning by Manfred, these tough words from him on Saturday There is no place in our game for the behavior or any behavior like the behavior we witnessed last night seem somewhat contradictory.Gurriel, after all, is still playing.But Manfred was right in saying that World Series games are far more significant than a midseason game for the Oakland As or the Toronto Blue Jays.Maybe that sounds crass, but there is no disputing it.And while Manfred would not declare five games as the new standard price for intolerant words or actions during a game he said he would deal with each situation on its own merits the penalty for Gurriel does exceed all recent punishments, including the three-game ban given to Yunel Escobar, then of Toronto, for wearing eye black inscribed with an anti-gay slur in 2012.Gurriel, for his part, said after Fridays game that he was surprised by the furor over his gesture.He mentioned his experiences in Japan he played for the Yokohama BayStars in 2014 and said that he respected Japanese people.I did not want to offend anybody, he said through an interpreter.As for his characterization of Darvish as a chinito, a word that can be demeaning to Asians, Gurriel said that in Cuba, the term applies to anyone who is Asian, not just to Japanese people, although that did not amount to much of an excuse.In any case, he added that he understood he was wrong.In a statement on Saturday, Gurriel apologized to Darvish and called his gesture indefensible.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Not surprisingly, both managers in the Series were asked to comment on Gurriel and his punishment.We support everything thats right about this game, and well move forward, if everyone will allow us to, Astros Manager A. J. Hinch said.Knowing Yuli, knowing what he will do to convince everyone that this incident was not in his heart, will be key.Dodgers Manager Dave Roberts, who was born in Japan and whose mother is Japanese, said he approved of the way Manfred had handled the incident.Gurriel, who was batting .340 in the postseason and was in the starting lineup for Game 4, has delivered on his promise since the Astros signed him for five years and $47.5 million after he defected last year.He made a smooth transition from third base to first while batting .299 with 18 homers, 75 runs batted in and 43 doubles this season.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Race/Related Newsletter Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of New York Times journalists.Hes a great hitter, said Jose Altuve, the Astros star second baseman, one of the best Ive ever seen, to be honest with you.It was, officially, Gurriels rookie season.But at 33 years old, after playing professionally for 15 seasons in Cuba and Japan, Gurriel is a rookie in name only.He comes from a prominent baseball family in Cuba, and spent most of his prime years there.I could have left at 22 or something like other players and spent their entire careers here and maybe that would have been better, Gurriel said in Spanish at a workout in Los Angeles on Monday.But no, I dont regret it.I had the chance to play my entire life in Cuba and enjoy those great moments, and the chance to play in Japan.God wanted me to be here in this moment now, and Im enjoying this.The Astros have such a deep offense that their leader in runs batted in, Marwin Gonzalez, batted eighth in Game 3.That suits Gurriel, who said he felt pressure to carry his Cuban teams but does not have the same feeling here.In Cuba, if I didnt hit, I lost, he said.If I did hit, it was normal and what I was supposed to do.So it was really hard to please people.Its been different here in this lineup.Advertisement Continue reading the main story At the same group interview in which he made those comments, Gurriel was asked a question by a Japanese reporter.He answered with a few words in Japanese before continuing in Spanish.I identified a lot with the Japanese public, Gurriel said.It was a really great experience.Yet with one gesture on Friday, Gurriel turned what should have been an experience to celebrate into something much different.And left Manfred to untangle it.
Astros Yuli Gurriel Escapes World Series Ban, but Will Miss 5 Games in 2018:::::Photo HOUSTON Yuli Gurriel, the Houston Astros first baseman who was seen making a racist gesture in the dugout during Game 3 of the World Series on Friday night, has been given a five-game suspension without pay that will begin at the start of the 2018 season.The suspension, which was handed down by Rob Manfred, the commissioner of Major League Baseball, is the largest levied against a player for a public act of intolerance during a baseball game, exceeding by two games the suspension of Yunel Escobar, who was penalized for gay slurs written on his eye black strips in 2012.Manfreds decision, which he announced in a Saturday afternoon news conference, means that Gurriel will not have to sit out any of the remaining games of the World Series.The Los Angeles Dodgers tied the Series at two games apiece with a 6-2 victory on Saturday night.Photo Gurriel is scheduled to earn $12 million in 2018 and will lose roughly $320,855 because of the suspension.He will also have to undergo sensitivity training.Advertisement Continue reading the main story There is no excuse or explanation that makes that type of behavior acceptable, Manfred said.During Game 3 of the Series on Friday, Gurriel, who defected from Cuba in 2016, hit a home run off Dodgers pitcher Yu Darvish in the bottom of the second inning.After Gurriel returned to the dugout, he was captured on camera smiling and then raising his hands as if to stretch the sides of his eyes.It seemed to be a clear, and pointedly insensitive, reference to Darvish, who is from Japan.After Game 3 ended in a Houston victory, Gurriel was besieged by reporters, and he told them through an interpreter that he did not intend to offend Darvish.He maintained that he was telling teammates that maybe Darvish thought he was Japanese and that is why he gave him a good pitch to hit.Photo Darvish issued a statement Friday night forgiving Gurriel and asking people to learn from the incident.
Astros Rout Yu Darvish and Hold On to Beat the Dodgers in Game 3:::::HOUSTON The list of stellar pitchers that the Houston Astros lineup has toppled this postseason is impressive: Chris Sale, Craig Kimbrel, Luis Severino, Aroldis Chapman and Kenley Jansen all among the best at their craft.And by the second inning of Game 3 of the World Series on Friday night, the Astros had struck again, this time getting the best of another prestigious pitcher the Los Angeles Dodgers Yu Darvish.They shelled him for four runs and forced him to make him an unceremonious exit after getting only five outs.The end result was a 5-3 victory that gave the Astros a lead of two games to one in the Series, with Game 4 scheduled for Saturday night at Minute Maid Park.The Astros are now 7-0 in their ballpark this postseason, and the Dodgers trail for the first time in a 2017 postseason series.The victory displayed the dynamism of the Astros offense.After being limited to one run in Game 1, the Astros scored 12 over the next two games.The win also underscored the versatility of pitcher Brad Peacock.Used mainly as a starter this season, Peacock took over for Lance McCullers Jr. in the sixth and fired three and two-thirds hitless innings to complete the game, earning the first save of his career and ensuring that the work of the Astros lineup would hold up.Photo When I was out there, a couple of times I got the chills from them screaming so loud, Peacock said of the Astros fans.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Even though the Astros played a solid all-around game on Friday night, with good defense and competent starting pitching from McCullers, they also created some controversy.After Astros first baseman Yuli Gurriel smashed a home run off Darvish in the second inning, television cameras caught him smiling and using his hands to stretch the edges of his eyes, a racist gesture that referred to Darvish, who is from Japan.
A World Series Twist: First Loves Become the Enemy:::::His parents were from New York and rooted for the Yankees, as did Luhnows older brother, Chris, who told him they could not root for the same team.Luhnow picked the Dodgers, one of the more successful teams of the 1970s.I watched them on TV sunshine, L.A., the beach, a likable team, I liked the colors, all that, he said.So they became my team.Photo When Luhnow was 14, in 1981, Fernando Valenzuela profoundly jolted the franchise.Valenzuela, a pudgy prodigy from Navojoa, Mexico, opened the season by going 8-0 in eight starts and working nine innings every time.He ended that year with nine more innings against the Yankees to win Game 3 of the World Series, helping the Dodgers to a championship.Luhnow had found his favorite player.He just didnt look like a prototypical athlete, he said.He physically didnt look like he was in that great shape, his delivery was so unusual, and he looked like a guy that grew up in rural Mexico and was suddenly on the largest stage in the world and dominating in an unusual way that no one could figure out the screwball, the eyes rolling back and all the things that he did.He was a lovable player.Decades later, Luhnow would also defy convention to make it in baseball, using a business background and a strong belief in analytics to grow a thriving farm system for the St. Louis Cardinals and, since December 2011, to patiently build the Astros into winners.When he moved to California for high school, though, that was too far-off to imagine.Luhnow just wanted to go to Dodger Stadium.I came to a ton of games, he said.My English teacher had season tickets, right up there in the loge level.I would come every time he would invite me, which was quite a bit.Luhnow was there for the first two games of the 1983 National League Championship Series against the Philadelphia Phillies a loss in the opener and a victory by Valenzuela in Game 2.The Phillies won the best-of-five series in four and the Dodgers would not reach the World Series until 1988, after Luhnow had left California to continue his education, eventually earning an M.B.A. from the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Friedman could relate to the World Series near miss.In 1986, just before he turned

later.Advertisement Continue reading the main story That was the infamous or celebrated Game 6, which the Mets tied with three runs in the ninth.The Mets scored again in the 14th before the Astros, who were facing elimination, tied it on a Billy Hatcher homer.The Mets scored three in the 16th, gave up two in the bottom of the inning, but finally won the pennant and avoided facing the unhittable Mike Scott in Game 7.I was heartbroken I swore off baseball, said Friedman, who had witnessed Scotts division-clinching no-hitter that September.He added that 86 scarred me some I remember watching the World Series with the Mets and Red Sox, and it was painful.Photo Of course, Friedman did not really give up the game.As the years went on, he would visit the Astrodome so frequently about 30 times a summer, he guessed that he befriended the stadium workers and could roam almost anywhere he pleased.Long before clubs stamped game-used items with holograms and sold them at the team store, Friedman would often go home with broken bats or discarded equipment.He once scored an artifact from the early career of a future Hall of Famer.Probably a Craig Biggio helmet from when he was catching, Friedman said, when asked for the prize of his collection.It had a crack in it, and I dont really remember how I got it but probably someone that wasnt him just saw me there hanging out.Friedman would play baseball at Tulane and, like Luhnow, work in business before joining a major league front office.He built the Tampa Bay Rays into pennant winners in 2008, and has been the Dodgers president of baseball operations for three years.In their jobs now, Luhnow and Friedman regularly meet their old heroes.Friedman said he had put his fandom long behind, and was not awe-struck when he met Biggio a few years ago.Luhnow, though, has never quite summoned the courage to have a conversation with Valenzuela, who now broadcasts Dodgers games in Spanish and tossed the ceremonial first pitch before Game 2.Luhnow said he got chills watching that ceremony.He has said hello to his baseball idol, but only casually.Yet Valenzuela is well aware of his work.I havent had the pleasure of meeting him, but I would congratulate him on where his team has gotten, Valenzuela said in Spanish.His team has reached the World Series, which is what you want.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Actually, both of Luhnows teams his employer and his first love have reached the World Series.Both of Friedmans, too.
Want to Play in the World Series? Just Get the Yankees to Trade You:::::Consider that Aroldis Chapman was traded to the Chicago Cubs in July of last year (he is a Yankee again) and played a key role in the 2016 Series.So did his fellow reliever Andrew Miller, who was traded by the Yankees to the Cleveland Indians in midseason and also ended up a major figure in the 2016 Series.Another Yankee who was dealt at the nonwaiver trade deadline last year was Carlos Beltran.He was sent to the Texas Rangers, but signed as a free agent with the Houston Astros before this season.Now he is in the World Series, too, along with another former Yankee catcher Brian McCann, who was traded by New York to the Astros in the off-season.Then there is reliever Tyler Clippard, who was a Yankee this year and is now an Astro, although he is not on the postseason roster.Still, if the Astros win the Series, he is in line to get a ring.Photo Clippard was sent to the Chicago White Sox this season to help offset some of the salary the Yankees were taking on when they acquired relievers Tommy Kahnle and David Robertson and third baseman Todd Frazier.Several weeks later, the White Sox sent Clippard to the Astros.The only two players the Yankees have dealt from their major league roster in the past 16 months who have not reached a World Series are starting pitcher Ivan Nova, who was sent to Pittsburgh at the 2016 nonwaiver trade deadline and has remained there, and reliever Tyler Webb, who was dealt to Milwaukee this past summer.Beltran, who grounded out as a pinch-hitter on Tuesday night in Game 1 of the Series, was relegated to the bench for the two World Series games at Dodger Stadium earlier this week because there is no designated hitter in National League parks.But McCann could play a central role as this Series continues, just as he did in the American League Championship Series against the Yankees, when he hit a pair of run-scoring doubles that sparked the Astros to victories in Games 6 and 7.McCann signed a five-year, $85 million deal with the Yankees in November 2013 but realized his role as the teams regular catcher was in peril once the Yankees called up Gary Sanchez from the minor leagues in August 2016 and thrust him into the lineup.Advertisement Continue reading the main story From that point on, McCann played regularly as a designated hitter but caught only sporadically.Meanwhile, Sanchez was slugging one home run after another.Photo When the season ended, I kind of assessed where I was and what I wanted to do going forward, and I just wasnt ready to catch once a week and I wasnt ready to just D.H. against right-handed pitching, McCann said recently.While McCann had a no-trade clause in his deal with the Yankees, he also had another incentive to waive it the $15 million in his contract for 2019.It vests only if he has 1,000 plate appearances in 2017 and 2018 and he must also catch at least 90 games next year and not end the season on the disabled list.In conversations with Yankees General Manager Brian Cashman after last season, it became apparent to McCann that there were two realistic landing spots for him the Astros and the Atlanta Braves.Atlanta is McCanns hometown and the Braves are the club with whom he began his career.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.But in the end, it was Houston that wanted to make the deal, with the Yankees picking up $11 million of McCanns contract over this season and next.I looked around and this was the first team that came to mind because I knew they needed a catcher, I knew the talent they had in the clubhouse playing against them, and it was just a perfect fit, said McCann, who is playing in his first World Series.I talked to Cash quite a bit during that process and it was really between coming here or going to Atlanta.Im very thankful this all worked out the way it did.Well, not all of it.Because McCann had only 399 plate appearances this season he batted .241 with 18 home runs it is unlikely the 2019 option will kick in.Still, he is in the World Series, one more recently traded Yankee enjoying baseballs most prestigious competition.Perhaps there will be still others in 2018.
World Series 2017: How the Astros Won Game 3, Inning by Inning:::::- Want exclusive sports news, highlights and analysis from a rotating cast of New York Times journalists, delivered to your inbox once a week?Click here to receive our weekly Sports newsletter.- Heres how the Astros beat the Dodgers in Game 3, inning by inning: Photo Top 1st: McCullers gets three quick outs.Game 3 began at 8:21 p.m. Eastern with Lance McCullers of the Astros throwing a 95 mile-per-hour fastball low and outside for ball one to Chris Taylor of the Dodgers.McCullers eventually got Taylor to pop out to second and retired Corey Seager when Jose Altuve made a great diving play in shallow-right to knock the ball down before throwing Seager out at first.The inning ended with Justin Turner flying out to deep center.Waldstein: Yu Darvish takes the mound in the bottom of the first for the Dodgers as the first Japanese starting pitcher in the World Series in 10 years.The last one was Daisuke Matsuzaka for the Boston Red Sox in their four-game sweep of the Colorado Rockies in 2007.Matsuzaka also started Game 3.Darvish has plenty of experience pitching at Minute Maid Park from his days with the Texas Rangers.He comes into the game with a 4-1 record and a 2.16 earned run average, so the Dodgers are pinning a lot of their hopes on him replicating that success here.Bottom 1st: Darvish gets out of jam.George Springer worked a 3-1 count against Yu Darvish and then pounced on a fastball in the zone, hitting a hard liner to center for a double.Alex Bregman made Darvish work, fouling off five pitches in an eight-pitch at-bat, but ultimately grounded out to third, which kept Springer at second.Jose Altuve flew out to deep center, which sent Springer to third, but Darvish got ahead in the count and Carlos Correa grounded out to short to end the inning.Top 2nd: Dodgers make some noise, but no runs.Lance McCullers threw half of his 12 pitches in the inning to one batter, but worked around a single to keep the game scoreless.He needed just three pitches to strike out Cody Bellinger, as the rookie infielder almost fell down as he swung wildly at a knuckle-curve.One pitch to Yasiel Puig and McCullers had a second out on a grounder to second, but Logan Forsythe got the Dodgers first hit on a single to right.Forsythe was able to steal second as Austin Barnes worked a six-pitch at-bat, but the half-inning ended when Barnes grounded out to third.Photo Bottom 2nd: Astros jump all over Darvish and score 4 runs.Yu Darvish struggled to put pitches where he wanted them and that led to a great inning for struggling Astros batters.Only six outs into the game, Dave Roberts had seen enough and removed his No.3 starter with the Dodgers already down 4-0.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Yulieski Gurriel, who was 1 for 7 in Games 1 and 2, led things off by unloading on a fastball for a solo home run.Josh Reddick, whose bat had been almost entirely silent, doubled to left for his first extra-base hit of the postseason.Evan Gattis walked and Marwin Gonzalez, who had been in a horrible funk leading up to his game-tying home run in Game 2, singled off the wall in left, scoring Reddick.With runners on first and second with no outs, Brian McCann, who was hitless in the first two games of the series, looped a ball into right-center that brought home Gattis and sent Gonzalez to third.Photo Darvish finally got his first out when George Springer, the sixth batter of the half-inning, lined out to second, but Alex Bregman hit a fly ball deep enough to center to give Gonzalez enough time to tag up and score, making the score 4-0.Jose Altuve doubled to left, sending McCann over to third, and that brought out Roberts, who replaced Darvish with Kenta Maeda.Maeda needed just two pitches to end the inning, getting Carlos Correa to fly out to right.Darvishs final line was one and two-thirds innings, six hits and four runs.He walked one and had no strikeouts in the shortest start of his career.Waldstein: Darvish did not have it tonight.Even the outs were on balls that were hit hard.Gurriel started it by ripping a line-drive home run into the left field bleachers, which can be home to some of the cheapest home runs in baseball.Not to say that it was cheap, because he hammered the ball.But the distance is 315 feet, only 5 feet deeper than Fenway Park in Boston.But the wall here is about half the height of the 37-foot Green Monster, so it is one of the most tantalizing targets in baseball for a right-handed pull hitter, as Gurriel showed.It was the sixth home run hit in the last four innings of this World Series, going back to the extra innings of Game 2.Photo Top 3rd: Dodgers get one back.Given a fairly sizable lead, Lance McCullers walked the bases loaded to start the third, but managed to get out of the half-inning having only allowed one run.It was a rough start, as he engaged in a battle with Joc Pederson.The boom-or-bust hitter fought off several good pitches in what proved to be a nine-pitch walk.Undoubtedly frustrated by putting Pederson on base, McCullers responded with walks to Kike Hernandez and Chris Taylor.He got some help when his defense turned a double-play on a grounder from Corey Seager, and ended the inning by getting Justin Turner to ground out to short.The inning couldve gone far worse for McCullers, who should be happy with a 4-1 score.Waldstein: You want to make a pitching coach crazy?Get handed a 4-0 lead and then go to the mound and walk the No.8, No.9 and No.1 hitters to load the bases with nobody out.Thats what Lance McCullers, Jr. just did.But thanks to some terrific defense, including by McCullers, himself, the Astros avoided big damage.The big play was getting Corey Seager to ground into a double play that required some exceptional synchronized movement and pinpoint throws from the Astros to complete.First baseman Yuli Gurriel threw a strike off the wrong foot to Carlos Correa coming across the second base bag and he, while in stride, delivered the ball to a moving target in McCullers covering first.That kind of cohesion begins in spring training.Photo Bottom 3rd: Maeda cools down Astros batters.After a pair of lengthy half-innings for both teams, Kenta Maeda made quick work of the Astros in the third.He started by getting a pair of matching pop-outs to third from Yulieski Gurriel and Josh Reddick.A walk to Evan Gattis was a mild speed bump, but Maeda finished things off by getting Marwin Gonzalez to ground out to first to end the inning.Photo Top 4th: Puigs gamble backfires.A bang-bang play went Houstons way, sending the Dodgers down in order.With one out, Yasiel Puig hit a grounder down the third-base line that Alex Bregman could not quite reach.The ball skipped into foul territory, but Puig took some time before realizing he should round first and Carlos Correa was able to corral the ball and throw him out at second.Stoked to have two outs despite the hard hit by Puig, Lance McCullers ended things by getting Logan Forsythe to fly out to right.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Waldstein: Yasiel Puig has been caught admiring balls before, but this time he suffered from putting his head down and hustling to first base.After hitting a sharp bouncer down the third base line, Puig ran so hard that he did not see the ball had skipped past third baseman Alex Bregman.Puig overran first, slowed down and only then realized he should have been headed to second.By the time he restarted and slid into second, the ball was in Jose Altuves glove and Puig was tagged out.Bottom 4th: Maedas relief appearance gives Dodgers hope.Kenta Maeda has done a terrific job of settling things down after Yu Darvishs disastrous start.Brian McCann led off fourth against him by looping a ball just out of Corey Seagers reach in shallow left field for a single.But Maeda was unfazed and went on to strike out George Springer on four pitches and Alex Bregman on five.He got out of the inning when Jose Altuve grounded out to short.Maeda is up to 38 pitches in two and one-thirds innings of relief as the Dodgers try to get as much as they can from one of the teams three best relievers.Photo Top 5th: McCullers gets out of trouble again.Lance McCullers worked around some tremendous hustle from Joc Pederson to pitch another scoreless inning, with some help from George Springer.With one out, Pederson hit what looked like a single to center.But the young outfielder ran hard right out of the box and managed to stretch the soft hit into a double.Kike Hernandez sent him to third on a groundout to second, but McCullers got out of the inning when Chris Taylor hit a shallow fly to center that a diving Springer was able to snare for the third out.
The Astros Alex Bregman Keeps Working at Hitting, Fielding and Spanish:::::Across from Gurriel at the other corner of the infield is Bregman, a 23-year-old third baseman and a first-round draft pick in 2015 who moves seamlessly between the teams contingents of Latino and American players because he has a working knowledge of Spanish and a desire to get better at it.He makes the effort, and he values the guys who dont speak English, which is important in this game, said Carlos Beltran, the Astros designated hitter, who is from Puerto Rico.When I see an American player really making the effort with the Latinos, its something really special, added Beltran, 40, who was shy as a teenage prospect because he did not understand English but over the years has become confident in publicly addressing issues.He was one of the players most instrumental in getting Major League Baseball to require that every team have Spanish-English interpreters.More than a quarter of major league players are Latino, and most of those were born overseas.After arriving in the United States, those players are expected to learn English, and they often take language classes in baseball academies and in the minor leagues.In contrast, American-born players without any Latino background do not receive similar instruction in Spanish, even though it is the first language of numerous teammates.Instead, they usually learn bits of Spanish from playing alongside Latinos in both the minor and major leagues.What frequently happens as a result is that the foreign-born Latino players, especially those whose English is limited, end up spending most of their time in and away from the clubhouse with their fellow Spanish-speaking teammates.It becomes a question of comfort and familiarity.Photo But in the Astros clubhouse, the high-energy, Spanish-speaking Bregman bounces around everywhere.He hangs with the American players, the Latinos, everyone, Correa said.Hes a great teammate.Advertisement Continue reading the main story On Monday, the day before Game 1 of the World Series, the Astros infielders finished fielding drills and headed to the batting cage together.Altuve, Correa, Gurriel, Bregman and the utility player Marwin Gonzalez, who is from Venezuela, walked as a group with Gonzalezs arm over Bregmans shoulder.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Growing up in New Mexico and in a baseball family, Bregman was perhaps destined for this.His father, Sam, who is a lawyer, and an uncle played baseball at the University of New Mexico.His grandfather Stan was the general counsel for the second version of the Washington Senators, and helped negotiate the teams sale.At age 5, Alex Bregman said, he began receiving Spanish instruction in school.Throughout his baseball travels, including time while on developmental rosters for Team U.S.A., he said, he played in Colombia, Mexico and Cuba.That helped with his Spanish, too.Bregman was selected by the Astros with the second overall pick in 2015, and within a year he was in the major leagues because of his strong fielding and hitting ability.He hit .284 with 19 home runs and 71 R.B.I.this season and was 3 for 10 with a home run through the first two games of the World Series.Meanwhile, Bregman said, his Spanish skills continued to improve because he had so many Latino teammates once he turned professional.Im basically almost fluent now, he said, perhaps overstating his proficiency.I understand it all and speak probably 90 percent of it.You can ask them, but theyll tell you Im fluent.Photo His teammates verdict?He speaks it pretty well, at least better than you think, said Altuve, who speaks English well, just like Correa and Gonzalez.When I first met him, he didnt speak much.But hes learning more every day, so be careful what you say in front of him.Francisco Liriano, a veteran Astros pitcher who is from the Dominican Republic, grinned when asked about Bregmans Spanish.He sounds like an American, but he knows a good amount, he said.Beltran lauded Bregmans confidence and desire to learn a new language, a trait Beltran said would help Bregman not only with Spanish but throughout his career on the baseball field.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The most important thing is that he tries, said Beltran, who spoke in Spanish for this article, as did the other Latino players who were interviewed.Hes not afraid to express himself.He makes me laugh a few times because its funny the words he uses, good and bad words.Words you hear and you think, Oh, wow, how cool that he knows this word.Bregman is so enthusiastic about his language endeavor that he has done conducted brief interviews in Spanish with Francisco Romero, a Spanish-language radio broadcaster for Astros games.In an interview two weeks ago with Romero during the postseason, Bregman called a home run against the Boston Red Sox a dream for me and my family in Spanish, then mixed in some English when he could not remember how to say a blessing.The sentences were not complete, and there were a few mistakes, but he tried and he smiled.Earlier in the season, Romero recorded Bregman singing along in Spanish to Ginza, a popular reggaeton song by the Colombian artist J. Balvin.Because Altuve is well known in the Astros clubhouse for singing along to music, Bregman wanted to do it, too.Hanging out with his Latino teammates, Bregman said, has given him an appreciation for reggaeton (we all listen to it in the clubhouse all the time) and for carne asada, a staple of Latin American cuisines.Its all part of his learning process.

Chelsea midfielder N'Golo Kante could be fit to play Manchester United:::::Chelsea boss Antonio Conte remains hopeful N'Golo Kante will return from injury in time to face Manchester United on Sunday.The France international is currently sidelined with a hamstring problem but has returned to first-team training in recent days.And although the midfielder wasn't expected to return in time for the visit of Jose Mourinho's United to Stamford Bridge, Conte remains hopeful he will be fit to play some part on Sunday."He's progressing well," the Italian said."We have also tomorrow and then I'll take the best decision for him, for the team."
Tottenham duo Hugo Lloris and Toby Alderweireld out of Crystal Palace clash:::::Tottenham captain Hugo Lloris and defender Toby Alderweireld will both miss Sunday's game at home to Crystal Palace through injury.Mauricio Pochettino said the pair will undergo scans on Friday, with the club set to learn whether either have a chance of being fit for the north London derby against Arsenal later this month.Alderweireld suffered a hamstring strain and Lloris a groin injury during Spurs' 3-1 win over Real Madrid on Wednesday and they now face a race against time to line up against the Gunners on November 18."They are now going to do a scan this afternoon, tomorrow we'll have a better idea," Pochettino said."We can guess but we must wait for information after scan and assessment from the doctor."Eric Dier is likely to drop into the back three against Palace while Michel Vorm will replace Lloris in goal as Tottenham look to maintain momentum following their sensational win over Madrid.Despite their success in the Champions League, however, Spurs still trail Manchester City by eight points in the Premier League and Pochettino insists there is no room for complacency this weekend."We finished the game against Real Madrid and we were sitting with coaching staff in the manager's room," Pochettino said."We knew it was a fantastic victory but we started planning the next game and not only the next game but the game against Arsenal.For us it's so important to reduce the gap."The game against United was very painful - to lose the way we lost.Now, after that victory against Real Madrid, it's to be focused on the game against Crystal Palace.It has the same value as the Real Madrid game."Tottenham can also rely on at least two of their rivals dropping points on Sunday as City host Arsenal and Manchester United travel to Chelsea."Manchester City are doing very well.In the Premier League and Champions League they're showing unbelievable performance.They're the most in-form team in Europe today," Pochettino said."But of course, it's a long way (to go).the challenge is to keep their form and maintain for the whole season."Pochettino said Harry Kane reported no ill-effects from the game against Madrid after he missed last weekend's loss to United with a hamstring injury but Erik Lamela and Victor Wanyama remain unavailable.Lamela has been training with the first team for a few weeks but the winger is still not ready to return following his year-long absence due to a problem with his hips."His problem is not mental, his problem was and is real."Pochettino said."For Sunday it's too difficult but maybe after international break, he can be available again."Wanyama has been out since August with a knee injury and Pochettino could not confirm the midfielder would play again before the end of the year.
Liverpool FC news: Jurgen Klopp reveals Sadio Mane could feature against West Ham:::::Liverpool forward Sadio Mane could be in line for a surprise recall to the squad for Saturday's trip to West Ham.The Senegal international was expected to be out for six weeks with the hamstring strain sustained in last month's World Cup qualifiers, but has returned sooner and was pictured training with his team-mates on Thursday afternoon.He will not start at the London Stadium but manager Jurgen Klopp has suggested he could be in line for a place on the bench."Sadio looked really, really good," said Klopp."We will see what we do with that."Yesterday it looked like he was ready for 20-25 minutes but we have to wait to see how his body reacts to the session.Obviously he has not lost his ability and skills in the injury break so that is good."Klopp will also make late decisions on midfielder Georginio Wijnaldum (ankle) and defender Dejan Lovren (thigh) but playmaker Philippe Coutinho (adductor) is definitely out.
Southampton boss Mauricio Pellegrino: No extra pressure ahead of Burnley tie:::::Southampton manager Mauricio Pellegrino has played down the importance of beating Burnley ahead of a daunting run of Premier League fixtures.Saints have managed a steady start to the season under the Argentine and are currently 10th in the table having taken 13 points from their opening 10 games.After hosting the Clarets on Saturday, their 10 remaining matches of 2017 include trips to Liverpool, Manchester City, Chelsea, Tottenham and Manchester United, as well as home games against Everton and Arsenal.However, coach Pellegrino does not believe the tricky forthcoming challenges add any extra pressure to take three points at St Mary's this weekend."Not for me, because it is for everyone," he replied when asked if the game was particularly significant for Southampton."We have got points in the last three games and it's another opportunity to keep improving and convert these performances into points."OK, in the future we play against the biggest teams in the Premier League but we don't know (how those games will go)."I'm really happy about that because, for me as a manager, to play against the biggest teams is something that we have to enjoy and I would like to see my players like we played against Man U (a 1-0 loss on September 23), we played really well."You don't know, competition in football, it's an opportunity to show how we are and we have to show every single week."Over-achieving opponents Burnley find themselves in seventh position, three points ahead of Saints.Sean Dyche's Clarets travel to the south coast looking to continue the impressive away form which has already seen them win at Chelsea and Everton and secure draws against Tottenham and Liverpool.Pellegrino believes "outstanding" counterpart Dyche deserves the success he has achieved."I don't know him personally but I know how he has been working in the last few seasons with his team, how they are growing," Pellegrino added."His job is outstanding, thinking about a team that are really humble, working and playing with an identity, it's something that is really difficult to build."It's part of the process, the transition, when you keep the same ideas in the long term always you get results."

Jupp Heynckes Hails 'Dynamic and Powerful' Emre Can Amidst Bayern Munich Links:::::Bayern Munich coach Jupp Heynckes has spoken out on the talent of their former youth player Emre Can as he enters the final stretch of his contract at Liverpool.Can, whose contract with Liverpool expires in the summer, looks set to leave the Reds at the end of the current season, with contract talks reaching an impasse and the German international free to sign for any non-Premier League team on a Bosman in the January transfer window.Michael Regan/GettyImages While Juventus look to be early favourites to pen a deal for the talented midfielder, Bayern would be keen to see the 23-year-old rejoin the Bavarian outfit.Speaking at a press conference ahead of Bayern's game at Borussia Dortmund on Saturday, Heynckes said, via ESPN: "There's always certain criteria when you're signing a player.I only had Emre Can for a few months.He is a good, young player who has developed well - he is dynamic and powerful."Can has been a integral part of Liverpool's midfield so far this campaign, making 14 appearances across all competitions so far this campaign, notching three goals and two assists as Jurgen Klopp's side look to push on form last year's success and push for the league title.CHRISTOF STACHE/GettyImages Heynckes went on to explain how it was vital for Bayern to sign players with the right ability and personality to make the German champions a European superpower once again, saying: "In my opinion, if Bayern want to play a dominant role in the Champions League again, we must have suitable players for every position."The most important thing for me is that the player's footballing concept meets our extremely high level.Not just his physical attributes and speed.There are many factors that play a role and everyone has different criteria.Not to forget, the player's character is important.He must also be a team player with social skills."He doesn't just have to fit on a sporting level.There is 20-24 young people together, they have to get on and respect each other, and their ego has to take a back seat.Therefore, the player's character and behaviour is most important for new signings."While Jurgen Klopp remains hopeful a solution to Can's contract talks can be found soon, the Liverpool boss will have to find a resolution soon or face losing Can to a European side on a pre-contract in January, be it Bayern, Juventus or another potential suitor.
Barcelona vs Sevilla Match Preview: Classic Encounter, Key Battle, Team News & More:::::League leaders Barcelona will look to maintain their four-point La Liga advantage, as Sevilla visit the Nou Camp on Saturday evening.Having been held to a surprise 0-0 draw in Athens versus Olympiacos in the UEFA Champions League on Wednesday night, Ernesto Valverde's men will seek to return to winning ways against their Andalusian opponents.La Blaugrana's draw in Greece was just the second game in all competitions the Catalan giants have failed to win, with their 1-1 draw at the Wanda Metropolitano to Atletico Madrid last month the only other occasion this season, that Barca have dropped points.LOUISA GOULIAMAKI/GettyImages Sevilla arrive on the Spanish coast in fifth spot in the league standings, nine points behind Barcelona.Los Rojiblancos have won just twice in the last five league games, but come into this game on the back of a successful seven days, having beaten Leganes and Russian champions Spartak Moscow in midweek.Frenchman Wissam Ben Yedder has once again become the man to watch this season, with the 27-year-old striker having notched eight goals this campaign.Here is everything you need to know ahead of the clash at the Nou Camp.Classic Encounter Chris Brunskill/GettyImages For their most memorable encounter, we go back to the Uefa Super Cup meeting of two years ago in a nine-goal thriller which Barcelona edged 5-4 in Tbilisi.After Ever Banega had given Jorge Sampaoli's men the lead, Messi scored another signature double before efforts from Rafinha and Luis Suarez either side of the break had given the Catalans a 4-1 lead.In a remarkable turnaround however, goals from Jose Antonio Reyes, Kevin Gameiro and Yevhen Konoplyanka in the space of 24 minutes, took the game to extra-time in the Georgian capital.With the game heading to penalties, Pedro Rodriguez - in his farewell appearance in a Barcelona short before moving to Chelsea - gave the club a moment to remember with the winner in the 115th minute of a classic.Key Battle Ivan Rakitic vs. Steven N'Zonzi Aitor Alcalde/GettyImages With the visitors facing a potential defensive crisis with the absences of Daniel Carrico, Nico Pareja and possibly Clement Lenglet also, Sevilla are set to be stretched this weekend to an even greater degree by the likes of Lionel Messi et el.The responsibility of Steven N'Zonzi in midfield then, serves a role of vital importance for Eduardo Berizzo's men.The Frenchman since his switch from Stoke City in 2015, has gone on to become on of the most consistent performers in Spain and stands as one of the more underrated defensive midfielders in Europe.After Ivan Rakitic was rested on Wednesday with Paulinho lining up against the Greek's, the Croatian is set to return to Valverde's starting XI and will do battle with N'Zonzi.Sevilla's combative midfielder has an eye for pass and aside from men in white's weaknesses in defence, through-balls are one of their definite strengths.For Sevilla to have any chance this weekend, the battle between the two men as out-and-out, box-to-box players could well determine the result in Catalonia this Saturday evening.Team News GABRIEL BOUYS/GettyImages Barcelona are without defender Sergi Roberto after the Spaniard was ruled out for up to five weeks with a hamstring injury.Like Sergi, midfielder Andre Gomes also sustained a problem to high thigh and is month away from a return to action.The trio of Aleix Vidal, Arda Turan and Andres Iniesta are all doubts for the visit of Sevilla, with ankle and thigh problems respectively.The versatile Rafinha is closing on full bill of health after April's meniscus injury, whilst Ousmane Dembele is out until the new year.As documented, Sevilla approach the game with defensive headaches.With Carrico and Pareja absent with groin and thigh complaints, French centre-back Leglent could also miss out with an unknown issue.CRISTINA QUICLER/GettyImages Midfielders Walter Montoya and Joaquin Correa should be passed fit, however Jose Mena Rodriguez is out with a groin injury Potential Barcelona Starting Lineup: ter-Stegen; Semedo, Mascherano, Umtiti, Alba; Rakitic, Busquets, Paulinho; Deulofeu, Suarez, Messi Potential Sevilla Starting Lineup: Rico; Mercado, Kjaer, Lenglet, Escudero; N'Zonzi, Ganso, Banega, Nolito, Navas; Ben-Yedder Prediction Barcelona have been in imperious form this season but on the back of a failure to score in Europe, Sevilla could be in for a backlash this weekend.With the visitors struggling to put out a full-strength back line also, the hosts will be licking their lips in anticipation.JOSEP LAGO/GettyImages The Barca midfield is starting to show its age a touch however, and with the pace of Jesus Navas and Ben-Yedder, coupled with the industry of Banega and the trickery of Nolito on the flank, it may not be all one-way traffic.Valverde's men however will be too much to handle, and should be comfortable winners.Prediction: FC Barcelona 3-1 Sevilla
Arsenal Face Competition From Newcastle & Serie A Giants for MLS Star Miguel Almiron:::::Newcastle United have joined fellow Premier League club Arsenal in the chase for MLS star midfielder Miguel Almiron, according to Italian news outlet CalcioMercato.The 23-year-old, who currently plies his trade with Atlanta United, has taken the American league by storm this season, playing an instrumental role in his side's fourth place Eastern Conference finish, as well as chipping in with nine goals during his 30 appearances.Arsene Wenger Says He Will 'Continue Rotating' After 'Frustrating' Draw Against Red Star Belgrade @callumrc96 https://t.co/RqS7ivkHDN ArsenalPro (@ArsenalPro) November 3, 2017 The Paraguay international, who made his debut in 2015, attracted the attention of many during his national side's Under-23 World Cup win in 2013, impressing the White and Reds' setup so much they awarded him his inaugural cap at the age of 21.It seems Newcastle boss Rafa Benitez is keen to sure up his midfield, particularly with the holes shown in the Tynesiders' drab attacking play during their 1-0 defeat to Burley on Monday in loanee and future permanent signing Mikel Merino's absence.Alongside this, the unreliability of creator Jonjo Shelvey's discipline, something that has already come to fruition so far this term after the Englishman's spat with Dele Alli on the opening weekend, has provided cause for concern for the Spaniard.Belgian Starlet Charly Musonda Set to Leave Chelsea in January Over Lack of Opportunities https://t.co/jp9yUxvVbI ArsenalPro (@ArsenalPro) November 3, 2017 However, Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger is also tempted by Almiron once again, after the north Londoners were previously linked with the Paraguayan during the summer.There were reports that the Gunners were preparing to table a bid in the final moments of the most recent transfer window, however no such actions were taken by the Emirates Stadium hierarchy.Santi Cazorla Reveals Injury Hell That Almost Resulted in His Foot Being Amputated @jamiespencer155 https://t.co/9OhQZYO90e ArsenalPro (@ArsenalPro) November 3, 2017 But the duo of Premier League sides will also have Serie A giants Inter Milan to contend with, who are suspected to be also interested in the 23-year-old.
Borussia Dortmund vs Bayern Munich Match Preview: Classic Encounter, Key Battle, Team News & More:::::The second Der Klassiker of the season takes place this Saturday at Borussia Dortmund's Signal Iduna Park - the same venue where Bayern Munich claimed Super Cup glory in August.Although in recent years this game hasn't proved to be much of a title decider, Borussia Dortmund have been the only team to offer Bayern a consistent challenge for the Bundesliga crown since the days of the great Borussia Mnchengladbach and Hamburger SV sides in the late 70's and early 80's.Here's everything you need to know about Saturday's Der Klassiker.Classic Encounter Alex Livesey/GettyImages With no shortage of classic encounters between the two heavyweights of German football, it seems only fair to look back at the last time Jupp Heynckes faced Borussia Dortmund as the Bayern manager and crowned the Bavarians as the champions of Europe.Jrgen Klopp's Dortmund side showed their class in the opening 45 minutes and peppered the Bayern Munich goal with shot after shot.However, failing to convert their chances allowed Bayern to take the upper hand in the second-half and Mario Manduki put the Bavarians in front with a simple tap-in.Dortmund were then given a lifeline when Brazilian defender Dante clattered into Marco Reus inside the 18-yard box.lkay Gndoan stepped up to take the penalty for die Schwarzgelben and the German midfielder calmly put the ball into the back of the net.Just 90 seconds before the full-time whistle, Arjen Robben became Bayern's hero with a delicate finish beyond the helpless Roman Weidenfeller to secure the Champions League trophy, Bayern Munich ending the 2012/13 season as winners of the treble.Key Battle Robert Lewandowski vs Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang Mike Hewitt/GettyImages The two best strikers in the Bundesliga will go head to head on Saturday with both Robert Lewandowski and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang looking set to battle it out between them to win the Torjgerkanone this season.The two former teammates in Dortmund found themselves at the centre of one of the most exciting goalscoring races last season, with Aubameyang's 31-goal haul preventing his Polish counterpart from becoming the joint second most successful recipient of the goal hunters cannon in Bundesliga history.This season, both strikers are currently sat on 10 league goals each.Aubameyang is, however, edging Lewandowski across all competitions, one extra goal in the DFB Cup the only thing to put the Gabonese forward ahead of Bayern's star man.Team News Alexander Hassenstein/GettyImages For the hosts on Saturday, the only significant team news in the suspension of Dan-Axel Zagadou.The 18-year-old was given his marching orders against Hannover last week and Peter Bosz will be looking to his senior players to fill the boots of Dortmund's impressive youngster.In the Bayern camp, seeing Robert Lewandowski and Thomas Mller return to training will be a huge boost.Jrme Boateng and Kingsley Coman are also both carrying minor knocks, however, the Bayern pair should be involved from the start.Potential Borussia Dortmund Lineup: Brki, Toljan, Sokratis, Bartra, Schmelzer, Weigl, Dahoud, Castro, Yarmolenko, Philipp, Aubameyang.Potential Bayern Munich Lineup: Ulreich, Kimmich, Hummels, Boateng, Alaba, Vidal, Tolisso, Robben, James, Coman, Lewandowski.Prediction PATRIK STOLLARZ/GettyImages Despite their incredible start to the season, Borussia Dortmund have been given a rude awakening in recent weeks and any talk about the possibility of winning the Bundesliga title this season is now nothing more than a whisper.Although Bosz's side shouldn't be on the end of a 4-2 defeat like they were last week, the visiting Bavarians could still have a lot of joy and run out resounding victors.The pressure is on the home side to prevent Bayern Munich moving six points clear at the top of the table and Dortmund will need to show a lot of character if they want to regain some of the pride that has been lost recently.Prediction: Borussia Dortmund 1-2 Bayern Munich
Newcastle Fans Worry as Fan Favourite Picks Up Injury and Will Miss Bournemouth Clash:::::Mikel Merino will miss Newcastle's Saturday afternoon match against Bournemouth and could be ruled out for many more weeks since he has reportedly picked up a serious back injury.The ex-Borussia Dortmund midfielder, who has become the supporters' favourite since arriving at St James Park during this season, was sidelined last week during Newcastle's defeat to Burnley.Newcastle fans when they see that Mikel Merino is missing tonight through a back injury... #NUFC pic.twitter.com/Bh4zJklGKx BetBright (@BetBright) October 30, 2017 After the Turf Moor match, manager Rafa Benitez did not know much about Merino's condition, as he was only able to say: "We have to wait to see.Hell see a specialist and well see how he feels."However, although initially his injury did not seem so alarming, the Shields Gazette has now confirmed that the Spaniard might be needing more time to regain fitness than expected.The report claims that he will run meds during the week but certainly won't be featured this weekend for Newcastle's clash with the Cherries.Friday 13th just became our lucky day!@mikelmerino has this morning completed a permanent switch from @bvb09, signing a five-year deal.#NUFC #NewcastleUnited #premierleague #football A post shared by Newcastle United FC (@nufc) on Oct 13, 2017 at 2:40am PDT Luckily for him, the upcoming Premier League round will be followed by a two-week international break that will allow Merino to recover as much as possible in order to return for the Magpies' away game against Manchester United.The midfielder arrived on a loan from the Bundesliga this year, but his positive performances - he scored once in nine appearances - made him the club's new hero, and Newcastle were quick to secure him with a five-year contract.Rafa Benitez will, therefore, need to find a substitute while Merino recovers: this would be a big chance for ex-Arsenal midfielder Isaac Hayden to mark his 50th appearance with Newcastle and is keen on playing.
Basketball covered in barnacles found in English Channel:::::As a Knicks fan, I often think of terrible shot by Alexy Shved seen above.I believe I finally may have found where the ball ended up.Annie Gilbert, the skipper of a fishing vessel in the south of England, was about 10 miles out into the English Channel on Thursday when she and her husband spotted something floating in the water.Found this floating about 10 miles out,this ball has obviously travelled a long way check out the Goose Barnacles quite pretty pic.twitter.com/LCdEQNAAWy Annie Gilbert (@HappyHooker1157) November 2, 2017 Alexy Shved jokes aside, this is so dang cool.I really cant stop looking at it.Theres an entire ecosystem clinging to the bottom of this lost basketball.In addition to the barnacles, Gilbert also told BBC Radio that there were crabs crawling around on it.She speculated that the ball floated across the Atlantic from the U.S.although Spalding does sell balls in Europeand she let the ball back in the water to reach its final destination.We fished it out of the sea, we took some photos and then we put it back in the sea for it to continue its journey, Gilbert said.[via @seth_rosenthal]
Saints respond to navy veteran who refused team's award:::::The Saints wanted to honor navy veteran John Wells, a disabled veteran who is the executive director of the Military Veterans Advocacy, with the team's Peoples Health Champion Award during last week's game against the Bears.Wells refused the award, calling it "tainted with the dishonorable actions of the NFL and its players."His full statement, per the New Orleans Observer: "Although I am touched and honored to be selected for such an award, the ongoing controversy with NFL players' disrespect for the national flag forces me to decline to participate in the presentation.I am unable, in good conscience, to enter an NFL stadium while this discourtesy prevails.Since this award is tainted with the dishonorable actions of the NFL and its players, I cannot accept it.Wells also spoke to a number of media outlets about his refusal, during which he called the anthem protests a "slap in the face" to the military."The Saints issued a response to Wells' decision and statement with a statement of their own on Thursday night.The full statement can be read here, but it reads, in part: Throughout Mr. Wells media appearances today, he has stated he no longer supports NFL football.That is unfortunate and disappointing considering the New Orleans Saints' unwavering 50-plus year commitment to honor, support and recognize our servicemen and women and veterans.We will not allow Mr. Wells decision and subsequent media appearances to distract our players and organization from continuing to honor and support our military and veterans.We, as an organization, have decided to move on from this sad and divisive discourse and focus our attention on supporting our military and veterans.In lieu of honoring Mr. Wells, we will use the time allotted for the Peoples Health Champion Award to highlight non-political military advocacy programs and encourage our fans and community to join us in contributing to these groups who directly support our military and veterans.Our players have chosen to stand for our National Anthem out of respect for the flag, our servicemen and women and veterans in every game since our inception in 1967 with the exception of one game - the Week Three game at Carolina when a few of our players did sit.We could not be more proud of the work our players do in the community and with our military, arguably a model program in the league.Our players have been clear and steadfast in their support for our military and veterans - not just with their words but with their actions - including visits with the military at home and abroad.Just two days ago, Saints players visited the Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base in Belle Chasse in partnership with USAA's Salute to Service Week.Their support for wounded veterans and their families and other meaningful engagement are normally conducted out of the public eye.The Saints host the Buccaneers on Sunday and said they'll be paying respect to their "military heroes" as they do every week.

Reports Claim Bayern Mnchen Star James Rodrguez Blames Zinedine Zidane for Real Madrid's Poor Form:::::James Rodrguez of Bayern Mnchen has pointed the finger at one person in particular for Real Madrid's poor start to the season.Real Madrid sit third in La Liga, eight points off of leaders Barcelona, and succumbed to a defeat at the hands of Spurs on Wednesday night in the Champions League.The Colombian was loaned out to the German champions in the summer after falling down the pecking order at the Bernabeu.Ian MacNicol/GettyImages Rodrguez started just thirteen league games last season, coming off the bench in nine, but despite getting eight goals and six assists, Zinedine Zidane chose to largely neglect the former Porto star.And according to Spanish outlet Diario Gol, James believes that the Real Madrid manager is to blame for his side's struggles this season.Despite the Frenchman winning back-to-back European Cups, Rodrguez believes the club should have kept Carlo Ancelotti on.Rodrguez struggled in his new spell with Bayern under Ancelotti, but has showed why he was so highly rated years ago since Jupp Heynckes returned from retirement.CURTO DE LA TORRE/GettyImages The 26-year-old has made five Bundesliga appearances - scoring two and assisting one - but admits to having still not adjusted to life in Bavaria."I try to give my all in every training session, in order to show my qualities in our matches.Obviously, I still need to adapt to my new life in Munich," the 2014 World Cup star added, "but it's getting better everyday.I like it here."Rodrguez is on a two-year loan at Bayern, whose next match is on Saturday evening against Borussia Dortmund at the Westfalenstadion.
West Ham vs Liverpool Match Preview: Classic Encounter, Team News, Prediction & More:::::Liverpool visit the Olympic Stadium to take on West Ham for only the second time, hoping to build on their last two victories over Huddersfield and Maribor respectively.The Reds have performed inconsistently so far this season, as they currently sit in sixth place, three points off the top four.Following a disappointing 4-1 defeat against Tottenham two weeks ago, the Reds have bounced back and will be aiming to replicate last season's 4-0 victory over the Hammers.Slaven Bilic has once again come under pressure following a string of poor performances, as his side have only recorded two wins so far this season.Victory against Jurgen Klopp's side may give the Hammers a chance to kick-start their season, but it will be a tough task stopping Liverpool's formidable attack.Classic Encounter Clive Brunskill/GettyImages Back in 2013 when Liverpool were up there as title contenders, Luis Suarez & co took the Hammers apart at Anfield with a ruthless performance.A brace from Suarez, one from Martin Skrtel and an own goal from Guy Demel sent the Reds second in the table, four points off Arsenal at the top.Kevin Nolan's red card summed up the evening for the Hammers, leaving them in a poor position early in the season as they were left just above the relegation zone.Form Bryn Lennon/GettyImages Both sides will see their opening 10 games as somewhat of a disappointment, and will look to this fixture as a platform to build on going forward.Klopp's side know they can perform better, but once again it is the defensive side of their game that continues to let them down.The German took underperforming Dejan Lovren off after his horror show half an hour performance against Spurs, and the Reds have gone on to keep two consecutive clean sheets since.West Ham fans are again calling for more from their team, especially considering the big money signings they made in the summer.Javier Hernandez has been a standout performer, but Marko Arnautovic has been poor following his arrival from Stoke.Team News Michael Regan/GettyImages Liverpool will again be sweating over the fitness of Gini Wijnaldum after the Dutchman suffered yet another injury during his side's 3-0 victory over Maribor in midweek.Dejan Lovren and Philippe Coutinho could come back into the side, but Klopp may opt for a similar side to the one he fielded in the Champions League.All of West Ham's injury concerns come from their defence, with Winston Reid, James Collins and Jose Fonte all out injured.The latter has a slight chance of playing, but whether Bilic will risk him against such a agile Liverpool frontline remains to be seen.Potential West Ham Starting Lineup: Hart, Ogbonna, Kouyate, Zabaleta, Anotnio, Cresswell, Noble, Lanzini, Arnautovic, Hernandez, Ayew Potential Liverpool Starting Lineup: Mignolet, Gomez, Matip, Klavan, Moreno, Henderson, Can, Milner, Salah, Sturridge, Firmino Prediction Ross Kinnaird/GettyImages Liverpool will be full of confidence after scoring six goals and keeping two consecutive clean sheets in their last two games.Wijnaldum is out with an ankle injury, and Coutinho may also drop to the bench, but their fire power against a West Ham side full of injuries in defence will have Klopp thinking of more goals.West Ham have conceded 19 goals already this season, and i'd expect that number to increase by at least two at the end of the game.West Ham 0 - 2 Liverpool Over the next few weeks Ill be teaming up with social betting app BetBull to compete against fellow contributors here at 90min to see who can come out victorious on a number of accumulators.Ill be predicting results from 4 Liverpool league games as well as matches from all over Europe, giving you my insights and opinions as to why I chose those games and results.Liverpool take on West Ham at the Olympic Stadium for only the second time having beaten them convincingly there last season.The Reds will be hoping their wins against Huddersfield and Maribor can spur them on, so Im going for a Liverpool win.West Ham have endured a poor start to their season, and although Liverpools defence has been shaky, I dont think the Hammers will have enough to get past them.West Ham 0-2 Liverpool.I have also gone for Napoli to overcome struggling Chievo, Borussia Monchengladbach to beat Mainz 05, Monaco to beat EA Guingamp and Valencia to continue their fine form against Leganes.And dont forget, download the BetBull app and follow me @Dan.90min to see if my accumulator brings home the money!
Week 9 DFS: Why Devin Funchess hsould be in your lineup:::::With the unfortunate news of Deshaun Watsons torn ACL, this weeks slate is no longer as simple as jam in all the Texans.Here are five things you need to know before locking in your DFS lineups for Week 9.1.The New Orleans Saints and their opponents average 19.8 more combined points per game when the Saints play at home The Saints and their opponents have combined to average 59.3 points per game in the three games in the Superdome this season, but just 39.5 points per game in the four theyve played outside New Orleans.This bodes well for fantasy production all aroundthe games 51.5-point over/under as of this writing suggests as much.What it does not bode well for is the prospects of a Buccaneers defense that is already allowing the second-most schedule-adjusted fantasy points to offenses as a whole.To make matters worse, the Bucs will likely be without their top cornerback, Brent Grimes, who is still nursing a shoulder injury.Feel confident firing up your Saints stacks in tournaments this week.2.Devin Funchess led the Carolina Panthers in market share of air yards, even with Kelvin Benjamin there For fantasy and DFS purposes, not all targets are created equalthe deeper downfield a wide receiver gets targeted, the higher his fantasy-point expectation becomes.With Benjamin traded to the Buffalo Bills, Funchess will assume his more natural position as the teams Z receiver and become a true go-to pass-catcher for Cam Newton.And with Carolina now able to get the speedy Curtis Samuel on the field to stretch defenses in place of the lumbering Benjamin, Funchess might actually have to deal with less defensive attention than he did before.Both this week and going forward, the 6-foot-4, 230-pound Funchess is a good bet for a touchdown, as Benjamins departure opens up another 22% of the teams red zone targets, a portion of which should go to Funchess, on top of the 22% he was already getting.Since Week 3, Funchess has been targeted fewer than eight times only once, and he has an unimposing matchup this week against a Falcons defense ranked 16th in schedule-adjusted fantasy points allowed to wide receivers.Because the Benjamin trade occurred in the middle of the week after DFS salaries had already come out, Funchess is underpriced across the industry.Want more in-depth fantasy football analysis?Click here for a free 7-day trial with our partners at 4for4 Football, home of the most accurate fantasy football predictions since 2010.3.Jack Doyle averages just 0.1 fewer targets per game than league-leading tight ends Rob Gronkowski and Zach Ertz Doyle has been a bright spot in whats been an otherwise luckless season for the Coltsliterally.Though the teams franchise quarterback wont be on the field this season, backup Jacoby Brissett has taken to targeting Doyle, and the tight ends target share, already at an impressive 7.9 per game, is trending upward of late.Doyle has drawn 11 or more looks from Brissett in two of his past three games.Among conventional box score stats, targets per game is the most predictive indicator of future fantasy production at the tight end position.Against a depleted Texans defense ranked 20th in schedule-adjusted fantasy points allowed to tight ends, Doyle is the best dollar-for-dollar tight end play on the slate.4.The Denver Broncos rank 28th in schedule-adjusted fantasy points allowed to tight ends Denvers reputation for having an elite defense is mostly well deserved, but fantasy points are scored in every game.Against the Broncos, theyre disproportionately scored by tight ends.In terms of schedule-adjusted fantasy points allowed, Denver ranks first against running backs, fourth against wide receivers, and against versus quarterbacks, with the 28th-place ranking against tight ends the only kink in their armor.This funneling effect is due to extremely high-level play from their cornerbacks, namely Aqib Talib and Chris Harris.This week theyre not facing just any tight end, but Zach Ertz, who has displayed remarkable consistency this season at a position normally fraught with volatility.Ertz has scored double-digit fantasy points in every game this seasoneven in scoring formats like FanDuels, which awards only half a point per reception.Expect the emerging Carson Wentz to lean on his favorite target yet again this week.Paying up for him could get you the unique roster construction you need to differentiate your lineup from the pack in tournaments.5.Aaron Jones has out-snapped Ty Montgomery, 77% to 22%, since taking over as the Green Bay Packers starting running back If you didnt already know, the two-game primetime slates can be a lot of fun, and this week youre going to want to get Jones in your lineups on that slate.Jones has wrested the starting job away from Montgomery by averaging a stellar 5.58 yards per carry, while Montgomery is stuck on 3.10.In Brett Hundleys first start last week, the team leaned on Jones, feeding him 20 touches on 80% of the snaps.Montgomery managed only five touches on 13% of the snaps.Jones also ranks third on the team with a 15% share of Hundleys targets, which is notable because Montgomery was thought to have the better receiving chops.Expect the Packers to feature Jones again in Lambeau on Monday night against a Lions defense ranked a middling 16th in schedule-adjusted fantasy points allowed to running backs.

UFC 217 card headliners get in some pre-fight barbs:::::The six fighters on UFC 217s main card sat in front of the media and a few fans on Thursday afternoon at Madison Square Garden.Saturday night, theyll shed the suits, sunglasses and sport coats for fighting gear and a pair of gloves to square off during one of the biggest nights in mixed martial arts history.Joanna Jedrzejczyk, Cody Garbrandt and Michael Bisping sat on one side of the stage with their respective championship belts displayed proudly in front of them.Georges St-Pierre, T.J. Dillashaw and Rose Namajunas sat on the other.UFC president Dana White stood at a podium in the middle, serving as the moderator of the press conference.The proceedings, however, lacked Whites moderation.As per usual at a pre-fight presser, the fighters wasted no time to jumpstart the jawing.St-Pierre, regarded as one of the best UFC fighters ever despite spending the last four years away from the octagon, tried to be cordial in his opener.I cant wait [for] Saturday.There is no other place Id rather be than where I am right now.I cant wait.Im back now.Boring!One fan shouted from the back of MSGs theater.Hes one and done!Bisping interrupted.Have you been lifting weights still?Drinking protein shakes?Hey, you got a new suit again!Good for you bro.He continued: Im going to wipe him out Saturday night.Im going to destroy him.Wipe him out, wipe the floor.Bisping (31-7-0) sounded overly confident in his ability to defend his middleweight title against St-Pierre (25-2-0).His remarks in the first two minutes of the press conference set the tone for the duration of the 26-minute discourse.The fighters sporting the belts to Whites right were on the offensive while those to his left took their opponents blows on the chin without much resistance.Take, for instance, when bantamweight title holder Cody Garbrandt (11-0-0) said that his challenger, T.J. Dillashaw (15-3-0), is only here this week for the moneynot to take away his championship.Dillashaw quickly refuted but also turned defensive.I dont understand the animosity coming from him, Dillashaw said.Theres never been any drama on my side, as you can tell.Theres never been any drama from me.Garbrandt and Dillashaw used to be sparring partners as teammates at Team Alpha Male.Bad blood between them finally broke out midway through the event.Garbrandt claimed that he was ready to fight Dillashaw in the Alpha Male locker room one day but the latter backed down.Dillashaw fired back, claiming that Garbrandt went home crying after practice one day.Garbrandt landed the final haymaker.You can do all the conditioning in the world with your new coach, but you cant condition that f------ chin of yours, he said.The theater erupted in a collective gasp.Bisping enjoyed it just as much as the fans.Thats how you do it, Georges, he said.Thats called a back-and-forth.More positive reactions from the crowd ensued as St-Pierre, dressed in a grey and blue suit that Bisping had already poked fun at earlier, sat and took it with a large grinjust as he had all afternoon.Not a word escaped his mouth when Bisping came at him two minutes later, either.You can do all the pushups, protein shakes and back flips you want.You will never beat me in a fight, Bisping said.As for Jedrzejczyk (14-0-0) and Namajunas (7-3-0), it was the title holder who again exhibited more fervor.White was asked if he can envision Jedrzejczyk headlining a UFC event in the future.White said of course, using the fact that if she beats Namajunas, shell tie Ronda Rouseys record of six successful title defenses.If isnt in Jedrzejczyks vocabulary.There is no if, she said.There is no if.We are making history, definitely.I will make history on Saturday.Shes even looking beyond this weekends fight, claiming that she will break Rouseys record and reach seven title defenses next year.The prophesying didnt stop there.I will retire in the future as undefeated.I have this chance.I have this opportunity, and Im going to make this happen, she said.Namajunas only spoke twice, and the latter of the two was the closest she got to a battle of words with Jedrzejczyk.Her banter resembled more of a middle school morals lesson than a pre-fight press opportunity.Everybodys got flaws, Namajunas said.Nobodys perfect.I dont think anybody should act like they are.Despite a lack of rousing ribbings from half of Thursdays participantssave for Dillashaws occasional chirping UFC 217 was labeled one of the best cards in the sports history for what will happen inside the octagon, not for what the fighters blabber into a microphone.Bisping said that his only fear is getting cuddled to death by St-Pierre.Of course, St-Pierre sat and laughed with a grin nearly as wide as his broad shoulders.On Saturday night, dont expect the former welterweight champion to be so kind.
Gabe Kapler; Phillies manager; Howard Eskin; Coconut Oil:::::1.On Thursday, Nov. 2, 2017, sports media hit its all-time low.While Gabe Kapler was introduced as the new Phillies manager, one reporter, Howard Eskin, actually questioned Kapler and Philadelphia GM, Matt Klentak, about Kapler being fit for the job because he once said he used coconut oil to masturbate.Now, let's break this down.If Eskin was trying to go for a cheap laugh, this would've been just fine.Everybody enjoys a good masturbation joke or pun ("Don't knock masturbation.It's sex with someone you love."-- Annie Hall, 1977).However, Eskin was not going for brevity.Think kids that love to follow #phillies are ready to hear his ideas about use of coconut oil.Baseball is a family sport.Dont think parents are on board with hearing this stuff about the manager.https://t.co/kkSQaimgjN Howard Eskin (@howardeskin) November 2, 2017 He was legitimately wondering about whether Kapler was the right man to manage a baseball team because he once said in a blog post, "Youre moisturized and smelling tropical, your teeth are white and your face looks like youve just visited a Beverly Hills plastic surgeon.The sun has set, and the moon is out.Perhaps you have a friend nearby, perhaps its just you by your lonesomewell, this is awkward.Ive promised you authenticity, honesty and openness.Take this how you wish and Ill spare you the step by step.Coconut oil is the worlds greatest lubricant.I cant help where your mind goes with this.Once the ball leaves the bat, I cant steer it.This is my all-time favorite Philly sports media moment: pic.twitter.com/n9CEhKrPzA Kyle Scott (@CrossingBroad) November 2, 2017 OK, yes, there can definitely be some fun had with that statement, but Eskin was basically treating Kapler as if he were a criminal.He couldn't even get the absurd question out in a cohesive manner.Here, verbatim, is how Eskin asked his very important question: "Matt, were there, you expressed that there were no reservations with some of the things you saw, uh, that Gabe had written on his blog and had tweeted.Uh, Im trying to figure out, if, you said there were none.There are none?And as far as Gabe, Gabe, are you proud of some of the stuff you said you express yourself I dont wanna get specific but, uh, people in the room, but theres an elephant in the room, people here.I mean, Coconut oil is a phrase, uh, I throw it out there.Gabe any reservations and Matt any reservations?Gabe for putting it out there and Matt while you were in the interview process."This is my all-time favorite Philly sports media moment: pic.twitter.com/n9CEhKrPzA Kyle Scott (@CrossingBroad) November 2, 2017 So, Klentak said he had no reservations about hiring Kapler over things he had written on his lifestyle blog, yet Eskin asked Klentak if there was none, as if he was incredulous a man could get hired because he liked to whack off with coconut oil.Then, Eskin asked Kapler if he was "proud" of the things he wrote in his blog.Oh, give me a break.The guy was writing a lifestyle blog to help people improve their lives, not a hate manifesto.Then Eskin said Kapler's fondness for self-pleasure with coconut oil is an elephant in the room.Really?REALLY?Are baseball reporters 12 years old?Elephant in the room?How would Eskin react if Kapler had actually done something, you know, wrong?Then it was back to "reservations."THE GUY SAID HE MASTURBATES WITH COCONUT OIL!What does that have to do with being a baseball manager?What does that have to do with making pitching changes, filling out a lineup card and running a clubhouse.He didn't rob a bank.He didn't murder someone.He didn't collude with Russia.He said he uses a specific kind of oil for the times he enjoys being alone.Get a grip, Howard.2.On the newest Off The Board podcast, I interviewed Sports Illustrated Managing Editor, Chris Stone.You may have heard that SI had a cover in 2014 that predicted the Astros would win the 2017 World Series.We discussed how that all came about along with what it means that Sports Illustrated will be going from 37 to 28 issues in 2018, how he would've handled the Jemele Hill situation, his thoughts on how SI staffers should handle social media, running a magazine in the Donald Trump era and more.You can listen below or in these places: iTunes | SoundCloud | Stitcher 3.The Jets beat the Bills, 34-21 last night, to improve to 4-5, so they deserved to have a big dance party.When the whole squads lit...

Wisconsin football: Badgers defense rollling under Leonhard:::::When Jim Leonhard retired from the NFL after the 2014 season, his plan was simple: Move back to Madison.The former Badgers safety, a native of Tony, Wisc., wanted to live in his home state, in the city where hed attended college and met his wife.He planned for a year away from football.That year would be defensive coordinator Dave Arandas third and final season at Wisconsin, and he and Leonhard struck up a bond once the younger man arrived in Madison.Leonhard, who was inducted into Wisconsins Athletic Hall of Fame in the fall of 2015, was interested in the college game and how it had changed in the decade since hed played.Aranda was curious to hear his perspective, and so for an hour or two most weeks, the men watched film together.That season, Wisconsin had the No.2 defense in all of FBS ball, allowing opponents just 268.5 yards per gamenearly eight yards per game fewer than Alabama.Aranda, already a respected coordinator, saw his profile rise further, and after the season, he left for the same job at LSU.Six weeks later, restructuring its defensive staff under new coordinator Justin Wilcox, Wisconsin hired Leonhard to be its defensive backs coach.In a way, it was a happy (if not at all surprising) accident.Leonhard hadnt retired with a plan to look for a coaching job somewhere; hed retired with a plan to return to Wisconsin, and within less than a year, he was hired.When he took the job, he inherited a unit that returned just one starter from the year before; still, the Badgers finished last season with the countrys No.15 pass defense, allowing opponents only 174.3 yards in the air per game en route to the Cotton Bowl and a No.9 ranking in the final AP poll.Again, it was exactly the kind of defense that gets a coordinator hired awaywhich happened in January, when Cal hired Wilcox to replace Sonny Dykes.On to its third coordinator in as many years, Wisconsin opted to promote Leonhard, who was just 34 at the time, rather than look outside.This is definitely not what I had planned, Leonard said last week, gesturing at his office and laughing.Since taking over, Leonhard and Wisconsins defense havent missed a beat.Going into their game this weekend at Indiana, the Badgers are 80 and one of just four undefeated Power 5 teams.Theyre ranked No.9 in the inaugural College Football playoff rankings, which were released Tuesday, a spot thats largely a result of the teams cakewalk of a schedule thus far.Things will get a bit tougher next weekend against Iowa, and Michigan travels to Camp Randall on Nov. 18.That was supposed to be the seasons hallmark game, but the Wolverines less-than-stellar year hurts Wisconsins strength of schedule further.The Badgers finish the year against Minnesota, and they very well might be 120 heading into the Big Ten title gamewhich they havent yet technically clinched but will almost certainly earn a berth in.By avoiding the Big Tens toughest cross-division teams in 2017something entirely out of Wisconsins controlitll be largely in the dark as to its playoff fate until December.Its entirely possible that the Badgers could continue winning and not crack the top four until the final ranking, which means that for now, they must control what they can control: one of the countrys most dominant defenses and an offense that complements it even more than the Badgers offense of a year ago.Sure, the statistics come with a grain of salt considering Wisconsins toughest opponent to date might be Florida Atlanticbut that shouldnt totally discount what the defense has done with such consistency and physicality.Leonhards unit boasts the No.5 defense in the country, allowing opponents just 268.0 yards per game.Its anchored by the run defense, which is also ranked No.5 and has allowed an average of 93.8 yards per game.And against the pass, Wisconsin is the No.15 unit, allowing a perfectly respectable 174.3 yards per game.In addition, the Badgers are averaging 3.5 sacks, good for No.5 in the country, and their defense has scored four touchdowns this year; only Texas has more.Alec James, a senior defensive lineman, says the carousel of coordinators illustrates what a business college football is.But there are positives to the change, he adds.It also shows you different coaching styles, James says.We havent lost a step in our defense over the past four years.Coach Aranda was real cerebral, real quiet in terms of talking to the media and things.Coach Wilcox was more outgoing.He kind of would interact a lot more.Coach Leonhard, hes kind of a mix of both.All four offenses that remain on Wisconsins schedule are in the bottom half of the FBS in total yardage this season.Keeping up the pace its set through two-thirds of the season shouldnt be too tough for the Badgers defense down the stretch, but in Indianapolis, itll get a team just as well-rounded as it is in Ohio State or Penn State.Thats a month away, though, and if this weeks playoff ranking says anything, its that Wisconsin must keep playing at the level it has and stifling opposing offenses to keep the committees respect.It seems more than prepared to do so.
Kante faces late fitness test ahead of Man United game:::::(Reuters) - Defensive midfielder NGolo Kante faces a late fitness test to make Chelseas squad for Sundays Premier League game against Manchester United at Stamford Bridge, manager Antonio Conte said on Friday.Soccer Football - Champions League - Chelsea Training - Cobham Training Centre, London, Britain - October 30, 2017 Chelsea's N'Golo Kante during teaining Action Images via Reuters/John Sibley Kante, who picked up a hamstring injury while on international duty with France in October, has missed Chelseas last six matches in all competitions but has returned to training with the first team.Chelsea have struggled without the influential midfielders defensive cover, conceding 11 goals in his absence, and Conte acknowledged Kantes importance to the team ahead of the weekends clash.Hes progressing well... we also have tomorrow and then Ill take the best decision for him and the team.We are talking about an important player, the Italian told a news conference.Conte added that the clash against second-placed United was a test of character for his men, as they look to reduce the gap between themselves and Jose Mourinhos side to one point ahead of next weeks international break.Fourth-placed Chelsea go into the game on the back of a 3-0 loss at Roma in the Champions League in midweek and Conte said his club were struggling to deal with their problems.If a period is positive, its easy to have confidence.But in this moment when youre struggling its important to show our character, to face the problem in the right way, he said.Im happy to work with my players.In this season, we are struggling a lot.Well see if youre a winner or a loser.Mourinho had told his Chelsea counterpart that his antics in whipping up the crowd during last seasons 4-0 league victory were humiliating but Conte said he respected the Portuguese and expected the same in return.Its not important the relationship.I dont like to speak about other situations.I have respect for the job.Hes an opponent... after the game itll be the same.I have respect for his job... he must have respect for mine.Sundays game will be the sixth time Mourinho takes a team to face his former side at Stamford Bridge as he targets his fourth win in all competitions against Chelsea.

City set the standard for United at Chelsea:::::MANCHESTER, England (Reuters) - Jose Mourinho returns to his old club Chelsea on Sunday with his Manchester United trailing leaders Manchester City by five points and the challenge against the champions will be a major indicator of his teams ability to close the gap.FILE PHOTO: Soccer Football - Champions League - Manchester United vs S.L.Benfica - Old Trafford, Manchester, Britain - October 31, 2017 Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho Action Images via Reuters/Jason Cairnduff/File Photo When City visited Stamford Bridge at the end of September they delivered a statement performance in their 1-0 win, answering many of the doubts about whether they had the defensive soundness to go with their undoubted attacking flair.It was a win - and performance - which suggested that City are capable of playing the kind of tight, disciplined tactical performance that had been lacking at times during Pep Guardiolas first season at the club.United face some different questions in what is their toughest test yet away from home.Mourinhos side were given a gentle start to the season by the fixtures computer with modest opposition for their opening seven games and they took advantage with 21 goals and six wins along with plenty of entertaining football.But in their first challenge against one of the big six, at Liverpool, United went into their shell - clearly under instructions to not allow Juergen Klopps side space and to limit their own forward movement.Debate has raged about whether or not that was an appropriate approach to take at Anfield or whether United should have been more adventurous and tried to exploit the vulnerabilities in Liverpools back line.Mourinho typically dismissed such talk, viewing the draw as a point gained.But a defeat at Huddersfield in his teams next game added to the sense that Uniteds early season momentum had been lost.Last week, though, United came through another test - beating Tottenham 1-0 at Old Trafford and a 2-0 win over Benfica in the Champions League in midweek has helped to dispel any talk of United losing their way.But the challenge against the champions on Sunday is for United to show that they can replicate the confident and businesslike win that City showed a month ago.FRAGILE CHELSEA United wont want to let City, who host Arsenal on Sunday, open up a seven or eight point lead and a defeat would allow Chelsea to move within a point of Mourinhos men.To get three points from their trip to West London, United need to combine the defensive solidity they showed on Merseyside with the ability to carve open Antonio Contes back line.Judging by Chelseas woeful 3-0 loss to Roma at the Stadio Olimpico on Wednesday, United can have some confidence that it will be fruitful to take the game to Contes team.A repeat of last seasons 4-0 mauling in this fixture certainly looks unlikely and Chelseas defence, so solid last season, looks far more fragile.United will need Romelu Lukaku, who Chelsea wanted to re-sign before his move to Old Trafford in the close-season, to get back to the form he showed before his six game barren streak.They will also need his support striker, whether that be Frenchman Anthony Martial or Marcus Rashford, to work closer to him than in the draw with Liverpool where Martial wandered in deep positions leaving the Belgian isolated.At Anfield, Uniteds midfield sat deep and rarely advanced in numbers.Whatever permutation Mourinho sends out to do battle on Sunday will need to be braver in committing to forward positions or countering in numbers.It is a balancing act, of course, as Chelsea possess in Eden Hazard in particular, the means to punish opponents who over-commit.But City showed that perfect balance and if United want to replicate their rivals, they too will need to show a willingness to do more than just frustrate.

South African prosecutors say Pistorius sentence 'shockingly lenient', seek appeal:::::BLOEMFONTEIN, South Africa (Reuters) - South Africas state prosecutors told the Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA) on Friday the six-year sentence for murder handed to Paralympic gold medallist Oscar Pistorius was shockingly lenient and asked for the right to launch an appeal.Pistorius was imprisoned in July last year after being found guilty on appeal of murdering his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp on Valentines Day 2013.The case has attracted worldwide interest.He was not in court for Fridays hearing.Womens rights groups in a country beset by high levels of violent crime against women say Pistorius has received preferential treatment compared to non-whites and those without his wealth or international celebrity status.The athlete was originally convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to five years in jail.That conviction was increased to murder by the SCA in December 2015 and his sentence increased to six years by trial Judge Thokozile Masipa.State prosecutors, led by advocate Andrea Johnson, said the sentence by Masipa was too lenient as the jail term was less than half the minimum 15-year sentence prescribed for murder in South Africa.Johnson said the High Court did not list the substantial and compelling factors for deviating from the 15-year sentence and that Pistorius had not shown remorse for the murder.FILE PHOTO: Olympic and Paralympic track star Oscar Pistorius leaves court after appearing for the 2013 killing of his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp in the North Gauteng High Court in Pretoria, South Africa, June 14, 2016.REUTERS/Siphiwe Sibeko/File Photo There is no true, gut-wrenching remorse, Johnson said.It is shockingly lenient and has accordingly resulted in an injustice, she said, referring to the sentence.Slideshow (3 Images) Lawyers for the gold medallist, known as the Blade Runner for his carbon-fibre prosthetics, say he did not deliberately kill model and law graduate Steenkamp.Barry Roux, lead defence lawyer for Pistorius, said the athlete was suffering from severe and worsening post-traumatic stress disorder over the case.Roux said Masipa had addressed the misperception that Pistorius deliberately killed Steenkamp.Leave to appeal should really not be granted, he said.The court did not set a date for when it would rule on whether the appeal can be heard or not.
Cool Colsaerts charges four shots clear in Turkey:::::BELEK, Turkey (Reuters) - Nicolas Colsaerts has gone more than five years without a tournament victory but the big-hitting Belgian is threatening to turn this weeks $7 million Turkish Airlines Open into a one-man show.FILE PHOTO - Golf - European Tour - Alfred Dunhill Links Championship - St Andrews, Britain - October 6, 2017 Belgium's Nicolas Colsaerts during the second round Action Images via Reuters/Craig Brough The 34-year-old played almost immaculate golf for the second day running on Friday, a second successive 64 helping him charge four strokes clear of the field with a 14-under-par total of 128.Englands Eddie Pepperell returned a 66 to climb into second position on 132, one ahead of Thailands Kiradech Aphibarnrat (67).It was Colsaerts, however, who stole the spotlight although he acknowledged that he had to work a bit harder in his second round than he did on Thursday.Yesterday it was kind of eyes closed and everything kind of falling in my lap, he told reporters at the Regnum Carya Golf and Spa Resort, which overlooks the Mediterranean.Today it was actually more satisfying to shoot the same score but having to go and find it a little bit more.I recovered well every time I hit a bad shot so I guess that was a key.I wasnt quite as good off the tee, I thought, but I still played some great shots into the greens.RYDER CUP Colsaerts has won twice on the European Tour, at the 2011 China Open and the 2012 World Match Play Championship in Spain, and said he would be taking nothing for granted over the weekend.If Im capable of going 14-under in two rounds then somebody else, or a few other guys, are capable of doing the same, he explained.There are a lot of great players playing in this tournament.Im just going to try to keep playing the way Ive been playing the last two days.Probably not get ahead of myself and see where that takes me.Sharing fourth place on 134 were English pair Matthew Southgate and Matthew Fitzpatrick, Irelands Shane Lowry and Scot Stephen Gallacher.World number six Justin Rose, the highest-ranked player in the field, was on 135 after carding a 68.I didnt play particularly well, the Englishman said.The short game kept me in it a few times early on the front nine and on the back nine I couldnt quite capitalise on the couple of chances I had.The last few holes are pretty tricky here.Youve got to play good golf coming in.Eighth-ranked Henrik Stenson of Sweden has struggled for form and is tied 62nd on 144.Englands Tommy Fleetwood, the runaway money-list leader, was on 141.

Lionel Messi As Great As Diego Maradona: Lothar Matthaus:::::What does Diego Maradona have that Lionel Messi does not?Why, a World Cup, of course!But does that make Messi any less great than Maradona?"Not for me," Germany's World Cup winning captain Lothar Matthaus told NDTV."Maybe for the people of Argentina, yes.But for me Lionel Messi is as great as Diego Maradona."Matthaus, who famously man-marked Maradona in the 1986 FIFA World Cup final, said, "People still ask me about not winning a Champions League title in my career, but I live with it.It's okay.Not winning a World Cup may take a little bit of sheen away from Messi's career, but not very much.I can live without winning the Champions League, he will also be able to live without winning a World Cup."Messi though happens to be the German's favourite player at the moment."I cannot tell you who is the better player, Messi or Ronaldo.But I can tell you I prefer Messi's style of playing, specially his dribbling.But that doesn't mean he is the better player.Both of them score 50-60 goals every year and it is unfair to one if I name the other."But Matthaus doesn't feel either Argentina or Portugal are likely to impress in the World Cup in Russia next year."Germany are looking good to defend our title.We are hungry to win that Cup again.But you never know.Brazil, Spain and Italy could be threats in my opinion," Matthaus signed off.
Ranji Trophy: Himachal Fights Back After Ashok Dinda's Five Wicket Haul:::::Himachal Pradesh staged a brilliant fightback following-on after Ashok Dinda grabbed a five-for in a superb pace bowling display along side Mohammed Shami before the visitors reduced the deficit to six runs against Bengal in a Ranji Trophy Group D match, on Friday.In reply to Bengal's 419, Himachal, the Group D leaders, were bundled out for 206 in their first innings with Dinda grabbing 5/61 and complemented well by Shami (3/94) as the hosts enforced a follow-on in the first session.Bengal, however, could not capitalise on their big 213-run first innings lead on an innocuous Eden wicket as Himachal ended the penultimate day at 207 for 2 when bad light stopped play in 58 overs.Brief Scores: Bengal 419 vs Himachal Pradesh 206 in 56.2 overs (Sumeet Verma 64, Priyanshu Khanduri 52; Ashok Dinda 5/61, Mohammed Shami 3/94) and f/o 207 for 2 (Prashant Chopra 81, Priyanshu Khanduri 67 batting, Nikhil Gangta 43 batting).-Ton-Up Akshdeep Nath Puts UP In Command vs Delhi- Akshdeep Nath struck his second first-class hundred, a rather timely one, to put Uttar Pradesh in a strong position after they took a slender first-innings lead against Delhi on day three of the Ranji Trophy Group A on Friday.During the fag end of the day, there was a security breach at the ground as a man in an allegedly inebriated state, drove onto the pitch before being detained by the security personnel.In the match, in response to UP's 291, Delhi could only get to 269 after resuming the day at 228 for six with overnight batsman Dhruv Shorey running out of the partner to miss out on a deserving hundred by two runs.In the second innings, Delhi had UP on the mat at 21 for four before Nath (batting 110) and Rinku Singh (64) forged a potentially match-winning stand of 108 runs to steer to their team to 224 for seven at stumps on day three, leading the oppostion by 246 runs.Brief Scores UP 291 and 224/7 in 63 overs (Akshdeep Nath batting 110, Rinku Singh 64; Ishant Sharma 3/38).Delhi 269 in 87 overs (Dhruv Shorey 98; Saurabh Kumar 4/87).-Siddesh Lad, bowlers put Mumbai in command vs Odisha- Siddesh Lad's strokeful 117 and the bowlers' fine performance put Mumbai in the driver's seat against Odisha at the end of the third day in a Ranji Trophy Group C match on Friday with the hosts struggling at 93 for 4 in pursuit of 413 for victory.Lad's ton, studded with 17 fours and one six, enabled Mumbai post a second innings total of 268 for 9 declared before the bowlers took over.Resuming at the overnight 58 for 3, Mumbai lost wickets in the space of less than 30 runs including that of captain Aditya Tare.However, Lad and veteran Abhishek Nayar, who came together at 85 for 6, arrested the slide.Lad, who looked to mix aggression with defence, added 57 runs with Nayar and another 76 runs with Akash Parkar (21) to revive his team.A ninth-wicket partnership of 42 runs with Shardul Thakur rubbed salt into Odisha's wounds and extended the lead beyond the 400-mark.Brief scores: Mumbai 289 all out in 99.5 overs (Prithvi Shaw 105) and 268 for 9 declared in 71 overs (Siddesh Lad 117, Prithvi Shaw 46, Suryakant Pradhan 3 for 106) vs Odisha 145 all out in 50.5 overs and 93 for 4 in 29 overs (Govind Poddar 48 batting, Akash Parkar 2 for 9)
Usain Bolt Should Have Retired Earlier: Michael Johnson:::::"My advice to Usain would've been to retire earlier," four time Olympic champion sprinter Michael Johnson told NDTV."He should have retired perhaps after his three golds at the Rio Olympics last year.The thing is, Usain had been speaking about retirement for sometime, which means it was on his mind.If it's on your mind means you've lost your motivation to compete, and you're also susceptible to injuries because you've lost your focus," added Johnson.Bolt, the world's fastest man, retired after this year's World Championships in London, where he won only one medal - a bronze in the 100m.The Jamaican had chosen not to run the 200m, and hobbled his way through the last race of his career, the 4x100m relay, which he was unable to complete."But that doesn't take anything away from Usain's career," Johnson said."People ask me, who is the next Bolt, and I tell them, nobody.There cannot be another Bolt.There was none like him before him, and there will none like him now.Of course there will be someone who dominates the 100m, and 200m, but will that person be like Bolt?No."Johnson also spoke about the crisis that track and field currently sees itself in, and that's way deeper than dealing with Bolt's absence from the sport."I think we have lost out on a lot of fans and credibility in the sport," the former 200m and 400m world record holder told NDTV."There are multiple issues, but these are three crisis areas in my opinion.One, because of the increasing number of doping offences, we have lost huge credibility, and fans have lost their faith.Second, the sport has done zero marketing to update and revamp itself for younger audiences, and hence encourage the youth to take up the sport.And third, how the former President (Lamine Diack) had to leave because of multiple corruption cases.So athletics sees itself in a lot of trouble for sure.But is it the end of the road?I don't think so."Johnson also spoke about the #takeaknee protests gathering in the US, with athletes protesting against police crimes and racism in the country."What we forget is that athletes are also humans, and they're entitled to opinions and free speech like everyone else, at least in America.We somehow tend to think that athletes are just around to play a sport and entertain us.If they're entitled to free speech, they must use it, and use it in any way they like," he said.
Banned S Sreesanth To Approach Supreme Court:::::Tainted former India cricketer S Sreesanth on Friday said he would approach the Supreme Court in a last-ditch effort to lift the life ban imposed on him by the BCCI following allegations of spot-fixing during an IPL match in 2013."That is the only option left with me, to approach the Supreme Court.At the end of the day, my life, except cricket is going really well.I will fight for my right.It is not just about playing for the country, but it is about getting the respect back," Sreesanth told PTI.Sreesanth said he has been very quiet for the four-and-a-half years and felt it was high time for him to speak his mind."That is why I have opened up and started to speak.It is just the beginning and there are more things to come," he added.Sreesanth also clarified that he did not make any allegations against BCCI's Anti-Corruption and Security Unit."All I said was that there were 13 accused and why they were treated differently.This is the only thing I asked.I never asked to reveal their names.More than anyone else, I know much better about it because I was the one who had undergone the toughest possible time," he said."It is very easy to say he has done it, he has not done it but then one has to back it up with proof and show to the world.BCCI can keep making comments but at the end of the day people are not fools," he added.Sreesanth was banned for life following allegations of spot-fixing during an IPL match in 2013.
Paris Masters: World No 1 Rafael Nadal Withdraws With Knee Injury:::::World number one Rafael Nadal pulled out of the Paris Masters on Friday before his quarter-final with a knee injury.The Spaniard, who had his right knee strapped during his third-round win on Thursday, said he wanted to try and be ready to face Filip Krajinovic in the last eight but that "it wasn't possible to play".He did not say if he would be fit to play at the World Tour Finals in London later this month."Yesterday (Thursday), the pain was very strong but it was not the moment to stop," Nadal told a press conference."I had treatment last night to try and be able to play today...But unfortunately, it was impossible for me to return to the court in the same condition as last night.It is a sad day for me."The 31-year-old became the oldest man to secure top spot in the end of season rankings when he beat Hyeon Chung in his opening match on Wednesday.Nadal has fought back this year from a series of knee problems, winning the French and US Open titles.But he allayed fears this would lead to another lengthy spell on the sidelines after injury-plagued campaigns saw him fail to reach a Grand Slam semi-final in 2015 and 2016."I had a long year, a lot of matches.I pushed the body," Nadal added."We are at the end of the season.It's normal that this kind of things happens.The knee is always, you know, bothering a little bit, but sometimes it's worse, and now is a little bit worse."He called the trainer to have his knee taped after the second set of his last-16 win over Pablo Cuevas, before insisting he would be fit to play at the season-ending event in London.But the 16-time Grand Slam champion then ended his bid for a first Paris Masters title, a serious blow for a tournament which is already missing the likes of Roger Federer, Andy Murray and Stan Wawrinka.If Nadal pulls out of the Tour Finals, it would leave Federer as the only member of the 'Big Four' in the year-ending event."I'm going to do my treatment, do my best to be playing in London, but I cannot talk about that now because (it) is a day that is tough enough for me to pull out from here," he said."For me, it's not about London.For me, it's about the longer term."And longer term I'm going to do the treatment I believe that (is) going to be safer and more important to keep playing tennis as long as possible."World number 77 Krajinovic, who had never been past the second round of a Masters tournament before, now progresses to his first ATP semi-final of the season against either Juan Martin del Potro or John Isner on Saturday."I did not expect this at all, I was ready to play but then I heard he had pulled out," said the Serb."I'm going to enjoy today and then see how it goes tomorrow (Saturday)."
Steve Smith Likens Tennis Great Roger Federer to Aussie Legend Mark Waugh:::::Australia captain Steve Smith on Thursday likened Grand Slam champion Roger Federer to former Australian captain Mark Waugh.Calling Waugh his favourite cricketer, Smith said Federer and Waugh shared similar qualities in their respective sports."I kind of liken him a bit to Mark Waugh, who was my favourite cricketer growing up.He just made everything look so easy and effortless.I see similarities in the way that those two go about their business in the respective sports.I think he'd be very stylish and just make it look easy", Smith was quoted as saying by ESPNCricinfo.Smith also stressed on how tennis helped him adapt to his game, learning the nuances of the sport and applying it to cricket."I loved playing tennis and I still love tennis.I watch it quite a lot.Roger Federer is my favourite, which is pretty well documented, but I always loved playing growing up.It was a way to be competitive", he said.Earlier, Smith refuted claims suggesting that he has too much say in selection of teams in Australia.The Australian captain dismissed talk of "picking my mates" and called it "absolute garbage".Smith came under heavy scrutiny after veteran batsman Ed Cowan was dropped in favour of Daniel Hughes in New South Wales' opening Sheffield Shield game.The call to elevate Hughes raised eyebrows and questions were asked over Smith's influence with national team selection.
Asia Cup Hockey: India Women's Team Stun Japan 4-2, Enter Final:::::The Indian women's hockey team continued its splendid run and came up with an overall performance to stun defending champions Japan 4-2 in the semi-final of the Asia Cup hockey tournament, on Friday.Goals from Gurjit Kaur (7th, 9th minutes), Navjot Kaur (9th) and Lalremsiami (38th) ensured India's entry into Sunday's final where they will face China.India had earlier defeated an unpredictable China 4-1 in the league stage of the tournament.Against Japan, the Indians got off to a rollicking start by earning back-to-back penalty corners to put pressure on the host nation.Drag-flicker Gurjit Kaur gave India a 1-0 lead in the seventh minute when she improvised the injection to send the ball past Japanese goalkeeper Akio Tanaka.Two minutes later, Navjot Kaur doubled India's lead when she struck a field goal from a perfect assist by forward Vandana Katariya.Almost immediately, India won a penalty corner and Gurjit was yet again on target as she gave India a commanding 3-0 in no time.India won another penalty corner in the first quarter but this time Tanaka made a fine save.While the first 15 minutes belonged to India, the defending champions made a strong comeback in the second quarter.Japan unleashed a well-coordinated attack on the Indian defence and found space for Shiho Tsujii to score past Indian custodian Savita in the 17th minute.The next few minutes saw India's defence put to test by the Japanese.Yui Ishibashi gave India jitters when she scored another field goal to close the gap to 2-3 in the 28th minute.From there on, the Indians were needed to play cautiously and not make impulsive decisions.This was exactly what they did after the 10-minute break at halftime.While Savita made a brilliant save to deny Japan from a penalty corner at the start of the third quarter, Lalremsiami scored a sensational field goal in the 38th minute to extend India's lead to 4-2.The final 15 minutes of the match continued to remain tense as Japan won two penalty corners but Savita stood like a rock in front of the goal to deny the hosts.
Man Drives Car Onto Pitch During Ranji Trophy Match, Gautam Gambhir, Ishant Sharma Left Amazed:::::It cannot get any more bizarre than this and this probably would be the first such case on a cricket field.On Friday, the Air Force ground in Palam saw a man driving his car onto the pitch in what can be termed as a major security breach during the Ranji Trophy match between Delhi and Uttar Pradesh as players from both the sides along with officials were left dumbfounded.International players like Gautam Gambhir, Ishant Sharma and Rishabh Pant were present on the ground when the incident took place.A picture has emerged of the incident where Gambhir, Ishant and Manan Sharma were seen standing with the car parked on the centre of the 22-yard strip.The BCCI will be seeking a report from their affiliated unit Services Sports Control Board (SSCB) about the incident.At around 4:40 pm, 20 minutes from close of play, a silver grey Wagon R suddenly drove onto the field of play with Uttar Pradesh batting in their second innings.The man, who identified himself as Girish Sharma, tried to swerve his car twice on the 22-yard strip before stopping, an eyewitness told PTI.It was learnt that the main gate of the Air Force ground, which only allows entry of cars after proper checking remained open with security not in position.This allowed the man free access inside the complex and instead of moving towards the designated parking lot, which is behind the main pavilion, he drove straight towards the field of play, leaving everybody in a state of shock.The security personnel at the ground swung into action after this and closed the gate in order to stop the man from fleeing.He was then detained for questioning by the Delhi Police.BCCI acting president CK Khanna told PTI: "The BCCI will enquire into the incident.The relevant department will get in touch with the Services Sports Control Board as this is a matter of serious concern."This is a breach of security measure at the Services Sports Control Board (SSCB) ground.Imagine if the man had any sinister motive, then lives of international cricketers could have been in danger," Khanna added.Delhi team manager Shankar Saini, who was present at the ground said: "Thank God, nothing untoward happened.There was a possibility that it could have been more serious."The allegedly inebriated man was first detained by the Air Force Police before being handed over to the Delhi Police for interrogation.However, as per senior Delhi Police official, none of the involved parties lodged a formal complaint against the intruder."No formal complaint has been lodged.Preliminary investigations suggest that the Airforce security guard was not present at the gate.We have detained the man identified as Girish for questioning.He is around 30 years old and claimed that he works in a private firm.He seemed mentally disturbed," a senior Delhi Police official told PTI.A DDCA official present at the ground said: "The man looked a complete mess.He was driving the car wearing a lungi.In fact, when he was being bashed up for his act, he hardly reacted.He did not look in perfect mental health."Although the match is being held at the Services' home ground, the host of this particular match is Delhi & Districts Cricket Association (DDCA).The Services is only the facilitator as they are providing the ground for the game.The match was supposed to be held at Feroz Shah Kotla but with India's T20 game against New Zealand being held on November 1, the match was shifted to the Airforce ground.(With PTI inputs)
India vs New Zealand: Ish Sodhi Opens Up About Plans To Halt The Virat Kohli-Led Side's Momentum:::::Kane Williamson-led New Zealand are 0-1 down in the three-match T20I series after losing the first game to India by 53 runs at Feroz Shah Kotla.In a pre-match press conference, New Zealand leg-spinner Ish Sodhi spoke about how well the visitors have performed in the recently concluded three-match ODI series and also the first T20I at Delhi.However, Sodhi feels that the key to bouncing back in the series with full force is to slow down India's momentum."I think we put up a fantastic performance in Mumbai (in the first ODI of the three-game series lost by the visitors 1-2) and played pretty well for that win.I think the second game is the only one we kind of struggled with.But the third ODI was a fantastic game and I think we chased extremely well.We showed that we can play spin a lot better than sides that have come here in the past," said Sodhi.Indian openers Rohit Sharma and Shikhar Dhawan scored brilliant half-centuries in the first T20I and stitched together a record 158-run partnership to give the hosts a solid start.Commenting on how the partnership proved to be a key moment in the game, Sodhi said that their batting set up the momentum for the rest of the game."T20 cricket is all about momentum and I think they (India) put on a good partnership at the start (a record 158 runs between openers Shikhar Dhawan and Rohit Sharma) that set up the momentum for the rest of the game.I think that's just about recognising those key moments and how we can slow their momentum down," the right-arm spinner pointed out.The Kiwis aim to win the second T20I at Saurashtra Cricket Association Stadium, Rajkot in order to keep the series alive."Every game we play, we try to put on our best performance and try to win for our country and we're going to approach the same way.We'll come to the ground tomorrow, have a look at the wicket, distinguish how we're going to play and hopefully combat the conditions well enough to come out on top.Being 0-1 down in a series is always tough, but it's two games to come and we'll have to give our best shot," said the Indian-origin cricketer.Sodhi was part of the Black Caps squad that came for the World T20 Championship last year and had also spent quite a bit of time prior to the series by touring India with the New Zealand A squad."I'd like to think that I've improved a lot since the last time I came here.Generally, the driving force is trying to improve and I got 2 for 25 the other day.It's been nice to spend extra time here with the A team, so the acclimatisation has been a lot easier since the last time I was here," he said."Regardless of the team we put out, I think we're really lucky with the resources to take on most conditions in the world and hopefully we'll do that tomorrow," Sodhi commented on the visitors' batting order.(With PTI inputs)
Axar Patel Reveals How Indian Spinners Countered Ross Taylor And Tom Latham's Sweep Shots:::::Axar Patel, who has been a part of the Indian limited-overs squad for quite some time, revealed how the Indian spinners had planned against the dangerous duo of Ross Taylor and Tom Latham as New Zealand resorted to the sweep shot to nullify any advantage that the spinners got in home conditions.While the ploy worked to perfection in the first of three-match ODI series where both Taylor and Latham had stitched together a 200-run match winning partnership, it didn't come off in the remaining matches as India won the ODI series 2-1.The hosts maintained their winning momentum by winning the first of the 3-match T20I series and the visitors need to act accordingly with the Indian spinners altering their length along with subtle variations that is making life difficult for the Kiwis.After losing the first ODI against New Zealand in Mumbai, where Latham repeatedly played the sweep shot against Kuldeep Yadav, the Indian team changed its ploy bring in Axar, which worked for the Men In Blue."They played the sweep (shot) well in the first game.We knew that against spinners that was the strategy they will adopt and we formalised our strategy as per that by changing the angle by bowling over and round the wicket (in turns)," said Axar at the pre-match conference, who plays for Gujarat in the Ranji Trophy.Axar also added that skipper Virat Kohli has given him the freedom and confidence to bowl as he wants to.The 23-year-old, however made it clear that he does not consider himself as a substitute of Ravindra Jadeja in the limited overs format and will "automatically" get selected if he is doing well.The left-arm spinner, who has been preferred over seasoned pro Jadeja has played 8 ODIs since August taking 10 wickets and more importantly has been economical in most of the games."I have got a place in the team and that's why I am playing.I am of the view that if I do well in one game, I will automatically be picked in the next match," Axar told mediapersons at the pre-match conference."The captain backs you when you do well.I have been playing from the second ODI.He gives me the freedom to bowl what I want to.He leaves it to us (him and Chahal) to decide on what to do.He says if that plan doesn't succeed even then I will back you, which gives us confidence to bowl with a free mind," said the lanky left-arm orthodox, who had splendid figures of 2 for 20 in four overs in the first T20 International in Delhi.Chief coach Ravi Shastri was also a left-arm spinner but his advice to Axar has been more on the mental aspects of the game."He knows my bowling style is different from his.He always says "you know how to bowl and that's why you are in the team and you continue to do that".He says all that is mind game, how to handle situations under pressure.He gives me small tips."He has always been assigned a specific role by the team management -- to contain runs and he has done that with a fair amount of success."My role is the same.The wrist spinner (Yuzvendra Chahal in this case) gets turn on most wickets and his role is to attack more and try to take wickets in middle overs.Finger spinner's aim is to contain from one end.If pressure is put from both ends, there are more chances of getting the wickets," said Axar.While he plays Ranji Trophy for Gujarat and IPL for Kings XI Punjab, the Rajkot Stadium (Saurashtra's home ground) has been like a second home for him."Obviously, it's my home ground and I have some idea about how the wicket will behave from my experience playing IPL over here.There is not much turn on offer but it's skiddy and there's some bounce.I know how to bowl here," he added.(With PTI inputs)
Ashish Nehra Gets Warm Message From Shoaib Akhtar, Twitterati React With Delight:::::Veteran India pacer Ashish Nehra called time on his 18-year career on November 1 by playing his last match in competitive cricket against New Zealand at the Feroz Shah Kotla in New Delhi.After the match, which India won by 53 runs, Nehra received a grand farewell not only from his teammates but cricketers worldwide.Former Pakistan seamer, Shoaib Akhtar is the latest cricketer to heap praise on the 38-year-old Indian and said that it was nice playing against him.Taking to Twitter, Shoaib Akhtar wrote, "1 of the nicest guy & honest fast bowler has retired from INTL cricket.A Nehra it was pleasure playing against u #Cheers fella#" 1 of the nicest guy & honest fast bowler has retired from INTL cricket .A Nehra it was pleasure playing against u #Cheers fella# Shoaib Akhtar (@shoaib100mph) November 2, 2017 Following his tweet, fans agreed with what the former right-arm bowler had to say about Nehra.How heartwarming is it to see players appreciating others crossing each and every border...may this world progress to a peaceful place..

India Vs New Zealand, 2nd T20I, Preview: Hosts Look to Clinch Series, Kiwis Eye Comeback:::::Team India, after thumping New Zealand in the first T20 International of the three-match series, will look to wrap up the contest in the second T20I clash in Rajkot on Saturday.However, the Men in Blue can't be complacent and would be wary of a fight back by the Kiwis.Riding on powerful knocks by openers Rohit Sharma and Shikhar Dhawan in the first match in Delhi, India strolled to a 53-run victory after restricting the visitors to 149/8 in their run chase after 20 overs.India had posted a big 202/3 in their 20 overs after a record-breaking 158-run partnership between Sharma and Dhawan.The win was India's first-ever over the Kiwis in the shortest form of the game.The 2007 World T20 champions have produced impressive death bowling with Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Jasprit Bumrah leading the pace department, while the spinners also pitched in with some excellent bowling in the middle overs.Considering the immense all-round strength that the hosts boast of, it's going to be a Herculean task for the Kane Williamson-led New Zealand to prevent India from surging to a third T20I series victory in eight contests, going back to 2012-13, three of which were drawn encounters.The last game is scheduled at Thiruvananthapuram on November 7.The Indian top order batting, with superb stroke-makers in Dhawan, Sharma and skipper Virat Kohli, has to be tamed early if New Zealand hope to carry on the fight till the series-ending game.The Black Caps' new ball attack of Trent Boult and Tim Southee lacked discipline in Delhi as they had failed to stop the Indian openers.It's a bit of a surprise that these two experienced Kiwi bowlers have been ineffective with yorkers at the death, unlike the Indian duo of Bumrah and Bhuvneshwar."We were outplayed in all the areas, fielding included, which is something we pride ourselves on and something we need to be much better at in Twenty20 cricket," Williamson had said after the Delhi loss.Kohli has led the team from the front and is himself fast approaching the 2000-run landmark in T20Is.If the top batsmen fall cheaply, there are others spearheaded by former captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni to come to the home team's rescue.In slow bowling too leggie Yuzvendra Chahal has continued to trouble the Black Caps' batsmen, in particular captain Williamson and senior pro Ross Taylor who is unable to read the twirl on the ball off the wrist spinner's hand.Only the left-handed Tom Latham, among the visiting team's batsmen, has shown a consistently sound and effective approach against the spin bowlers.India had clinched back-to-back wins in the last two games of the 50-over ODI rubber for a 2-1 verdict in their favour and they will need to come out with something out of the box to keep the rubber alive.Incidentally, this would be the second T20 International to be played at this venue on the outskirts of the city which was the home venue of IPL side Gujarat Lions earlier this year.The first one was against Australia in October, 2013, won by the home side.It has also hosted two ODIs at this stadium - in 2013 and 2015 - and in both these games India ended up on the losing side against England and South African respectively.It became a Test venue last season when India played against England.Teams India: Virat Kohli (capt), Rohit Sharma, Jasprit Bumrah, Yuzvendra Chahal, Shikhar Dhawan, Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Shreyas Iyer, Dinesh Karthik, Kuldeep Yadav, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Mohammed Siraj, Manish Pandey, Hardik Pandya, Axar Patel, KL Rahul.New Zealand: Kane Williamson (capt), Todd Astle, Trent Boult, Tom Bruce, Colin de Grandhomme, Martin Guptill, Matt Henry, Tom Latham, Henry Nicholls, Adam Milne, Colin Munro, Glenn Phillips, Mitchell Santner, Ish Sodhi, Tim Southee.(With PTI inputs)
Steve Smith Terms Claims Of Favouritism In Team Selection As 'Absolute Garbage':::::Steve Smith fired back at critics who claim that he has too much say in selection of teams in Australia.The Australian captain dismissed talk of "picking my mates" and called it "absolute garbage".Smith came under heavy scrutiny after veteran batsman Ed Cowan was dropped in favour of Daniel Hughes in New South Wales' opening Sheffield Shield game.The call to elevate Hughes raised eyebrows and questions were asked over Smith's influence with national team selection but the Australia skipper strongly refuted such claims."I'm not a selector, but I certainly speak to the selectors a lot and express my views," Smith was quoted as saying by cricket.com.au."All this rubbish about me picking my mates, it's absolute garbage.I certainly don't agree with that.""People can say what they like," he said."I'll read it, but it doesn't bother me.I'll just get on with it."The likes of former Test pacer Rodney Hogg, former Tasmania paceman Brett Geeves and former Victoria wicketkeeper Darren Berry alleged that the Australian captain was getting his way after his "mate" Nic Maddinson was picked in the New South Wales squad."Smith shouldn't be a selector," Hogg told SEN. "We saw Maddinson get selected, (he's) a mate, he's one of Steve Smith's mates.You can't pick bloody mates."I think the captain's getting his own way."Smith shot back at his critics, saying, "People can say what they like," he said."I'll read it, but it doesn't bother me.I'll just get on with it."

Josh Hazlewood Urges Nathan Coulter-Nile To 'Crack Open' England Batsmen:::::Josh Hazlewood is expected to lead the Australian new-ball attack vs England in the Ashes.Josh Hazlewood is expected to lead the Australian new-ball attack vs England in the Ashes.AFP Josh Hazlewood is hoping fellow pacer Nathan Coulter-Nile can "crack open" England's batsmen and "create a few scars in their top order" ahead of the first Ashes Test starting on November 23.England start their Ashes tour on Saturday (November 4) with a two-day match against a Western Australia XI side, captained by Coulter-Nile, in Perth.Coulter-Nile was sidelined from Western Australia's Sheffield Shield game against NSW in Sydney, and will instead get a chance against the English tourists in the two-dayer.Hazlewood, who is expected to lead the Australian new-ball attack with Mitchell Starc and Pat Cummins in the Ashes series opener in Brisbane later this month, told Coulter-Nile to go after the tourists' batsmen."Maybe he can crack open a few guys early and create a few scars in their top order and middle order," Hazlewood told reporters late Thursday."It's disappointing he's not playing in the Shield game against us but he's obviously had injuries in the past few years so they're easing him back into it."The injury-jinxed Coulter-Nile bowled 15 overs in the opening Shield round last week in his first first-class game in more than two years.Coulter-Nile took three for 18 from six explosive overs for WA as Tasmania were skittled for 63 in last week's Shield match in Perth."That top order, it will be their first real hit-out in Australia and to have a guy like Coults there to warm them up and to maybe create a few scars, would be nice," Hazlewood said."Obviously their plan is to jump straight into it on the bounciest and quickest wicket and get used to conditions that way."Hazlewood said an Australian Test pace attack comprising Starc and Cummins would be a handful for England in the first Test in Brisbane, where the wicket traditionally rewards fast bowlers with bounce and movement off the pitch."They're not going to fear me or (off-spinner) Nathan (Lyon) but the other two guys obviously put fear into the batsmen," Hazlewood said."That's part of their game, bowling fast and bowling short on occasions."(With AFP Inputs)
Paris Masters: Rafael Nadal Beats Pablo Cuevas to Reach Quarter-Finals:::::World number one Rafael Nadal on Friday overcame a second-set blip to reach the Paris Masters quarter-finals with a 6-3, 6-7 (5/7), 6-3 victory over Uruguayan Pablo Cuevas.The Spaniard, 31, had sealed the year-end number one spot for a fourth time on Wednesday, but he was made to work hard by an enterprising Cuevas.Nadal is looking for his maiden title on the Bercy hard courts, which would take him clear of Novak Djokovic with a record 31st Masters triumph.The 16-time Grand Slam champion will take on world number 77 Filip Krajinovic in the quarters, after the Serb beat Nicolas Mahut 6-2, 3-6, 6-1."You don't expect to win easy in big tournaments like these ones," said Nadal, who had his right knee strapped after the second set."It's normal that at the end of the season after all the things that happened... All the matches I played with high intensity, it's normal that there are body issues a little bit."So it's nothing strange.Something that's completely normal and accepted."Nadal started far stronger than he did in Wednesday's win over Hyeon Chung, breaking early on thanks to a couple of trademark forehands.Cuevas played his part during the first set in front of a near-capacity crowd, hitting an outrageous 'hot-dog' shot between his legs for an outright winner.But Nadal held after a tough service game for a 4-1 lead before closing out the opener on his fourth set point.The reigning French and US Open champion has only won two of his 75 ATP titles indoors, with just one at this level coming at the 2005 Madrid Masters.He broke in the third game of the second set, only to hand Cuevas a lifeline with a string of uncharacteristic unforced errors as the world number 36 hit straight back.The South American forced a tie-break, but after Nadal had moved 4-2 in front, the top seed dumped two volleys into the net and Cuevas levelled the match at the first opportunity.Nadal returned to the court reinvigorated after having his knee taped, breaking serve in the second game with a fierce backhand down the line.Cuevas also had to call the trainer after appearing to dislocate his thumb when sliding for the ball, but he grabbed the break back as Nadal struggled to put the match to bed.That proved to be the unseeded player's final show of resistance, though, as his illustrious opponent reeled off three successive games before wrapping up the match with a big serve out wide.
Patrice Evra Sent Off Before Europa League Game For Karate Kick On Own Fan:::::Former Manchester United star Patrice Evra, who currently plies his trade with French club Marseille, was sent off in astonishing circumstances even before the Europa League match between Marseille and Vitoria Guimaraes started.Evra was pictured launching a karate-style kick on a fan said to be from his own team.The French defender was seen in a heated exchange with a group of Marseille fans in Portugal before aiming a head-high kick at a supporter.The incident was reminiscent of another Manchester United legend, Eric Cantona, kung-fu kicking a Crystal Palace fan at Selhurst Park in 1995.Cantona's assault led to a nine-month ban handed down by the English Football Association and it is expected that Evra too now faces a lengthy UEFA ban.Stewards and Evra's teammates quickly surrounded Evra and intervened before more harm could be done.The 36-year-old, who was originally listed as a substitute, was ordered to return to the dressing room by the referee.A fan posted a video of the incident.Patrice Evra: Kicking racism out of football.Literally.??pic.twitter.com/QA0p27DSrq PapaBeats (@PapaBeats_) November 2, 2017 Twitter quickly got into the groove as fans posted some hilarious memes of the incident.Conor McGregor fait pas le poids face a Patrice Evra #VSCOM pic.twitter.com/VmCOfWMPtM L'interiste (@L_interiste_) November 2, 2017 Who did it better?RT - Eric Cantona LIKE - Patrice Evra#mufc pic.twitter.com/IZJSaZzi62 United Xtra (@utdxtra) November 2, 2017 Looks like Patrice Evra has been practising that karate kick.pic.twitter.com/ro8LgOAE23 Nathan (@NathanOAFC01) November 2, 2017 Patrice Evra kicks a fan in the head, that only means one thing ... pic.twitter.com/3HQ8NIuQMe Daniel Mccabe (@dmccabe_5) November 2, 2017 "Pat has experience, and he must not react, it's obvious," said Marseille coach Rudi Garcia whose side lost the game 1-0 and also had Boubacar Kamara sent off three minutes from time."Patrice is a more than just an experienced player.You can't respond, of course, to insults as bad as they are and as incredible as they might be because they come from one of our supporters.""He must learn to keep his cool.That's all I can say."(With AFP Inputs)
Arsenal Through To Europa League Last 32, Everton Out:::::Arsenal stretched their unbeaten home run in all competitions to 16 games.Arsenal stretched their unbeaten home run in all competitions to 16 games.AFP Arsenal reached the Europa League last 32 on Thursday as Everton crashed out and Patrice Evra was red-carded for a karate kick at one of his own Marseille fans -- before the match had even started.Arsene Wenger's Arsenal fought out a drab 0-0 draw with Red Star Belgrade at the Emirates but the point was enough to make sure of qualifying for the knockout round with two games to spare in Group H. Jack Wilshere, overlooked by England manager Gareth Southgate earlier in the day, had the best chance but saw a second-half effort cleared off the line.The result allowed the Gunners to stretch their unbeaten home run in all competitions to 16 games."If you can't win the game, don't lose it.We're not delighted with the point, but we'll take it," said Wilshere.Veteran Marseille defender Evra was sent off after launching a karate-style kick at one of his team's own supporters before the match against Vitoria Guimaraes in Portugal.Former Manchester United star Evra, 36, was engaged in a heated exchange with a group of fans from an area reserved for around 500 Marseille supporters before aiming a head-high left-footed kick at one of them."Pat has experience, and he must not react, it's obvious," said Marseille coach Rudi Garcia whose side lost 0-1 and had Boubacar Kamara sent off three minutes from time."Patrice is a more than just an experienced player.You can't respond to insults as bad as they are and as incredible as they might be because they come from one of our supporters."He must learn to keep his cool."The incident immediately brought back memories of another act of kung-fu kick madness by a French footballer.In January 1995, Eric Cantona, playing for Manchester United, launched a flying kick at a Crystal Palace supporter at Selhurst Park who had jeered him after he had been sent off.Struggling Everton crashed out after a 3-0 defeat in Lyon.Languishing in the relegation zone in the Premier League and without a permanent manager since the sacking of Ronald Koeman last week, Everton succumbed to three second-half goals.Bertrand Traore rounded Jordan Pickford to break the deadlock on 68 minutes in the Group E clash.Memphis Depay then set up 19-year-old Houssem Aouar to steer in a slick second goal for the hosts on 76 minutes.The former Manchester United winger completed the scoring himself late on after another ex-United player, Morgan Schneiderlin, was sent off for a second booking.AC Milan stumble "We're really disappointed with the result.For nearly 70 minutes, we were nearly perfect with our game plan and created a couple of opportunities and should have scored," said Everton caretaker manager David Unsworth.Everton also lost defender Cuco Martina to a worrying incident in the first half as the Curacao international was stretchered off in a neck brace following an awkward fall.Despite suffering a concussion and needing hospital treatment, Martina was later discharged and travelled back to Merseyside.Seven-time European champions AC Milan, in the midst of a poor run of form in Serie A, failed to relieve much pressure on under-fire manager Vincenzo Montella following a 0-0 draw at AEK Athens.The Italians hit the post on 57 minutes through Riccardo Montolivo, while Turkey midfielder Hakan Calhanoglu had a powerful drive turned away as Milan remained two points clear of their Greek hosts in Group D.

Ranji trophy: Security breach during Delhi-UP Ranji Trophy game at Air Force ground in Palam:::::NEW DELHI: International cricketers Gautam Gambhir Rishabh Pant and their Delhi teammates survived a major security scare on Friday evening during their Ranji Trophy match against Uttar Pradesh, as a youngster drove his car on to the pitch at the Palam Grounds here when the exciting final session of the play was underway.In a first of its kind incident, a Delhi resident, Girish Sharma , from Buddh Vihar locality, drove his WagonR in full speed inside the stadium and entered the field of play upon finding that no guard was stationed at the Air Force stadium gate.As the Delhi fielders and UP batsmen - Akshdeep Nath and Imtiaz Ahmed - ran to save themselves from getting hit by the car, Girish - who later told police that he works for the Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) at its Parliament Street branch - tried to make an '8' on the pitch as if he had come for a driving test.Gambhir barely escaped being knocked down when Sharma took a sharp turn on the pitch.When Sharma tried to flee the scene, Air Force security guard, Anubhav Kumar, managed to stop his car with the help of spectators at the gate and handed him over to his seniors.Kumar, who was supposed to be stationed at the gate but was enjoying the match near the pavilion area at the time of the incident, was immediately taken off duty.Girish, who was thrashed by the security staff attached with the Delhi team and the Air Force personnel, later told the interrogators that he did so out of his "love for the game" and to earn his "two minutes of fame".Later, while speaking to TOI, Girish came up with a bizarre explanation: "I was on my way back to the Buddh Vihar after dropping my sister at the domestic airport.She was flying to Bengaluru.On my way, I saw that a cricket match was being played at the Palam Grounds.After realizing that no one was guarding the entry gate, I took my car on to the field and tried to meet the players."However, a security guard employed by the Air Force had a different take on the matter: "In the morning, a spectator scaled the stadium's boundary wall and tried to enter the field of play.He was let off only after a sound thrashing by the Air Force personnel.This guy Girish is a friend of that spectator and had come to take revenge for his insult.He himself admitted to this."When TOI asked Girish about it, he rubbished the theory.Ishant, when approached for his reaction, said: "Of course, it's a major security breach.We couldn't understand for a moment what was happening."Another Delhi team management official said, "I have never seen or heard of such an incident in the history of cricket.I can recall digging of pitches by right-wing groups or some other incidents, but nothing like this."Match referee, Narayanan Kutty, later said: "We have called the Delhi Police .He would be handed over to them for further interrogation.The match would continue as scheduled on the fourth and final day.We are treating it as a stray incident but it's a major security breach and one would have to be very careful about such incidents in the future."Investigating officer from Air Force, Suren Kumar Baral, refused to speak to the media citing protocol.Sources later said that Air Force officials told Delhi & District Cricket association (DDCA) that since it was their `home' game, they should have ensured that proper security was in place.
India v Japan: Asia Cup Hockey: Indian women beat defending champions Japan 4-2 to make final:::::NEW DELHI: The Indian women's team has reached the final of the 2017 Asia Cup, beating hosts and defending champions Japan 4-2 in a closely contested semi-final in Kakamgigahara on Friday to set up a rematch of the 2009 summit clash against China.Goals from Gurjit Kaur (7th, 9th minutes), Navjot Kaur (9th) and Lalremsiami (38th) underlined India's victory, which took them to a fourth Asia Cup final; India won the title in 2004 and finished runners-up in 1999 and 2009.Rani Rampal 's team will face China in the final on Sunday, November 5 - having beaten them 4-1 in the league stage just a few days ago.Not surprisingly, given her superb form, it was Gurjit who gave India their first goal by converting a penalty corner in the seventh minute.In the ninth minute, that scoreline became 2-0 as Navjot added a fine field goal and Gurjit slotted in her second goal of the match.Japan did not sit idle for long, however, and recovered to make it 2-3 at half-time.Shiho Tsuji opened Japan's account in the 17th minute, and 11 minutes later a field goal from Yui Ishibashi left the home fans cheering.The third quarter saw Lalremsiami score her first goal of the tournament to put India ahead 4-2, and the defenders did well to keep the Japanese at bay thereon.India entered the knockout stage of the tournament following wins over Singapore 10-0, China 4-1 and Malaysia 2-0 to top their pool, and on Thursday defeated Kazakhstan 7-1 in the quarter-final.India's opponents in Sunday's final, China, are two-time winners of the Asia Cup in 1989 and 2009.In the 2009 final, China beat India 5-3.The winner of this year's edition will qualify for the 2018 World Cup in England.
If I do well in one game, obviously I will play the next: Axar Patel:::::RAJKOT: Axar Patel made it clear that he does not consider himself as a substitute of Ravindra Jadeja in the limited overs format and will "automatically" get selected if he is doing well.Patel, who has been preferred over seasoned pro Jadeja has played 8 ODIs since August taking 10 wickets and more importantly has been economical in most of the games."I have got a place in the team and that's why I am playing.I am of the view that if I do well in one game, I will automatically be picked in the next match," Patel told mediapersons at the pre-match conference.After losing the first ODI against New Zealand in Mumbai, where Tom Latham repeatedly played the sweep shot against Kuldeep Yadav , the Indian team changed it's ploy bring in Axar, which worked for the 'Men In Blue'."They played the sweep (shot) well in the first game.We knew that against spinners that was the strategy they will adopt and we formalised our strategy as per that by changing the angle by bowling over and round the wicket (in turns)," said Patel, who plays for Gujarat in the Ranji Trophy.Patel said that skipper Virat Kohli has given him the freedom and confidence to bowl as he wants to."The captain backs you when you do well.I have been playing from the second ODI.He gives me the freedom to bowl what I want to.He leaves it to on us (him and Chahal) to decide on what to do.He says if that plan doesn't succeed even then I will back you, which gives us confidence to bowl with a free mind," said the lanky left-arm orthodox, who had splendid figures of 2 for 20 in four overs in the first T20 International in Delhi.Chief coach Ravi Shastri was also a left-arm spinner but his advice to Patel has been more on the mental aspects of the game."He knows my bowling style is different from his.He always says "you know how to bowl and that's why you are in the team and you continue to do that".He says all that is mind game, how to handle situations under pressure.He gives me small tips."He has always been assigned a specific role by the team management - to contain runs and he has done that with a fair amount of success."My role is the same.The wrist spinner (Yuzvendra Chahal in this case) gets turn on most wickets and his role is to attack more and try to take wickets in middle overs.Finger spinner's aim is to contain from one end.If pressure is put from both ends, there are more chances of getting the wickets," said Patel.While he plays Ranji Trophy for Gujarat and IPL for Kings XI Punjab, the Rajkot Stadium (Saurashtra's home ground) has been like a second home for him."Obviously, it's my home ground and I have some idea about how the wicket will behave from my experience playing IPL over here.There is not much turn on offer but it's skiddy and there's some bounce.I know how to bowl here," he added.
Rafael Nadal: Injured Rafael Nadal pulls out of Paris Masters:::::PARIS: World number one Rafael Nadal pulled out of the Paris Masters on Friday before his quarter-final with a knee injury.The Spaniard, who had his right knee strapped during his third-round win on Thursday, said he wanted to try and be ready to face Filip Krajinovic in the last eight but that "it wasn't possible to play".He did not say if he would be fit to play at the World Tour Finals in London later this month."Yesterday (Thursday), the pain was very strong but it was not the moment to stop," Nadal told a press conference."I had treatment last night to try and be able to play today...But unfortunately it was impossible for me to return to the court in the same condition as last night.It is a sad day for me."The 31-year-old became the oldest man to secure top spot in the end of season rankings when he beat Hyeon Chung in his opening match on Wednesday.Nadal has fought back this year from a series of knee problems, winning the French and US Open titles.But he allayed fears this would lead to another lengthy spell on the sidelines, after injury-plagued campaigns saw him fail to reach a Grand Slam semi-final in 2015 and 2016."I had a long year, a lot of matches.I pushed the body," Nadal added."We are at the end of the season.It's normal that these kind of things happen.The knee is always, you know, bothering a little bit, but sometimes it's worse, and now is a little bit worse."He called the trainer to have his knee taped after the second set of his last-16 win over Pablo Cuevas, before insisting he would be fit to play at the season-ending event in London.But the 16-time Grand Slam champion then ended his bid for a first Paris Masters title, a serious blow for a tournament which is already missing the likes of Roger Federer, Andy Murray and Stan Wawrinka.If Nadal pulls out of the Tour Finals, it would leave Federer as the only member of the 'Big Four' in the year-ending event."I'm going to do my treatment, do my best to be playing in London, but I cannot talk about that now because (it) is a day that is tough enough for me to pull out from here," he said."For me it's not about London.For me it's about longer term."And longer term I'm going to do the treatment I believe that (is) going to be more safe and more important to keep playing tennis as long as possible."World number 77 Krajinovic, who had never been past the second round of a Masters tournament before, now progresses to his first ATP semi-final of the season against either Juan Martin del Potro or John Isner on Saturday."I did not expect this at all, I was ready to play but then I heard he had pulled out," said the Serb."I'm going to enjoy today and then see how it goes tomorrow (Saturday)."
Sreesanth: Banned Sreesanth to approach Supreme Court:::::BENGALURU: Tainted former India cricketer S Sreesanth said he would approach the Supreme Court in a last ditch effort to lift the life ban imposed on him by the BCCI following allegations of spot-fixing during an IPL match in 2013."That is the only option left with me, to approach the Supreme Court.At the end of the day, my life, except cricket is going really well.I will fight for my right.It is not just about playing for the country, but it is about getting the respect back," Sreesanth said.Sreesanth said he has been very quiet for the four-and-a-half years and felt it was high time for him to speak his mind."That is why I have opened up and started to speak.It is just the beginning and there are more things to come," he added.Sreesanth also clarified that he did not make any allegations against BCCI's Anti-Corruption and Security Unit."All I said was that there were 13 accused and why they were treated differently.This is the only thing I asked.I never asked to reveal their names.More than anyone else, I know much better about it because I was the one who had undergone the toughest possible time," he said."It is very easy to say he has done it, he has not done it but then one has to back it up with proof and show to the world.BCCI can keep making comments but at the end of the day people are not fools," he added.Sreesanth was banned for life following allegations of spot-fixing during an IPL match in 2013.
Sonia, Neeraj in quarters of Asian Boxing Championships:::::HO CHI MINH CITY (Vietnam): World Championship silver-medalist Sonia Lather and debutant Neeraj advanced to the quarter-finals on a mixed day for India at the Asian Boxing Championships on Friday.Lather (57kg), who is a former silver-medalist at this event, and Neeraj (51kg) won their respective opening-round bouts to make the last-eight stage.However, Pooja Rani (81kg) made a first-round exit.First up for India was Neeraj, the Nation's Cup gold-medalist who was making her debut at the continental meet.The Haryana-boxer dominated her opponent from Myanmar, Nally Nally, making good use of her height and reach advantage.The Indian back-paddled effectively, forcing Nally to drop her guard and lunge forward, a tactic which worked more for Neeraj.It also helped that Nally's attempts at connecting punches were at best feeble and were thwarted quite easily by the reigning national champion.Neeraj will be up against Korea's Pang Chol Mi in the quarter-finals.Lather was the next woman in for the country and pulled off an aggressive triumph over Japan's Kurogi Kana Kana also sustained a cut above the eye in the second round which made her all the more defensive, making it a shade more easy for Lather to dominate the bout.Lather will be squaring off against China's Yin Junhua in the quarter-finals on Saturday.However, there was disappointment as well with Asian Games bronze-medalist Pooja Rani bowing out with an opening-round loss.Rani lost to China's Yang Xiaoli in a unanimous verdict.
Need to slow down India's momentum to make a comeback: Ish Sodhi:::::RAJKOT: New Zealand leg-spinner Ish Sodhi feels the key to make a comeback into the T20 series against India is to slow down the home team's momentum.The Black Caps lost the series opener at New Delhi by 53 runs and face a must-win situation on Saturday in the second Twenty20 game at the SCA Stadium to keep the three-match series alive."I think we put up a fantastic performance in Mumbai (in the first ODI of the three-game series lost by the visitors 1 -2) and played pretty well for that win.I think the second game is the only one we kind of struggled with.But the third ODI was a fantastic game and I think we chased extremely well.We showed that we can play spin a lot better than sides that have come here in the past," said Sodhi at the pre-match media conference."T20 cricket is all about momentum and I think they (India) put on a good partnership at the start (a record 158 runs between openers Shikhar Dhawan and Rohit Sharma ) that set up the momentum for the rest of the game.I think that's just about recognising those key moments and how we can slow their momentum down," he said."Every game we play, we try to put on our best performance and try to win for our country and we're going to approach the same way.We'll come to the ground tomorrow, have a look at the wicket, distinguish how we're going to play and hopefully combat the conditions well enough to come out on top.Being 0-1 down in a series is always tough, but it's two games to come and we'll have to give our best shot," said the Indian-origin cricketer.Sodhi was part of the Black Caps squad that came for the World T20 Championship last year and had also spent quite a bit of time prior to the series by touring India with the New Zealand A squad."I'd like to think that I've improved a lot since the last time I came here.Generally, the driving force is trying to improve and I got 2 for 25 the other day.It's been nice to spend extra time here with the A team, so the acclimatisation has been a lot easier since the last time I was here," he said."Regardless of the team we put out, I think we're really lucky with the resources to take on most conditions in the world and hopefully we'll do that tomorrow," Sodhi added when asked whether there could be any changes in the visiting team's batting order.
2nd T20I: India look to wrap up series, New Zealand aim fightback:::::RAJKOT: India are poised for their third T20 International series triumph in five years but would be wary of a strong fightback from the usually plucky New Zealand when the two sides clash in the second game of the three-match series here on Saturday.The comprehensive 53-run victory in the series opener at Delhi has put India firmly in the saddle for sweeping to a winning 2-0 lead at the Saurashtra Cricket Association Stadium here in Kandheri.The resounding victory, riding on the exhilarating batting exploits of their top-order and, in particular openers Shikhar Dhawan and Rohit Sharma, was the country's first-ever over the Kiwis in the shortest form of the game.The 2007 World T20 champions have produced impressive death bowling with Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Jasprit Bumrah leading the pace department, while the spinners also pitched in with some excellent bowling in the middle overs.Considering the immense all-round strength that the hosts boast of, it's going to be a Herculean task for the Kane Williamson-led New Zealand to prevent India from surging to a third T20I series victory in eight contests, going back to 2012-13, three of which were drawn encounters.The last game is scheduled at Thiruvananthapuram on November 7.The Indian top order batting, with superb stroke-makers in Dhawan, Sharma and Kohli, has to be tamed early if New Zealand hope to carry on the fight till the series-ending game.Dhawan and Sharma put on a record 158-run partnership that went into the 16th over to ensure that India ended up with a 200-plus total despite a brief wobble towards the end.The Black Caps' new ball attack of Trent Boult and Tim Southee lacked discipline in Delhi.It's a bit of a surprise that these two experienced Kiwi bowlers have been ineffective with yorkers at the death, unlike the Indian duo of Bumrah and Bhuvneshwar.And the catching too has let the Black Caps down in contrast to some superb outfield efforts by the Men in Blue."We were outplayed in all the areas, fielding included, which is something we pride ourselves on and something we need to be much better at in Twenty20 cricket," Williamson had said after the Delhi loss to Virat Kohli-led India.Kohli has led the team from the front and is himself fast approaching the 2000-run landmark in T20Is.If the top batsmen fall cheaply, there are others spearheaded by former captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni to come to the home team's rescue.In slow bowling too, leggie Yuzvendra Chahal has continued to trouble the Black Caps' batsmen, in particular captain Williamson and senior pro Ross Taylor who is unable to read the twirl on the ball off the wrist spinner's hand.Only the left-handed Tom Latham, among the visiting team's batsmen, has shown a consistently sound and effective approach against the spin bowlers.Incidentally, this would be the second T20 International to be played at this venue on the outskirts of the city which was the home venue of IPL side Gujarat Lions earlier this year.The first one was against Australia in October, 2013, won by the home side.It has also hosted two ODIs at this stadium - in 2013 and 2015 - and in both these games India ended up on the losing side against England and South Africa respectively.It became a Test venue last season when India played against England.Virat Kohli (capt), Rohit Sharma, Jasprit Bumrah, Yuzvendra Chahal, Shikhar Dhawan, Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Shreyas Iyer, Dinesh Karthik, Kuldeep Yadav, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Mohammed Siraj, Manish Pandey, Hardik Pandya, Axar Patel, KL Rahul.Kane Williamson (capt), Todd Astle, Trent Boult, Tom Bruce, Colin de Grandhomme, Martin Guptill, Matt Henry, Tom Latham, Henry Nicholls, Adam Milne, Colin Munro, Glenn Phillips, Mitchell Santner, Ish Sodhi, Tim Southee.Match commences at 7pm IST.

Shivnarine Chanderpaul: Chanderpaul, 43, signs new Lancashire deal:::::MANCHESTER (England): Former West Indies captain Shivnarine Chanderpaul has signed a new contract with Lancashire at the age of 43, the club said on Friday.The Guyanese left-hander, struck 819 runs at an average of over 50 in last year's County Championship , including three centuries as Lancashire finished second in Division One, the club's highest position since the 2011 title triumph."The Club is extremely ambitious and there is a group of hugely talented young cricketers in the squad.I've really enjoyed playing my part both on the field scoring as many runs as possible, but also as a mentor to some of our younger players," he said."Hopefully I can continue to pass on some of my knowledge and experience to them," Chanderpaul told the club's official website (www.lccc.co.uk).Chanderpaul, who previously played with Durham Warwickshire and Derbyshire , as well as enjoying an earlier spell with Lancashire in 2010, retired from international cricket in 2016 with an average of 51.37.His total of 11,867 Test runs is the seventh highest of all-time.
Mayank Agarwal: Ranji Trophy: Agarwal's triple ton lights up Karnataka's chances against Maharashtra:::::PUNE: Karnataka batsman Mayank Agarwal 's maiden first class triple century was the lone highlight of the third day's action of the Ranji Trophy round four as the tourists found them in a commanding position against Maharashtra on Friday.Agarwal, who was unbeaten on 219 on Thursday, notched up an unbeaten 304 off 494 balls that included 28 fours and four sixes to guide Karnataka to 628/5 declared at the Maharashtra Cricket Association Stadium.The 26-year-old Agarwal had put on 259 for the opening wicket with R Samarth (129) on the second day before joining forces with Karun Nair to add 279.Nair, who was not out on 56 overnight, struck a century of his own, finishing with 116.Maharashtra, in reply, ended the day on 135/4 with Ruturaj Dasharath Gaikwad and Rahul Tripathi on the crease.In another Group A fixure, Uttar Pradesh piled up 224 runs in their second innings at stumps after bowling Delhi out for 269.With a crucial first innings lead in the bag, UP need to keep their composure and end up on the winning side eventually, unlike their first and third matches this season.Akshdeep Nath, unbeaten on 110, and Rinku Singh (64) played two crucial knocks for their team after the first three wickets had fallen with just two runs on the board.Skipper Suresh Raina , though, failed yet again and fell for a personal score of 16.In Group B, Saurashtra rode on India star Cheteshwar Pujara 's double century to score a mammoth 553 runs in their first innings before bowling out Jharkhand for 270.Ishank Jaggi high scored with 114 runs and Ishan Kishan smashed a half-century (59), but none of their fellow batsmen held on to help the team avoid following on.After being asked to follow-on, Jharkhand's opener Md Nazim Siddiqui, with nothing to lose, started explosively and completed his half-century at a strike rate of over 150.However, with only one day of the play left, it's highly unlikely that Saurashtra will let this one slip away and will hope to bowl Jharkhand out as soon as possible.In Group C, Mumbai had gained a healthy first innings lead against Odisha, thanks to Prithvi Shaw's century and then a brilliant team effort to dismiss the hosts for 145.Subsequently, in their second innings, Siddharth Lad's century ensured Mumbai give Odisha a mammoth total of 413 to chase.Ajinkya Rahane, though, fell for a duck in the second innings.In reply, Odisha had added 93 runs by the end of day's play for the loss of four wickets.They still need 320 more runs on the final day to win the match.In Group D, pacer Ashoke Dinda's five-wicket haul helped hosts Bengal bundle Himachal Pradesh for 206 in their first innings in reply to Bengal's 419.In their second essay, HP are 207/2 at the end of the day's play as the match looks to be heading for a tame draw.
Satnam Singh: UBA signs hoopster Satnam Singh:::::MUMBAI: Satnam Singh has become the first Indian player to be signed by the United Basketball Alliance for its season 5.AC Green, Director of Sport at the UBA of India, has announced the signing of Satnam, who two years ago became the first Indian national to be drafted into the NBA League.With this signing, UBA continues to reaffirm its commitment towards the growth of Indian basketball by giving the players an opportunity to play at the highest level.Satnam made history when he was drafted in the second round of the 2015 NBA Draft by the Dallas Mavericks with the 52nd overall pick.The 7'2" hoopster from Punjab played for the Dallas Mavericks in the NBA's Summer League and spent two years with the Texas Legends, a G-League affiliate of the Mavericks.Satnam was awarded a scholarship in the USA at the IMG Academy Florida in 2010, and spent the next five years honing his talent to a level worthy of being drafted in the NBA.His inspirational life story was the subject of a documentary "One in a Billion".Praising Satnam's game Green said, "I watched Satnam play in the NBA during his time in the United States while I was working with the Los Angeles Lakers.We are happy that Satnam has the opportunity to play in India in front of his friends, family and fans in the upcoming UBA Season 5."Hailing from Ballo Ke village in Punjab, Satnam was just nine years old and almost six feet tall when he arrived at the Ludhiana Basketball Academy to train under the tutelage of India's legendary coach Dr Subramanian.Talking about his association with UBA and his desire to take basketball in India to the next level, Satnam said, "I want to play an active role in the journey to take Indian basketball to the next level.I'm very excited to play in the UBA along with the best players from India and abroad."I've been working for an opportunity to show what I can do and this will be the perfect stage for me to compete at the highest level in front of my fans in India.UBA also gives me an opportunity to work on my game and see the love for basketball grow in this country."Satnam had few opportunities to play for India over the years due to his training commitments and constraints in the United States.Now at the age of 21, this will be the first time Satnam will play in front of Indian fans when he makes his UBA debut this season.

Rio Olympics: Fredericks charged in French probe over Rio corruption:::::PARIS: Former world sprint champion Frankie Fredericks was charged on Friday by French authorities for passive corruption and money laundering relating to a graft probe into the awarding of last year's Olympics to Rio, a judicial source said.International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) member Fredericks, who denies any "involvement in untoward conduct", is being investigated over a $299,300 (262,000 euros) payment he received from Papa Massata Diack , son of ex-International Association of Athletics Federations ( IAAF ) president Lamine Diack , on October 2, 2009 -- the day Rio won the bid.Fredericks, a four-time Olympic silver-medallist, had appeared before a Paris judge on Thursday.French investigators are looking into the possibility that bribes were paid over the awarding of both the 2016 Olympics to Rio and the 2020 Tokyo Games.The investigation centres to a large extent around the activities of Papa Massata Diack, who along with Lamine Diack also faces charges in France over millions of dollars paid to cover up doping failures by Russian athletes Fredericks insists that the payments, first revealed by France's Le Monde newspaper in March, were received for promotional services provided between 2007 and 2011 under a contract signed on March 11, 2007, and had nothing to do with the Olympics.Following the corruption allegations, the 50-year-old Namibian stepped down as head of the IOC committee evaluating bids to host the 2024 Olympics.The IOC said in July that it was cooperating with French authorities.The IAAF provisionally suspended Fredericks from its ruling council on July 17 as it launched a probe into the graft allegations against him.In March, Fredericks had also stepped down from an IAAF task force working on getting doping-tainted Russia back into global sport.Fredericks released a statement at the time, saying: "I categorically deny any direct or indirect involvement in any untoward conduct and confirm that I have never breached any law, regulation or rule of ethics in respect of any IOC election process."

IAAF to introduce world rankings in 2018:::::LONDON: Athletics is to introduce a world rankings system in 2018 as part of a widespread effort to bring some sense and shape to its currently nebulous calendar, and continue to move away from the sport's scandal-hit past.The introduction of the rankings in partnership with All Athletics, announced on Friday, is part of a sweeping reform package that was voted in by the IAAF last December to change the way the sport's governing body operates.The rankings will be a point-based system in which athletes collect points across different levels of meet throughout the season to determine qualification for premier competitions such as the Olympics and World Championships.It is also hoped that the introduction of the rankings will bring some focus to the Diamond League, where currently leading athletes often do not compete against each other, leaving fans feeling short-changed and often confused.International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) President Seb Coe has made no secret of his frustration with many aspects of the Diamond League's current format and is desperate to reform it.When it comes to major championships, athletes are currently selected by their national associations, if they achieve a qualification time or mark."The IAAF World Rankings will drive and shape the global competition system including entry into the World Championships and Olympic Games," Coe said in a statement."For the first time in the sport's history, athletes, media and fans will have a clear understanding of the hierarchy of competitions... allowing them to follow a logical season-long path to the pinnacle of Athletics' top two competitions."The athletes' position in the rankings will be determined by various performance aspects along with the level of competition they are participating in.The points system for each event along with other details related to the rankings will be finalised in the first quarter of 2018, meaning the new system can be applied for qualification into the 2019 World Championships and the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.The sport's governing body will also establish a new department named IAAF Heritage to use athletics' history, drive understanding of the sport and promote it around the world."The Rankings will bring much needed clarity to what is today a confusing competition picture even for those from within the sport, while Heritage will be an important tool to help inform, inspire and engage interest through the extraordinarily story of Athletics," IAAF CEO Olivier Gers said.IAAF to introduce

Cowboys' RB Elliott granted stay to play Sunday:::::(The Sports Xchange) - A federal appeals court granted an administrative stay for Dallas Cowboys running back Ezekiel Elliott, reinstating his eligibility for Sundays game against the Kansas City Chiefs.FILE PHOTO: Oct 22, 2017; Santa Clara, CA, USA; Dallas Cowboys running back Ezekiel Elliott (21) during the game against the San Francisco 49ers at Levi's Stadium.Sergio Estrada-USA TODAY Sports The 2nd U.S.Circuit Court of Appeals on Friday granted the request for an administrative stay to the NFL Players Association on behalf of Elliott.With his six-game suspension on hold once again, the 22-year-old Elliott arrived at the Cowboys practice facility Friday morning.He was not with the team on Wednesday and Thursday, per league rules.A panel of federal judges will convene next week to hear Elliotts request for an injunction that overturns Judge Katherine Polk Faillas ruling from Monday.The NFL dealt Elliott a six-game suspension Aug. 11 for violating the leagues personal-conduct policy relating to domestic-violence allegations by a former girlfriend.Elliott was never charged with a crime by Columbus, Ohio, authorities who investigated the allegations.The NFLPA argued in its appeal that Elliott will sustain irreparable harm without an injunction, saying that courts have consistently concluded that professional athletes suffer irreparable harm when threatened with a potentially wrongful suspension.Elliott, who currently ranks third in the league in rushing with 690 yards, had a career-high 33 carries for 150 yards in last Sundays 33-19 victory against the Washington Redskins.It was his third straight 100-yard game and third career game over 150 yards dating back to last season.

South African prosecutors say Pistorius sentence 'shockingly lenient', seek appeal:::::BLOEMFONTEIN, South Africa (Reuters) - South Africas state prosecutors told the Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA) on Friday the six-year sentence for murder handed to Paralympic gold medalist Oscar Pistorius was shockingly lenient and asked for the right to launch an appeal.Pistorius was imprisoned in July last year after being found guilty on appeal of murdering his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp on Valentines Day 2013.The case has attracted worldwide interest.He was not in court for Fridays hearing.Womens rights groups in a country beset by high levels of violent crime against women say Pistorius has received preferential treatment compared to non-whites and those without his wealth or international celebrity status.The athlete was originally convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to five years in jail.That conviction was increased to murder by the SCA in December 2015 and his sentence increased to six years by trial Judge Thokozile Masipa.State prosecutors, led by advocate Andrea Johnson, said the sentence by Masipa was too lenient as the jail term was less than half the minimum 15-year sentence prescribed for murder in South Africa.Johnson said the High Court did not list the substantial and compelling factors for deviating from the 15-year sentence and that Pistorius had not shown remorse for the murder.FILE PHOTO: Former Paralympian Oscar Pistorius appears for sentencing for the murder of Reeva Steenkamp at the Pretoria High Court, South Africa June 14, 2016.REUTERS/Kim Ludbrook/Pool/File Photo There is no true, gut-wrenching remorse, Johnson said.It is shockingly lenient and has accordingly resulted in an injustice, she said, referring to the sentence.Slideshow (2 Images) Lawyers for the gold medalist, known as the Blade Runner for his carbon-fiber prosthetics, say he did not deliberately kill model and law graduate Steenkamp.Barry Roux, lead defense lawyer for Pistorius, said the athlete was suffering from severe and worsening post-traumatic stress disorder over the case.Roux said Masipa had addressed the misperception that Pistorius deliberately killed Steenkamp.Leave to appeal should really not be granted, he said.The court did not set a date for when it would rule on whether the appeal can be heard or not.
Jets run past Bills, 34-21:::::(The Sports Xchange) - You could almost hear Al Pacino reciting the line he made famous in The Godfather Part III if he were a Jets fan: Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in.Nov 2, 2017; East Rutherford, NJ, USA; Buffalo Bills wide receiver Deonte Thompson (10) catches a touchdown pass against New York Jets corner back Darryl Roberts (27) during the fourth quarter at MetLife Stadium.Mandatory Credit: Brad Penner-USA TODAY Sports Even the Jets couldnt blow this one.Losers of three straight in which they gave up 14-point leads in the first two and fourth-quarter advantages in the second two, the Jets put together a complete performance, dominating the Buffalo Bills 34-21 on Thursday night at MetLife Stadium.New York (4-5) is still in last place in the AFC East, so talk of a playoff push would be premature.However, the Jets showed surprising signs of improvement in two areas where they previously struggled -- running the ball and rushing the passer.Running back Matt Forte (14 carries, 77 yards) complained after Sundays loss to the Atlanta Falcons that the Jets got too pass-happy.But the Jets eclipsed last weeks total of 43 rushing yards in the first quarter with 53, then finished with 194 on 41 carries.Forte scored his first two touchdowns of the season, the second giving the Jets their largest lead of the season to that point (31-7) and sending many fans to the exits as the rout was on.Buffalo quarterback Tyrod Taylor threw for a touchdown and ran for one late to pique the few remaining fans interest, but the Jets closed it out and won for the first time in nearly a month.Fortes touchdown was set up by a strip-sack by Jordan Jenkins and a recovery by Demario Davis to the Buffalo 5-yard line.The Jets defense came into the game with 11 sacks, tied for second worst in the league with the Titans, but New York kept Taylor skittish all game.The Jets sacked the man they call T-Mobile because of his elusiveness seven times, and Muhammad Wilkerson, who didnt practice for the third straight week, had arguably his best game of the season with a sack, two QB hits and a pass deflection.The Jets took a 17-7 lead on their first drive of the second half, marching 74 yards in seven plays, capped by Robby Andersons 25-yard touchdown catch on a fade route down the right sideline.On the play, quarterback Josh McCown tied his career high with his 13th TD pass of the season.Nov 2, 2017; East Rutherford, NJ, USA; New York Jets running back Elijah McGuire (25) runs the ball against Buffalo Bills linebacker Lorenzo Alexander (57) during the fourth quarter at MetLife Stadium.Mandatory Credit: Brad Penner-USA TODAY Sports Anderson, who blew past Bills rookie corner TreDavious White, has scored in three consecutive games.For the fifth straight game, the Jets took the lead first.McCown scrambled around the left side and lunged into the end zone to put the Jets up 7-0 with 7:43 left in the first quarter.Slideshow (10 Images) The 38-year-old quarterback, who spiked the ball with all his might, leads the Jets with three rushing touchdowns this season.The other two came on sneaks from the 1-yard line.The Bills tied the score at 7 eight seconds into the second quarter on the first career touchdown catch for rookie Zay Jones.The second-round pick out of East Carolina caught a 10-yard pass on a slant route from Taylor.The Jets appeared to score a touchdown on the ensuing drive.McCown, rolling to his left, threw across his body to Austin Seferian-Jenkins in the front corner of the end zone.But Forte was blocking downfield before McCown released the ball and was flagged for offensive pass interference.Chandler Catanzaro, who missed two kicks in the rain on Sunday, hit from 45 yards to put the Jets up 10-7.Buffalo, which had won four of its last five coming into the game, fell to 5-3, missing on a chance to tie New England for first place in the division with the Patriots on a bye this week.McCown completed 14 of 20 passes for 140 yards and a touchdown.Taylor was 29 of 40 for 285 yards and two scores.

Dodger Yasiel Puig's Home Burglarized on Night of World Series Loss:::::While coming to terms with the loss of the World Series, Yasiel Puig takes another loss after finding out his home was broken into.Patrick Healy reports for NBC4 News on Thursday, Nov. 2, 2017.(Published Friday, Nov. 3, 2017) A San Fernando Valley home owned by Dodger Yasiel Puig was burglarized on the same night Los Angeles' dreams of its first World Series title in 29 years were dashed at Dodger Stadium.The break-in occurred shortly after Game 7 of the World Series, a disappointing 5-1 loss to Houston.A window at the address was smashed and items were taken, according to the Los Angeles Police Department.Police responded to the address after a burglary alarm was activated.Puig was likely at Dodger Stadium at the time.He was 0-for-3 at the plate in Wednesday night's loss.TMZ reported that jewelry was taken from the Mediterranean-style villa in Encino's Amestoy Estates, which Puig recently bought for $2.65 million.Security cameras captured the crime, according to TMZ.The home is not the same one owned by Puig that was burglarized in March.About $500,00 worth of jewelry was taken in the March burglary, which occurred when Puig was away at spring training.A string of burglaries have been reported in recent months targeting celebrities in the Hollywood and Beverly Hills area, including Alanis Morissette, Nicki Minaj, Emmy Rossum, Jaime Pressly, David Spade, Puig, and former Lakers Nick Young, Byron Scott and Derek Fisher.In March, a burglary was reported at the family home of Lakers star rookie Lonzo Ball.
It Can Take a Mountain of Money to Raise a Winter Olympian:::::American ice dancing duo Rachel and Michael Parsons, left, and snowboarder Mike Trapp.They've all spent tens of thousands of dollars a year on training as they vie to go to the Olympics.The rewards for competing in the Olympics this winter in Pyeongchang are largely symbolic for the vast majority of athletes who won't win medals or sign lucrative endorsement deals.And the financial strain their years of training puts on their families can hit hard."Its a daunting challenge," said Richard Parsons, whose two eldest children are the reigning U.S. and world junior ice dance champions.Rachel and Michael Parsons' win at the 2017 World Junior Figure Skating Championships in Taiwan this year marked a milestone in their quest to compete at the 2022 Olympics if not sooner, should they clinch the spot as alternates for Team USA at the 2018 Games.Once theyve qualified for the Olympics, athletes flights, accommodations, food and training are paid for by the United States Olympic Committee.But getting to that point?That's on the athletes, and often their families.Olympic Hopefuls Gear Up for Winter Games American Olympic hopefuls are doing everything they can to be ready for the 2018 Winter Games in Pyeongchang.(Published Tuesday, Oct. 31, 2017) The cost of the Parsons' 12-year journey thus far has been over $500,000, to cover the ice time, coaching, choreography, dance classes, costumes, ice skates, registration fees and travel expenses necessary to help Rachel and Michael compete at the elite level on the international stage, their dad said."When they were starting out, it was just a thousand or two a year early on.Then it started ramping up steadily as they started competing nationally and then internationally," Richard Parsons said, noting the annual expenses increased from an average of $40,000 a year to $75,000 last year.And the Maryland family is not an outlier in how much it spends eye-popping expenses are par for the course for most Olympians.Parsons said some teams in their sport spend more than $100,000 a year to train at the elite level.Mike Trapp, the 2011 and 2012 U.S. snowboarding champion, said an average season training costs about $35,000 in equipment, coaching and traveling expenses.It's more expensive in a year leading up to the Olympics.The native of Cape Cod, Massachusetts, is training in Italy ahead of World Cup qualifiers in December and January.In order to score a spot on the U.S. Olympic team, Trapp needs to finish in the top three in one of five events taking place in Italy, Austria and Slovenia.It took nearly two decades of training and discipline, plus hundreds of thousands of dollars, just for Trapp to reach the cusp of Olympic selection.Rachel and Michael Parsons.Photo credit: Daphne Backman/Ice-dance.com FUNDING THE 'A TEAM' The United States is one of the only countries with an Olympic committee that is not supported through funding from the federal government.The separation was established in 1978 with the Ted Stevens Olympic and Amateur Sports Act, which gave sole control over Americas representation in the games to the USOC and the various sports' national governing bodies under the committee.Under this legislation, the USOC has complete control over the intellectual property associated with the Olympic Games, giving it exclusive distribution rights over logos and other licensing material.The autonomy also means the USOC is responsible for raising and allocating all of the funding needed for the U.S. to compete in the Olympics and Paralympics.It does this through trademark licensing, corporate sponsors and broadcast revenue.Some of the money is also distributed to various sports' national governing bodies to help fund athlete development.Richard Parsons said that once his kids made the jump to the junior level in ice dancing they began receiving support from the U.S.Figure Skating Association, which helped offset some of their costs.The money is allocated based on performance, or "likelihood that an athlete will win a medal," according to Team USA spokesman Mark Jones.This pay-for-performance model leaves some organizations struggling to support their athletes.Olympians Try Korean Snacks In preparation for the Olympic Winter Games, NBC gave Team USA some of the most popular Korean snacks to see what they thought of them.(Published Tuesday, Oct. 31, 2017) "U.S.Ski and Snowboard can only fund the A team," Trapp said.As a B team member, Trapp, who moonlights as a mechanic during his summers, has had to foot the bill for his training."I'm doing this all on my own dime," he said."That job keeps the dream alive."The A team is fully funded in the U.S. ski teams budget, which allocates about $100,000 per athlete annually, according to U.S.Ski President Tiger Shaw."But theres a $2 million funding gap in paying for travel costs for B and C team athletes."Members of the B and C teams are billed $15,000 to $20,000 at the beginning of each season to close the gap.Shaw acknowledged that is a significant amount of money, but the only other option, he said, is to cut half the team.He said the organization works with the athletes to help them find sources of revenue.EXPENSIVE SCHOOLING Like many elite athletes competing in snowsports, Trapp attended a ski academy during his formative school years, albeit part-time.From sixth to 11th grade, Trapp transferred out of his regular school curriculum for part of the year to train at Waterville Valley Academy in New Hampshire, where tuition for a three-month season cost $15,000, not including equipment and race fees.That figure pales in comparison to the $55,000 tuition Olympic gold medalist Mikaela Shiffrin paid to attend Burke Mountain Academy in Vermont full-time.Olympic Torch Lighting Starts Relay to Pyeongchang Games The torch for the 2018 Winter Olympics was lit among the ruins of Olympia, Greece, marking the start of its 100-day journey to the Pyeongchang Games.Skier Apostolos Aggelis, of Greece, was the first torch-bearer.(Published Monday, Oct. 30, 2017) Shiffrin was born in Vail, Colorado, "an epic ski town," she told NBC.Both her parents and her older brother are skiers, and they grew up with skiing as their "family recreational sport."She recalled starting out in a kids' "Fresh Tracks" training program by age 5.When it came time for high school, the prodigy who was already winning races opted for a ski academy.She gained entrance to one of the country's most exclusive ski academies, where Shiffrin trained for hours each day, learning "a lot about time management" and "being responsible."Shiffrin went on to claim gold in the slalom in Sochi.But it's not just expensive to attend an exclusive training program.To even be considered for admission to an elite ski school, applicants usually need a solid foundation in skiing and a resume of winning races."You had to apply and get in, and part of that process obviously is showing your skiing resume you couldnt just be a beginner," said Gordy Megroz, a graduate of Stratton Mountain School in Vermont.And though some ski schools offer junior classes for skill-development training, "realistically youd need to live within four or five hours of the ski area to be able to get to practice, races and lessons," said Megroz, highlighting the geographical difficulties some aspiring athletes face.He learned to ski growing up in Vermont, he said, by standing on his father's and grandfather's skis when he was as young as 2 years old.He started competing when he was 10.His parents drove him to races on weekends."You have to pay for everything from season passes to equipment to race fees," Megroz said."Its certainly an expensive sport no disputing that.People who get into ski racing probably are pretty affluent."Former U.S.Ski Team coach and co-founder of the alpine skiing World Cup, Robert "Bob" Beattie, said the cost of ski racing is pricing out talent who have no income and "killing our sport.""We're only getting kids with money," Beattie said in a March interview with the Aspen Times."Kids like Billy Kidd, Jimmie Heuga and Buddy Werner would never be ski racers now.They could never afford it.Their parents didn't have that kind of money."Kidd and Huega became the first American men to win Olympic medals in skiing, taking silver and bronze respectively in the slalom at the 1964 Games.'WE'VE HAD TO MAKE A LOT OF SACRIFICES' Chasing the Olympic dream is a risky venture, and for most families, raising an Olympic athlete is a tremendous investment with no guarantee of a monetary return.Many Olympians are young, and a lot of their expenses are covered by their parents.The average Olympic hopeful will train for a decade or more.And with athletes devoting more than six hours a day, six days a week to training, there isn't much room for a part-time job or career.Team USA Concerned About N. Korea, But Trusts USOC With tensions high between North Korea and the U.S., how do Olympic hopefuls feel about traveling to South Korea for the 2018 Olympic Winter Games?(Published Friday, Oct. 27, 2017) Michael Parsons, now 22, began skating at age 7, and sister Rachel Parsons, 19, at age 6.Their parents credit the Wheaton Ice Skating Academy, a Maryland rink run by Russian ice dancing champions Alexei Kiliakov and Elena Novak, for making the endeavor affordable in the early years by offering classes in group sessions, which are less expensive than private lessons.But as their kids began moving up the ranks, they required more training, fresh routines, new costumes and more money.And just as they were taking off on the world stage, the 2008 recession hit and Richard Parsons was laid off from his job by 2009."We've had to make a lot of sacrifices.We're just a middle class family and we've had to be very creative, especially with two," Parsons said, noting the family doesn't take vacations, he and his wife drive older-model, well-worn cars and they don't shop for new clothes.Team USA speedskater Emily Scott made headlines in 2013 when she applied for food stamps while training for the Olympics after her monthly stipend from the U.S.Speed Skating Federation got cut from $1,950 to $600.Scott turned to crowdfunding site GoFundMe for help, ultimately flying to Sochi thanks to thousands of strangers.Like many athletes vying for the Olympics, Trapp and the Parsons have also turned to crowdfunding to raise the money needed to fund their goals.Even entire teams and national sports organizations are turning to sites like Rallyme and Dreamfuel to help foot the bill to prepare for the Winter Games.But despite all the hardships, Richard Parsons said Rachel and Michael have gotten so much out of the experience that "I wouldn't change it for the world."Click here to support Team Parsons or here to support Mike Trapp.NBC's Emilie Mutert contributed to this report.

Still Obsessing Over Tonya and Nancy Nearly 25 Years Later:::::Pop quiz, hotshot.Where were you the evening of Feb. 25, 1994?Well, if you're over the age of 35 it's a fairly safe bet you were huddled around a television that night watching Olympic figure skating.But this wasn't just any Olympic ice skating.It was appointment television because it was was Tonya Harding versus Nancy Kerrigan, the Super Bowl of ice skating showdowns.And the appeal had nothing to do with their competition on the ice.Their duel would become the third-highest-rated sporting event ever to that point.Long before the days of Facebook or Twitter or any social media, when people still largely digested their information from newspapers and the evening news, the showdown between Kerrigan and Harding captivated the nation.And to this day we're still not over it hence the upcoming film starring Margot Robbie and Amy Adams, "I, Tonya."It was on Jan. 6, 1994 at the U.S.Figure Skating Championships in 1994 just one month before the Winter Olympics in Lillehammer, Norway that Kerrigan was clubbed in the knee leaving skating practice.Video of her plaintively screaming "Why?Why?"amid sobs played on endless loops on the evening news for days afterward.In a 2013 "Today" show interview, Kerrigan spoke about the horrific incident."Watching anything sort of horrific, its disturbing to see anybody in pain," Kerrigan said."To think its me its a lifetime ago.It hurts to see anybody in such pain.Its a long time ago.I just moved on."Check Out the New Olympic Skating Stadiums South Korea is ahead of schedule in constructing venues for the 2018 Winter Olympics and NBC got an exclusive tour of the arenas that will host skating events.Some of the biggest events of the games will take place here.(Published Monday, Oct. 30, 2017) It was later revealed that Jeff Gillooly, Harding's then-husband, had hired Shane Stant to maim Kerrigan in a bid to knock her out of the upcoming Olympics.To this day, Harding disputes her level of involvement, but she was ultimately convicted of hindering the investigation.Harding received three years' probation, 500 hours of community service and a $160K fine, and was banned from the U.S.Figure Skating Association for life.But before all that, she was free to compete in Lillehammer, and she did.After a series of mishaps, Harding came eighth.Kerrigan, healed from the attack, took home silver.Not surprisingly, over the past 23 years, the lives and careers of Harding and Kerrigan careened along distinctively different paths.Kerrigan was inducted into the Figure Skating Hall of Fame in 2004, has served as a special correspondent covering various Olympic Games and this year, at age 47, returned to spotlight by competing on "Dancing with the Stars."Welcome to Pyeongchang: A Look Inside the 2018 Olympic Venue The years weren't as kind to Harding.She released a sex tape showing her with Gillooly, was arrested on domestic violence charges in 2000 and appeared on Fox's "Celebrity Boxing" in 2002.Now, thanks to the upcoming film, a new generation will get to relive the Kerrigan-Harding feud.This is the VERY FIRST LOOK at @itonyamovie also starring @imsebastianstan and #allisonjanney Coming soon to theaters!A post shared by @margotrobbie on Oct 19, 2017 at 8:34am PDT "To be honest, when I read the script, I didnt know who Tonya Harding was, and I didnt realize it was a true story," Robbie, who plays Harding, told Vanity Fair."I thought it was entirely fictionalized and our writer Steve was so creative to come up with the quirky characters and absurd incidents."Robbie is not the first to portray Harding onscreen.Both Melanie Hutsell and Amy Poehler parodied her on NBC's "Saturday Night Live," in 1994 and 2002, respectively.Tina Yothers played the athlete in Comedy Central's spoof, "Spunk: The Tonya Harding Story" in 1994, as did Alexandra Powers in NBC's drama, "Tonya & Nancy: The Inside Story" in 1994.Robbie told Vanity Fair after the film was completed she and the director screened it for Harding, who was moved to tears."I think it is a lot for someone to have the most traumatic events of their life encompassed in a two-hour film," Robbie said."I feel like you have to be very brave to let someone do that.I dont know if I could do that, and she handled it incredibly."Pyeongchang 2018: The Comebacks
The Pyeongchang Olympics Are Encouraging Visitors to Stay in a Buddhist Temple:::::The Woljeongsa Temple is a short drive from the Olympic Stadium.Visitors walk through an ornate temple gate.A serene path lined with fir trees leads visitors to 60 temples and eight monastaries, some dating back nearly 1,400 years.Thousands of sports fans from all over the world will descend on Pyeongchang, South Korea, for the 2018 Olympic Winter Games in February, and many will book traditional accommodations.But why book a hotel room or an Airbnb when you can stay in a Buddhist temple?South Korea's tourism organization is encouraging tourists to lodge in sacred temples for part of their stay during the games to learn about traditional Korean Buddhism and culture, experience the daily life of a monk and breathe fresh mountain air.More than 30 Buddhist temples around South Korea open their doors to visitors, at least five of them in Gangwon Province, where the Winter Games will take place.Sometimes, we want to escape from everyday life and rejuvenate our minds and bodies in nature, reads the official Pyeongchang Olympics website.One of the best ways to do so is to take a temple stay trip....It could be a perfect time to refresh your mind and body.When the world conceives of South Korea, it usually thinks of its military standoff with North Korea, K-pop music and global brands such as Samsung and Hyundai, said David A. Mason, an American professor of Korean tourism at Sejong University in Seoul.Mason has lived in South Korea for more than 30 years, and was part of the committee that helped create the Temple Stay program that opened up the South Korea.With our Temple Stay program, we can show an entirely different and balancing side of Korea: the quiet simplicity and subtle beautiful artworks, charming aspects like the green tea ceremony, beautiful mountains and a profoundly deep enlightened spirituality with roots 1,600 years deep -- the Outside-of-the Seoul-urban part of Korea, Mason told NBC in an email.On a typical day in a temple, guests are awoken at 4 a.m. by a moktak, a wooden percussion instrument used for the morning chanting ceremony.Visitors can practice Buddhist meditation and other traditions such as lotus flower making, wood block printing and cooking communal meals of rice and vegetables are cooked and served in moderate amounts so there is no waste.Leisurely walks through the forest are encouraged.Despite the tranquil imagery, tourists should keep in mind that staying in a mountain temple in the depths of winter wont be as comfortable as in spring or fall, except for people who love cold, Mason said.But on the other hand, having this unique and very pleasant experience of authentic Korean traditional culture might well be the most memorable part of many tourists visit, he said.'These Spiritual Burpees Are a Real Test' Mohammed Sami, who stayed at the Woljeongsa temple in Pyeongchang in January of 2015, said not everything went as expected during his stay with his girlfriend.The couple, visiting from Toronto was looking forward to guided meditation sessions and making lotus flower lanterns, but neither of these activities were offered at the time of their stay because there were too few people, they were told.Still, they took part in bead making and prayer services and enjoyed breathing the fresh mountain air, and Sami said he'd recommend that others stay there as part of the Temple Stay program.Even in the bone-chilling winter, it's a wonderful place to experience, especially when the entire place is covered in snow, Sami said in an email.The pagoda in the middle of the the temple is beautifully lit up at night.The ceremonious ringing of the bells and banging of the drums by the monks is definitely something to experience; you do get to strike the bell yourself.The pine tree forest close by is really calming.It occurred to one temple visitor that his temple would actually be more work than relaxation when he realized how often he would have to sit cross-legged.Journalist Andrew Sun, who described himself as a "meat-eating, Facebook-addicted non-believer" in an article in The South China Morning Post, stayed at the Beomosa temple near Busan.Making prayer beads, which was meant to be a sort of meditation in motion, was more of a physical struggle than he had expected, Sun wrote."The drill is that for each bead we insert the string through, we must perform a full prostration from a standing position," Sun wrote, adding that there were 108 beads total and they had to maintain a strict tempo."These spiritual burpees are a real test and most of the group fall behind or resort to a kneeling bow."Sun said he only managed to clear his mind toward the end of his 24-hour stay."Im not sure I feel enlightened, but at least Ive stopped caring that my phones battery is almost dead," he wrote.Buddhism's Revival in South Korea The idea of foreign tourists staying in their temples was not originally welcomed by the Jogye Order, the representative order of traditional Korean Buddhism.They were imagining drunken European soccer hooligans burning down their temples, Mason said.But Mason and the rest of the special tourism committee, created in 2001 by former president Kim Dae-Jung to build new tourism initiatives, convinced the order to try out the concept when they presented it as a missionary opportunity for tourists interested in Buddhism and as a means of spreading the heritage of Korean Buddhism and traditional Korean culture.For 500 years, Buddhism was suppressed in South Korea, forcing monks to take refuge in monasteries deep in the mountains and exiled from most of civilization.But as of the late 20th Century, when paved roads and electric lines were brought into those temples (and now full internet and cellphone access, with other luxuries), these are now some of the best places to live -- grand monasteries right inside national parks and provincial parks, amidst the best scenery of the nation, Mason said.Foreign tourists aren't the only ones taking advantage of this program.South Koreans from Seoul often stay in these temples as a low-priced health spa option and to reduce the stress from urban life, Mason said.A night in a temple starts at about $44 per night for an adult, with stays ranging from two days to up to a month.Day trips are also available starting at $27.The the official Temple Stay website provides more details and reservation information.Although it was created by the government, the Temple Stay program was handed over to the Jogye Order in 2005 after a few years of operation.Mason calls this "a textbook excellent case of how religious tourism should be run by the religion themselves, even if government and commercial interests help get the program going, in order to keep it 'authentic' and not 'Disneyfied.'"

Would a US Men's Ice Hockey Gold in 2018 Be Another Miracle?:::::The NHL will not allow its players to participate in the 2018 Winter Olympics.Mens head coach Tony Granato is up for the challenge of putting a competitive team on the ice with players from college and other leagues.The Winter Olympics are approaching against a backdrop of nuclear-armed tension, NHL players won't be playing in the hockey tournament and the men's team from Russia is the distinct favorite to win gold.What was true in 1980 is also shaping up as the situation for Team USA at the 2018 Olympics.The NHL has refused to let its players represent their countries at the games, but the bona fide Russian stars playing in the world's second-best hockey league, the Russian-based Kontinental Hockey League, can still make the trip to Pyeongchang.Bookies have Team Russia as the front-runner in the run-up to the 2018 Games, while some of the Americans playing may be unknown even to serious hockey fans.Still, if you ask the captain of the "Miracle on Ice" team, it won't count as a miracle if the group of American college kids and professionals playing in minor leagues or abroad beats Russia this time around.Olympians Try Korean Snacks In preparation for the Olympic Winter Games, NBC gave Team USA some of the most popular Korean snacks to see what they thought of them.(Published Tuesday, Oct. 31, 2017) "We're a good team, we're not unknowns anymore.The days of the 'Miracle on Ice,' those days are over," said Mike Eruzione, now director of special outreach at Boston University."1980 will never happen again."Russia has won four world championships in the last decade, but it's a perennial underachiever at the Olympics, last medaling in 2002 and only winning silver before that.Russia was eliminated by the U.S. in the first round at the 2014 Sochi Games despite being on home ice.The Soviet team, by contrast, won gold in seven of nine tries.But Russia's time may be at hand, after the NHL said in April that it would not disrupt its season for 17 days to accommodate Olympic play.NHL players have participated in the Olympics since 1998.The KHL, which features teams from across Europe and one in China, has plenty of Russian players who were all-stars back in North America.Ilya Kovalchuk, who once led the NHL in goals, retired from the New Jersey Devils in his prime to move to Russia.He could have returned to the U.S. over the offseason this year, but has called the Olympics "one of the main factors" in deciding against it.His SKA Saint Petersberg teammates, Pavel Datsyuk and Slava Voynov, won Stanley Cups with the Detroit Red Wings and L.A. Kings, respectively.(Voynov went to jail on a domestic violence charge in 2015, then decamped for Russia.)Meanwhile, the all-time highest-scoring foreigner in the KHL is Brandon Bochenski, a Minnesota native who's relatively unknown stateside but was the captain of Barys Astana in Kazakhstan.He retired this year with 154 goals in seven KHL seasons, after scoring just 28 goals in five years in the NHL.Bochenski last played for the Kazakh national team he's a newly minted citizen.Olympic Torch Lighting Starts Relay to Pyeongchang Games The torch for the 2018 Winter Olympics was lit among the ruins of Olympia, Greece, marking the start of its 100-day journey to the Pyeongchang Games.Skier Apostolos Aggelis, of Greece, was the first torch-bearer.(Published Monday, Oct. 30, 2017) U.S. men's coach Tony Granato is picking players for his roster among Americans playing abroad, in domestic minor leagues (unless their contract would allow them to play in the NHL) and in colleges.The list will be announced around Jan. 1.The Team USA line-up for an international Olympic tune-up tournament this November offers a glimpse into who will be playing in Pyeongchang, and it lacks the star power of their Russian rivals.Brian Gionta, who won a Stanley Cup in 2003 with the New Jersey Devils, is the most recognizable name on the list, but the 38 year old is eligible for the Olympics only because no NHL team signed him this year.The other player on the list with prior Olympic experience is Ryan Malone, 37.He last played in the NHL in 2014 and retired before suiting up again this year for the Iowa Wild of North America's top minor league, the American Hockey League.He has one assist in eight games, in which his team has been outscored by eight goals when he's been on the ice (excluding power plays).But navigating the Olympics without NHL players isn't bothering coach Granato."I think we have a tremendous talent pool of players that are available to us," Granato said."We'll be able to put together a fun team, an energetic team and a skilled team that'll make the Americans proud."Granato noted the way players in the U.S. grow up dreaming of wearing the jersey: "You're playing in the basement of your house and you're pretending like you're Mike Eruzione and Jim Craig and Mark Johnson."Eruzione is, of course, familiar with winning against a much-hyped team from Russia, scoring the game-winning goal in the "Miracle" game and taking the gold-medal podium as Team USA's captain.But despite the long odds, he always thought they could make the podium."I always tell people, if you think you're going to lose, you probably will," Eruzione said.He knows all the ex-NHL stars that Russia will have in 2018, while the U.S. will be missing guys like Patrick Kane and budding stars Auston Matthews and Jack Eichel.But he noted some very big differences between his team and today's that make it hard to compare the two.For one thing, his 1980 team had six months of training to gel as a team, while none of the top Olympic teams will train together for anything like that much time.Eruzione's team had an average age of 21, while this team will probably be much older.Oh, and the U.S. junior players, some of whom are in contention to make the team, are the reigning world champions, having beaten Canada in a shootout.Team USA Concerned About N. Korea, But Trusts USOC With tensions high between North Korea and the U.S., how do Olympic hopefuls feel about traveling to South Korea for the 2018 Olympic Winter Games?(Published Friday, Oct. 27, 2017) "I don't see this as being a super huge challenge, other than coming together as a team," Eruzione said.He knows one of the college players who starred on that victorious world junior team, Jordan Greenway, from his work at Boston University, where Greenway is a junior.He's an "awesome kid," big and competitive, Eruzione said, and definitely has a chance of making the team."It's obviously a big change," Greenway said of the NHL's decision not to participate in the Olympics."I think everyone's really excited just to kind of see how it turns out."Eruzione didn't have too much advice for the collegiate players who may end up taking the ice against some of the best Russian players of their generation with the whole world watching.They already have plenty of international experience, he said."You're still playing on a sheet of ice.Who's in the crowd is really irrelevant," Eruzione said."Just go out there and play."

WNBA Star Says She Was Sexually Abused in Powerful Post:::::A file photo of Breanna Stewart of USA Basketball Women's National team during a game at Galen Center on July 25, 2016, in Los Angeles.Stewart says she was the victim of sexual abuse as a child.The Seattle Storm forward describes the abuse in an essay posted Monday, Oct. 30, 2017, on the Players Tribune website.Former UConn basketball star and current forward for the Seattle Storm Breanna Stewart detailed in a blog post Monday that she suffered sexual abuse as a child.Simply titled "Me Too," a nod to the social media movement started following abuse allegations against Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein, Stewart wrote about a two-year period of sexual abuse that took place at a relative's house, beginning when she was 9 years old."I don't know how to say this part.I haven't told many people," she wrote."I'm not the most vulnerable person - I don't talk about my feelings much - so this is uncomfortable."The blog appeared Monday morning in The Players' Tribune, a website that allows professional athletes to connect with fans in their own words, according to the site.Stewart included details of how the abuse would happen and how she felt helpless."I couldn't sleep.I was always on guard."She talked about the night she decided, as an 11-year-old, to wake up her mother and tell her what had been happening to her.Stewart's parents called police and the man, who she describes as a construction worker who smelled like cigarettes and dirt, confessed and was arrested, according to Stewart.She said she immersed herself in basketball.In fact, the day of her predator's arrest, she told her father she wanted to go to basketball practice that night.Her basketball skills took her from her home near Syracuse, New York, to UConn, where she won four National Championships and left as one of the most popular players in Huskies' history.'Late Night': Bourdain's Dicey 'Parts Unknown' Shoots Anthony Bourdain discusses obstacles when fiming 'Parts Unknown,' including working with bad fixers and getting labeled a government agent by Romania.(Published Wednesday, Nov. 1, 2017) Now with the WNBA's Seattle Storm, Stewart says she still carries horrible memories with her."Even though I play in front of thousands of people or talk to reporters all the time, I have quiet moments every day that no one sees," she wrote."Thats often when I think about it.I could be surrounded by my teammates or friends or complete strangers, living life as I normally would, and memories like lightning will strike."She said after recently reading Olympic gold medalist McKayla Maroney's account of sexual abuse she feels "less alone."Stewart said her father has always told her that one day she might be comfortable enough to talk publicly about what happened to her and that she may even save someone's life."That's why I'm writing this," she added."This is bigger than me."Stewart, the first overall pick in the 2016 WNBA Draft, was named WNBA Rookie of the Year for the 2016 season.'Tonight': Millie Bobby Brown Raps 'Stranger Things' Recap
Cap That Shielded Jackie Robinson From Racist Pitchers Fetches Record Amount at Auction:::::Robinson joined the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1947.The padded cap protected him from racist pitchers.A Brooklyn Dodgers cap worn by Jackie Robinson has been auctioned for a record amount.The blue cap sold for $590,000 Saturday after a monthlong online auction through the sports auctioneers Lelands.It's the most money ever exchanged for a hat at auction.Lelands says Robinson wore the hat when he broke baseball's color barrier in 1947.That year he joined the Dodgers and became the first black athlete to play in the segregated MLB in the 20th century.Robinson endured constant racist taunts during his rookie year, and pitchers frequently threw at his head.The specially-padded cap helped protect him from beanings by the pitchers.The padded cap came with a letter from Robinson's widow, Rachel, describing the three protective plates sewn inside the lining.The 95-year-old Rachel Robinson was in Los Angeles on Tuesday to throw out the ceremonial first pitch at Game 1 of the World Series between the Dodgers and the Houston Astros.Batting helmets didn't become mandatory in the Major Leagues until 1956.Top Tri-State News Photos
Opinion Shifting Toward Athletes' Anthem Protests: Poll:::::AP reporters counted more than 200 NFL players who did not stand during the national anthem before their games on Sunday.(Published Monday, Sept. 25, 2017) Americans are split in a new poll on rules that would require professional athletes to kneel for the national anthem, a real shift in favor of their right to protest, NBC News reported.Fifty-one percent of respondents to an HBO Real Sports/Marist poll said they opposed leagues requiring that players stand, while 47 percent supported such rules.The four-point difference is within the Oct. 15-17 poll's margin of error, which makes it a statistical tie.But when the poll was conducted a year ago, a clear majority supported rules requiring players to stand, by a mark of 52 to 43.Since then, President Donald Trump threw a spotlight on the athletes following the example of former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who began kneeling for the anthem in August 2016.

Richie Incognito: 'Ridiculous' we're forced to play on four-day weeks:::::EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. -- Buffalo Bills guard Richie Incognito gave sharp criticism to the NFL's decision to have Thursday night games, following his team's 34-21 loss to the New York Jets."They suck," Incognito said of Thursday games."They throw a wrench in our schedule.It's absolutely ridiculous that we have to do this.As physical as this game is, as much work and preparation that goes into this, to force us to play games on four-day weeks, it's completely unfair and bulls---.The league makes money off it, and that's all they care about anyway."The Bills' offensive line gave up seven sacks on?Tyrod Taylor, the most given up by Buffalo since Week 2 of the 2015 season.The Bills managed 63 rushing yards, their fewest since Week 4 of 2015.Others in the Bills' locker room did not echo Incognito's gripe."I'm not gonna complain about it," center?Eric Wood?said."Everybody's got to do it.I thought we were prepared.When the lights came on, we just didn't make enough plays."Added coach Sean McDermott: "[The Jets] were challenged with the same short week as us and had the same amount of time to prepare, so give them credit."The NFL has expanded its Thursday night package in recent years and scheduled 14 games on Thursdays this season.
Damian Lillard's late 3 halts Lakers' comeback bid in Portland:::::PORTLAND --?Trail Blazers?guard?Damian Lillard handed the Los Angeles Lakers a heartbreaking defeat on Thursday night that only got more painful with the loss of starting power forward Larry Nance Jr. Lillard buried a clutch step-back 3-pointer over Brandon Ingram with 0.7 seconds remaining to give Portland?a 113-110 win.And, as if the Lakers' 13th straight loss to the Blazers wasn't bad enough, Nance Jr. suffered a fractured left hand.He left the game in the third quarter and X-rays revealed the fractured second metacarpal in his left hand.The Lakers will face the Brooklyn Nets in?D'Angelo Russell's return to Staples Center on Friday with a new starting power forward in the lineup.This loss was a tough one for the Lakers to swallow.They battled back from an 18-point deficit and played well enough to win in one of the toughest buildings in the NBA.But Lillard (32 points, 5 assists) was too much at the end.Lakers rookie Lonzo Ball had his worst offensive game of the season, going scoreless with just four assists and three rebounds.But Brook Lopez had 27 points, and late first-round rookie power forward Kyle Kuzma came up big off the bench with 22 points.Kuzma missed at the buzzer on a potential game-tying 3.The Lakers (3-5) have had stretches this season where they fall behind big, and this game was no different.The Blazers blitzed the Lakers in the first quarter, building a 41-23 lead just before the end of the first quarter.Ball, who has had his best games when he was aggressively pushing the pace and looking for his shot, seemed out of sorts on offense in the first three quarters.He was engaged defensively, trying to challenge Lillard when he could.But offensively he didn't seem like himself.Ball took just two shots in the first three quarters.One was a poor decision -- a blocked 3-pointer that came after fans booed him while he milked the clock toward the end of the first.Ball also didn't grab a rebound until the third quarter, which is uncharacteristic since he crashes the boards often.Despite their rookie point guard struggling, the Lakers continued to do what they have done most of this early season -- they showed fight and mounted a comeback after falling behind big.After trailing 43-25 with 11:43 remaining in the second quarter, the Lakers outscored the Blazers 55-31 over the next 19:33, taking an 80-74 lead with 4:10 left in the third.But the real reason the Lakers got back into this game was their defense.After finishing 30th in the league in defense the past two seasons, the Lakers came into training camp preaching defense and spent hours working on defensive details.The Lakers have made strides this season, surrendering 106.6 points per game (tied for 16th best in the league entering Thursday) and ranking ninth in defensive efficiency.They contested shots against the Blazers, with Lopez and Nance Jr. making things difficult inside before Nance Jr. left the game for good.?Ball even blocked Lillard on a drive to the basket and deflected another pass for a turnover that led to a transition basket with his length.Lakers such as?Corey Brewer and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope deflected passes that started fast breaks, but the Lakers got sloppy and wasted some of those transition opportunities.The Blazers, who lost the night before in Utah in overtime, turned to Lillard.The star point guard scored 10 of his points in the third as Portland regained the lead.While Ball struggled offensively, fellow rookie Kuzma was big in the fourth.He scored seven points early in the quarter as the Lakers opened a 98-93 lead.The two teams went back-and-forth to the end.Caldwell-Pope caught an inbounds pass and buried a 3 to tie the game at 110 with 15.5 seconds remaining.Lillard, though, calmly brought the ball up court out of a timeout before drilling a lightning-quick step-back 3 over Ingram for the win.The Lakers got to see what life is like when Lopez gets going.Lopez, who will be facing his old Nets team for the first time on Friday night in Los Angeles, had his best stretch as a Laker when he made 5 of 6 shots and scored 13 points in the second quarter.The game took a retro turn where both teams went inside to their respective 7-footers.Portland's?Jusuf Nurkic scored 20 of his 28 points in the first half as he and Lopez went back-and-forth.
Aric Almirola to replace Danica Patrick at Stewart-Haas Racing:::::FORT WORTH, Texas -- Aric Almirola is set to replace Danica Patrick in the Stewart-Haas Racing No.10 car next season, and new SHR sponsor Smithfield also has agreed to continue a relationship with Richard Petty Motorsports, sources said.Almirola said last week that he was continuing to work on his 2018 plans, and SHR has announced that it would hold a news conference Wednesday morning to introduce the driver of its Smithfield-sponsored No.10 car.Smithfield, which has sponsored Almirola for the past six seasons at RPM, announced in September that it would move to SHR in 2018 but did not announce a driver.At the time, Almirola would not say what his 2018 plans were but just that he would not return to the Petty team.Smithfield has recently agreed to an ongoing collaboration with RPM next season as it transitions to SHR, according to a source.RPM and Smithfield executives exchanged harsh words after that announcement, with Richard Petty saying the team had a handshake deal with the sponsor.Teams often put clauses in sponsor contracts that can make it difficult for a sponsor and a driver to leave together, which industry sources said was the hold-up for SHR to announce the hiring of Almirola.The 33-year-old Almirola has one career victory -- the July 2014 race at Daytona -- in 241 Cup starts.He was 20th in the Cup standings when he broke his back in a crash in Kansas in May.He also has three victories in the Xfinity Series and two in the Camping World Truck Series.SHR still has to announce a driver for its No.41 car, currently driven by?Kurt Busch?and sponsored by team owner Gene Haas and Monster Energy.SHR didn't pick up Busch's option as it awaits a decision from Monster Energy, but Haas has said he fully expects Busch to return, and Busch has said remaining at SHR is possible.Motorsport.com first reported confirmation of Almirola to SHR.
An extraordinary start, interrupted: Deshaun Watson by the numbers:::::The Deshaun Watson rookie campaign was remarkable -- and ultimately way too short.A year ago, the Houston Texans' offense was plodding along under quarterback Brock Osweiler, who was the 29th-rated passer and couldn't seem to complete much beyond 5-yard passes to tight ends.But Watson flipped the script and turned the Texans into must-see TV with a rookie quarterback season like we've never seen.But with news Thursday that Watson suffered a torn ACL, the talk of what is still possible in a record-setting rookie season is over.We have an end point in the Watson rookie experience, and it has been a remarkable ride.When it comes to the impact we can measure, Watson was off the charts from a historical perspective.Here's a look at the numbers behind Watson's historic start -- and what could have been.TD passes at record pace Watson replaced an ineffective Tom Savage at halftime of the Texans' season opener, a 29-7 loss to the Jaguars.That was followed by a quiet statistical game against the Bengals in Week 2, but he did lead the Texans to their first win.Since then he has thrown 18 touchdown passes in his past five games, including five against the Kansas City Chiefs in a 42-34 loss on Oct. 8.The main benefactors have been DeAndre Hopkins and Will Fuller V, who share the NFL lead with seven touchdown catches apiece.Hopkins topped his 2016 season total of four by Week 5 and his 224 receiving yards in Week 8 against the Seahawks is a single-game high in the NFL.Fuller has just 13 catches on the season with seven going for TDs -- and he missed the first four games of the season with a broken collarbone."We all make each other better," Hopkins said earlier this season."[Watson] getting the ball where it needs to be.Just getting the ball to his playmakers.He makes the whole team better, not just me."Setting the pace for all QBs Watson's start wasn't just good for a rookie -- he's leading the NFL in three major categories, including rushing yards.That kind of versatility has been fun for the Texans' coaching staff to utilize."Having a guy with athleticism as well as somebody who can stand in the pocket [and] throw the ball down the field, somebody who's an intelligent player, instinctive player, certainly kind of opens things up for you, no question," quarterbacks coach Sean Ryan said.Where Watson was at his best Watson, who is the first rookie quarterback to win AFC Offensive Player of the Month, thrived operating out of play-action, especially from Week 3 on, during which he has passed for 18 touchdowns and the Texans have averaged 30.7 points a game.O'Brien is learning weekly what the rookie can do."He's got some pretty good insight, even though he's a young player," O'Brien said."So, I don't think it's so much that he suggests plays, it's more about the plays that are -- you know, maybe there's four or five plays in the game that he has a suggestion about tweaking a little bit during the week, and it's usually a good one, which is pretty interesting.That's usually the case with really good players.They know what they're talking about."What they're saying about Watson So why weren't the Texans winning?Houston enters Sunday's game against the Colts 3-4, and 3-3 in Watson starts.For all the excitement Watson generated, NFL FPI gave the Texans a 31 percent chance of making the playoffs before he was injured.One of the big reasons is the play of their defense.The Texans have scored 30-plus points a league-high five times this season, but they've gone 2-3 in those games.They went 36-3 when scoring 30-plus points from 2002 to '16.The Texans have allowed 26.9 points per game this season, 29th in the NFL.That's almost 6.5 points more per game than they allowed last season (20.5).But much of that is because of injuries and offseason losses in free agency from the top-ranked defense in the NFL last season.ESPN Stats & Information, Rebecca Carman and ESPN Texans reporter Sarah Barshop contributed to this report.
Saints defend team's support of military after vet declines award:::::METAIRIE, La.-- The New Orleans Saints released a statement Thursday saying it is "unfortunate and disappointing" that a retired Navy commander who declined an honor at Sunday's game has been telling media outlets he no longer supports NFL football because of player protests throughout the league before and during the national anthem."We will not allow Mr. [John] Wells' decision and subsequent media appearances to distract our players and organization from continuing to honor and support our military and veterans," the Saints said in their statement, which stressed the organization's "unwavering 50-plus year commitment to honor, support and recognize our servicemen and women and veterans."In the statement, the Saints also emphasized their players have stood for the anthem in every game since the franchise's inception in 1967, with the exception of "the Week Three game at Carolina when a few of our players did sit."Since then, Saints players have chosen to kneel before the anthem in a display of unity, then stand during the anthem.Still, many fans have booed the kneeling players inside the Superdome even though the booing has not taken place during the anthem.Saints safety?Kenny Vaccaro?and defensive end Cameron Jordan touched upon this on their Twitter accounts Thursday, with Vaccaro writing, "Our crowd boos us before the anthem, therefore it's not about the flag, it's about the fact we are bringing awareness to a cause that makes people uncomfortable."Jordan tweeted about how fans have "ignored" the reason behind the player protests.Wells, who is the executive director of the national Military Veterans Advocacy in Slidell, Louisiana, was selected as a Peoples Health Champion, an award given at Saints home games to recognize "the exceptional achievements of Louisiana residents age 65 and older."However, Wells declined the honor, calling the protests during the anthem a "slap in the face to veterans" in a news release and saying he could not "in good conscience" enter an NFL stadium."Although I am touched and honored to be selected for such an award, the ongoing controversy with NFL players' disrespect for the national flag forces me to decline to participate in the presentation," Wells said according to the release."Since this award is tainted with the dishonorable actions of the NFL and its players, I cannot accept it."The Saints released their lengthy statement in response on Thursday afternoon: "Respectfully and honorably, we chose Mr. Wells for the Peoples Health Champion Award purposefully for this game to bring to light the exact issues that he and his organization represent -- the health and well-being of our military, veterans and their families.Unfortunately, he has chosen very publicly not to accept this honor and refused the opportunity to promote the very cause for which he was being honored and distract from awareness we hoped to build throughout our community.We respect his decision, he has that right, and we thank him for his service to our country and his past efforts on behalf of the military and veterans."The Saints went on to list the community appearances and financial commitments the team has made to military and related organizations, and to stress that owner Tom Benson -- a former Naval officer -- has been honored and recognized as a longtime supporter of the military.They said they would use the time at Sunday's game that had been allotted for Wells' award to "highlight non-political military advocacy programs and encourage our fans and community to join us in contributing to these groups who directly support our military and veterans."
Federal appeals court: Cowboys' Elliott can play Sunday:::::Dallas Cowboys running back Ezekiel Elliott can play in Sunday's home game against Kansas City while a federal appeals court considers a challenge to his six-game suspension.The 2nd U.S.Circuit Court of Appeals in New York City issued a one-page order Friday temporarily blocking a lower-court ruling that cleared the way this week for Elliott to begin serving the disciplinary penalty.Circuit Judge Susan Carney granted a request from the NFL Players Association for Elliott to be allowed to play Sunday.In the meantime, a three-judge panel will decide whether the appeal will be handled in expedited fashion and whether Elliott will continue to be allowed to play before the appeal is decided.The suspension was imposed in August after the NFL investigated several alleged physical confrontations in the summer of 2016 with Elliott's girlfriend at the time.The NFL submitted papers to the 2nd Circuit on Thursday, arguing that the appeals court should not block the suspension any longer because the union has no chance of winning its appeal.It said "swift discipline" should not be manipulated by players and teams seeking to strategically time court challenges so that suspensions are served when they play weaker opponents or when an injury would already require a player to remain off the field.Lawyers on both sides did not immediately return messages seeking comment Friday.U.S. District Judge Katherine Polk Failla ruled Monday that the 22-year-old player must begin the suspension.Lawyers for the players' union said Failla was the first judge ever to have "concluded that professional athletes with short career spans do not face irreparable harm" when suspensions are enforced before appeals options have been exhausted.The NFL said about 100 players have been suspended for approximately 500 games over the past season and a half.The Cowboys (4-3) are in second place in the NFC East.They face a Chiefs team that is 6-2 and leads the AFC West.
Houston honoring World Series champion Astros with parade:::::Hundreds of Astros fans clad in orange shirts and jerseys crowded downtown Houston streets early Friday hours ahead of an afternoon parade to honor their World Series champions.Many fans waved Astros banners and small pennants or played catch in front of City Hall, where a rally will he held after the parade begins at 2 p.m.The crowd roared with cheers and applause when someone started playing Queen's classic song, "We Are the Champions."Several cars drove through the parade route before it was closed to traffic, honking their vehicles' horns as the drivers and passengers waved to fans along the route.Manuel Mejia and his 15-year-old son, Jonah, had snatched a key spot along the route by 9 a.m..The pair set up four foldable chairs at a street corner where they'll be able to see the start and end of the parade."I'm just trying to get a good spot.It's going to get packed," the 43-year-old father said, noting he's been an Astros fan since his father took him to his first Astros game when he was 8 years old.But he said the World Series win is great for all of Houston, as the city continues to recover from Hurricane Harvey and the devastating rains and flooding that followed the storm."For the city, this is great," Mejia said.The Astros took home their first championship in franchise history with a Game 7 win Wednesday in Los Angeles against the Dodgers.Playing for a city still recovering from Hurricane Harvey, and wearing an "H Strong" logo on their jerseys, the Astros won the title that had eluded them since they started out in 1962 as the Colt .45s.The new champs will be honored with a parade that will travel through downtown Houston, culminating in a rally where Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner will be the master of ceremonies.The Houston school district cancelled classes on Friday so students, staff and their families could attend the parade.
Jets save season with stifling D, strong running game:::::Muhammad Wilkerson challenged the New York Jets' defense to hold the Buffalo Bills to 60 yards rushing.Steve McLendon thought 80 would be more realistic.The two D-linemen compromised and settled on 70 and then went out and got the job done.The Jets kept the Bills to just 63 yards on the ground, including 25 on 12 carries by LeSean McCoy, in an impressive 34-21 victory Thursday night.It was a glimmer of what New York has been hoping to see all season from its beleaguered defense."Mo, after the last game, brought us all up and said, 'This isn't who we are going to be.This isn't us,'" linebacker Jordan Jenkins said."He said, 'We have to keep fighting.We have to stop messing around, and we have to finish.'"Mission accomplished.After blowing fourth-quarter leads in their last two games, the Jets (4-5) snapped a three-game skid by making big plays on defense and harassing Bills quarterback Tyrod Taylor all night.New York came in second-to-last in the NFL with just 11 sacks through the first eight games.The Jets had seven in this one, including two by Jenkins."We've got a high ceiling," said defensive end Leonard Williams, who got his first half-sack of the season."We showed we can get takeaways, we showed we can get sacks, we showed we can stop the run.This is our first game putting it all together in a complete game."I feel like now that we showed it and put in on film, we'll definitely challenge ourselves to keep progressing."Add in a rejuvenated running game that rumbled for 194 yards just four days after Matt Forte complained about offensive coordinator John Morton not sticking to the run, and New York might just be able to stick around in the AFC playoff hunt."The defense was lights out," said quarterback Josh McCown, who threw for 140 yards and a touchdown and also ran for a score."They set the tone getting stops.We went three-and-out that first drive and we were committed to running it and we showed it."Here are some other things to know from the Jets' victory over the Bills: THUMBS DOWN ON THURSDAYS: Buffalo guard Richie Incognito made it clear that he's no fan of the short work week."It's tough man.These Thursday night games (stink)," he said."They throw a wrench in our schedules.It's absolutely ridiculous that we have to do this.As physical as this game is and as much work and preparation that goes into this, to force us to play games on four-day weeks is completely unfair and ... the league makes money off it and that's all they care about anyway."We just keep trucking, we have a tough group of guys in this locker room, and back to the drawing board and back to Buffalo."COOL RUNNING: New York had just 43 yards on 22 carries in its 25-20 loss to Atlanta on Sunday in rain-soaked conditions.That prompted Forte, who gained 7 yards on four attempts, to criticize Morton for not sticking to the run-heavy game plan.Well, no complaints after this one.Forte had a season-high 77 yards on 14 carries, Bilal Powell ran for 74 yards on nine attempts and rookie Elijah McGuire added 30 yards on 13 rushes."We had some difficulties and frustrations, and on a short week, addressed them on Monday," Forte said."And to come out on a Thursday and run the ball like we did and throw the ball like we did as well, we did a great job.Kudos to coach Johnny Mo for sticking with the run, like he said he'd do."SHUT DOWN SHADY: McCoy ran for 110 yards in the teams' first meeting, Buffalo's 21-12 victory in Week 1.He also had five catches for 49 yards.The Jets made him a non-factor this time around, with his 25 yards being his second-lowest rushing total this year.McCoy was also held without a catch for the first time this season."They beat us down," McCoy said.DON'T LET IT LINGER: The Bills had won four of their last five to start turning some doubters into believers.But they struggled all night in pass protection, running the ball and with their discipline.While no one was saying they should forget what happened, the message throughout the locker room was to not allow the loss to poison the rest of the season."I don't think this is who we are," linebacker Lorenzo Alexander said."It's about pride and how we approach the game.You've got to be strong in your fundamentals and we weren't tonight."Taylor likes where the Bills stand at 5-3 in what looks like a wide-open AFC wild-card race."I think we're in a good spot," he said."Tonight definitely was a challenge for us and we didn't step up.As a team, we have a choice to make and I think we will make the right steps and move forward."NO KELVIN: The Bills opted to deactivate wide receiver Kelvin Benjamin, who they acquired Tuesday from Carolina.Benjamin, in his third NFL season he sat out 2015 with an injury is expected to be a starting wideout when he's ready."You don't want to put a guy out there who isn't ready," Taylor said."It was a smart move."Coach Sean McDermott wouldn't speculate when Benjamin might be ready, but the Bills are off until Nov. 12, when they face New Orleans.For more NFL coverage: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/APNFL
AP sources: Texans QB Watson out for season with ACL tear:::::Texans quarterback Deshaun Watson sustained a season-ending knee injury in practice on Thursday, two people familiar with the situation told The Associated Press.The rookie suffered a torn anterior cruciate ligament in one of his knees and will go on injured reserve.The people spoke on the condition of anonymity because the team hadn't announced the injury.His injury is the latest blow to a team that lost three-time NFL Defensive Player of the Year J.J. Watt and linebacker Whitney Mercilus to season-ending injuries on Oct. 8.The former Clemson standout had been a bright spot in a challenging season for the Texans (3-4).The 12th overall pick in this year's draft was the AFC offensive player of the month after throwing for 1,171 yards with 16 touchdowns and running for 145 yards and another score.Clemson coach Dabo Swinney, talked about Watson's injury, and noted that he rebounded from the same injury when he was with the Tigers."I talked to Deshaun late this afternoon and we are disappointed," Swinney said."But, he is a person who has had some setbacks in his life, and always comes back stronger.Since he went through the rehab before, he knows what it takes."Watson also tore his ACL in 2014 as a freshman at Clemson."All he did after the injury in 2014 was come back and lead us to the national championship game twice and of course we won it last year," Swinney said."He started all 30 games the last two years here.I have no doubt he will come back from this.He has the resolve.His work ethic and drive are incredible."Many people took to Twitter to express dismay at the injury and wish Watson well.Watt tweeted: "Minor setback for a major comeback.We've all seen what's possible, can't wait to see what's next.With you every step of the way 4,".NBA superstar LeBron James tweeted a link to a story about his injury and wrote: "This seriously just made me sad man!!Get well and stronger asap."Watson's development this season had been a revelation for a team that has featured a revolving door at quarterback over recent years.The Texans signed Brock Osweiler to a $72 million contract before last season, but he was benched before the season was over and shipped to Cleveland in the offseason.When Houston traded up 13 picks to take Watson, many assumed he'd be the starter to open the season.But Coach Bill O'Brien insisted he back up Tom Savage.Watson's time as a backup was short-lived as Savage struggled in the opener and was benched at halftime, making the former Clemson standout the ninth quarterback the Texans have played in the past five years.Watson made his first start in Week 2 and immediately excelled, leading the Texans to a 13-9 win on the road against the Bengals.Since then, he's turned a team known for defense into one with a high-flying offense.Under his guidance, the Texans had scored 30 or more points in five straight games to set a franchise record.Watson's 19 touchdown passes are tied for the league lead and are the most in NFL history through a player's first seven games.He leads all quarterbacks this season with 21 touchdowns overall and has thrown four or more touchdown passes in three games this season to join Fran Tarkenton as the only rookies in NFL history to do so.Now with his brilliant season cut short, the Texans will look to Savage to salvage this injury-plagued season and try to reach the playoffs for the third straight season.The Texans host the Colts (2-6) on Sunday and Indianapolis announced earlier Thursday that franchise quarterback Andrew Luck had been placed on injured reserve as he recovers from a shoulder problem that hasn't allowed him to play at all this season.The Texans will sign Matt McGloin to back up Savage, a person familiar with the move told The AP on the condition of anonymity because the team hadn't announced it.McGloin, who played for O'Brien at Penn State, was released by the Eagles on Sept. 1.For more NFL coverage: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/APNFL
NYC circles the wagons around marathon after truck attack:::::In a city shaken by its deadliest terrorist attack since 9/11, police are promising an unprecedented security effort to try to secure a soft target spanning five boroughs and 26.2 miles: the New York City Marathon.City officials have sought to calm the nerves of more than 50,000 runners and huge crowds of onlookers expected to line the marathon route by insisting it should go off Sunday without a hitch only days after a truck attack killed eight people in lower Manhattan.The security detail will include hundreds of extra uniformed patrol and plainclothes officers, roving teams of counterterrorism commandos armed with heavy weapons, bomb-sniffing dogs and rooftop snipers poised to shoot if a threat emerges.The Police Department is also turning to a tactic it has used to protect Trump Tower and the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade: 16-ton sanitation trucks filled with sand.The trucks, along with "blocker cars," will be positioned at key intersections to try and prevent anyone from driving onto the course.Marathoners from around the world who have been streaming into the city in anticipation of the race expressed mixed feelings about running so soon after the carnage."I can be really scared of it when I am at home and in front of the TV," Annemerel de Jongh, 28, of The Hague, Netherlands, said Thursday as she picked up her race number at a Manhattan convention center."But when I am running I feel maybe a little bit invincible, like nothing can happen to me.I can run away from it."The New York Police Department said it has no information pointing to any credible threat against the race.There is no question, though, that the course provides a security challenge, even for a police department with 35,000 officers.The race starts in a relatively secure location.Runners gather at Staten Island's Fort Wadsworth, a former military installation now partially occupied by the U.S. Coast Guard.From there, though, the race heads through residential neighborhoods with hundreds of spots where an attacker could steer a vehicle onto the thickly packed course.Streets leading to the course are closed, but on many of them, in most years, the only barrier is a blue, wooden sawhorse and a thin plastic tape.The crowd is so big, runners start in waves, meaning some people will still be standing on the starting line while competitors in the wheelchair division are crossing the finish."It will be an extraordinary event, as it always is," Mayor Bill de Blasio said this week at a news conference."It will be well protected, as it always is."The attack Tuesday, on a bicycle path miles from the marathon route, was a grim reminder of how the Islamic State group is using its propaganda to encourage radicalized "lone wolves" to cause harm with unsophisticated means in easily accessible settings.The attack by an alleged Islamic State group supporter "appears to have followed, almost exactly to a T, the instructions ISIS has put out in its social media channels," said the NYPD's top counterterrorism official, John Miller.An online Islamic State group magazine posted last year extolled using trucks to kill innocent victims, saying, "Vehicles are like knives, as they are extremely easy to acquire."It also advised "surveying the route for obstacles, such as posts, signs, barriers, humps, bus stops, dumpsters, etc.which is important for sidewalk-mounted attacks."Investigators say there's evidence the suspect, 29-year-old Sayfullo Saipov, did reconnaissance before driving a Home Depot rental truck through an unobstructed entry to a bike path in lower Manhattan and mowing down cyclists and pedestrians.A police officer shot and wounded Saipov before he was arrested and charged with supporting terrorism and other federal counts.The shift away from sophisticated large-scale attacks like the one on the World Trade Center's twin towers on Sept. 11, 2001, to smaller ones on soft targets has forced law enforcement to become more adept at how to prevent and respond to terrorism, said Karen Greenberg, director of Fordham Law School's Center on National Security."I don't think people should be worried," Greenberg said."The police know what they are doing.Look at how few successful attacks there have been."Safety adjustments made by organizers of the New York City Marathon following the bombing of the Boston Marathon in 2013 like banning backpacks and costumes remain in place, said Chris Weiller, spokesman for New York Road Runners.Despite widespread news reports and images of the trail of bodies left by the truck attack, the cancellation rate has remained about the same, he said.Boston Marathon organizers, working with local, state and federal law enforcement, also significantly enhanced security along the course after the 2013 attack, including more officers deployed on race day, a no-fly zone over the course and drones to help with surveillance.New York Marathon entrant Kris Ledegen, 49, of Herdersem, Belgium, said he never considered skipping the race.One of the women killed in Tuesday's attack was from Belgium.The country was also the scene of an

Week 10 preview: Bedlam at its best; Heisman RB rebounds:::::The first College Football Playoff rankings are out and seven games matching ranked teams this weekend have the potential to make the second rankings look much different.The seven ranked vs. ranked games match a record for one week in the history of the AP poll.It's happened five times previously, the last in 2015.Also, unlike many Saturdays, the best games aren't stacked up in one time slot.Usually, the television networks stuff the prime-time window with most of the day's best games.Last week, the 3:30 ET window was overloaded and had fans wearing out their remotes and firing up multiple screens.On Saturday, a fan can watch games matching ranked teams from noon (No.3 Ohio State at Iowa) until whenever #Pac12AfterDark (No.23 Arizona at No.17 Southern California) ends.Things to know about week 10 of the college football season.BEST GAME No.8 Oklahoma at No.11 Oklahoma State Two of the top five offenses.Two Heisman Trophy contender quarterbacks.Two teams with playoff hopes that can't afford another loss.When it comes to Bedlam, it doesn't get much better than this one.Baker Mayfield and the Sooners have won the last two meetings against Mason Rudolph and the Cowboys, though Rudolph hardly played in the 2015 meeting.In the last five meetings, both teams have scored at least 20 points and the winner has reached 33 points in all those games.By the numbers, the Cowboys have the advantage on the defensive side, ranking 19th in the country in yards allowed per play (4.79).The Sooners defense has been a problem, ranking 71st in the nation (5.63 yards per play).HEISMAN WATCH Mayfield and Rudolph both have a chance to make Heisman statements, but two running backs trying to bounce back are the pick here.Penn State's Saquon Barkley was held to 44 yards on 21 carries last week in a loss to Ohio State, though he did have a 97-yard kickoff return for a touchdown and another long scoring run.The seventh-ranked Nittany Lions try to rebound from their first loss of the season against No.24 Michigan State and its stingy run defense, allowing 2.83 yards per rush.Later, No.20 Stanford hopes to have Bryce Love back in action against No.25 Washington State.The Cardinal played without the nation's leading rusher last week against Oregon State, and barely escaped with a last-second victory.NUMBERS TO KNOW 6 No.1 Alabama's winning streak against LSU, the longest in the series since the Crimson Tide won 11 in a row from 1971-81.13 Seasons in which Miami has been a member of the Atlantic Coast Conference without reaching the league championship game.The ninth-ranked Hurricanes can clinch their first division title by beating No.13 Virginia Tech at home and having Georgia Tech lose at Virginia.Even if the Yellow Jackets don't help, the Hurricanes will be in great shape with a victory to earn a trip to Charlotte.36 Number of plays of at least 30 yards for Arizona, the most in FBS.That includes four runs of at least 70 yards from quarterback Khalil Tate.75 J.T.Barrett's completion percentage during Ohio State's six-game winning streak.UNDER THE RADAR Can Florida and Florida State get bowl eligible?Both need November winning streaks to get there, and that includes a game against each other.Any chance the Gators (3-4) and Seminoles (2-5) have to salvage their disappointing seasons starts Saturday with games that before the season would have appeared to be gimmes.Florida plays its first game under interim coach Randy Shannon at Missouri.Florida State hosts Syracuse.Both Florida and Florida State had games cancelled by the hurricanes in September and, for now, will play only 11 games.HOT SEAT WATCH Kevin Sumlin, Texas A&M The Aggies are in danger of another second-half swoon after losing at home to Mississippi State last week to drop to 5-3.Now, No.14 Auburn comes to College Station.The road team has won each meeting between these teams since A&M joined the SEC in 2012.Sumlin has not been able to get over the eight-win hump in his last three seasons and Aggies fans want more.To do so, Texas A&M needs to upset the Tigers.Follow Ralph D.

Stephen Curry puzzled over mention in GOP tax talking points:::::Golden State Warriors superstar Stephen Curry doesn't know how he became the only person named in the House Republicans' tax plan."It was weird, that's about it," Curry said following Golden State's 112-92 win over San Antonio Thursday night."There's a lot of people wondering why I was called out, whatever the case may be, but mama, I made it."Accompanying the 429-page bill unveiled Thursday were talking points for Republicans that included the following paragraph: "The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act includes specific safeguards to prevent tax avoidance and help ensure taxpayers of all income levels play by the rules under this new fairer, simpler tax system," the tax proposal stated."Our legislation will ensure this much-needed tax relief goes to the local job creators it's designed to help by distinguishing between the individual wage income of NBA All-Star Stephen Curry and the pass-through business income of Steve's Bike Shop."Curry learned about his place in the plan Thursday and had a question."I wonder if Steve's Bike Shop is hiring," Curry tweeted.Curry was the first NBA player to sign a super-max contract in July following a restructuring of the league's collective bargaining agreement.Perhaps that's why he was named an example for individual wage income.In fact, the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee and its chairman, Rep. Kevin Brady, R-Texas, have mentioned famous people to explain the impact of tax policy on real people on several occasions.A committee blog post in August referenced Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, and in a speech in February, the chairman mentioned a football superstar, saying, "We decided that it was finally time to stop taxing Tom's Bike Shop and Tom Brady at the same rate."A committee spokesman said Friday it uses well-known people to help explain wage income from small business income.Curry has been singled out by Washington Republicans before the top one, in fact.In September, President Donald Trump criticized the Warriors for saying they may not visit the White House.Championship teams have traditionally visited the president, but the Warriors were wavering because of their disapproval of Trump.Warriors coach Steve Kerr has roundly criticized Trump, as has Curry.But it was the two-time NBA MVP that drew Trump's ire."Going to the White House is considered a great honor for a championship team," Trump tweeted."Stephen Curry is hesitating, therefore invitation is withdrawn!"Associated Press writer Donna Cassata in Washington contributed to this report.More AP basketball: https://apnews.com/tag/NBAbasketball
Keep the train rolling: Astros could be back for more titles:::::It's not just one World Series title that has Houston excited.With Jose Altuve, Carlos Correa, George Springer and more locked in for years to come, the Astros are ready to be a force for some time.Houston's plan to endure a difficult rebuild has put the team in a great position moving forward.No player in Houston's starting lineup for Game 7 of the World Series will be free agent earlier than 2019.Alex Bregman and Yuli Gurriel are under team control until 2023, and All-Star shortstop Correa can't hit free agency until 2022.Springer, the World Series MVP, is under control through 2021, and promising young starter Lance McCullers Jr. is under team control until 2022.Altuve has team-friendly club options for the next two seasons that will keep him in town through 2019 at least.While everyone else is chasing high-priced free agents, Houston should be set, especially after acquiring ace Justin Verlander on Aug. 31 from the Detroit Tigers.Verlander is owed $56 million over the next two seasons combined before possibly becoming a free agent.All of that was made possible by patience from owner Jim Crane and general manager Jeff Luhnow.The Astros were the laughingstock of baseball after trading away their veterans to shed payroll, losing 100 games every year from 2011-13, including a franchise-worst 51-111 mark in 2013.With the losing came a bevy of high draft picks, and Houston hit big on a few of them.In Luhnow's first draft in 2012, Houston took Correa with the first overall pick and nabbed McCullers at 41st overall.Then in 2015, they grabbed Bregman with the second overall pick.They weren't without their misses.Most notably Mark Appel, who they famously drafted first overall in 2013.The right-hander never played for the Astros and was eventually traded, while Kris Bryant, who Houston passed on to take Appel, won National League MVP and helped the Cubs win the World Series last season.Only four players on the World Series team were around for any of the 100-loss seasons, and Altuve was the only one with Houston for all three."It's a crazy journey, man," Altuve said."I was the only one in 2011, '12 and '13, those 100 losses, three years in a row.It's not easy.But I ... believed in the process.I believed in what Jeff Luhnow and Jim Crane used to (say) to me: 'Hey, we're going to be good.We're going to be good.'"Altuve said their encouragement and seeing the pieces slowly come together helped get him through the difficult times."(I was like) 'OK, let me keep working hard.Let me get better every year and try to be part of the winning team,'" he said."I always believed that we're going to become good.Then I saw Springer get drafted, Correa and Bregman, and I was like: 'OK, here we go.'"The heart of this team, Altuve followed up a brilliant regular season where he led the majors with a .346 average by hitting seven homers and driving in 14 runs in the playoffs.His work this year made him a front-runner to become the first Astro to be named MVP since Hall of Famer Jeff Bagwell won the NL award in 1994.With Altuve returning to lead this team and ample talent around him, the young and confident bunch has plenty of reason to believe that this could be the first of many titles for a team that waited so long for the first one.Back in Houston, fans celebrated the Series title at Minute Maid Park on Wednesday night the city's first championship since the Rockets won NBA titles in 1994 and '95.The crowd erupted after the final out, and Bobby Dynamite pulled hard on the whistle in the train located beyond left field.Houston's not done chugging along by a long shot, either."I want to celebrate tonight, go back and have a nice little parade," Bregman said after Game 7."And then guess what?We're going to go back, work our (butts) off, and do it again next year."More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball
Home of Dodgers' Puig burglarized during World Series:::::Police say the home of Los Angeles Dodgers star Yasiel Puig was burglarized while his team was losing the World Series.Police say officers answered a burglary alarm at the Encino, California, home Wednesday evening and found a smashed window with several items taken.There's no word on the value of the items.Puig was at Dodger Stadium, where the team lost Game 7 to Houston 5-1.A neighbor, Zach Eliass, tells KABC-TV that Puig's two German shepherds got out of an open gate.Eliass took them in until Puig returned home and calmly thanked him.Puig bought the home about a month ago.Earlier this year, burglars hit Puig's Sherman Oaks, California, home and stole about $170,000 in jewelry and other items while he was at spring training in Arizona.
UEFA-led plan for global soccer competition every 2 years:::::More worldwide soccer tournaments involving even more national teams could be coming to every odd-numbered year.Officials briefed on the UEFA-led Global Nations League project told The Associated Press it can replace many often-meaningless friendly matches.The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because talks are confidential.The plan would invite all 223 members of soccer's six continental confederations and take place every two years.The format expands on UEFA's Nations League, which kicks off next September in Europe."UEFA can confirm that it has initiated discussions regarding the evolution of the UEFA Nations League," the governing body of European soccer said Friday in a statement.Teams would be graded in seven divisions according to their FIFA ranking.Each confederation would run its own qualifying groups with promotion and relegation every two years.Group winners would advance to eight-team intercontinental tournaments in each of the seven divisions played in June, and broadcast around the clock.The first mini-tournaments each in a knockout bracket and each hosted over one week in a different country could be played in 2021, the officials said.If approved, it means teams like Germany and Brazil, Spain and Argentina, Japan and the United States, could play each other competitively between each World Cup, maybe even twice.In the competition format being discussed, the top division final tournaments would include three European teams, two from South America, plus one each from Africa, Asia, and the North American region.Oceania teams would play in the fourth tier, the officials said.The project is still being discussed by soccer's six confederations with FIFA.They would be invited to team up in a new entity to jointly manage the event."These constructive discussions involve our national associations, European football stakeholders, all confederations and of course FIFA, with whom we have a very good relationship," UEFA said."We have included (FIFA) in discussions on this topic since the start.No decisions have been made at this time."The concept is to give national teams competitive games against opponents at a similar level, and to replace friendlies that are less interesting to fans and broadcasters.The likely appeal of the Global Nations League for most FIFA member federations, who rarely qualify for a World Cup, is a realistic chance to compete for a trophy and prize money by qualifying for a final tournament.It would also align with the FIFA-managed calendar of playing dates when clubs must release players for national-team duty.The June 2021 dates are seen as a prime slot for a new or expanded competition because FIFA has said the Confederations Cup is at risk of being scrapped.A potential issue is FIFA President Gianni Infantino's suggestion of a 24-team Club World Cup as an option for June 2021.The FIFA Council will discuss a review of international competitions in March at a meeting in Bogota, Colombia.Still, a Global Nations League raising the profile of national teams would appeal more to FIFA member federations.They get few benefits from the success of elite clubs and are in line to get a share of Global Nations League revenue from centralized commercial deals.Broadcast rights to the proposed new competition are seen as likely to interest media companies now focusing on sports, such as Amazon, Google and Netflix, according to a briefing document seen by the AP.
