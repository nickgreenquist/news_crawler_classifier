WhatsApp’s hour-long outage today was global in scale, likely caused by software bug:::::Did WhatsApp go down for you earlier today?You werent alone.The Facebook-owned messaging service experienced a roughly hour-long global outage on Friday, which led to difficulties in accessing the app and sending messages to friends.While no online service is immune to the occasional hiccup, this outage was notable for its global scale which impacted WhatsApps sizable user base.The company today has over 1.2 billion users, and is relied upon as the main means of messaging for many people, particularly in emerging markets like India.The outage was first reported by Reuters, which noted that whatsappdown was a trending item on Twitter in countries like India, the apps biggest market with around 200 million of WhatsApps over one billion users.Other countries where the outage was popping up on social media included Pakistan, Britain, Germany, Brazil, Russia, Vietnam, and Myanmar, Reuters had said.WhatsApp today released a brief statement, confirming the outages global scale after the situation was resolved.Earlier today, WhatsApp users globally had trouble accessing the app for about an hour.This issue has been fixed and we apologize for the inconvenience, a spokesperson said.We understand that the outage was caused by a bug in the software code, as opposed to something like issues with a data center, for example.Its not very common for WhatsApp to be unavailable worldwide.Most outages tend to be regional in scale, as opposed to affecting app users around the globe.But not everyone today noticed the outage due to how quickly it was resolved.The service began functioning again some regions around 30 minutes after the first complaints began popping up, Reuters had noted.That means that by the time some users began hearing about the problem, WhatsApp was already working for them again.However, this was not WhatsApps first global outage this year.The app in May had experienced downtime of a few hours a longer outage than todays.Featured Image: Erik Tham/Getty Images
Hevo Data gets $1M in seed funding to streamline data integration:::::Going from food delivery to data integration might seem like an unlikely progression for a startup team, but it was a natural fit for Hevo Datas founders.Manish Jethani and Sourabh Agarwal previously launched SpoonJoy, an on-demand restaurant delivery app in India.The challenges they encountered while analyzing data in order to improve SpoonJoys service inspired them to form Hevo Data, a cloud-based data integration platform which just raised $1 million in seed funding led by IDG Ventures India.Hevo Data chief executive officer Jethani (Agarwal is its chief technology officer) explains that SpoonJoy, whose investors included SAIF Partners, needed to analyze data from many sources.For example, if order volume started to drop in one area, the team would look at web and ad traffic, customer engagement and feedback, as well as activity by competing services.That meant they needed to draw on data from Google Analytics, Mixpanel, Zendesk or Salesforce, which had to be organized and formatted first.This is a time-consuming process and without a data integration platform, small to medium-sized companies may only be able to analyze data once or twice a week.One of the challenges of food delivery is that the data needs to be highly optimized, says Jethani.Food margins are very low, so if your delivery cost is high, you will not make money.So we built a lot of technology to optimize the logistics part of things.We fundamentally come from a very strong engineering and data background and we wanted to solve food delivery with data.SpoonJoy was acquired by Grofers, one of Indias largest online grocery delivery services, in 2015.Afterward, Jethani and Agarwal spent a year working at Grofers before founding Hevo Data, which has offices in Bangalore and San Francisco.Jethani says Hevo Datas solutions can reduce the amount of time needed to prepare data to a few minutes.One reason companies sign up for data integration services is to get data ready for machine learning algorithms, since those algorithms are only as good as their training data.Hevo Data doesnt target specific industries, but its typical clients are small to medium-sized companies with engineering teams of less than 400 people, which means they need to make sure data scientists and engineers are spending most of their time developing algorithms and getting insights out of data instead of organizing it.It took us a lot of time to get data into one place before we could start analysis.Its very inefficient if multiple people are engaged in just cleaning up and bringing in data instead of analyzing it, says Jethani.If we can cut the cycle from a few weeks to a few minutes, we can respond to the needs of businesses faster.This is especially important for companies that need to analyze data almost as soon as they get it, like on-demand food delivery services (Swiggy, Indias largest food delivery service, is one of Hevo Datas clients).Hevo Data is cloud-neutral, so users can run it on whatever cloud platform they use, including Amazon AWS, Google Cloud Platform and Microsoft Azure.It also offers an on-premise version of its platform for larger companies that have a private cloud.Hevo Data, which will use its seed round to hire more engineers and expand in the United States, competes with other data integration companies like Informatica, Pentaho and Talend.Jethani says Hevo Datas advantage is that it is cloud-native and therefore better equipped to handle real-time data.More and more things are happening in real-time, so our architecture is designed to deal with real-time data flowing in high speeed, says Jethani.In a statement, IDG Ventures India executive director Venkatesh Peddi said Today enterprises are investing heavily in technology to strengthen and empower their data teams to gain the competitive advantage in their space.We invested in Hevo Data because we saw a strong team building a great product that fills a critical gap in the market.Featured Image: John Lund/Getty Images
Lazy Jar’s app makes you pay for not exercising enough:::::Want to exercise more, but lack motivation?An app called Lazy Jar, aimed at Fitbit owners, may be able to help.The app actually penalizes you a monetary amount if you fail to meet the fitness goals youve set for yourself, in terms of metrics like steps per week, miles walked, or calories burned, for example.The idea that some people may need a little bit of an extra push to start exercising isnt a unique concept.Other apps have offered this sort of cash penalty system before, like GymPact.However, GymPact takes a different approach it rewards active members with cash paid by members who dont hit their health goals.Lazy Jar wont reward you with cash payouts, it will simply slap your wrist when you screw up.Explains founder Justin Anyanwu, we want people to focus on a healthier more active lifestyle as its own reward.Thats fair.You shouldnt be working out for cash anyway you should be doing it for you.Plus, he says, programs with rewards incentivize cheating.Justin believes most people want to get in shape, but theres a shortage of discipline and patience, especially when getting started.Its a pain point he experienced himself, which led him to make Lazy Jar.I built Lazy Jar because I was getting frustrated with my own lack of discipline.Ive joined countless exciting gyms, and I leave after a couple of months, says Justin.Even though I was making progress, I merely found myself making excuses to stop going.I was getting fed up with falling off the wagon too often.I also needed something that could guarantee that I was physically active every day.Something that helped me see fitness as part of my lifestyle and not just a chore I had to do, he adds.Lazy Jars approach to making people more consistent about their exercise routines is by punishing users with very real consequence when they dont meet their goals.In Lazy Jar, you commit to a six-month program where you push themselves to meet your weekly Fitbit goals.You set what your goals should be using Lazy Jars in-app controls, as well as the weekly penalty amount for any week where you fall short.As an extra motivation, Lazy Jar takes a refundable $30 security deposit to guarantee its users are committed to the program.Even if you never meet your goals, youll still get this money back at the end of the program.But if you cancel your account or quit during the six months, youll lose the money for good.Justin says Lazy Jar only keeps 20 percent of the money it makes from penalties, and donates the rest to charity.(This may not be a sustainable business model for the long-term, but at least for now you know your money is doing some good.)Currently, the money is going to St. Judes Childrens Hospital, but more charities will be added in time.392x696bb (14) 392x696bb (15) 392x696bb (16) 392x696bb (13) 392x696bb (17) View Slideshow Previous Next Exit Since launching earlier this year, some Apple Watch owners have asked for a version that works with their wearable, too.Justin says this is now in the works, and will arrive at some point early next year.Lazy Jar is live on iOS and Android, as a free download.
Sources: Snap has acquired Metamarkets for less than $100M to step up its ad tech play:::::As Snap, the parent company of Snapchat, gears up to report its quarterly earnings next week, it looks like the company is making some moves to beef up its primary business line, advertising.TechCrunch has learned that the company has acquired Metamarkets, an ad tech startup that provides programmatic ad data-related services to marketers, such as a data dashboard to measure how campaigns are performing; an API to import your programmatic data into other apps; and inventory discovery and bid monitoring for exchanges.Clients that use its data tools include large media properties like Twitter and Oath (which owns TechCrunch but also Yahoo and Aol and the Huffington Post), marketing dashboard Nanigans and many more.Neither Snap nor Metamarkets have responded to requests for comment but two sources have confirmed the deal to us.One, an ex-employee, received a stock alert about the transaction that noted that the agreement and plan of merger happened on October 24 (meaning, it may not have completely closed).The second confirmation came from a source close to the deal, and said that the acquisition is for under $100 million.Metamarkets is profitable and currently generating tens of millions in revenues, the second source said.Its not clear what happens with the companys existing business as part of the deal.Metamarkets, which has been around since 2010, had raised just under $58 million from investors that include Khosla, True Ventures, Data Collective (where Metamarkets CEO Mike Driscoll is also a partner), IA Ventures, AOL Ventures and a number of others.You might recall that there was a rumor back in January 2016 that Snap would acquire an ad tech company or two to beef up its in-house team as it worked on ways of automating ad buying for its platform, with Recode naming Metamarkets among the shortlist.If that report was accurate, this deal looks like it could have taken 22 months to close.The acquisition underscores a couple of interesting themes.The first of these is Snaps ongoing efforts to build out its advertising business.Last quarter, the company reported revenues of $181.6 million largely from advertising, missing analysts projections.And the story hasnt ended with that earnings report: a couple of weeks ago eMarketer revised its forecast for Snaps overall ad revenues to $774 million, down from its previous estimate of $1 billion, in part because of slowing user growth.(Snap also reported slowing daily active user numbers for Snapchat last quarter, which as of August stood at 173 million.)One thing that you can read from this is that Snap has to figure out more ways to grow usage, especially amid heavy competition from the likes of Facebooks Instagram.But another is that the company needs to develop better tools to serve ads and other marketing to those users it does have.Unsurprisingly, the company also announced last quarter that it would be moving to a bidded auction model as part of its efforts to better automate its ad platform, so you can see how acquisitions like Metamarkets could play into that bigger strategy.(Coincidentally, the other potential acquisition mentioned back in January 2016 was the bidding platform Beeswax.)If Snap can provide better tools to marketers, it could lure them to spend more investment on Snapchat.And potentially Metamarkets provides more: it could represent an opportunity to Snap to present itself as an analytics dashboard across a number of other properties, not just its own.(Interestingly, this was some of the strategy behind Twitters acquisition of MoPub back in the day, too.)And it potentially opens the door to more collaboration between Metamarkets existing customers and Snap.Other acquisition that fall into Snaps strategy to build out its ad tech and marketing tools include Placed, Flite, and Vurb.The second theme that is worth highlighting here is the ongoing dominance of Facebook and Google in the world of online ads.Its notable that Metamarkets, a company that is processing billions of data points in real time, working with some of the bigger names in media and programmatic ads today, and is profitable, is selling up for a price that is not significantly higher than what it raised from VCs.The crushing oligopoly of Google and Facebook leaves so little room for perceived future growth and innovation, that VCs and acquirers no longer value either revenue or tech as upside in the ad space, one observer said to me.That speaks to just how big the disparity is between these companies today, but potentially also of the glimmer of opportunity for those trying to find a way to compete against them.If data is where the money is, providing more ways of consolidating that, in the name of competition, could be one way forward.Featured Image: Metamarkets

Snapchat fell out of the top 10 for first time this year in Q3:::::Snapchats mobile app fell out of the top 10 for the first time this year during Q3 2017, according to a recent report from Sensor Tower.The app, which had been ranked at #8 during Q2 2017 dropped to #18 on iOS during the quarter, but remained ranked at #2 on Google Play.Combined, that gave the app an overall ranking of #5 for the quarter, the report noted.Sensor Towers data was presented without context as to why this ranking change could have occurred.That may lead you to believe that Snapchat is losing steam.Perhaps all that Instagram cloning is finally catching up with it?After all, Facebook recently announced that both Instagram Stories and WhatsApp Status now have 300 million daily active users or nearly twice the size of Snapchat.However, reading the top charts alone doesnt always tell the full story.While its true that a slowing of downloads could see a popular app losing rank, thats not always what can boot it from the top 10.Sometimes, its not that one apps rate of downloads slow, its that the apps surrounding it gain.Thats what happened with Snapchat, we understand.During the month of August, Snapchat fell to #16 on the iOS App Stores top overall chart on August 19th, then to #33 on August 20th, according to App Annies data.The ranking began to stabilize the following day, where it returned to #7.Of course, a drop of this size is still fairly notable.The app had not fallen from the top 10 on iOS all year, and it hasnt fallen since.In fact, Snapchat has been in the top 10 on iOS in the U.S. for the better part of its tenure, App Annie notes.In 2016, it only fell out of the top 10 for 8 days, and then, it was only ranked #11.It never got as low as #33.But this years decline doesnt mean Snapchats downloads slowed.App Annie says that Snapchat continued to have consistent daily downloads in the weeks prior and after August 19th and 20th, which were the only days in Q3 that Snapchat lost its top 10 position.What happened is that there was a surge of downloads from other top apps on those days instead.When this happens, even an app with strong downloads can drop in the charts, and thats why Snapchat fell.The situation was not unique to Snapchat, either.In addition to its drop, some of the top ranking social networking and photo and video apps, including Instagram, Messenger and newcomer Sarahah, also saw their rankings decline during the same time.Featured Image: LIONEL BONAVENTURE/Getty Images
Query friends or fans with new GIF and photo Facebook Polls:::::Facebook Questions first launched in 2010 as a Quora wannabe before shifting into lighter-weight polls, but Facebook shut the feature down in 2012.Apparently it was just ahead of its time as Facebook went poll-crazy this year, adding them to Instagram Stories and Messenger group chat as well as buying hit teen anonymous polling app tbh.Plus its had bare-bones multiple-choice text polls for Facebook Pages for years.Now the social network is officially launching Facebook Polls with the added options of using photos or GIFs as answers.Polls are coming to people and Pages on iOS, Android, and desktop today.Facebooks been testing these new Polls since at least September, but now everyone will have access.You just open the status composer on your profile or Page, select Polls, write your question and two answers, optionally upload images or choose from a library of GIFs, attach links to answers if you want, choose an expiration date for your polls, post, and then you and everyone who votes can see the results.Beware, the answers arent anonymous and arent only visible to a polls creator.Facebook Polls will provide an easy way to spur conversation, gather opinions, or organize plans.You could ask what TV show is better using GIFs of the programs, find out which of your outfits friends prefer, or figure out what movie your pals want to go see tonight.Polls could make interactive social media simple.Instead of just Liking like a zombie or struggling to come up with a comment, friends and Pages can let you express a specific opinion with just a click.
Beheld is a new startup that lets you scan, send, and print yourself:::::Kat Kinkead and Peter Weijmarshausen met at their old company, Shapeways.Weijmarshausen recently stepped down as CEO and was looking for something cool to do when he and Kinkead realized that the most popular application of 3D scanning and printing was in 3D figurines.These tiny action-figure-like representations were wildly popular print subjects back at Shapeways but they were notoriously difficult to capture and print.Now, thanks to improvements in scanning, color printing, and software, theyre surprisingly easy.Thus Beheld was born.Kinkead, the CEO, has an MFA in industrial design and has worked in the 3D printing industry for half a decade.She helped build 3D printing procedures for places like Michael Kors and they founded Beheld in January 2017.Theyve raised a small amount of angel funding.The system is simple: you enter a booth-sized scanner and strike a pose.The scanner takes multiple pictures of your body in 360 degrees and then stitches them together, creating a 3D model that you can share with your friends for free.If you want to print yourself, however, it will cost you about $40.What separates us from others in the industry is: We are making 3D scanning an experience, said Kinkead.Were taking the components which already exist, and neatly tying them together to create a truly fun and memorable experience for consumers while simultaneously creating a turnkey experience for businesses.Were placing scanners in an environment that makes them accessible to everyone.The vision is to have 3D scanning kiosks in malls and other high-trafficked places.Because the service is free to try the pair think that theyll get quite a bit of upsell in the process.It wasnt hard convincing users that they wanted to scan themselves.It wasnt even hard to convince them to pay a few dollars for a 3D print.Once the idea comes to mind that they, themselves, could actually be 3D printed, thats when I would see the true excitement in people.Whether it was simply to have a 3D print of themselves or to use a 3D scan of their body to make items that were customized to fit them perfectly thats when the true sparks would fly, said Kinkead.The team plans to roll out 3D scanning kiosks in spots across America and Europe.Theyve also created special effects that can make you appear and disappear in fireworks and clouds of smoke, the better to please the Snapchat generation.After all, who wants a selfie when you can make yourself appear and disappear into a cloud of particles?

Apple’s revenues in China are growing again:::::Apples blockbuster Q4 pushed the companys valuation to $900 billion, but it also saw the firm return to growth in key market China following a challenging past couple of years.Analysts already reported that Apple saw shipment growth in China during the last quarter with a 41 percent increase, but now the companys latest financial report confirmed that revenue was up, too.Total sales in Greater China the region that Apple defines as China, Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan grew by 12 percent year-on-year to $9.8 billion.That figure was up 22 percent quarter-on-quarter.An increase in iPhone sales thanks to the newly-released iPhone 8, CEO Tim Cook told investors in an earnings call that Apple sold a record number of Macs during the quarter.Likewise, earnings from services where Apple made huge strides globally also hit at an all time high.We increased market share for iPhone, Mac, and iPad during the quarter.We hit all-time revenue records for services for Mac and for the PRC during the quarter.We had very strong iPad revenue growth.We had double-digit unit growth iPhone and both the upgraders and Android-switchers were both up on a year-over-year basis during the quarter.And so the results were broad day, Cook said in response to one question.While growth is of course positive, Apples China revenue was still some way short of its peak two years ago, when the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus the firms first phablet-sized devices helped revenue jump to $12.51 billion.Analysts are less sure on the impact that the iPhone X will have in China.While it has generated attention for a design that represents a clear departure from other devices and emphasizes luxury, a point that has served Apple well with previous phones opinions are divided on whether a starting price of $1,000 for the cheapest model and limited supply will play out in Apples favor.Apple is unlikely to sustain this growth in Q4, Canalys analyst Mo Jia said earlier this week.While the iPhone X launches this week, its pricing structure and supply are inhibiting.The iPhone X will enjoy a healthy grey market status, but its popularity is unlikely to help Apple in the short term.
N26 is launching its bank in the UK in 2018:::::Fintech startup N26 is announcing yet another international expansion move.The company plans to launch its bank of the future in the U.K. at some point during the first half of 2018.As N26 already has a German banking license, the company can also operate in the U.K.Without getting a separate license.British customers will get an account in GBP, a debit card and personal account information.First of all, well launch with the same feature set as the rest of Europe, N26 co-founder and CEO Valentin Stalf told me.The thing that is going to be different for the U.K. is that youll have a U.K. sort code and account number.And also well bring all the products that we have including our premium card.When you create an account, you get a debit card from MasterCard and a checking account.You can then send and receive money, accept direct debits, pay anywhere around the world with your card without any foreign transaction fee or markup, lock your card, set your own limits and get push notifications for each transaction.The company also plans to launch savings, investment and credit features pretty quickly.In some cases, N26 will do it in house.In other cases, N26 will partner with another fintech startup.The startup might rely on its existing partners or look for new local partners.The U.K. uses its own payment system.Thats why it took a bit of time to bring N26 to the U.K. N26 has developed a full integration with the British payment system.This way, you can replace your regular bank account with an N26 account from day one.There are many competitors in the U.K. already, such as Revolut, Monzo, Starling, Atom and Tandem.Some of them dont have a banking license and operate as an electronic wallet with a payment card.Others have a banking license, but it doesnt necessarily mean that they have made the switch to their own infrastructure yet.If you look at our user base, most of our users dont use the card primarily for travel, Stalf said.Weve never gone for a sort of niche on the market.Its not just a product for travelers.N26 is a bank that you love to use from standing orders to direct debits, credit and savings.Last week, N26 also announced plans to launch in the U.S. in 2018.Eventually, Stalf says you could imagine opening multiple N26 accounts in different countries.Each account could have its own account number.Its not just one account with multiple currencies.N26 is getting aggressive when it comes to international expansion.
Adobe and Microsoft expand partnership with Adobe Experience Manager and Dynamics 365 integration:::::Adobe and Microsoft expanded their continuing partnership today when they announced that they are making it easy to share data between Adobe Experience Manager, a website marketing tool and Dynamics 365, Microsofts CRM tool.For a sales person that means seeing the latest sales activity and customer interactions from the company website right in the customer record.From a customer experience perspective, it means that if you are on a website and filling in a form to join a service or make purchase, Adobe can pull your customer information like name, address and phone number from the CRM record and fill in much of the information for you automatically, making it more likely that youll complete the transaction, while providing a better overall experience.Dave Welch, vice president or Microsoft Solutions at Adobe says that from his companys perspective, its really about streamlining the experience on the company website to turn that shopper into a buyer.The more personal we can make that based on what we know about you, it makes the experience more integrated for a customer, he said.Dina Apostolou, director of Microsoft Business Applications Group says for her company, its about giving salespeople more complete data to work with to understand the customer better.The more information you can pull into a single customer view in Dynamics 365, the better you can understand their needs and sell to that.Ultimately, this is a combining of sales and marketing data.Traditionally, sales and marketing, two departments that need to work together, for whatever reason have often had difficulty communicating.By integrating the marketing and sales information together at the data level in this manner, it puts the information in the hands of the people who need it without any politics involved.It just happens.The companies have previously provided APIs that would allow customers to do this kind of integration if they were willing to put in the work to make it happen, but with the new agreement, the two vendors are doing all of the heavy lifting for them making it a simple configuration to share the data.When you combine this with the Dynamics 365 partnership announcement around Adobe Sign announced last month and Adobe Campaign integration from last year, the two companies are looking for ways to work together by combining various types of sales and marketing information that play to their various strengths.Featured Image: Adobe
Globality raises $35 million for its marketplace to connect small companies with big business:::::Small business has long been held as a key driver of the global economy, but these businesses often dont have access to large multinational companies who could use their services.Hoping to change that paradigm, is Globality, a startup founded by Joel Hyatt, the former founder of the low-cost law firm Hyatt Legal Services, which has just raised $35 million in new financing.With the money, Globality will look to take its business services marketplace to global Fortune 1000 companies, launching a European office in London, in the hopes that they can tap the expertise and opportunity that working with a smaller business may afford.This startup could, itself, be a huge boon for other early stage companies that often run into procurement problems because their larger partners may be concerned about the longevity and viability of the businesses their contracting with.Backing Globality is an international consortium of individual and institutional investors culled from the highest ranks of U.S. business and politics.Former Vice President Al Gore; former IBM chief financial officer, John Joyce; International Chamber of Commerce secretary, John Danilovich, and PricewaterhouseCoopers former global chairman, Dennis Nally; are joining Raine Ventures and THK Equities in the companys new round of funding.Launching the companys new consulting business will be Yuval Atsmon, a former senior partner at McKinsey.For Hyatt, Globality is an opportunity to build a bridge between large companies and small service providers that have been left out of the benefits of big contracts with global businesses.Our latest funding round indicates strong investor confidence in Globalitys mission; to drive the benefits of globalization deeper into the worlds economies empowering innovative small and mid-size service providers to partner with major multinational corporations, said Hyatt in a statement.So far, Globality has tapped roughly 1000 small and mid-sized businesses from more than 70 countries to join its marketplace.Would-be service providers can sign up to apply to be listed through the Globality website to bid on projects listed on its marketplace.Ultimately, service providers access to the marketplace is invite-only, and all prospective service providers are vetted by Globalitys staff.Basically, the company wants to ensure that the service provider is capable of doing the work that theyre bidding on from both a regulatory and professional perspective.Companies applying to bid on contracts have to be financially stable, have fewer than 500 employees and be able to meet standards of reporting and auditing for the worlds most regulated industries.Once a company is approved, they submit a project brief based on a series of questions designed by Globality.Then the company processes that application using machine learning tools to match a customer with a prospective service provider.Matches that are selected from the thousands of service providers are then further winnowed down by Globality staff until a pool of three to five final candidates are selected.The process takes two to three days versus the traditional months-long request for proposal process that big companies typically use, according to Globality.Update: Joel Hyatt was the founder of Hyatt Legal Services.He did not work at McKinsey & Co.Featured Image: Oliver Burston/Getty Images
BMW, Daimler, Ford and Volkswagen team up on high-power charging network:::::BMW Group, Daimler, Ford Motor Company, and the Volkswagen Group (with subsidiaries Audi and Porsche) will join up to create a high-power charging network for electric vehicles called Ionity, which will build and operate around 400 charging stations across Europe by 2020.The collaborative venture formed by the automakers is intended to make it easier for Europeans to manage long road trips using electric cars, and to put in place a key infrastructure component needed to make electric vehicles a viable option for general consumer use.The Ionity brand will operate around 20 stations by the end of this year, and then aims to have 50 available in 2018.Each charging point will have a capacity of as much as 350 kW, and the intent is for the charging to be brand-agnostic using the Combined Charging System (or CCS) standard.The CCS standard is supported by VW, GM, BMW, Daimler, Ford FCA, Tesla and Hyundai, and current vehicles that support it, including the Bolt EV, max out at 50 kW quick charging.Ionity will pick spots for its chargers based on negotiations with political institutions and private companies and aims to put them in, in concert with existing infrastructure initiatives which are ongoing.This is a big moment for the acceleration of electric vehicle adoption an automaker joint venture like this one with its considerable brand power will go a long way toward making sure the charging network can meet future demand as more models become available and demand increases among consumers.
Mapbox acquires neural network startup Mapdata to help it expand into AR maps:::::Two weeks after announcing $164 million in funding, mapping data startup Mapbox has made its first acquisition.The company has acquired MapData, a artificial intelligence mapping startup based out of Minsk in Belarus that focuses on building neural networks to improve computer vision for applications like augmented reality.It will be using the deal spearhead the opening of a new office in the city and the hiring of more engineers; and to help build its next big product, an SDK that will let developers build augmented reality-based maps into their apps that will work by way of the front-facing cameras on peoples devices.This SDK should now be coming in Q1 of next year, Mapbox CEO and founder Eric Gundersen told me in an interview.Before the acquisition, MapData had been a partner of Mapboxs providing engineering support on open source projects for the past 18 months, but ironically for a mapping startup it was largely off the grid as far as startups are concerned.(Just try finding a website for it, or much other proof that it exists.)I guess that if youre good at helping people figure out where they are, you are probably also very good at making people invisible.Terms of the deal are not being disclosed.Yuri Melnicheck, a Belarussian entrepreneur and investor (who was also behind the sale of AIMatter to Google this summer), is an advisor to Mapbox.Melnicheck had made the introduction between the two companies.The CEO of MapData who will now lead Mapboxs Belarussian office, Alexander Matveenko, had worked at another previous company of Melnichecks, Maps.me, which had been acquired by Mail.ru in Russia.Maps.me was a Waze-style platform that was built in part through crowdsourced data from its users.That is notable, because its a paradigm that Mapbox has also used in building its platform up to now, and will continue to use in the future as it ramps up its own vision for how to create and deliver navigational guidance to the world.Today, Mapbox is already collecting anonymized (and ONLY anonymized, says Gundersen) aggregated telemetry data from 200 million users, by way of apps that are using the Mapbox SDK, which include apps from Airbnb, Instacart, Snap, and MasterCard.When people touch our maps, we get latitude, longitude, topology and more, Gundersen said.Acquiring a neural network and AI specialist to help build Mapboxs AR-based SDK will serve two purposes: it will (Mapbox hopes) be creating a service that people will use, and it will be creating an interface that will start to be able to collect even more data, specifically in the area of street views, which is essential for building out Mapboxs dataset in its bid to do more in the area of autonomous driving systems.The AR SDK is focused on AI and presentation, yes, but my interest ultimately is, the more our SDK is used, the more data we get back, Gundersen explained.If we do this right, everyone will benefit from that network effect.There are still a lot of questions about how this will work, and what applications might come out of AR maps longer term.Many in the mobile world have talked about how the phone is disappearing, with bezels getting thinner and more functions requiring less of your active input to work, but there is still a hurdle when it comes to AR applications on these devices since they, by definition, require active participation and physically holding up your device as you walk.I think it will be interesting to see how socially acceptable this is, said Gundersen.For walking, I think AR and holding up your phone feels awkward and I dont know if that will ever be publicly acceptable.For now, the more obvious deployments are in areas like gaming and in-car navigation two use cases that Mapbox is doubling down on with this deal.

Apple’s record services revenue suggests growth in Apple Pay, Apple Music:::::Everyones favorite almost-trillion-dollar company reported fourth quarter earnings after the bell on Thursday.And while much of the attention was on stellar iPhone sales, Apple wants to make sure that people know its services business is doing great, too.Service revenues reaches all-time high, was the headline of the press release.But what is services revenue, exactly?Well, it incorporates a lot of things.According to the data summary, Apples services revenue includes revenue from Digital Content and Services, AppleCare, Apple Pay, licensing and other services.Apple Music, iCloud and the App Store are also part of the category.This broad group of businesses accounted for $8.5 billion in revenue in Apples latest quarter, a sizable chunk of Apples $52.6 billion in sales.This is also up 34% from the same period last year.While we havent been given a detailed category breakdown, we do know that Apple Music is a growing aspect of the business.The company said that subscriptions are up 75% since last year, as it continues to make gains on Spotify and Pandora.And Apple Pay, the companys mobile payments solution, is seeing growth as it develops new partnerships and expands to new countries.A recently redesigned App Store also has led to more app downloads, says Apple.Apples other products category additionally saw impressive gains.This is a division that includes sales of Apple TV, Apple Watch, Beats products, iPod touch and Apple-branded and third-party accessories.This group brought in $3.2 billion in revenue, up 36% from the same time last year.But the biggest category was, of course, the iPhone.Partly aided by the release of the iPhone 8 which came out at the end of the quarter, overall sales totaled $28.9 billion.Macs brought in $7.2 billion in revenue.iPads accounted for $4.8 billion.Apple has been having a great run on the stock market in 2017.
Paytm brings messaging features to India’s top digital wallet app:::::Paytm, Indias top digital wallet and payment service, has introduced a chat feature to amp up its appeal among an increasingly competitive market.The new Inbox feature, which was first outed in August, is initially available on Android, which accounts for the bulk of Paytms claimed 200 million users, and not iOS.It allows users to share messages and photos like other chat apps, but it also includes a peer-to-peer money transfer feature and access games, another vertical that Paytm has expanded into.Paytm, which is backed by Alibaba and SoftBank among others, is steeling its product with social features to give it an advantage against messaging apps in India which are increasingly encroaching on its territory by introducing payment features of their own.Hike, which is backed by Tencent, added a mobile wallet feature this year, WhatsApp which counts India as its largest market worldwide is set to introduce business payments in India, while WeChat, Chinas top app, has long tried to gain traction with its app which you guessed it includes payment and wallet features, too.We have realized that besides making payments, our users and merchants also like to communicate with each other.There is a need of social messaging, commerce and payments seamlessly blending into one another, Paytm senior VP Deepak Abbot said in a statement.In a cheeky nod to WhatsApp, Paytm stressed that Inbox launches with the option to recall messages from the word go.Thats a feature that Facebook-owned WhatsApp finally implemented last week but it will take some time to roll out to its userbase of over one billion.
Xbox One X review: This is the ultimate Xbox:::::This is the Xbox One X.Its the fastest and smallest Xbox and the first to offer games in 4K.At $499 the higher resolution comes at a steep price.After a week with the console and hours of gaming, I can firmly state the Xbox One X is the best Xbox to date.This Xbox has everything.Think about it.The Xbox One X is the culmination of the Xbox project and, right now, at this moment in history, the system is not missing a critical feature or capability.Im happy to report it performs as advertised, too.Its fast, smooth and capable of playing games from the past and the present with the best possible graphics.Even though the Xbox One X provides the best possible Xbox experience, it may not be a system for everyone.From 480p to 4k The Xbox One X is the third version of the third generation of the Xbox.The original came out in 2001 with the Xbox 360 hitting stores in 2005.The current generation started in 2013 with the Xbox One.The Xbox One X shares a lot of similarities with the first Xbox One yet lacks a feature of the original: Kinect.Microsoft once bet the future of the living room on motion and voice controls.Here we are, some four years later, and the Kinect is dead, and the controller stands tall.With certain games, graphics pop and colors shimmer in a way that was not possible on past consoles.The jump in quality is significant with the One X.The increase in quality feels more like the jump from the 480p Xbox to the 720p Xbox 360 rather than the jump from the 360 to 1080p Xbox One.Simply put, gaming at 4K is brilliant.Gaming at 4K with a faster refresh rate is even better, and this Xbox throws down.Games optimized for the higher resolution and quicker refresh rate look better and play smoother.Likewise, games that are not optimized still benefit from the One Xs extra power with faster load times and improved graphics.I guess.Sometimes I felt older Xbox One games were performing better on the One X than the One S but that could have just been because I was using an Xbox that wasnt pulling from a full hard drive.New games like Gears of War 4 look stunning in 4K and at 60 frames per second.I found the graphics nearly as good as anything available on a PC.Even during the most intense firefights, the gameplay was beautifully smooth.This wasnt always the case.Sometimes with past systems there was a bit of slowdown when the action sped up.I played latest Gears last month and yet I played through a good chunk again for TechCrunchs readers, of course and for the first time in a Gears game, felt like the system had enough headroom to provide the smoothest possible experience.I literally said wow during the opening fight scene on Gears of War 4.I had played the game since it was released last month, so it felt like the right place to start.The game is already gorgeous, and even on a One S, the gameplay is smooth.However, on the Xbox One X, the gameplay is smoothed out to a silky experience.It gets messy All the graphical improvements can be complicated.For Gears of War 4, players have several options.In the games setting menu, players can select between Visuals or Performance modes.Select Visuals and the game plays in 4k at 30 fps (the pretty mode).The Performance option bumps the framerate to a 60 fps target and keeps the resolution at 1080p (the smooth mode).But this switch is only for the campaign mode.The Horde mode plays at 60 fps in 4k with adaptive resolution scaling to maintain the high frame rate.And these options are the settings for just Gears of War 4.Each game offers different settings and modes and some do not offer any at all.Thats just the start of the confusion.Other games have been updated to support HDR that provides a broader swath of colors and contrast.HDR lets bright parts of the picture look more vivid and dark parts look darker while serving up more colors in between.Only some games output HDR and 4K and some games support HDR or 4K.Its a confusing mess, and the consumer will suffer.Games like Gears of War 4 were updated to support both 4K and HDR.Others like Halo 5: Guardians or Killer Instinct only support 4K and not HDR.As a consumer, I find the situation insulting and a drawback to buying the console at launch.Eventually, most games will support at least 4K but until then, gamers will need to suffer through Microsofts growing pains of convincing developers to release games in 4K.Microsoft is smart to point out that the extra power inside the Xbox One X improves the graphics even on a 1080p display.If patched for the hardware, these games look marginally better on older displays.Sometimes the differences are inconsequential for a person with a 1080p display and a One X.Most users would be hard pressed to notice the difference outside of a few games.On the home screen, the One S performs as well as the One X thanks to the new UI Microsoft rolled out last month.Its important to note that the Xbox One X does not automatically make a game 4K.And of course the system has to be hooked up to a 4K TV.Moreover, some 4K TVs offer HDR for better color and faster refresh modes for smoother graphics.It gets complicated.There are many variables, and these variables can be expensive.Right now, 4K titles available on disc have to download a patch to output at a higher resolution.There are also 4K titles available through the online Store.In both cases its a chore to discover games available at a higher resolution.Right now, at launch, the best place to find 4K games is with this comprehensive list on the Xboxs site.Users can search for 4K games through the online Store, but some of the results are not 4K games.To check if a game is available in 4K users must click through and consult the Capabilities box on the games product page.Its a tedious process and Microsoft would be smart to add a label to the titles box art thats displayed when browsing the catalog.Sony had a similar issue when the PS4 Pro launch, and it seems like Microsoft is handling it slightly better.The online listing is easier to parse and displayed more prominently.When it comes to retail availability right now, its just as hard to find a 4K Xbox game as it was a PS4 4K game.Eventually Xbox games will sport a label on the back of the title displaying its graphical capability but the stores I visited are still working through back stock and have yet to get titles with the new labels.I checked two Best Buy Stores and Forza 7 was the only game labeled as 4K capable.The selection will improve over time but it might be hard around the holidays for mom and dad to identify 4K games to buy for your new 4K gaming system.Amazing performance, questionable value Microsoft proudly proclaims the Xbox One X as the most powerful console ever.And by all accounts, thats true.It packs more computing power than the PS4 Pro, which until now, held that title.Listen, the Xbox One X is the best Xbox a gamer can buy.Hands down.Its smoother, quicker and smaller than the Xbox One S. If the One X replaced the One S at the same price, it would be easy to recommend.With the One X priced at $499, for most people, the $279 Xbox One S is the smarter way to spend money.It offers, in most cases, a similar gaming experience and, in a few cases, slightly less pretty graphics which you definitely wont miss if you arent running a 4K-capable display, or viewing your set from the proper distance.There is an appeal to gaming in 4K though I question the current value to gaming in 4K.Are the Xbox One X graphics better than on the Xbox One S?Yes, but sometimes the differences are marginal and often meaningless to the gameplay.Purchasing the Xbox One X right now is an investment.4K TVs are quickly becoming the standard and now that Microsoft and Sony offer 4K systems, eventually developers will start designing games with 4K as the standard.There will be a time when 1080p is an afterthought and thats when the Xbox One X will be justified.And by then, the Xbox One Xs price will probably be lower and 4K games will be easier to find.When the Xbox 360 came out, it was a runaway hit.The difference between the Xbox and the Xbox 360 are massive.Then the $500 Xbox One came out and the difference was less dramatic over the Xbox 360.The $500 Xbox One X is an even less meaningful jump in quality over its predecessor and gamers will have a hard time justifying purchasing a One X over a One S. To me, its not worth it.At least not right now.If youre the person who needs the best Xbox possible, the One X is the system for you.xbox one x (17 of 20) xbox one x (20 of 20) xbox one x (1 of 20) xbox one x (2 of 20) xbox one x (3 of 20) xbox one x (4 of 20) xbox one x (6 of 20) xbox one x (7 of 20) xbox one x (8 of 20) xbox one x (10 of 20) xbox one x (11 of 20) xbox one x (12 of 20) xbox one x (13 of 20) xbox one x (14 of 20) xbox one x (15 of 20) xbox one x (16 of 20) xbox one x (19 of 20) View Slideshow Previous Next Exit
DoubleDutch CEO Bryan Parker is out after a couple of months:::::Live engagement marketing platform DoubleDutch has replaced CEO Bryan Parker, who was appointed from COO to CEO just two months ago, TechCrunch has learned.Lawrence Coburn, founder of DoubleDutch, has since been reinstated as CEO.DoubleDutchs board made the decision to replace Parker with Coburn today, according to a source familiar with the situation.Parker first joined the company earlier this year in June.DoubleDutch has confirmed to TechCrunch that Parker is no longer in charge, but will remain employed at the company.Bryan Parker remains actively involved with the company in a senior capacity and will work with DoubleDutch, its board and its leadership team on its strategic growth plan going forward, a DoubleDutch spokesperson said in a statement.Lawrence Coburn, the founder and original CEO of the company, is resuming his role as CEO.We look forward to Bryan continuing to make important contributions to the future success of the company.Whats not completely clear is the rationale behind the decision, but in a follow-up text message specifically asking why Parker would no longer be CEO, Colburn said, were a startup always looking to put people in the best spots to be successful.This year has been full of ups and downs for DoubleDutch.In January, the company laid off 40 percent of its staff, including the CFO, CCO and VP of Customer Success.But then in September, the company acquired Eventgrid and, at the same time, announced Parker would be promoted to CEO.That, of course, was very short-lived.DoubleDutch, which first launched in 2011, has raised over $78 million in venture capital from investors like Bessemer Ventures, Index Ventures and others.Ive been in touch with members of the board and will update this story as I get more information.Megan Rose Dickey can be reached securely on Signal at 415-419-9355, and their PGP fingerprint for email is: 2FA7 6E54 4652 781A B365 BE2E FBD7 9C5F 3DAE 56B Featured Image: DoubleDutch
How the iPhone could save your life:::::An iPhone 8 Plus Im testing has called 911 by accident a few times.Its annoying, but it turns out this new iOS feature could save lives.Experts say discrete calling is a sign of things to come in making 911 calls work a little better and a little safer, especially in a tense situation.Apple introduced the feature in iOS 11 recently, and on the new iPhone 8.Its still a work in progress, however.iPHONE X HITS STORES, APPLE NEARS $1 TRILLION MARKET CAP The feature lets you call 911 by pressing the power button and either volume button at the same time.For example, if youve been kidnapped or youre in a hostage situation, you can press the two buttons without having to open the dialer and press 9-1-1.It does not like cup-holders, though.Placing the wider iPhone 8 Plus in the holder -- which is what many people do when they drive -- has triggered a 911 call at least five times.To test the theory, I used the iPhone 8 Plus in the cup holders of a Dodge Durango and a smaller VW Tiguan, but the buttons activated by accident in both cars.IPHONE X REVIEW ROUNDUP: SHOULD YOU BUY?Fortunately, theres a way to disable discrete calling in the iPhone settings.And, you can activate a countdown and a siren that plays before you actually place the call.Just head to the Emergency SOS section and enable the features you want to use.Apple iPhone expert Konstantin Makarov, the Chief Operating Officer at IGotOffer.com, a marketplace for selling gadgets, says the alarm sound is both good and bad.It can prevent 911 calling mistakes, but also means you cant make the call discreetly.If you do accidentally call 911, don't hang up, Makarov said.Stay on the line and let 911 operators know that it was an accidental call.If you hang up, they may think it is an emergency and track the location of the call to send help or call back to verify the emergency.MORE THAN 300 IPHONE Xs STOLEN FROM DELIVERY TRUCK, POLICE SAY 911 calls can be costly in some states.In California, making repeated 911 calls by accident can cost about $200 each infraction, he says.In Michigan, charges are much higher if anyone is injured while responding to the 911 call -- there can be a $50,000 fine, he says.Tech expert and analyst Rob Enderle says discreet calling and other 911-related features are helpful, especially since you can place the call even when the phone is in your pocket or purse.He questioned whether Apple has advertised this feature enough.And, making the calls by mistake is a bigger problem than most people realize.About 40 percent of the calls to 911 are mistakes made from cellphones, he said.Thats around four million calls a year and at $8,000 each.Fortunately, he says, most fees are waived.APPLE FACE ID: TECH PROFESSIONALS UNSURE ABOUT SECURITY BENEFITS, RESEARCH SAYS Security expert Henderson Cooper says 911 calling does have other issues.One is coverage.He says it is frustrating for those in an a life-threatening situation, even after all of these years and with technology improving at such a rapid pace, that you can still hear a recording.While the iPhone discrete calling is a good idea, it may add to the confusion.Especially if you put your phone in a cup holder.
Hundreds of iPhone X stolen from UPS truck:::::Today is iPhone X launch day, and as is typical of a new iPhone launch it has seen people lining up hours in advance outside Apple Stores to get one.However, three individuals got their hands on the iPhone X early yesterday by stealing hundreds of them.As CNET reports, the theft took place outside an Apple Store in Stonestown, San Francisco.A UPS truck containing 313 iPhone X handsets was broken into by theives who proceeded to unload the phones into a white Dodge van before driving off.The police have the description and serial number of every single stolen iPhone, with their total value thought to be over $370,000.They also have a photo og the theft in process taken by a janitor.The theft is suspicious for a couple of reasons.The UPS truck had its cargo area locked while parked outside the Stonestown Galleria mall, yet the thieves had no problem gaining access.They also either got very lucky or knew exactly which UPS truck to target to grab the very expensive iPhones.I doubt it was luck.Apple says there will be no problems with supplying the iPhone X to customers who planned to pick one up from the Stonestown Apple Store.That's surprising considering how constrained stock is thought to be.But maybe this is a sign stock levels are actually much better than we expected.With the serial number of each stolen phone known, it should be possible to track them all down eventually.Unfortunately, the thieves will have likely sold them on and disappeared with the cash long before that happens.This article originally appeared on PCMag.com.
iPhone X hits stores, Apple nears $1 trillion market cap:::::In September, Apple CEO Tim Cook paid homage to company co-founder Steve Jobs, by unveiling the iPhone X with the phrase, "One more thing."That "one more thing" has helped propel Apple's market cap over the $900 billion mark and may hit $1 trillion, experts say.Apple reported fiscal fourth-quarter earnings Thursday, one day prior to the iPhone X's official launch and analysts noted how upbeat management sounded at the company's propsects, in particular Cook.IPHONE X REVIEW ROUNDUP: SHOULD YOU BUY?"The sentiment on Apple's call was the most upbeat that we have heard in quite some time as we believe the company feels the momentum of this iPhone cycle, combined with the positive trends across the company's non-iPhone portfolio," Drexel Hamilton analyst Brian J.White wrote in a note to investors.He raised his Apple price target to $235 a share, which implies a market cap over $1 trillion, when taking into account Apple's 5.1 billion shares outstanding.Apple said it expects fiscal first-quarter revenue to be between $84 billion and $87 billion, due in large part to pent-up demand surrounding the iPhone X.Shares were up more than 3 percent to $174.46 in early Friday trading and are up more than 40 percent year to date.Demand is "off the charts" Customer demand for the iPhone X (pronounced "ten") has been exceptional, with Apple telling media it is "off the charts."On the company's conference call, Cook expanded upon that sentiment.Cook said that the Apple Store in Sydney, Australia had "several hundred people" waiting outside to get the iPhone X and he also received "similar reports from across that region."The iPhone X, which went on pre-sale on Oct. 27, starts at $999.Prior to the announcement, there was significant speculation that the high-end iPhone X would start at a cost of $1,000 or more.It has a 5.8-inch super retina display and Face ID facial recognition technology, which can be used to unlock the phone and for Apple Pay."Face ID learns your face.It learns who you are," Apple's vice president of marketing, Phil Schiller, said when introducing the iPhone X in September.IT LOOKS LIKE APPLE WANTS TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THE SKY-HIGH PRICE OF THE IPHONE X Not everyone is happy though Though consumer interest in the device is high, Apple has not been able to catch up to demand - at least not yet."The ramp for iPhone X is going well, especially considering that iPhone X is the most advanced iPhone we've ever created and it has lots of new technologies in it," Cook said, when asked by an analyst when iPhone X supply would meet demand."And so we're really happy that we were able to increase week by week what we're outputting and we're going to get as many of them as possible to the customers as soon as possible."A look on Apple's website shows iPhone X ship dates between 3 and 4 weeks for both the 64GB and 256GB models.Sources have told Fox News that some iPhone X orders, which were originally scheduled to be shipped between December 5 and 11 have since been told they will be shipped between the 1st and the 8th.Other sources have told Fox News they have received emails showing the order has already shipped, a sign that Apple is working to get as many iPhone X units in consumers hands as it can.Follow Chris Ciaccia on Twitter @Chris_Ciaccia
Twitter security slammed after rogue employee deactivates Trump's account:::::Twitters internal security is in the spotlight after a rogue employee briefly deactivated President Donald Trumps account on Thursday.The social media site said that the account was taken down by a customer support employee during their last day with the company.Amazing.That this could happen to a President's account demonstrates Twitter has poor insider threat controls and indicators, tweeted Micah Zenko, a foreign policy and national security analyst at international affairs institute Chatham House.WHAT TWITTER'S 280-CHARACTER LIMIT COULD MEAN FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP AND US POLITICS Matt Tait, a senior cybersecurity fellow at the Robert Strauss Center, outlined some of the potential mayhem that a rogue employee could cause via Trumps Twitter account.What if someone had hijacked the President's Twitter and issued policies for DHS or DOD that the department wasn't aware it had to implement?, he tweeted.What if the Twitter employee had tweeted about some ongoing terror case and jeopardized it?, he wrote, in another tweet.TRUMP MAKE FIRST TWEETS AS PRESIDENT What if the Twitter employee tweeted a video of him assaulting a media organization or a political opponent?Imagine the damage to the dignity of the office, Tait tweeted.Tait also suggested that the rogue employee could face charges under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA).Going to be boring and say the Twitter employee who deleted Trump for 11 minutes should get an attorney and get ready for CFAA charges, he tweeted.Technologies such as artifical intelligence are being touted as a way for companies to gain visibility into their employees working practices.Questions will also inevitably be asked about Twitters employee vetting processes.TRUMP'S TWITTER: COULD HACKERS WREAK HAVOC FROM THE WHITE HOUSE?Twitter says that it is conducting a full internal review into the deactivation of the Presidents Twitter account.When contacted by Fox News, Twitter declined to comment beyond its initial tweets.The President himself addressed the situation early Friday.My Twitter account was taken down for 11 minutes by a rogue employee.I guess the word must finally be getting out-and having an impact, he tweeted.Trump, who has more than 41 million followers on Twitter, turned his @realDonaldTrump account into a powerful political weapon during his run to the White House.Experts, however, have warned that hackers could potentially use the same account to wreak havoc.JAMES COMEY'S 'SECRET' TWITTER ACCOUNT REVEALED Trumps Twitter account has already been hacked, albeit briefly, in 2013, when an unknown attacker tweeted out an offensive lyric by rapper Lil Wayne."My Twitter has been seriously hacked---and we are looking for the perpetrators," tweeted Trump, in response to the incident.The brief deactivation of Trumps Twitter account on Thursday also sparked amusement on social media, with some people hailing the rogue employee as a hero.TWITTER SUSPENSION: HERE ARE A FEW ACCOUNTS THAT HAVE BEEN DEACTIVATED Dear Twitter employee who shut down Trump's Twitter: You made America feel better for 11 minutes.DM me & I will buy you a Pizza Hut pizza, tweeted Democratic Rep. Ted Lieu.Follow James Rogers on Twitter @jamesjrogers
This artificial intelligence can detect if someone is having suicidal thoughts:::::Artificial intelligence could one day be used to help identify a person contemplating suicide.Around 800,000 people die a year from suicide, according to the World Health Organization.Its currently the second-leading cause of death in the U.S. among people between the ages of 15 and 24.But a new study is using brain scans and AI to show how someone experiencing suicidal thoughts thinks differently about life and death.The results were published in Nature Human Behavior.What is central to this new study is that we can tell whether someone is considering suicide by the way that they are thinking about the death-related topics, Marcel Just, the studys co-lead author, told CMU.edu.Researchers looked at 34 participants, 17 of whom were experiencing suicidal thoughts.Each person underwent brain imaging with an MRI machine while being shown a series of words that were related to different emotions.Ten words had a positive emotional relation, such as carefree, 10 were negative, like trouble, and 10 were related to suicide, including desperate and hopeless.Based on the participants that were already considered suicidal, the researchers were able to map five regions of the brain and six words that could identify someone as suicidal.Next they devised an algorithm to spot the same thing.The algorithm correctly identified 15 of the 17 suicidal patients and 16 of the 17 members in the control group.Researchers then applied the algorithm to the group of participants experiencing suicidal thoughts half had previously attempted suicide and half had not.The algorithm correctly identified 94 percent of the participants who had attempted suicide.Further testing of this approach in a larger sample will determine its ability to predict future suicidal behavior, said David Brent, co-head author of the study.And could give clinicians in the future a way to identify, monitor and perhaps intervene with the altered and often distorted thinking that so often characterizes seriously suicidal individuals.This story originally appeared in the New York Post.
More than 300 iPhone Xs stolen from delivery truck, police say:::::As Apple fanatics awaited Friday's release of the iPhone X, three husky thieves in San Francisco made off with more than 300 of the coveted smartphones, a police report said.The suspects, in hoodies and driving a white van, broke into a delivery truck parked oustide an Apple Store and took about $375,000 worth of what Apple has deemed the smartphone of the future, Cnet reported.But despite the theft, the iPhone X -- with a hefty price tag of $999 -- will still be available as scheduled for customers who preordered the devices, Apple said.The driver of the United Parcel Service truck claims he locked the loading area after parking outside the Stonestown Galleria mall, the police report said.A janitor spotted the culprits loading the merchandise into their Dodge van.UPS was working with law enforcement in hopes of catching the suspects.Selling stolen iPhones has become less lucrative since Apple added the "Find My iPhone" and remote lockout features, Cnet reported.The newest iPhone has already set a record for the largest product launch in Apples history.Since the company began taking preorders last week, it has seen pre-sales jump 125 percent over the iPhone 6, Slice Intelligence reported.The theft in San Francisco was first reported by KTSF-TV.

11-minute Trump Twitter outage prompts company investigation:::::President Trump blamed his 11-minute Twitter account outage on Thursday on a "rogue employee.""My Twitter account was taken down for 11 minutes by a rogue employee.I guess the word must finally be getting out-and having an impact," Trump tweeted early Friday morning.Twitter launched an internal investigation Thursday after a "customer support" employee, reportedly working his or her last day with the company, briefly deactivated the highly viewed account of the president."We are conducting a full internal review," the company said in a statement about the approximately 11-minute outage.It was unclear how a customer support worker had obtained clearance to deactivate such a high-profile account.The president has tweeted more than 36,000 times and has nearly 42 million Twitter followers.When reports first surfaced about the outage, Twitter officials initially blamed human error.Shortly before 7 p.m. Thursday, social media reports surfaced that Trumps personal account, @realDonaldTrump, was unavailable, providing the error message that the user "does not exist."The account was restored by 7:03 p.m.But about two hours later, the company said the deactivation "was done by a Twitter customer support employee who did this on the employee's last day."The company has in the past suspended other accounts for violating its terms and conditions.The company has resisted calls from those opposed to the president to delete his account.A spokesperson for the White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Trump did not immediately address the outage after his account was reactivated.Instead, he tweeted about the GOP tax plan."Great Tax Cut rollout today.The lobbyists are storming Capital [sic] Hill, but the Republicans will hold strong and do what is right for America!"The Washington Post pointed out that Trump credited social media for its role in getting him elected.He told Fox Business Maria Bartiromo that, You have to keep people interested.

Apple Face ID: Tech professionals unsure about security benefits, research says:::::IT professionals are unsure about the security benefits of Apples new Face ID technology, which can be used to unlock the tech giants new iPhone X.Unveiled during a glitzy launch event in September, Face ID facial recognition technology has been touted by Apple as a security breakthrough for its customers.Apple says that the probability of someone unlocking your phone with Face ID is 1 in 1 million, compared to 1 in 50,000 for Apples Touch ID technology, which uses a fingerprint.WILL APPLE'S NEW FACE ID SECURITY FEATURE HELP COPS UNLOCK YOUR IPHONE?Nonetheless, research from data protection specialist Bitglass indicates that there is still a question mark over Face ID for many people working in technology.Some 60 percent of over 200 IT and security professionals surveyed at the recent Gartner Symposium/ITxpo in Orlando said they have reservations about Face ID.A majority of IT and security professionals have reservations about Apples Face ID technology as a viable method of secure mobile authentication, said Bitglass, in a statement.Traditional authentication methods like passcodes, PIN codes and fingerprint recognition are familiar and trusted by enterprises, while facial recognition technologies remain unproven.APPLE ISSUES RESPONSE TO SENATE INQUIRY ON FACE ID CONCERNS Top concerns about Face ID included accuracy of face detection, prevention of unauthorized access, and speed of face detection, according to Bitglass.This is not the first time that these worries have been voiced.In September Sen. Al Franken, D-MN., wrote to Apple CEO Tim Cook requesting information on how Face ID will affect users privacy and security, and whether the technology will perform equally well on different groups of people.DUMB AND DUMBER: APPLE FIRES IPHONE X ENGINEER AFTER DAUGHTERS VIRAL VIDEO In a response sent last month, Apple explained in detail how Face ID works and assured consumers that their information will be safe.NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden has also voiced his concern that Face ID technology could be used to unlock someones phone against their will.However, the latest version of Apples iPhone operating system, iOS 11, contains a fail-safe feature that can disable Touch ID and Face ID, requiring a passcode to unlock the phone.IPHONE X REVIEW ROUNDUP: SHOULD YOU BUY?Face ID's ability to distinguish between twins has also been put to the test in early reviews, with varying results.Fox News has reached out to Apple with a request for comment on this story.Apples iPhone X will be available Friday.Follow James Rogers on Twitter @jamesjrogers
Apple hits record high, and its market cap nearly reaches $900 billion:::::Here's what Tim Cook just said on the Apple conference call 18 Hours Ago | 01:55 Apple rose to a record high in morning trade Friday, nearly giving the company a valuation of over $900 billion for the first time.Shares were briefly up more than 3 percent at the opening bell on Friday, after the company reported earnings that blew past Wall Street expectations on Thursday night.Around the world overnight, thousands lined up outside Apple Stores, hoping to buy Apple's new flagship phone, the freshly launched iPhone X.By midmorning, the stock was up about 2 percent, giving the company a valuation of $868 billion.Apple's 10th-anniversary handset represents a significant upgrade from past phones, with features like a bright, edge-to-edge screen, facial recognition with animated emojis, no home button and a glass and steel chassis.But the fervor around the iPhone X did not stop Apple from making more money than expected over the last three months despite worries on Wall Street that consumers would hang back in anticipation.The iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus "instantly" became Apple's top-two selling products at launch, surprising even executives, chief executive Tim Cook said on a conference call.And it doesn't expect to slow down: Revenue guidance for next quarter was also on the high end of estimates."You can see from our guidance, we're very bullish," Cook said on a Thursday night conference call.Part of Apple's valuation reflects investors' future expectations of the company.Apple executives have expressed high hopes for rapid growth in software and services, in the booming middle classes in China and India, and in the tantalizing prospect of tax reform.Apple's mound of cash and cash equivalents continued to scrape the cloudline this quarter, coming in at $268.9 billion in the company's quarterly earnings report.
Here's the real problem for tech companies trying to fix the fake news crisis:::::The Congressional spotlight shone on the Silicon Valley behemoths exposes one of the great weaknesses about Internet firms in the past two decades that has had little attention.Contrary to common sense, technology platform companies, including Facebook, Google, Twitter and hundreds of their peers, do not knownor will they know in the futureall of the myriad ways their platforms will be used by millions of users.These platforms leverage new and creative technologies to enable many activities and capabilities.But what they fail to anticipate are all of the ways that users of these platforms create, maintain and deliver old and new kinds of content.Fake news, graphic videos, 140-character messages fueling terror networks, and your banking app on a hand-held device are recent manifestations of a connected society enabled by technology platforms that were unforeseen, except in in broadest terms, by everyone.We do not know how people and organizations will use existing platforms, nor can we project what new technologies will become available in a few yearsand the innovative uses they will be put to.For example, augmented and virtual reality technologies are becoming readily available.Yet do we really know how we will be using them?There is confusion as to how to classify these platform companies.Are they technology companies?Media companies?Content providers?Adding to the confusion is the fact that the platform companies have multiple sides.Typically, one side has responsibility to maintain and add more functionality to the platform, while the other sides are actually users of the platform.They use the platforms in separate and creative ways.These platform companies are best described as media companies using the outdated categorization of industrial sectors and the description is not perfect.The latest comment by Sheryl Sandberg, the Facebook COO that Facebook is not a media company because it does not hire journalists is like saying McDonald's is not a restaurant because it does not hire waiters and waitresses.However, she is just trying to avoid the additional regulatory scrutiny that comes with being a traditional media company.Facebook and many other Internet firms are truly media companies.What should be expected going forward?Two things are clear.First and most importantly, there will continue to be creative new uses to these platforms in ways that we cannot predict.Countries and organizations that we view as our adversaries see these platforms as our Achilles' heel.They will continue to evolve their use of the platforms to destabilize democracies and nonprofit organizations worldwide given their successes to date.The old attack vectors of fake news and buying ads will be replaced by new attack vectors.Second, much of this new use will be created and carried out by artificial intelligence software rather than humans sitting around coming up with the ideas.AI has become a useful tool because of cheap processing power, but also because of the almost limitless supply of data that can be used to train the AI software to perform specific tasks.Putting controls on these platforms to solve the problems of the past few years is a fool's errand.Our adversaries are creating new and improved capabilities to adversely impact our democratic processes in ways we have not considered.The vast amounts of information generated on the election interference topic and our reactions to it this past year provide our adversaries with copious amounts of data to train their AIs.These newly trained AIs can evolve new attack vectors to undermine future democratic processes throughout the world.We do not know what these attack vectors are, therefore, whatever is put into place now will most likely prove ineffective in the future.What should we do?The best course is to stop solving last year's problems and start understanding potential new problems and how to mitigate them.Preemptive actions should be taken now to forestall new attack vectors.For example, a new vector could be to create a "person" that exists in cyberspace only who donates large sums of money to extremist campaigns and SuperPACs.Functionally this is easy to do and hard to detect and track after the fact.How about doing it before the fact?The Congressional hearings make for good theater but little else.At worst, they will force resources to be expended in solving problems that will bear little resemblance to the problems our adversaries are planning to put into place in the next election cycle.Finally, as an educator, it would be remiss of me not to point out two contributing factors to the effectiveness of fake news and other mountebanks.The first is a lack of understanding on the part of the electorate of our democratic processes and their historical origins.The latter evolved over many centuries and our Founding Fathers were well-steeped in this history as they created the Constitution.Secondly, at many levels of society, there is a lack of thoughtful and substantive discussions of opposing viewpoints to understand the complex problems brought about by the use of these platforms.Collaborative development of solutions to these complex problems, whether at local or global levels, requires more than 140

First Wall Street strategist to embrace bitcoin is now 'cautious':::::The only major Wall Street strategist with an official price forecast for bitcoin turned "cautious" as the digital currency soared above $7,000 to record highs.We are "cautious short-term on bitcoin," Fundstrat co-founder Tom Lee said in a Thursday report.He said bitcoin has gained far more than fundamentals warrant right now.Fundstrat's model for bitcoin factors in the number of unique bitcoin addresses a string of letters and numbers used to identify accounts and the estimated number of transactions per user.In August, the model indicated that bitcoin would rise to $6,000 by the middle of 2018.Bitcoin shot past that figure to an all-time high of $7,454.04 on Friday, according to CoinDesk.A surge of investor interest in the digital currency has sent it soaring more than seven times in price this year.Bitcoin 12-month performance Source: CoinDesk DataTrek Research co-founder Nick Colas, a market strategist who began writing about bitcoin several years ago, also pointed out in a Friday note that digital currencies are still not an asset class by traditional criteria of size and fundamentals."Crypto currencies do not yet have as robust a regulatory framework around them as stocks, bond, currencies or other traditional asset classes," Colas said."Some prominent financial markets professionals even think that governments may eventually ban them.No one talks that way about stocks and bonds."Several major investors and banking executives have said in the past several months that bitcoin is a bubble that may soon burst.Elliott Prechter of The Elliott Wave Theorist newsletter predicted nearly seven years ago that bitcoin would surge from 6 cents.But Prechter said in July that the mania around bitcoin now dwarfs the tulip bulb mania from nearly 400 years ago.With bitcoin just above $7,000 on Thursday, Lee said in his report that the currency is overwhelmingly in "weak hands," or held by investors who are chasing price gains and who would quickly sell on any negative turn in sentiment.Lee maintained a 2022 target of $25,000 for bitcoin.His team's technical analysis indicates if bitcoin falls below $6,450, the lowest it will fall is $5,000, the September high.Before starting Fundstrat in 2014, Lee was chief equity strategist at JPMorgan.The world's largest futures exchange, CME, said Tuesday that in response to client interest it plans to launch bitcoin futures by the end of the year.Amazon.com this week also registered three website domains that include references to cryptocurrencies, although the move may be more to protect the company's brand name.The e-commerce giant has said it has no plans accept cryptocurrency.In contrast to Lee's cautious turn, stock analyst Ronnie Moas of Standpoint Research said Friday that following the latest headlines, he is raising his 2018 price target on bitcoin from $7,500 to $11,000.Moas began covering bitcoin this summer around the same time as Fundstrat and has a $50,000 target for 2027, a nearly sevenfold gain from Friday's prices.Bitcoin has come a long way from being followed by a small group of enthusiasts to the focus of a new product from a major exchange.More than 120 so-called cryptofunds have launched to invest in bitcoin and other projects related to cryptocurrencies, according to financial research firm Autonomous Next.Not meeting the traditional criteria of an asset class is "no reason to avoid" digital currencies, Colas said."By the time they meet the high hurdles of 'Asset class' status, much of the high-powered return potential will be in the past."
The tricks app makers use to get ranked more highly in the App Store and Google Play:::::With so many apps out there, it's hard to get noticed."When you have over 2 million apps in the iOS app store, how you get your app downloaded verses other apps becomes important," said Amir Ghodrati, the director of market insights for app market data and insights company App Annie.Developers have come up tactics to get their apps to number one in Apple's App Store and Google Play, the store for Android devices.Here are some tricks App Annie has noticed.
Apple CEO Tim Cook: Why we had to stagger iPhone X and iPhone 8 launch:::::The dual September unveiling of the iPhone 8 and iPhone X, but staggered release dates, was borne out of necessity and not "marketing," Apple CEO Tim Cook told CNBC after reporting blowout quarterly earnings."If we could do anything we wanted to, we would have obviously shipped 8, 8 Plus and X on the same day," Cook said Thursday evening in an off-camera interview."But we felt like the most important thing for us to do was to announce them on the same day so we wouldn't have customers buy an 8 and then we announce the X and ship it and they go, 'Oh, you hosed me, I would've bought a X.'""That's the reason that we did the stagger," Cook said."It wasn't a marketing thing.It was we weren't ready to ship; we were still working on [the X].We accelerated the date at which we were initially planning to do iPhone X.And that's how we got here and we're going to learn a lot."The iPhone 8 and the redesigned 10th anniversary iPhone X were both unveiled at Apple's big Sept. 12 event.But the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus were shipped 10 days after the event.The $1,000 iPhone X, with no home button and an edge-to-edge super high-resolution screen, was not available until Friday.
Tim Cook says spending $999 on the new iPhone X is like buying high-quality coffee:::::Apple has a market capitalization of almost $900 billion.The company also has $268.9 billion in cash and cash equivalents, according to its most recent quarterly financial report released Thursday.And as Apple sits on its growing pile of cash and continues to titillate Wall Street investors, CEO Tim Cook defends the staggering four-figure price tag on the newest smartphone.The iPhone X, hitting stores today, starts at $999.(CNBC's tech reviewer suggests the $1,149 model with more storage if you play a lot of games and movies.)Some believe that charging and spending a grand for a smartphone will usher ushering in a whole new era of consumer behavior."I think a couple years ago, nobody would've imagined selling a phone at this price and obviously, you're pretty confident that you can do it," said Steven Milunovich, managing director at UBS Securities, to Cook on the earnings call.
These are the best smartphones to buy if you can't get an iPhone X:::::The Pixel 2 offers the latest version of Android from Google and unique features, like the ability to squeeze the phone to bring up Google Assistant.It doesn't have as good of a display as the Note 8 or iPhone X, but it starts at a much more affordable $650.The camera has been one of the highlights of the Pixel 2, but you'll also get fun features like Google Lens which can tell you more about whatever you snap pictures of.You also get free unlimited photo storage with Google Photos.Keep in mind, the Pixel 2 XL has run into a lot of problems, so avoid that one for now.
Singapore state fund takes £120 million stake in UK bank OakNorth:::::British challenger bank OakNorth said Friday that Singaporean sovereign wealth fund GIC would take a 10 percent stake in the firm.The state-owned investor has poured 90 million ($120 million) into the financial technology (fintech) company.Combined with another investment the lender scored last month, a total of 244 million ($318 million) has been raised."If you aggregate the two announcements about the primary and secondary rounds, it is the largest U.K. fintech financing to date," OakNorth Chief Executive Rishi Khosla, told CNBC Friday.On Thursday, another U.K. fintech firm, Transferwise, said it had raised $280 million from asset management firm Old Mutual and Silicon Valley venture capital firm IVP.Collectively, Transferwise and OakNorth's investments saw $400 million injected into the U.K.'s fintech sector in just two days.OakNorth said the latest investment would enable it to boost lending in the U.K. by an additional 1.5 billion ($2 billion).The firm plans to roll out its ACORN lending platform which helps banks originate, underwrite, monitor and book transactions faster to markets across the globe.Khosla said: "What this financing round does is help us continue building the business in the U.K. but also taking the model to other markets around the world."Khosla added that OakNorth would look into partnering with a more established bank further down the line, "as we look at other markets."
Bitcoin jumps $400 in one day and soars to a new record high:::::Bitcoin skyrocketed past $7,400 on Friday, hitting yet another record high.The virtual currency had shot past the $7,000 mark for the first time Thursday and finished on $6,895.41 toward the end of the session.According to CoinDesk, the cryptocurrency reached a renewed all-time high of $7,454.04 at 6:40 a.m.ET Friday, after opening at $7,030.The jump in price saw bitcoin rise 6 percent.Analysts believe more institutional investors could warm to the digital token after derivatives operator CME Group announced it would introduce bitcoin futures contracts this year."This is bitcoin crossing the divide from the wild west of finance to the mainstream," Charles Hayter, CEO of cryptocurrency comparison website Crypto Compare, told CNBC in an email Thursday."Futures from an incumbent exchange bring bitcoin and cryptocurrencies into the regulatory fold.This allows more complex financial products to be created and will eventually open the doors to institutional money."CME's futures will be cash-settled and based on the CME CF Bitcoin Reference Rate (BRR), launched in November last year with Crypto Facilities, a digital cryptocurrency trading platform.The bullish activity that followed CME's announcement also saw the total value of all cryptocurrencies surge past $200 billion for the first time.The market cap of bitcoin alone is more than $124 billion.Bitcoin's price has risen 640 percent since the start of the year.
Pandora loses a quarter of its value after abysmal revenue forecast:::::Pandora Media stock plunged as much as 26 percent on Friday as things went from bad to worse after its third quarter earnings report.The company revised its fourth quarter revenue forecast downward, to a range of $365 million to $380 million, Pandora CFO Naveen Chopra revealed on a conference call with investors Thursday evening.That is well below the consensus estimate of $413 million before the report, according to FactSet.Pandora also reported weak revenue for the third quarter and announced plans to sell about 62 million shares of common stock after Thursday's close.Four firms downgraded the company's stock in response, lowering expectations for the company from "buy" to "hold."The shares were down 25 percent to $5.52 at 10 a.m.ET in New York after falling as low as $5.42 shortly after the open of trading."We have been trying to stick with Pandora through its multiple management changes and multi-year turnaround process," J.P. Morgan analyst Doug Anmuth wrote in a note."However, near-term advertising trends are deteriorating and we believe it will take time for the company to realize the benefits of its ad tech investments."SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Stifel Nicolaus and FBR joined J.P. Morgan in revising ratings of Pandora's stock lower."We are a bit taken back as the company appears much further behind in its ad tech product map than we have appreciated and the company's deficiencies appear more severe," SunTrust analyst Matthew Thornton wrote in a note.Pandora's revenue in the last quarter was $379 million, below Wall Street's expectations of $380.6 million, according to Thomson Reuters.Advertising revenue, which accounts for the bulk of Pandora's overall revenue, grew 1 percent year over year but missed analyst expectations.Pandora reported $275.7 million in advertising revenue, which also came in below analyst expectations of $289.3 million, according to StreetAccount."There's no silver bullet that's going to come in and solve these problems," CEO Roger Lynch said in a conference call with investors.He said investments in ad targeting and reporting technology would start to have an effect throughout 2018.The stock was already struggling this year, falling 43 percent for 2017 through Thursday's close, according to FactSet.
'Biotech rebel': Here's what it's really like to raise money in Silicon Valley:::::It's deceptively easy to fall into the trap of being the accommodating founder who goes with the flow by dutifully scheduling follow-up meetings that will go nowhere.Never wrap up an investor meeting or call without taking their temperature.Most investors know within five minutes.That means there's never ever a reason to take more than two face-to-face meetings one on their turf, one on your turf with a prospective investor.Any more and you're being strung along.How do you know where an investor stands?Just ask.Here's what I suggest: "Are we a thesis fit and can you see yourself getting to conviction?"If a VC can't answer those two questions, they either weren't paying attention to your pitch, or they're not taking their job and your time seriously.Too many founders hear investors tell them that they're going to "circle up with the team," and believe them.Weeks of radio silence and several Monday VC partnership meetings later, founders maddeningly realize they've hit a dead end.Unfortunately, few investors come right out and say no.All too often they sugar coat rejection with unverifiable excuses about timing or purely ceremonious offers to help.You know as a founder that you've hit a wall when you hear things like, "we need 4-5 weeks to dig in," or "we prefer to lead," or "love your mission, tell me how I can help."You want to know how you can help?You can fund my company.
In a new trend, companies really want workers with political skills, LinkedIn says:::::Jobseekers with political science degrees or backgrounds in grassroots campaigning are emerging as highly desired by businesses looking to navigate Donald Trump's Washington, a year after he won the presidency, LinkedIn Editor-in-Chief Dan Roth told CNBC on Friday.In the monthly Workforce Report from the social network for professionals, hiring across the U.S. showed a 24.1 percent increase last month compared with a year earlier."One surprise, we're seeing is increasing demand for people with political skills," Roth said."It goes beyond lobbying.We looked into who's being hired; people with grassroots skills, any kind of development, foreign relations.People with a poli sci major, this is a glory day for you."The October LinkedIn report said that in large cities, like the San Francisco Bay Area, Seattle and New York, top employers hiring people with political skills are tech companies, nongovernmental organization and universities."Businesses are realizing that they have to interact or help steer government; policies and regulations," Roth said.He said the tech company hiring the most from the government is Amazon, adding it's from the post office as the e-commerce giant looks to continue honing its delivery models.LinkedIn's Workforce Report, released ahead of Friday's weaker-than-expected October jobs data from the government, is compiled from the website's 141 million user profiles in the U.S., 20,000 company profiles and 3 million monthly job postings.
These robotic skeletons could teach spine-injury patients how to move again:::::The Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts that demand for physical therapists will grow by 25 percent from 2016 to 2026.A group of engineering students from the University of Texas at Austin hopes to alleviate some of that need with two rehabilitation robots.The first, Harmony, is a full upper-body exoskeleton designed to wrap around a patient's arms and shoulders.It's meant to move patients through a set of exercises, much like a physical therapist would."Given the serious need in therapy right now for stroke patients, a robotics system can play a really important role by delivering more therapy, collecting data on people and also be precise in how we deliver therapy," said Ashish Deshpande, director of the ReNeu Robotics Lab, which made the bots.
Apple shares hit record high as Wall Street gushes over iPhone X launch:::::Apple shares are surging as Wall Street is growing more bullish on the smartphone maker's iPhone X launch Friday.The company reported better-than-expected September quarter earnings results and gave a December quarter sales guidance range above Wall Street expectations at the midpoint Thursday evening.Apple shares hit an all-time high, opening up 3.5 percent Friday as notes poured in from Wall Street that were positive on last quarter's earnings and even more optimistic about the iPhone X."Apple closed FY17 on a solid note then offered healthy guidance for the first quarter of the iPhone X," Nomura Instinet analyst Jeffrey Kvaal wrote in a note to clients Friday."Recent supply chain improvements allay concerns of severe supply constraints.We expect consensus to come towards our high end estimates."The iPhone X is available in stores Friday at a base model price of $999.Thousands have lined up around the world to be among the first to get their hands on the much anticipated phone.Kvaal reiterated his buy rating and $185 price target for Apple shares, representing 10 percent upside to Thursday's close.Morgan Stanley is confident the new higher-priced model will spur current iPhone users to upgrade."We see iPhone X unlocking pent-up iPhone upgrades, especially in China," analyst Katy Huberty wrote on Friday."Near-term, we see pent-up demand heading into a significant form factor change that is likely to accelerate iPhone unit growth."Huberty reaffirmed her overweight rating and raised her price target to $200 from $199 for Apple shares.On the flip side, one Wall Street analyst doesn't believe iPhone X's success is assured.While the September quarter "results were solid, we believe investors' main focus is on whether Apple can sell a $1,000 premium phone in significant quantities, something we won't have a good sense of until later this year, at the earliest," Deutsche Bank analyst Sherri Scribner wrote on Thursday."Until then, we expect bulls and bears to remain in their own camps, with this quarter's results unlikely to sway views."Scribner maintained her hold rating for Apple shares.Apple's stock is up 45 percent year to date through Thursday compared with the S&P 500's 15 percent gain.
How to get an iPhone X on launch day:::::Apple promised some stores will have stock of the iPhone X op launch day Friday.This is probably your best bet, but you'll be faced with long lines of people who also want to be among the first to grab one.Also, keep in mind that selection might be limited by the time you get there, so be ready to take what's available.
This is how you can protect your cryptocurrencies from hackers:::::So what's the best way to protect your cryptocurrency investments from hacks?To find out, we reached out to three cryptocurrency investors and three cybersecurity experts.All three investors have lost some cryptocurrencies due to different hacks.One of the experts, Amir Bandeali, also is an investor, lost about 18 percent of his investments because the exchange (Bitfinex) he was trading with was hacked.That incident inspired him to build decentralized exchanges, which he believes will be the future for trading cryptocurrencies.All of them admitted there's no perfect solution to the problem.In the age of cryptocurrency, hard drives and personal computers have become the new bank vaults.And our real-world knowledge of protecting money from theft is not enough in the virtual world.The following suggestions can serve as a safety pamphlet for new cryptocurrency investors.Here's the advice of investors and experts, edited for clarity and style: Jonathan Levin, co-founder of Chainalysis 1.Before you open up an account on Coinbase [or other exchanges], set up an unique email that you are going to use for that account.2.Make sure to set a really hard and long password, and you are the only one to access it from a piece of paper that you control.Dan Romero, VP of operation at Coinbase 1.On Coinbase, turn off SMS-based two-factor authentication and account recovery for your email account.If you move to Google Authenticator but don't turn off SMS account recovery, a phone port attack can still lead to an email compromise.2.On Coinbase, setup the Coinbase Vault and two-factor authentication for any sends off-site.Sean Everett, VP of product management, Coinbase account was hacked by phone porting attack 1.Don't talk about cryptocurrency publicly, especially on social media.2.Call your cellphone provider, put every level of security you possibly can, and add a passcode to it.The next level protection is to add a "do not port" SIM card to your account.That can last for a year.3.Even though Coinbase says it takes security seriously and has system designs to protect customers, it's not a bank.Don't trust it as such.Adam Dachis, digital consultant, Coinbase account was raided by a computer hack Don't keep all your cryptocurrency investments in one place.Diversify among exchanges.It's unlikely you are going to get hacked at the same time through all of them.Especially if you have different emails and passwords for each.Sanjay Beri, CEO of Netskope, specialize in enforcing security across cloud applications and network.Keep your cryptocurrency off the internet, in a "cold wallet.""Cold wallet" is not a brand, it's a concept of storing bitcoins offline (not connected to internet) so that it reduces the opportunities for hackers to steal via online techniques."Hot wallet" is connected to the internet, for daily transactions.Think about "hot wallet" as a checking account and "cold wallet" as the savings account.Here is how to create a cheap "cold wallet" on a dedicated computer: First, download a cold wallet application to a new, secure usb drive.Then, take a computer, reset it to factory setting, disconnect it from the internet and keep it offline.Last, load the cold wallet application onto the computer, keep your cryptocurrencies on that clean and offline computer.You can make transactions offline, using the cold wallet application.Amir Bandeali, CTO and founder of 0x project 1.If you must use a centralized exchange, withdrawal often, store your tokens on a hardware wallet, which is a hardware device, creates transactions without connecting through the internet.2.If you are trading tokens on ethereum, I recommend looking into decentralized exchanges.The biggest difference between centralized exchanges (like Coinbase, Kraken and Bitfinex) and decentralized exchanges is that decentralized exchanges do not hold users' funds.No one can ever access your funds other than you.So it can't be stolen unless your private keys are compromised.
Trump tweets on account deactivation: 'The word must finally be getting out—and having an impact':::::President Donald Trump tweeted early Friday on the 11-minute deactivation of his account by a Twitter customer service worker on the employee's last day at work."I guess the word must finally be getting out-and having an impact," the president tweeted.Twitter said Thursday night that Trump's personal account had been deactivated.
WhatsApp messenger service suffers major outage:::::WhatsApp was hit by a major outage on Friday morning, preventing people around the globe from using the world's most popular messaging app.Users of the Facebook-owned app could not send or receive messages as the service continued to say it was "connecting", though no connection was made.According to DownDetector, there were problems across Europe although users in India, Pakistan, Singapore and Iraq also reported that they could not access the service.Whatsappdown was the top trending item on Twitter in India, which is the app's largest market.Around 200 million of the messaging app's billion-plus users are based in India.A spokesperson for Facebook in Singapore said the company was investigating the matter, Reuters reported.The online messaging app went down in the U.K. at approximately 8:30 a.m. GMT (4.30 a.m.ET), before users were able to reconnect around 30 minutes later.The reported connection error comes as Apple released the iPhone X on Friday, with people eagerly anticipating the tech giant's latest flagship phone in stores globally.Facebook was not immediately available for comment when contacted by CNBC.
Blockchain and biometrics: The tech disrupting banking:::::As the banking industry changes at a rapid pace, one term is being used with increasing frequency blockchain.Put simply, blockchain refers to a tamper-proof, distributed digital ledger that records transactions.Instead of different parties involved in a transaction keeping their own records of that transaction which could potentially differ and cause confusion blockchain creates one "master" record.This cannot be changed once a transaction has been recorded.As technology giant IBM notes: "All parties must give consensus before a new transaction is added to the network."Dirk Haubrich is head of consumer protection, financial innovation and payments at the European Banking Authority (EBA).He told CNBC: "We've looked at blockchain in one particular use case, which was virtual currencies, four years ago."At that time, the EBA had a "rather negative view," Haubrich explained."But there are lots of other use cases that have been emerging since then, like trade finance and clearing of payments."This was "quite interesting," he added."Many of the risks that we've identified at the time for virtual currencies probably don't arise for those use cases but we need to have a closer look, which we haven't done yet."It could be argued that blockchain technology is still in its infancy, and that its potential is a long way from being fully realized.PayPal's Mark Brant told CNBC that blockchain would continue to evolve, "but for it to become widely used there need to be scale use cases on either the consumer side or the merchant side or both.""We'll continue to follow that and experiment with it and keep abreast of it, and continue to look to see whether there is a clear gap in the market that we can exploit with it," Brant, who is managing director at PayPal U.K., added.While blockchain technology offers new ways of carrying out transactions, other innovations could help to boost the security of financial dealings.One such development is the increasing use of biometrics in banking.Already, many of us use our fingerprints to unlock our smartphones, and there are a range of potential applications."There's voice biometrics, there's fingerprint biometrics, there's iris biometrics, I think there's going to be many more invented," Niall Cameron, global head of corporate and institutional digital at HSBC, said.Cameron went on to say that biometrics was probably one of the most important areas of new technology needed by the industry.Follow CNBC International on Twitter and Facebook.
Thousands are lining up for the iPhone X around the world:::::Thousands of Apple users around the world lined up to get their hands on the new iPhone X that became available in major markets on Friday.The iPhone X, Apple's 10th anniversary offering, is loaded with plenty of high-end hardware and new features, including Face ID that unlocks the phone when users look at it.It is also pricey, starting at $999 for the entry-level model.According to Apple, the handset was available Friday in more than 50 markets, including China, the U.S., the U.K., Singapore, Australia, India and Japan.CEO Tim Cook told CNBC on Thursday that the iPhone X, from an order perspective, is "off to a very strong start."That followed a muted launch for the iPhone 8 in September.
Alibaba’s Jack Ma on e-commerce in China, globalization and Trump:::::And eBay's reaction was to put out a press release saying: Free is not a business model.But in fact, we knew that because we were getting so many people onto Taobao because we were free in the early days.Ultimately, we could make money, Erisman said.There was talk of a partnership with eBay, but then Ma shocked the business world by doing a deal with Yahoo in 2005, where the American company invested $1 billion in Alibaba.But ultimately, it didnt work, Erisman said.The underlying politics of the two countries were sort of destined to rip the companies apart.You can't have a U.S. company like Yahoo that reports up to a sort of a Western set of ideals, really partnering on an equal basis with a Chinese company that has to conform to the Chinese political regulations.There was also a dispute with Yahoo in 2011 when it accused Ma of transferring ownership of Alipay to his own entity, without telling shareholders.After Verizons acquisition of Yahoo completed in June 2017, Yahoo renamed its remaining assets including its stake in Alibaba Altaba.Alibaba also has an advantage because of huge U.S. tech companies including Google and Facebook being blocked in China (although both are said to be hoping to enter the country next year), but the Chinese government is also a threat to its own business people.Anbang Insurance Chairman Wu Xiaohui was said to be detained, in June, possibly due to his links with the U.S. Is that something Ma is concerned about?Well, I think, as businesspeople, me, I do everything to make sure that I'm (keeping) my customers happy, employees happy, the society is good.It's healthy.Social responsibility is the key.Whatever we do, we try to make sure that the society is good.So I don't know what's going on with the others, he told The Brave Ones.Ma talks about three things you should not touch: money, power and glory.If you keep the power in your office, you will be in trouble.If you keep the money in your own pocket, you will be in trouble.If you put the glory in your hand, you will be in trouble.So when you have the money, spend the money supporting more people.When you are in power, empower the others.When the glory, (make sure) the other people have that.Then you will be happy.
Thieves steal more than $300,000 worth of new iPhones from a truck in San Francisco:::::More than 300 Apple iPhone X units were stolen from a UPS truck in San Francisco before the newest model was launched for sale, multiple outlets reported.The thieves, who have yet to be caught, broke into the truck while its driver had been making a delivery at the Stonestown Galleria shopping mall in San Francisco, according to CBS SF Bay Area.With the iPhone X retailing at between $999 and $1,150 in the U.S., the value of the stolen goods would have amounted to at least about $300,000.The police are looking for three suspects in hooded sweatshirts who drove a white Dodge van, the report said.The theft reportedly occurred between 11 a.m. and 11:15 a.m. Pacific time on Wednesday, website CNET reported, putting the value of the stolen goods at more than $370,000.The iPhone X was launched for sale on Friday in more than 50 markets, including the U.S., China and the U.K. Thousands had formed snaking queues outside Apple stores around the world in the lead up to the launch.Read more about the theft on CBS SF Bay Area's site.
Twitter employee deactivated Trump's account for 11 minutes:::::The company sent out a tweet from its Twitter Government team saying that Trump's account has been restored."We are continuing to investigate and are taking steps to prevent this from happening again," the tweet said.
Amazon to end Fresh grocery delivery service in some areas:::::AmazonFresh deliveries will stop for some people after Nov. 30, according to messages sent to customers in suburban Pennsylvania and New Jersey, seen by Reuters.Amazon customers in Maryland and California posted on Twitter that they were losing the service as well.The news comes after the online retailer's $13.7 billion acquisition of Whole Foods Market, which is expected to play a key role in Amazon's grocery delivery going forward.Amazon did not immediately comment if the delivery change stemmed from the Whole Foods deal.
Cramer Remix: Here’s why Apple’s quarter is one of the greatest blowouts I’ve ever seen:::::Cramer Remix: Heres why Apples quarter is one of the greatest blowouts Ive ever seen 17 Hours Ago | 01:11 CNBC's Jim Cramer knows that sentiment matters when stocks are constantly being driven higher by a raging bull market.But the "Mad Money" host also knows that sentiment is extremely difficult to measure.So Cramer has started asking people why they don't like the market.So far, he's been met with a cacophony of eye-opening answers.One major reason Cramer has heard is that people can't afford to invest in the stock market, despite Cramer's advice to start with small investments and build on their gains.Often times, Cramer asks if they like their iPhones.When they say they do, he asks why they wouldn't go buy shares of Apple."They typically screw up their faces and say, 'I don't know.I have no idea.'Well, let me tell you something.The company that is Apple reported tonight and it was one of the greatest blowouts I have ever seen," Cramer said."Spectacular revenue growth, amazing earnings, a re-acceleration in China, bountiful services stream, and you just try getting an [iPhone] 10.Just try."Cramer said that he was proud of his faith in Apple CEO Tim Cook, adding that so many people are "oblivious" to Apple's stock and the plays that benefit when it soars, like Broadcom."No one got Apple right except for us," he said."What a shame, as this company, with a market cap approaching what could be $1 trillion, could have made fortunes for people if they would just understand that you can own not trade, but own a piece of this amazing company."
Tim Cook interview with CNBC after Q4 2017 earnings: full transcript:::::Apple CEO Tim Cook said the company is working hard to meet the demand for its flagship iPhone X smartphone in an interview with CNBC's Josh Lipton and Jim Cramer after the company's earnings report on Thursday.What we can say, and you can see that from our quotes, is we were quickly backlogged, to say the least.Now, however, as I mentioned, the ramp is going better, and we're hoping to decrease those quotes in the next day or two -- some.Now, there will still be a wait, but we're working as hard as we can to get as many out there as soon as possible.We know that a lot of people want these in time for the holidays, and so you can bet that we're trying to do that.An Apple representative said that between 200 and 500 people were waiting in line in front of some of the first Apple Stores where the iPhone X on sale Friday, including stores in Australia, Singapore and Japan.Cook also noted that the company's wearable devices business is going strong."The wearables business, which is largely the Watch and AirPods, are now the size of a Fortune 400 company and really coming out of nowhere if you really think about when we started this business," Cook said.No.400 on the Fortune 500 list is Calpine, which had $6.7 billion in annual revenue, according to Fortune.Separately, investor and former Apple analyst Gene Munster estimated that the Watch alone makes up about 3 percent of Apple's revenue, or about $7 billion a year.Here's the full transcript.Tim Cook: We just finished a spectacular year, fiscal year 2017, and we had a strong end to it.We had record Q4 revenues of $52.6 billion, which was above the high end of our guidance and up 12 percent year on year.It's the fourth consecutive quarter that we've had accelerating revenues.Geographically, Americas, Europe and the rest of Asia Pac all hit record revenues for Q4, for the September quarter, and we've returned to growth in greater China from strong iPhone, Mac and iPad unit and market share gains.If you look at products, we shipped almost 47 million iPhones, which was more than we had expected, and we saw double-digit iPhone gains in a number of emerging markets, like the Middle East, central and Eastern Europe, India, Mexico, mainland China -- yeah, I can't forget that one -- which we're very proud of.Also, I should've said earlier our total revenue in India doubled year on year, and so that the initiative on India really has a lot of traction.From a services point of view, we had all-time quarterly results of $8.5 billion in revenue, up 34 percent year on year.The App Store hit another record, Apple Music also had a spectacular quarter, and if you look at our total paid subscriptions, which includes the Apple-branded and third-party branded services we now hold 210 million subscriptions, putting us among the top subscription holders in the world.That's up 25 million in just the last 90 days.The Mac had its best year ever in 2017, and its best Q4 ever, as we ended the year.Our product line that we refreshed in June, particularly the notebook line, has been very, very well received, and we picked up share again around the world.Over 60 percent of Macs were sold to people who are new to Mac, and the largest component of that by far are switchers from Windows.IPad also grew double digits for the quarter, and this is the second consecutive quarter of iPad growth.The new product line here has also been well received with iPad Pro and iPad and iOS 11, which added a number of productivity kinds of things, multitasking, drag and drop, Files, etc., to the iPad experience.The Apple Watch was up over 50 percent in units for the third consecutive quarter, so the momentum here continues, and we couldn't be more excited about the Series 3 and how it's being received and sort of the cellular function that is clearly a game changer for the Watch.The wearables business, which is largely the Watch and AirPods, are now the size of a Fortune 400 company, and really coming out of nowhere, if you really think about when we started this business.From a new product point of view, iPhone 8 and 8 Plus, when we started shipping those, they instantly became the top two selling iPhones in our line and have continued to be every week since the launch.IPhone X, from an order point of view, is off to a very strong start from both the direct orders and the orders that our channel partners, primarily carriers, place on us.The manufacturing ramp, which I know has been the subject to much discussion, is going well.Our output is increasing every week, and I think it's going particularly well considering that it's the most advanced iPhone we've ever made, and it has a number of new technologies in it.The first stores open in about one hour from now in Australia and that's sort of the firing gun for sales to begin for November 3, and we could not be more excited about it.The place is really buzzing about that.Our revenue guidance is very strong, it's $84-87 billion, and keep in mind that the quarter that we're comparing against had 14 weeks in it versus this quarter has 13 in it, so you have to add 8 points to sort of normalize it to get a normalized growth rate, so you would come out then at the low end we're accelerating again on revenue growth.Let's see.I think that's it.Any questions?Josh Lipton: Regarding the iPhone X, Tim, we know the delivery window got pushed out very quickly.Cook: Yeah.Lipton: Is demand for that phone above what you've seen in previous years?Because I know Apple said it was off the charts, which to me sounds like you're saying higher than ever.Is that the right way to think about it?Cook: There's nothing to compare it to is the real answer to that, because it has no predecessor product.It's not replacing something that existed, and so there's not a compare other than a compare to sort of our forecast internally, and so in some ways I'm not sure if any language I've put on it is terribly meaningful for you.What we can say, and you can see that from our quotes, is we were quickly backlogged, to say the least.Now, however, as I mentioned, the ramp is going better, and we're hoping to decrease those quotes in the next day or two -- some.Now, there will still be a wait, but we're working as hard as we can to get as many out there as soon as possible.We know that a lot of people want these in time for the holidays, and so you can bet that we're trying to do that.Lipton: To the ramp, Tim, as you mentioned, there were a lot of rumors of productions problems with the X given as you said all the new technology in this phone.Is that just for your noise, or were there any more production challenges that with previous models?Cook: We knew that this was going to be a challenging product.It's challenging because it's so advanced and because it sets the roadmap for the next decade, we knew it would be challenging.From my point of view -- I've been through lots of iPhones and lots of ramps as well -- the way I would really describe it is it's going well.And we're happy with where we are and what you want to see in a ramp is every week you're doing better, and that's what I see.And so a lot of the noise in the system sometimes cannot be accurate, as you probably know.Lipton: And do you expect the iPhone X to come into supply-demand bounds within roughly another quarter as other models have?Cook: I don't know is the answer to that.I don't know.And so we'll see.This one is harder to read.What I mean by that is we have three iPhones for the first time, we have a staggered launch for the first time.And so there's a number of things we've never experienced before.We put our best judgment in the guidance that we're going to provide in an hour or so -- the $84 to $87.And we'll see how we do.But we believe it's going to be our best quarter ever.Lipton: And how does the iPhone X demand in China look relative to previous models that were priced lower?Would you say demand for the iPhone X in China is off the charts too?Is that how you'd describe it?Cook: We haven't started selling in China yet.So we start in a few hours, I guess, so we'll start getting a read.China takes indications of interest.That's my word for it -- versus a hard pre-order.In general, the channels sell the vast majority of the units.And so the indications of interest are really good.Lipton: Two more questions, Tim.The fight with Qualcomm continues.We got news today, Qualcomm is suing Apple, alleging breach of contract, trying to help rival Intel.There are also these reports that Apple has now designed devices for 2018 that don't use Qualcomm components.Is that accurate, Tim?Cook: On the second one, I wouldn't comment on it because it's a new product thing and we just do not comment on new products, as you know.On sort of the lawsuit, the macro lawsuits, there's lawsuits going back and forth.If you back up and look at this, what is happening is that the KFTC has found Qualcomm guilty and fined them in the past few weeks.The Taiwan justice department has found Qualcomm guilty and fined them.The U.S. FTC sued them and has a suit going on.The EU is investigating them.And so I think it's pretty clear that there are problems there.What do you think?Lipton: We talk a lot about how much Qualcomm needs Apple.But doesn't Apple need Qualcomm if it wants to keep selling top-of-the-line devices in the future?Cook: No.No.Lipton: Fair enough.A final question.House Republicans unveiled their plan to overhaul the tax code today.It includes lowering the corporate tax rate to 20 percent.You suggested to Lester Holt that the tax reform could encourage Apple to hire more people.When you think about that, Tim, how many more people, and what kinds of jobs do you have in mind?Cook: Well, what I believe is that on a more macro basis, I think it's great for the U.S. economy to have tax reform.There are two things going on today.One is U.S. domicile companies pay a lot domestically.Secondly, if you are multinational and you have earnings, you make money offshore, which more and more people will over time.The only way to bring that back to the U.S. and invest in the U.S. is to pay 40 percent on it.And people aren't going to do that.And so I think that you wind up having a huge investment in the United States by passing tax reform.Will we do more in the U.S.?Yes, we've been doing more in the U.S., right?We're putting up a data center up in Iowa.We're out training people in community colleges to learn to code.We hired 10,000 people or so in the U.S. last year.We just put another huge store in Chicago and continuing to expand our footprint.Lipton: So what you're saying, Tim, is you don't know if you'll come into supply and demand balance with the X within roughly a quarter?Cook: I don't know.Lipton: There are some who say listen, if that delay is too long, then there's the risk of some consumers saying, You know what, I'm going to go with what I can get my hands on -- the 8, the 7, switch to a rival or just wait for the new phone to roll out?What's your answer to that?Cook: I want people to buy what they want.And so if they want to buy an 8 or an 8 Plus or a 7 or a 7 Plus, then I'm good with that.I want them to be an Apple customer.And we want to earn that, so we want to sell them what they want, and if they want an X, I can tell you we're working just as hard as we can to make as many as we can as fast as we can.It's just hard to say with certainty when supply hits demand.This is something, again -- we're in uncharted territory in terms of three phones, staggered launch -- and releasing it halfway through the quarter, basically.We're five weeks into a 13-week quarter already.However, look at the guidance.The guidance is unbelievably strong.We're talking about our best quarter ever.And we're talking about the low end of the guidance I think the growth rate is 7 percent, and that's 7 compared to 14 weeks, so it's really 15.And so that's pretty good.Jim Cramer: I just wanted to get some color on China because it's a very big deal to be able to say you're taking share.A year ago we were worried about China.It sounds like something's happened to make it so that China is terrific.I'd love to be able to tell that story.Cook: The real story that's happening there is that it's broad-based.That it's the iPad doing well -- that's China responding to our new lineup on iPad.The Mac is doing well -- that's China responding to our new Mac lineup.Services are really doing well.That's the ecosystem being stronger and stronger particularly on iOS.So that's iPad and iPhone.IPhone had a great quarter in China, the best for quite some time from a year on year point of view.Our initiative from a market point of view to focus on tier 2 cities is paying off.Before we were focused on major Tier 1 cities.We've put quite an effort in over time to focus more on Tier 2.And we saw really nice growth in Tier 2 cities last quarter.The other thing that's happened -- currency which happened to be a big drag in China, was only a 1 point drag last quarter, so some of that headwind has subsided.And then secondly, and this is also very important, is if you remember, I talked about Hong Kong until you were probably sick of hearing me talk about it.Hong Kong was still a headwind last quarter but much much, much less than it has been.And that's not necessarily because Hong Kong is doing a lot better, it's because we're comping now to a weaker Hong Kong number.And so you've got the Hong Kong improving on a relative basis, but more importantly, all of the products, which is our lifeline, are being received very well in China.We're thrilled on getting the iPhone X in there.Which is about to happen.Cramer: Some people are saying, Oh, wait, a second, the 8, X-- I'm really confused.How could Apple be doing well if they've got two out there.It sounds like from this number that it's a great strategy.I'm trying to figure out how you knew it'd be a great strategy, and why it's working.Cook: Well, if we could do anything we wanted to, we would have obviously shipped 8, 8 Plus and X on the same day.But we felt like the most important thing for us to do was to announce them on the same day so we wouldn't have customers buy an 8 and then we announce the X and ship it and they go, Oh, you hosed me, I would've bought a X.So we announced all of those.Obviously there are some people over time that delay to play with all three before they decide.A fair number have decided I want the X and they're waiting for the X.But that's the reason that we did the stagger.It wasn't a marketing thing.It was we weren't ready to ship -- we were still working on it.We accelerated the date at which we were initially planning to do iPhone X.And that's how we got here and we're going to learn a lot.
Cramer: Despite their difficulties, Facebook and Tesla are good long-term investments:::::After negative reactions to Facebook's and Tesla's respective earnings reports on Wall Street, CNBC's Jim Cramer made a somewhat contrarian call."You know what?I think the stocks of these two companies could reverse and go higher after a couple of days of selling," the "Mad Money" host said."It has to do with the way they handle their conference calls after they report their earnings, and how they approach their investor bases and make their promises."Cramer began with Tesla.The automaker posted a larger-than-expected loss in the third quarter due to production problems with its Model 3 sedan.Elon Musk, Tesla's outspoken CEO, tried to mitigate analysts' concerns on the conference call, acknowledging the production issues but saying that, once they're fixed, Tesla could become a production machine with the highest profitability in the industry.The Street responded in kind, sending shares of Tesla down nearly 10 percent on Wednesday.But individual investors could respond differently, Cramer said."There's a retail investor cohort who actually cares about different things," Cramer said."You gotta have faith, and individual investors, they've got just that when it comes to the stock of Tesla.They believe in Tesla, which is why they'll soon come in to buy the stock because they love the car and they don't care about things like profit or gross margins or earnings per share."Musk's followers tend to forgive his over-promising and under-delivering, even if the analysts who cover Tesla don't.Cramer said that he could see Tesla's stock withstanding another round of financing on the faith of its fans.Facebook's third-quarter earnings report beat analyst estimates, but the company's situation is different, Cramer said.The social media giant's management tends to under-promise on conference calls, like in 2016 when they said they expected Facebook's ad revenue growth rate to "come down meaningfully."After this quarter, shares of Facebook fell on the company's statements that countering bad actors like Russian hackers on its platform will significantly impact profitability."Facebook's stock was up 4 [basis] points before [CEO Mark] Zuckerberg said that and added, 'protecting our community is more important than maximizing our profits,'" Cramer said."I think this comment's just like the ad slowdown comment.It's done to temper expectations as well as make it clear to Congress that Facebook's good actors."So, even as neither conference call inspired much near-term confidence, Cramer pointed to the statistics: Tesla's stock is up 50 percent for 2017 and Facebook's stock is up 58 percent."They both have their narratives, one hopelessly upbeat, the other ridiculously downbeat, and both work longer term even with the short-term pressure they're under," the "Mad Money" host said."Two different strategies, same stock results a few weeks later, as the stocks first go lower and then climb right back up again."
Cramer vouches for behind-the-scenes digital payment play Global Payments:::::CNBC's Jim Cramer has been following the bull market in payment processing and the rise of digital transactions for a while, pounding the table on plays like Visa and PayPal.But there are more ways to play the global cash-to-credit shift besides credit card companies and payment processors, so Cramer decided to analyze Global Payments, an international merchant acquirer that enables retailers to accept electronic payments."The stock of Global Payments has rocketed up more than 48 percent year to date, so good that, yes, I'm kicking myself.I wish I had highlighted it earlier," the "Mad Money" host said."These guys own the client relationships in the payments business and they're the ones who set pricing.They also have some e-commerce, cross-border and gambling-related solutions."When somebody makes a purchase with a credit card, it sets off a complex chain of events.First, the retailer that sold the item sends transaction information to its merchant acquirer (Global Payments, for example), which sends it to the credit card network (say, Visa).The credit card operator then gives the information to the customer's bank, which validates and pays for the transaction.In the end, the credit card network only makes less than one-fifth of 1 percent of each transaction.The merchant acquirer in this case, Global Payments makes a 2 to 3 percent cut.Cramer said Global Payments' outlook drastically improved when it bought Heartland Payment Systems in 2015 for $3.8 billion.The deal, which was completed in April 2016, gave Global Payments an array of new small- and medium-sized clients, helping boost its exposure to new industries like restaurants.It also added 1,400 salespeople across North America to Global Payments' roster.All together, the Heartland acquisition is expected to produce $1 billion in added revenues and $60 million in cost savings in 2017 alone.Long term, it is expected to boost Global Payments' revenue growth by up to 2 percent, part of the reason why the stock has caught fire this year."Meanwhile, Global Payments is looking to expand internationally," Cramer said."Right now, the rest of the world accounts for roughly a quarter of the company's sales.Asia, Europe, [the] Middle East, Africa, [and] Latin America is where the real growth is, so they're aggressively trying to take share overseas."Typically, Cramer doesn't like to invest solely on earnings reports.But given Global Payments' bullish guidance, strategic partnership with Vista Equity Partners and e-commerce expansion, he made an exception to his rule regarding the company's third-quarter earnings report on Nov. 8."I don't like to game the earnings reports, but if Global Payments delivers another good quarter next week and the stock gets dinged anyway, I wouldn't be surprised if you're getting another buying opportunity," he said.And shares of Global Payments are trading at less than 22 times next year's earnings estimates, slightly more expensive than its closest rival, Vantiv, but much cheaper than payment networks than Visa, which trades at 27 times next year's earnings."Bottom line: I love the payments space.That's why we own the cheapest one for my charitable trust club members know First Data, which hasn't been acting well but is so inexpensive, is the one that has got the best value but if you want a little-known company that's essential to the payments food chain, then you could do a whole lot worse than Global Payments," Cramer said."Only concern?[The] stock's run a lot this year.Yeah, ideally, you could wait for a pullback.How about this: half before, half after."
Facebook's revenue per user topped $5 for the first time:::::Users in the U.S. and Canada, were more profitable than elsewhere, with ARPU in those countries rising 35 percent to $21.20.On Wednesday, Facebook said third-quarter revenue surged 47 percent to $10.3 billion, and the company reported that it has 2.07 billion users.Facebook shares dropped 2.1 percent on Thursday to $178.92, after the company said expenses will jump between 45 percent and 60 percent next year, more than some analysts expected.
Apple roars back to growth in China:::::Apple CEO Tim Cook made good on his promise: Apple's business in China is growing again.Apple reported quarterly earnings on Thursday.The company said revenue in China was $9.8 billion during the fourth fiscal quarter, up 12 percent year over year and up 22 percent sequentially.Last quarter, sales were down 10 percent year over year and 25 percent sequentially in the region."We increased market share for iPhone, Mac and iPad during the quarter.We hit all-time revenue records for services for the PRC during the quarter, we had very strong iPad revenue growth, we had double-digit unit growth in iPhone, and both the upgraders and Android switchers were up on a year-over-year basis during the quarter.So the results were broad-based they were pretty much across the board," Cook said of China on a conference call.Apple was also helped by easier comparisons to the year-ago quarter, and easing pressure on exchange rates in Hong Kong."I feel great about the results," Cook said.Cook said a year ago that China would be a key to Apple's growth going forward.Earlier this year, the company promoted Isabel Ge Mahe to a new position as Apple's vice president and managing director of greater China, reporting directly to Cook and Chief Operating Officer Jeff Williams."We are very bullish on China," Cook said on the fourth-quarter earnings call last October."We continue to see a middle class that's booming there."Shaking the slump in China is no small feat.While Chinese brands like Huawei, Oppo, Vivo and Xiaomi have struggled to gain traction in the U.S., they all outpace Apple in terms of units sold in China, according to Canalys estimates.Chinese consumers also use apps like WeChat to perform some of the functions of Apple's operating system, and Chinese regulators have a somewhat uneasy relationship with American technology companies.Pre-orders also work slightly differently in China, Cook said.Cook said he expects to take an analogous approach in another huge market, India, where Apple now manufactures many iPhone SE models.The cell service in India is "materially better" than a year ago, creating a "sea change" in India, Cook said."It's building stores, it's building channels, it's building markets, it's building the developer ecosystem, it's having the right product line up for the market," Cook said."I feel like we're making good progress there and are gaining understanding of the market, but we still have a long way to go, which I sort of see as an opportunity instead of a problem."Apple's chief financial officer said emerging markets helped lead Apple's iPad growth, with iPad unit sales were up 25 percent year-over-year, and India, which grew 39 percent."Our emerging market performance during the quarter was very strong," Cook said."If you take China out, it's even strong, but you can see the China rebound .... we just had a phenomenal quarter."
Russia Investigation Has Tech Giants Shying From ‘Social’ Label:::::Tim Cook, Apples chief executive and an outspoken critic of the data-collection practices of his companys technological rivals, said Wednesday that he was concerned that social networks could be weaponized against the people who use them.The bigger issue is that some of these tools are used to divide people, to manipulate people, to get fake news to people in broad numbers, and so to influence their thinking, said Mr. Cook in an interview with NBC News.Frank Shaw, head of communications at Apples longtime rival, Microsoft, praised Mr. Cooks comments in a Twitter post, saying that Mr. Cook had framed the issue perfectly.Last year, Microsoft did purchase LinkedIn, a career-oriented social network, for $26.2 billion, but that site appears to have played little role in Russias influence efforts.With the emergence of Facebook, Twitter and their ilk over the last decade, social became a key Silicon Valley buzzword as companies crammed social network-like features into new products.Even Apple, despite the tens of billions of dollars it has earned making computing devices, has tried its hand at a social network focused on music.But as social media has become increasingly connected to unpleasant bickering, race-baiting and Russian propaganda, the must-have social label has become an albatross, said Joseph Bayer, an assistant professor at Ohio State University who focuses on social networks.The mere fact that a tech company is trying to minimize its overall influence is a telling signal of the moment were in, said Mr. Bayer.Google, which operates under the parent company Alphabet, can offer a distinction between its business and how social networks operate largely because its attempts to build a social network have not been very successful.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The company spent millions of dollars creating Google+, a social site built specifically to take on Facebook.The company tied Google+ into nearly every one of its properties, describing it as the social spine of Google in public statements at the time.There also were short-lived efforts like Google Buzz and Google Wave, or geographically specific sites like Orkut popular in Brazil but ignored elsewhere.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Google+ continues to exist but it is considered a disappointment.Google said it had found no political posts from state-linked actors on Google+.Google has often tried to fashion YouTube, its sprawling video service, into something more like a social network in hopes of keeping visitors interested.Last year, YouTube added what it called its Community product, essentially features intended to inspire users to interact more with one another.Google said accounts believed to have ties to the Kremlin had uploaded more than 1,100 videos to YouTube on racial, religious and political topics.Those videos were viewed 309,000 times.Many of those videos had only a small number of views, though they were frequently posted to other social media platforms, Richard Salgado, Googles senior counsel in law enforcement and information security, told a Senate subcommittee on Tuesday.Facebook, to offer a comparison, estimated that 150 million users of Facebook and its subsidiary, Instagram, had been exposed to 80,000 posts that came from the Russian influence campaign.Twitter said it had discovered more than 2,700 accounts that were linked to Russias Internet Research Agency, a company tied to the Kremlin, between September 2016 and November 2016.Those accounts posted roughly 131,000 tweets over that period.Twitter identified an additional 36,000 automated accounts that had posted 1.4 million election-related tweets linked to Russia over that same period.The tweets received about 288 million views.Now youre seeing all the attention from Congress go to Facebook and Twitter, because theyre the linchpin of the Russian information operations, said Ms. DiResta, the security researcher.In his testimony on Capitol Hill, Mr. Walker, Googles general counsel, sought to draw a bright line separating his companys services from social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter, which has been an occasional subject of Google acquisition rumors.Advertisement Continue reading the main story He also played down what Google knows about its users, a surprising conceit for a company that makes more money than anybody from selling advertising based on the online interests of users.Were somewhat differently positioned because were not primarily a social network, Mr. Walker said in response to a question regarding whether Google should notify users who are exposed to propaganda or divisive content from a foreign government.Many users are not logged in when they access content, so its difficult to know who sees what.Still, social media remains a compelling proposition for internet companies, even Google, because it keeps people coming back and creates a place for them to spend their time, said Jan Dawson, an analyst at the technology data firm Jackdaw Research.Take the example of Facebook.Despite having been assailed for weeks about the role it played in the 2016 election, Facebook reported another blockbuster financial quarter on Wednesday, shattering analysts expectations with more than $4.7 billion in profit in the third quarter.That was a 79 percent increase from the same period one year ago.If you gave Google the choice of having a social network, even with everything thats happened, said Mr. Dawson.I think it would still like to have one.
The iPhone X Is Cool. That Doesn’t Mean You Are Ready for It.:::::And although the face scanner for unlocking the device is impressive and creepily accurate, in many situations, it didnt work as quickly as a fingerprint scanner.It also failed to unlock the phone when I wore a pair of Persol sunglasses.The iPhone X feels ahead of its time, perfect for a target audience of technology enthusiasts and obsessive photographers.Everyone else may want to wait awhile to buy.An iPhone X overview First, the basics: The iPhone X has a 5.8-inch screen that is larger than the 5.5-inch display on the iPhone 8 Plus and the 4.7-inch screen on the iPhone 8.Yet the iPhone Xs overall body is smaller than that of the iPhone 8 Plus (though a little bit larger than that of the iPhone 8).Apple managed to squeeze a larger screen onto a smaller body by eliminating the iPhones bezel, which is the border surrounding the display.The screen takes up the entire face of the device, with the exception of a notch at the top containing the infrared face scanner.In the process of removing the bezel, Apple also eliminated the home button.As a result, controlling the iPhone X mostly involves using touch gestures.When inside an app or unlocking the phone, swiping up from the bottom brings you to the home screen.Thats simple, but other functions are trickier.To open the app switcher, a popular feature, you swipe up from the bottom and hold your finger for a second.Many times, I lifted my thumb too soon before opening this shortcut.(On past iPhones, you would just press the home button twice to open the app switcher.)Apple has included a shortcut on the phone called Reachability, which lowers the top of the screen to make it easier for one-handed users to reach for buttons or apps on the top row with their thumb.To engage it, swipe downward from the bottom of the screen.Yet it often took me multiple attempts to swipe the sweet spot before successfully opening it.It is much easier to use Reachability with other iPhones: you just tap the home button twice.I struggled with the new iPhone controls when I ran into a bug.One morning, the Amazon app was loaded on the screen then it froze.I tried swiping up to leave the app, then holding two physical side buttons down to shut down the phone, but to no avail.Advertisement Continue reading the main story I fumbled around for at least 10 minutes before I read a guide that revealed that pressing three physical buttons in a sequence would force a restart.These are troubling signs for how less technologically inclined people may respond to the iPhone X.For the last decade, the iPhone has been a computer that anyone can use without reading an instruction manual.With the iPhone X, that is no longer the case.Testing Face ID Apples Face ID, the official name for its face scanner technology, works by spraying an object with infrared dots and stitching the patterns into a detailed 3D image of your face to determine whether you are the owner of the smartphone before unlocking it.Face ID continues to update this map of your face with more information every time you unlock your smartphone whether you are wearing a scarf or a hat or growing facial hair.In addition, Face ID can authorize mobile payments, log in to apps and create animated emojis that mimic your face movements.I put Face ID through dozens of tests and it recognized my face in most situations, including when I wore a beanie, Ray-Ban sunglasses or goggles for my Halloween costume or draped a dog toy over my head.It worked in pitch dark at night and outside on a sunny day.But Face ID worked inconsistently or not at all when I lay the iPhone X flat on a table or my night stand, wore a gas mask for my Halloween costume, walked around in bright sunlight at a park or wore Persol sunglasses.(According to Apple, these particular sunglasses probably blocked the part of the infrared spectrum used by Face ID.)It also didnt work when I tried using the face scanner while slurping a bowl of noodles.Ultimately, it was faster to unlock the iPhone 8 with Touch ID, the fingerprint sensor, than it was to unlock the iPhone X with Face ID in most situations.Unlocking with a fingerprint sensor is one rapid gesture: You hold your fingerprint over the sensor, and the phone unlocks in less than a second.With Face ID, you have to wait for the camera to scan your face, which sometimes takes more than a second;

Apple Report Expects New iPhones to Jump-Start Growth:::::Photo SAN FRANCISCO Ten years after Apple unveiled the iPhone and embarked on an era of supercharged growth, the company lifted investor hopes on Thursday that the iPhone X would be its next blockbuster product.As Apple reported revenue and profit increases that beat Wall Street expectations for its fiscal fourth quarter, the company said it was also seeing strong demand for the iPhone X, as well as for the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus models, which it unveiled in September.Apple said it expected revenue for the holiday quarter, which is typically its most robust, to come in at between $84 billion and $87 billion.That forecast was well above the $78.4 billion that Apple generated during last years holiday quarter, which was an all-time high for quarterly revenue, and reflected confidence that people want new iPhones.Timothy D. Cook, Apples chief executive, said during the earnings call that the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus had been the most popular iPhones every week since they went on sale.And in an interview, Luca Maestri, Apples chief financial officer, said that iPhone X production was going well and that the company could not provide such strong revenue guidance if we didnt have strong iPhone X demand.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The iPhone X, which arrives in stores on Friday, is Apples most expensive iPhone ever, starting at $999.Its new features include a way to unlock the phone using facial recognition technology.The device is the centerpiece of a lineup of new iPhones for the holiday season.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Interested in All Things Tech?The Bits newsletter will keep you updated on the latest from Silicon Valley and the technology industry.Strong demand for the devices could give a shot in the arm to Apple, which could become the first publicly traded company to reach a $1 trillion market value but has faced more questions about its growth in recent quarters.While the iPhone once fueled Apples growth its popularity underpinning other offerings like sales of services and software more people around the world now own smartphones, and iPhone sales growth has flattened.New products, including the Apple Watch, have not been as widely adopted as the iPhone.
Where the STEM Jobs Are (and Where They Aren’t):::::There is a huge divide between the computing technology roles and the traditional sciences, said Andrew Chamberlain, Glassdoors chief economist.At LinkedIn, researchers identified the skills most in demand.The top 10 last year were all computer skills, including expertise in cloud computing, data mining and statistical analysis, and writing smartphone applications.In a recent analysis, Edward Lazowska, a professor of computer science at the University of Washington, focused on the Bureau of Labor Statistics employment forecasts in STEM categories.In the decade ending in 2024, 73 percent of STEM job growth will be in computer occupations, but only 3 percent will be in the physical sciences and 3 percent in the life sciences.A working grasp of the principles of science and math should be essential knowledge for all Americans, said Michael S. Teitelbaum, an expert on science education and policy.But he believes that STEM advocates, often executives and lobbyists for technology companies, do a disservice when they raise the alarm that America is facing a worrying shortfall of STEM workers, based on shortages in a relative handful of fast-growing fields like data analytics, artificial intelligence, cloud computing and computer security.When it gets generalized to all of STEM, its misleading, said Mr. Teitelbaum, a senior research associate in the Labor and Worklife Program at Harvard Law School.Were misleading a lot of young people.Unemployment rates for STEM majors may be low, but not all of those with undergraduate degrees end up in their field of study only 13 percent in life sciences and 17 percent in physical sciences, according to a 2013 National Science Foundation survey.Computer science is the only STEM field where more than half of graduates are employed in their field.If physicists and biologists want to enjoy the boom times in the digital economy, a few specialist start-ups will train them and find them jobs as data scientists and artificial intelligence programmers.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Insight Data Science Fellows Program, which has offices in New York, Boston, Seattle and Palo Alto, Calif., began its first training program five years ago and now has 900 alumni working at companies like Facebook, LinkedIn, Airbnb, Amazon and Microsoft.Jake Klamka, a physicist who founded the program, kept hearing from Silicon Valley executives that they had considered hiring traditional scientists, but converting them to technologists seemed time-consuming and risky.So Mr. Klamka decided he would start a company to provide scientists a smoother pathway into the tech industry.Carlos Faham made that passage.He had an impressive academic career, with a string of grant awards and fellowships.His Ph.D. from Brown University was in dark-matter physics.After Brown, he was a postdoctoral fellow at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.Dr. Faham loved the research, but after nearly two years he was feeling the strain of that life.By then, he had spent 12 years in college, graduate school and postgraduate research.His next step would be to compete for a handful of tenure-track teaching openings across the country.For the pricey Bay Area, he wasnt making enough.A postdoc researcher typically makes $40,000 to $60,000 a year.Dr. Faham had done serious programming for his physics research.He applied to tech companies, figuring they would be eager to hire someone with his intellectual firepower.He couldnt get an in-person interview.He was told his background was too academic.He fumbled a couple of phone screening interviews because the statistical and machine-learning problems were unfamiliar to him.It was like hitting a wall running at full speed, really humbling, he recalled.Dr. Faham joined the seven-week Insight Data Science Fellows program in 2015.There was no formal course work.Other than a few tutorials by industry people, the time was spent creating a product his was software for recognizing and tracking faces in video and training for interviews.That involved solving a programming problem on a white board and explaining his thinking.Interviewing is a muscle and you have to exercise it again and again, he said.After the program, he received six job offers.He accepted the offer from LinkedIn.(Insight is free for participants; hiring companies pay an undisclosed fee.)Today, Dr. Faham, 33, is a senior data scientist, working on a team that uses machine learning and statistical models to detect illicit activity on the social network, including fake job listings, ad fraud, spam and bot attacks.The range of data-intensive detective work, he said, is extremely rich and it moves so much faster than my previous world.He makes a pretty good six-figure salary, about five times what he did as a postdoctoral researcher.About 90 percent of those who enter the Insight program have landed jobs as data analysts, the company says, with a dropout rate of about 3 percent.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Anasuya Das made a similar career move, but not one as far from her academic training.After the program, Dr. Das, whose Ph.D. is in neuroscience, joined the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York, where she is now a senior data scientist.She works on a team that creates software tools for the centers doctors, nurses and researchers.One current project is a program to recommend the most promising clinical trials for individual cancer patients, based on their medical histories, age, gender and genetics.Data science is distinctly different from neuroscience, Dr. Das said, but some of the tools she employs, like a machine-learning technique called artificial neural networks, do take their inspiration from the brain.Her experience points to the larger trend that digital technologies like data science and artificial intelligence are increasingly being used in nearly every discipline.So technology and the other STEM fields merge.That is the thinking behind a new division of data sciences at the University of California, Berkeley, that started in July.The division is a response to student demand and advancing technology.Berkeleys Foundations of Data Science course attracted 1,200 students from more than 50 majors in the last academic year.The choice of the term division rather than institute, explained David Culler, the interim dean for data sciences, underlines its approach.We want this to be something foundational across the university, innovating with other disciplines, not differentiating from them, he said.This is the academic world mirroring what is happening in the larger economy.
Farhad and Mike’s Week in Tech: Facebook Under Fire in Washington:::::The ads are wild.The Russians primary political goal seems to have been to create discord in American society; they took just about every side of every issue, promoting protests over religion, politics and other issues.Beyond the ads, though, did we learn anything new from the hearings?Mike: First, let me say attending House and Senate hearings is surreal.Members of Congress love to have aides blow up tweets and Facebook posts 1,000 percent, plaster them on big pieces of poster board, and then use them as visual aids in the hearing.I spent an hour looking at an advertisement of Satan fighting Jesus in a hearing this week.Anyway, my takeaway: The whole ordeal was mostly orchestrated pageantry a way for lawmakers to give tech execs a very public, rather embarrassing dressing down with a few new facts and insights scattered throughout.For one, all three companies said the reach of Russia-backed ads stretched much further than they had originally known.Facebook estimated some 150 million people were served the ads across Facebook and Instagram.Thats a lot!But more than that, I found it fruitful that some members of Congress seemed to recognize the more pervasive issue of so-called organic content.That is, the posts that you and I and anyone else can create and post to Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.Those are much more difficult to track, and we still dont know the extent to which Russia-linked organic content spread across all of these platforms.Farhad: I do wonder where this leads.The tech execs were all contrite and vowed to police themselves better.I noticed that even in Facebooks earnings statement on Wednesday in which the company boasted record profits, suggesting that the scandal hasnt hurt its bottom line Mark Zuckerberg downplayed the business and instead focused on the political climate: Protecting our community is more important than maximizing our profits, he said.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Interested in All Things Tech?The Bits newsletter will keep you updated on the latest from Silicon Valley and the technology industry.I wonder if this contrition will be enough to head off any strong regulation.I suspect it will.Mike: Probably.And note that in the hearings this week, none of the tech companies said they would back the Honest Ads Act, the bill senators are proposing that could impose stricter regulations on digital advertising.So well see how far the bill goes after this week.The iPhone X Is Here, and Tech Writers Are Mad Farhad: Mike, how excited are you for the new iPhone?Did you stay up late to order one?Mike: The only things I stay up late for are Radiohead concert ticket sales and New Years Eve.So, my answer is no.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Farhad: I didnt either, so mine is likely to ship in a months time long after the first ones hit the shelves this weekend.Its a strange feeling to be so left out.In previous years, Apple has given tech journalists a week to look over its latest iPhone.But it completely changed the plan with the coveted X, causing a lot of heartache for us whiny writers.Apple gave some outlets including TechCrunch, Buzzfeed and Backchannel, which is part of Wired a week with the device.But many others, including The Times, were given just a day with the new phones.Meanwhile, Apple also offered review devices to several YouTube stars and some out-of-left-field choices, like the political journalist Mike Allen.Mike: Dont tell the others, but Mike Allens review was my favorite.He gave the phone to his nephew, who is more tech savvy than him, and relayed what the kid loved about it.Im totally asking a cousin to write my next Facebook story.Farhad: Ordinarily the question of who gets to review the iPhone would be too inside baseball for us.But as Jake Swearingen at New York points out, Apples shifting review policies are a good way to document how much the media business has changed since the original iPhone came out in 2007.That year, Apple provided early review units to big print outlets the Times, The Wall Street Journal, USA Today and Newsweek.In 2017, Apple has the pick of any outlet it wants; it knows that a review will get a lot of traffic on virtually any site, so it doesnt really matter whether it chooses an established media brand or some YouTuber with a fan base.Mike: I loved Jakes piece!Aside from chuckling at the angry posts from reviewers who felt slighted, it was a clear insight into how Apple believes people buy things these days, and how the older model of going to a select few reviewers perhaps isnt the only way to drive purchasing decisions.Frankly, I agree!I dont really read traditional consumer reviews anymore, and I suspect the crowd for deep tech and gadgety reviews is growing smaller over time.Farhad: I guess we should talk about the actual substance of these reviews.They were mostly positive.After two days of using it, our colleague Brian X. Chen found that the phone was incredibly fast and took exceptional photos, and that the face-detection unlock system mostly worked very well.But like several other reviewers, Brian said the X is not a must for most people.Youll probably get by just fine with a cheaper phone.Mike: Im not going to buy one because my phone is only a year old.Also, I think if I try to unlock a device with my face Ill break the entire phone.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Farhad: O.K., have fun in D.C.

Sina, an Internet Pioneer in China, Wards Off U.S. Activist:::::More than three-quarters of investors voted to keep Yichen Zhang, a board member who was seeking re-election, Sina said in a statement.Charles Chao, Sinas chairman and chief executive, said he was grateful for shareholders support, input and participation and pleased that shareholders recognize the transformative growth and the unique value of the company.Still, Robert H. Lynch Jr., a partner at Aristeia, said shareholders have sent a strong message to the company that change is needed and that the status quo is unsustainable and unacceptable.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.The proxy fight came to an end on Friday afternoon, after a group of about 20 shareholders and company executives gathered in a conference room on the 42nd floor of a high-rise in Hong Kong.During the 25-minute meeting, a representative for Aristeia was given the opportunity to make a statement, according to two people who were present but who asked not to be named because they were not authorized to speak publicly.Sina which controls Weibo, one of Chinas biggest social media platforms seemed an unlikely target for an activist campaign.It has seen its share price soar over the past year as investors piled into technology stocks hoping to get a piece of Chinas internet growth.But the New York-traded internet company found itself in the cross hairs of Aristeia earlier this year when the shareholder accused Sina of failing to hold itself to the standards expected of U.S.-listed public company boards.Aristeia pushed Sina to consider a sale or merger of Sina or Weibo.Sinas operations include online entertainment and news.But its most valuable asset is a 46 percent controlling stake in Weibo, which is listed separately.The separate listing helped to trigger the proxy fight.Even as Sinas shares jumped by nearly three-quarters this year, Weibos shares have more than doubled.Weibo is now more than twice as valuable as Sina.The campaign was seen as a rare test of the power that American shareholders have in Chinese companies that are listed in the United States.It also touched a nerve for some investors who have complained about fewer shareholder rights in Chinese companies that are incorporated in business-friendly countries like the Cayman Islands.These investors have expressed frustration that some companies appear to be managed for the sole benefit of top executives.The bottom line is that Sinas poor corporate governance, lack of substantive engagement with its shareholders and substantial valuation discount need to be addressed, Mr. Lynch said, adding that Aristeia would continue to pursue all avenues to further the goals of maximizing shareholder value and enhancing corporate governance.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Responding to this criticism, Mr. Chao said on Friday, We will continue engaging constructively with our shareholders toward our common goal of long-term value creation.
India’s Top Payments App Adds Chatting, Challenging WhatsApp:::::Paytm was founded in 2010 as a simple app for paying mobile phone bills.It has grown exponentially since Prime Minister Narendra Modi shocked India last November with an edict declaring all large bank notes invalid.That so-called demonetization forced Indians to exchange their cash for new bank notes, a tortuous process that prompted many people to look for digital alternatives to pay bills and buy daily necessities.With nearly $2 billion in financing from Alibaba, Chinas leading e-commerce company, and SoftBank, the Japanese investment giant, Paytm jumped in.It marketed itself to small merchants and consumers as an easy way to make all sorts of payments with a few taps on a smartphone.The company now offers a wide range of products, from gold by the gram to airline and movie tickets, and it said 100 million Indians visited its service at least once a month.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Interested in All Things Tech?The Bits newsletter will keep you updated on the latest from Silicon Valley and the technology industry.WhatsApp, which claims more than 200 million monthly active users in India and 1.3 billion worldwide, has eyed business services and person-to-person payments as a potential way to generate revenue from what has been a free service.Facebook paid $22 billion in cash and stock for WhatsApp in 2014.The messaging service has already begun experimenting with verified business accounts in India, which companies use to communicate with customers.The payments feature will let Indian users send immediate payments to one another via a chat message.Neeraj Arora, head of business at WhatsApp, said in an October interview that his team was studying opportunities created by Indias demonetization and the governments broader campaign to push more business and services online.They are trying to digitize every part of society, said Mr. Arora, who also sits on the board of Paytm.We play right in the middle of it.Its natural for us to think about improving the experience.WhatsApps overall popularity could give its new payments service a leg up, but Mr. Abbot said it would also raise awareness for all digital payment services, including Paytm.Advertisement Continue reading the main story WhatsApp, like another new service from Google, Tez, will probably be limited to transferring funds from one persons bank account to anothers because of complex Indian banking regulations.Paytm has cast itself as a broader financial player, handling payments made by credit and debit cards, the governments electronic transfer system, and digital wallets.A Paytm banking affiliate is exploring how to offer loans too small to interest a normal bank, with creditworthiness assessed by examining a borrowers transactions on the service.And a Paytm digital mall is selling physical products.Messaging is just Paytms latest brand extension.Mr. Abbot said other plans for the chat service included a personalized news feed of special offers based on each users history in the app.Eventually it might become the main screen for Paytm, he said.Paytm is at heart a payments company.
When the iPhone Disturbs You About Driving:::::Q.Ever since I upgraded the software, my iPhone freaks out whenever Im in a cab because it thinks Im driving.Im tired of tapping the Im not driving button how do I tell the phone I dont drive?A.The recent iOS 11 software update includes a new safety component of the Do Not Disturb feature for silencing notifications one that blocks most calls and alerts to the phone while you are driving.If enabled, the new safeguards kick in automatically when the iPhone makes a Bluetooth connection to the cars dashboard or its motion sensors pick up movement and acceleration similar to that of riding in an automobile.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story How Do You Use Tech?Advice and tips on the technology changing how you live.The iPhone can also mistake the forward motion of a train or a bus for riding in a car.And as you have discovered, taxi passengers may also notice their phones are temporarily disabled unless the Do Not Disturb control is switched off.If you never drive yourself and want the iPhone to stop pestering you when you are taking mass transit, tap open the Settings icon and choose Do Not Disturb from the main Settings screen.Scroll down the bottom of the screen until you get to Do Not Disturb While Driving.Tap the Activate button to switch the setting from Automatically to Manually.Photo For those who do drive and want to use the feature, you can change the auto-reply message the phone sends to people who text you while you are on the road.Theres also the option to choose the specific people (or groups) in your Contacts list who get an automatic message from you while you are focused on driving.If you prefer to use the Do Not Disturb feature in manual mode, you can add a shortcut icon to the iPhones Control Center.Open the Settings app, select Control Center and then Customize Controls.Tap the Plus (+) button next to Do Not Disturb While Driving icon to add it to the Control Center screen, where you can quickly tap the setting on or off.
Alibaba’s Earnings Jump as China’s Online Shopping Boom Continues:::::Still, the results released Thursday show that Alibaba still has ground to cover as it seeks to grow beyond e-commerce into more of a data and technology company.Apart from online shopping, its other businesses lost money.Bigger and Bigger Alibabas core business continues to be a money-spinner.That business generated nearly $3.6 billion in income during the quarter, about 50 percent more than a year ago.The company says nearly half a billion people now shop on its platforms annually.Photo Despite worries about a debt binge that could choke economic growth, Chinas new consumer class is expanding.That suggests the countrys online-shopping market, already the worlds largest, has room to grow yet.McKinsey estimates that the countrys middle class will expand to 315 million households by 2030, from 116 million households last year.In 2000, China had only two million middle-class households.Future Bets Alibaba has ranged far afield of e-commerce in recent years.It owns a movie studio, a soccer club and a Hong Kong newspaper, plus stakes in a variety of tech start-ups.The company is also spending $15 billion over the next several years on research in artificial intelligence and other cutting-edge fields.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.In the near term, though, investors are more interested in Alibabas recently announced investment of the same amount in logistics.Alibaba has long depended on outside companies to deliver packages.But Jack Ma, the companys founder and executive chairman, has said his goal is to ship anywhere in China within 24 hours, and anywhere in the world within 72.That will require a lot of spending.Offline to Online Alibaba has found ways to make more money from its shopping platforms.For instance, better targeting of ads at customers has helped generate more interest and sales from advertisers.Still, the company also wants to capture more of the 85 percent of retail sales in China that take place offline.Alibaba has been buying stakes in grocers and other brick-and-mortar stores since well before Amazons acquisition of Whole Foods this year.It has even opened its own grocery stores where purchases are made via smartphone app.These locations serve as hubs for delivering food to nearby homes, while also catering to shoppers who like to pick out fresh items, such as seafood, in person.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Alibaba says it is not interested in building a large grocery chain, however.The company says it wants to showcase the ways traditional retailers can incorporate online tools into their business with the hope that those retailers will then do so using tools and services provided by Alibaba.Going Global Mr. Ma has circled the planet and hobnobbed with world leaders in his effort to take the Alibaba brand global.The company has paid billions of dollars to take control of Lazada, an e-commerce company in Southeast Asia.And Mr. Ma pledged this year that Alibaba would create a million jobs in the United States by linking small American businesses with Chinese shoppers, who tend to view American-made goods as higher quality.But those efforts are not close to eclipsing Alibabas main businesses in China.In the latest quarter, Alibabas e-commerce business earned about 90 percent of its revenue at home.
Waymo Enlists AutoNation to Maintain Driverless Test Fleet:::::Photo Waymo, one of the leading forces in self-driving technology, is enlisting the largest auto retailer in the United States, AutoNation, to maintain and repair the growing number of driverless vehicles Waymo is testing around the country.No financial terms were disclosed.But the partnership suggests Waymo a unit of Googles parent, Alphabet is moving a step closer to putting driverless vehicles into ride-hailing fleets that would serve the general public, not just its own employees and others selected by the company to test them.AutoNation will help assure that Waymo vehicles are always in top condition as we bring fully self-driving cars to the public, John Krafcik, Waymos chief executive, said in a statement.Mr. Krafcik recently hinted that Waymo was further along in commercializing its self-driving technology than previously indicated.Were really close, he told reporters at a demonstration of Waymos driverless vehicles at Castle, its test center on a former Air Force base in Northern California.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Maintaining expensive and technology-packed self-driving vehicles is a main challenge for using them in moneymaking businesses, like ride-hailing fleets, said Michael J.

These Are the Ads Russia Bought on Facebook in 2016:::::Advertisement These Are the Ads Russia Bought on Facebook in 2016 They made for a wildly varied slide show, designed by Russia to exploit divisions in American society and to tip the 2016 presidential election in favor of Donald J. Trump and against Hillary Clinton.The House Intelligence Committee provided on Wednesday the biggest public platform to date for a sample of the Facebook ads and pages that were linked by a trail of ruble payments to a Russian company with Kremlin ties.America, we have a problem, said Representative Jackie Speier, a California Democrat who sits on the House committee.We basically have the brightest minds of our tech community here and Russia was able to weaponize your platforms to divide us, to dupe us and to discredit democracy.Among the ads the committee made public at Wednesdays hearing were a Bernie Sanders superhero promoting gay rights ...Image Credit ... and a shot of Mr. Trump giving a thumbs up and promoting rallies in Florida.Image Credit An image of Jesus arm-wrestling Satan (who, the ad said, was backing Mrs. Clinton) ...Image Credit ... and an endorsement of the Black Panthers as fighters against the Ku Klux Klan.Image Credit There was a Confederate flag and a call for the South to rise again ...Image Credit ... and a yellow No Invaders Allowed sign posted at the United States border.Image Credit Attacking Candidates While many descriptions of Russias stealth influence campaign have stressed the focus on issues rather than candidates, many of the Facebook posts did both, often attacking Mrs. Clinton (sometimes via Mr. Sanders): Image Credit Image Credit Image Credit But at least one ad attacked Mr. Trump: Image Credit On the Left and Right And although some of the Facebook pages fell on the liberal or multicultural side of the political divide, with names like Woke Blacks ...Image Credit ... most leaned strongly to the right, including Back the Badge...Image Credit ... and Stop All Invaders.Image Credit From Both Sides In some cases, the Russian groups took opposite stands on painful issues, such as police shootings of black people.A page called Dont Shoot took aim at police brutality...Image Credit ... while Being Patriotic suggested that Black Lives Matter activists were killing police officers.Image Credit Only a Sampling While the ads being made public by Congress were just a sampling of the large Russian influence operation, independent researchers in recent weeks have identified and made public a far greater volume of such pages.Facebook, Twitter and other platforms have shut down the suspect accounts, but it is still possible to retrieve many of the posts and images because they were widely shared across the internet.Perhaps the biggest collection, put together by two American researchers who asked not to be identified to avoid online harassment, is posted at a page on Medium .The researchers based their searches largely on the pages and accounts named in a Russian media account based on interviews with former employees of the Russian company with Kremlin ties, the Internet Research Agency, accused of much of the fakery.
Facebook, Under Fire in Russia Inquiry, Posts 79% Rise in Profit:::::In a statement, Mr. Zuckerberg added, Protecting our community is more important than maximizing our profits, noting that the amount of money Facebook is spending on security will affect the companys bottom line.Mr. Zuckerberg appears to have little to worry about with Facebooks profit.The revelations of Russian interference on the tech platforms has turned sentiment against the companies, but their businesses remain robust.Last week, Googles parent company, Alphabet, reported strong financials on the back of search advertising sales.Twitter, which has grappled with stagnating growth, also posted better-than-expected earnings last week.On Wednesday, Facebook said its online ads business rose by 49 percent to $10.1 billion for the quarter.Much of that success continues to hinge on its ability to make money from people using smartphones; some 88 percent of Facebooks advertising revenue is derived from mobile devices.The performance was bolstered by Facebooks push into video advertising, which the company has prioritized for the past two years.Advertisers are generally charged more for video ads than static ads because of the engaging nature of the content.Mr. Zuckerberg said video would remain a top priority for the companys revenue growth over the next three years.David Wehner, Facebooks chief financial officer, also earmarked video as an area for heavy investment in 2018.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Interested in All Things Tech?The Bits newsletter will keep you updated on the latest from Silicon Valley and the technology industry.That spending will go into Facebooks nascent efforts of funding new original shows for streaming, specifically on the social network.Money will also go toward making video products more social, said Mr. Zuckerberg, as a way to strengthen the bonds between the people who regularly use Facebook.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Another reason for the successful quarter: user growth.Already home to more than two billion people who regularly use the social network every month, Facebooks number of users grew another 16 percent to 2.07 billion people.Some 1.37 billion people use the site on a daily basis.To make sure that growth stays on track, Facebook plans to spend even more.The company said it employs more than 23,000 full-time workers, up 47 percent from the same period a year ago.Facebook reported more than $1.76 billion in capital expenditures.More hiring is in the works.During this weeks hearings, Facebook executives said they planned to hire 10,000 more workers to increase safety and review content across the platform, doubling to 20,000 reviewers.Facebook and other companies typically use less expensive third-party companies, not full-time in-house employees, to review content.Facebook also said it would keep investing in its still-fledgling virtual and augmented reality businesses.The company also made clear that even as it has faced grilling from lawmakers over what has been posted and shared on its site by Russian actors, it will not go overboard by stifling free expression on the social network.We believe that ads are important to free expression, Ms. Sandberg said during the earnings call.But we will also do our part to elevate the quality of those ads.
Tesla’s Elon Musk Reassures Investors Over Model 3 Delays:::::The company attributed its slow pace so far to difficulties in producing battery packs at its Nevada plant, called the Gigafactory.It also said that welding processes and final assembly tasks in the Fremont factory were moving more slowly than other parts of the manufacturing system.We are adding robots at the choke points and making the lines go really fast, Mr. Musk told analysts during a webcast on Wednesday.Speed is the ultimate weapon.Getting to market with the Model 3, which will carry a base price of about $35,000, has been a humbling experience so far.Tesla built just 260 Model 3 sedans in its most recent quarter considerably short of its target of 1,500.And the sluggish pace has coincided with a rash of job cuts and allegations of lax safety standards on the assembly line from its workers.While Wall Street analysts and media coverage have focused on the shortfall in Model 3 production, Mr. Musk concentrated Wednesday on the fact that Tesla expected to deliver record numbers of its higher-priced Model S sedans and Model X sport-utility vehicles in the last three months of the year.But the company also reported wider losses than expected for the quarter that ended Sept. 30.Revenue from auto sales increased 8 percent to $2.08 billion, compared with the same period a year ago, but the company lost $619.4 million, versus posting a profit of $21.9 million in the third quarter of 2016.Tesla shares were off nearly 5 percent in extended trading after the earnings report and the production update, falling below $306, more than 20 percent lower than their midyear peak.Advertisement Continue reading the main story And even as the company is making plans for a factory in China and possibly more plants in the United States, some analysts are questioning Teslas overall competence in the intricate processes of mass vehicle production.One analyst, Clement Thibault of Investing.com, said Wednesday that Teslas vertically integrated manufacturing system which includes building many of its own major components, like batteries and seats is out of step with tried-and-true industry practices.Theres a reason traditional car companies have an established decentralized business model, Mr. Thibault said.Tesla believes it can centralize the process, but lacks any real world evidence to back up its claim.Since it began production in late summer, Tesla has sold the new Model 3 only to its employees, rather than begin filling the hundreds of thousands of orders from buyers who have put down $1,000 deposits.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.While Mr. Musk has said the employee-only sales strategy was meant to reward Teslas work force, analysts have surmised that it was also a way to discover and correct quality problems before the vehicle is made available to the public.The bottom line, however, is that Tesla has yet to prove that it can meet the huge demand it has created for the new Model 3, and that it is capable of joining the big leagues of auto manufacturing.Further delays will most likely benefit competitors such as General Motors and Nissan, which offer electric vehicles in the Model 3s price range.And new electrified models are in the works from automakers like Volkswagen, Daimler and Toyota.At this point in the game, all eyes are on the Model 3, said Akshay Anand, an analyst with the auto-research firm Kelley Blue Book.Tesla needs to ensure its production volume is achieved.But perhaps more importantly, Tesla needs to ensure the vehicle is being produced in a quality manner.Tesla is experiencing a number of labor-related issues as it works to increase its annual production output to 500,000 vehicles a year from about 100,000.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Last month, the company fired hundreds of workers for what it described as subpar performance.Mr. Musk said on the webcast that the company was looking to hire new employees with skills better suited to its production goals.But some workers have said that they were dismissed because they supported a union organizing drive conducted with the help of the powerful United Automobile Workers, which represents hourly employees at the three big Detroit automakers.One worker, Daniel Grant, said he had supported the union effort because of unsafe conditions in the Tesla factory and he believed he had been fired for it.Management pushed us hard, and it created very real risks for us working on the line, Mr. Grant said in an email.Thats why I wore a union T-shirt, and thats why I handed out fliers.The U.A.W.has joined workers to file complaints against Tesla with the National Labor Relations Board, accusing the company of harassing and dismissing employees for their organizing activities.I dont believe I was fired for performance, said Mr. Grant, who said he had been injured on the job and fired a few days later.Workers have said that Teslas production systems can cause injuries linked to repetitive stress.Other employees say that they were not properly trained to handle some hazardous chemicals, and have experienced burns, rashes and eye injuries.Tesla has said that the dismissals were based only on performance reviews and that it would never act against employees based on their union views.It will not discuss individual cases.While Tesla acknowledges that the plants injury rate has exceeded industry averages in the past, it says on-the-job injuries have been steadily declining.
Encountering Robots While Still Using Fax Machines in Japan:::::Earthquake apps like QuakeFeed are also helpful in quake-prone Japan, not to mention as early indicators of nuclear tests in North

which artificial intelligence outstrips humans.I encountered an android tourist greeter at a mall, and television news programs frequently feature some new application of robotic technology, from restaurant servers to nursing home caregivers.For personal texting, Line, a communications app that started after the 2011 earthquake and tsunami, is extremely popular.So I communicate with friends, my staff and even the woman who cuts my hair using Line.Part of the reason it's so popular here is its wide variety of emoticons and digital stickers.How do you use tech differently in Japan than you did in the United States?The weird thing about Japan is that although it seems technologically advanced, it is still behind the times in many ways.As The Times has written before, the fax machine is

sent or received a fax in the United States.Photo My 11-year-old son has a small keitai, or kids cellphone, that is programmed so he can only call or receive calls from me, my husband or his sister.By the time we left Brooklyn in 2016, it seemed like most kids his age either didn't have a phone at all, or had a smartphone.A lot of Japanese children, as young as age 6, have such keitais, which enable them to independently travel on subways and walk to and from school on their own while still being reachable.We often run into very small children on their own on the subway platform, the small phones dangling from their backpacks.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mobile payment systems have been slow to gain traction in America.How about in Japan?Unlike China, where people pay

as Suica, that is mostly used to pay for train fares but can also be used to pay for items from vending machines or convenience stores as well as taxi rides.Mobile payments via Suica have been

important to Japan.Meanwhile, personal digital assistants like Siri and Google Assistant are trendy in the United States.Where do you think this is all taking us?Unlike in the United States, where workers fear automation taking over their jobs, robotics are embraced here in Japan by the government, corporate sector and broader society.The government is anti-immigration, so one of its oft-cited solutions to a declining population and shrinking labor force is to rely increasingly on artificial intelligence.Whether robots can actually accomplish all the tasks they are being promoted for is an open question.I wonder whether something as personal as nursing home care can really be outsourced to robots.As a parent, I would hate the thought that robots would be used in day care facilities,

Russia-Financed Ad Linked Clinton and Satan:::::Im disappointed that youre here, and not your C.E.O.s, said Senator Angus King, independent of Maine.Lawmakers also complained that the companies had taken months to acknowledge Russias interference on their sites.I have more than a little bit of frustration that many of us on this committee have been raising this issue since the beginning of this year, and our claims were, frankly, blown off by the leadership of your companies, said Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee.Facebooks chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, and chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, spent Wednesday at the companys headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif., talking to investors and analysts as they reported blockbuster quarterly earnings.The stocks of both Google and Facebook, which faced the most criticism in the hearings, are at record highs.Video During the earnings call, Mr. Zuckerberg was unequivocal in his stance on the issue of Russian meddling in the election.Ive expressed how upset I am that the Russians used our tools to sow mistrust, Mr. Zuckerberg said, noting that Facebooks profits will probably be affected by the amount of money the company will spend fighting abuse of its platform.Facebook said it plans to double the number of content reviewers it employs, to 20,000, and will try to add a greater degree of transparency into its advertising system.What they did is wrong, and were not going to stand for it, Mr. Zuckerberg said.The tech companies also provided new numbers on the reach of Russias influence campaign.Facebook said an estimated 150 million users of its main site and its subsidiary, Instagram, were exposed to the posts, a larger figure than it provided even as recently as Monday.Advertisement Continue reading the main story During the last of the three hearings, members of the House Intelligence Committee spoke in front of posters displaying the content, complaining that it was divisive.Representative Andr Carson, Democrat of Indiana, said an account called Being Patriotic, which amassed 200,000 followers, pushed out content that cynically exploits grieving officers and their loved ones in order to pit Americans concerned about our law enforcement personnel against Americans concerned about African-American lives lost during police encounters.The account was created by the Kremlin-backed Internet Research Agency.My concern is that a dictator like Vladimir Putin abused flaws in our social media platforms to inject the worst kind of identity politics into the voting decisions of at least 100 million Americans, Mr. Carson said, referring to the Russian president.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Facebook has found a particularly vocal set of critics on the Congressional Black Caucus, of which Mr. Carson is a member along with Representative Terri A. Sewell, Democrat of Alabama.Together, they pressed Facebook to grapple with its role in promoting racial animus.Ms. Sewell cited figures showing few blacks in Facebooks work force and its leadership a lack of diversity that she said made it hard to believe that those reviewing socially divisive ads could spot problematic posts.The hearings exposed a growing rift between Silicon Valley and Washington, where sentiment toward big tech companies has drastically shifted.While the lawyers showed humility and promised to beef up security and improve technology to prevent foreign interference in elections, they admitted they could not guarantee they would prevent future intrusions.Googles general counsel, Kent Walker, said the company would work on creating new technologies to detect foreign actors and misinformation on its site.All three said they would build artificial intelligence tools to combat fake and problematic content.Photo Some lawmakers used the hearings to stake a position on the influence of the Kremlins social media use in the election.The conclusions, particularly among senators, split along political lines.Republicans offered an implicit defense of the legitimacy of President Trumps victory and dismissed the effect of Russian meddling.A lot of folks, including many in the media, have tried to reduce this entire conversation down to one premise: Foreign actors conducted a surgically executed covert operation to help elect a United States president, said Senator Richard M. Burr, Republican of North Carolina and the chairman of the Intelligence Committee.Im here to tell you this story does not simplify that easily.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, emphasized that the real intent of Russian propaganda was to broadly spread misinformation and create chaos.These operations while were talking about the 2016 presidential race theyre not limited to 2016, and they were not limited to the presidential race, and they continue to this day, he said.They are much more widespread than one election.Such comments offered a rare view into the Senate committees investigation, which has largely played out over the past nine months in secured briefing rooms.Publicly and in private, Mr. Burr and Mr. Warner have taken pains to preserve bipartisan comity, and their success has set the committee apart from the other panels investigating Russias efforts.But the difference in their emphasis on Wednesday also underscored the political realities buffeting their work.In advancing an investigation tied to Mr. Trump, Mr. Burr has been careful to make clear that the committees work is larger than an individual candidate, and he has repeatedly tried to tamp down expectations about what it might find.Democrats did not have such reticence.Whether the Russians and the campaign coordinated these efforts, we do not yet know, but it is true that the Russians mounted what could be described as an independent expenditure campaign on Mr. Trumps behalf, said Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee.Senator Martin Heinrich, Democrat of New Mexico, also took aim at Mr. Trumps dismissal of the role of Russia-linked social media in his win.Mr. Heinrich challenged Colin Stretch, Facebooks general counsel, to acknowledge such content and the role that fake accounts linked to Russia and other misinformation had in the election.Last month, President Trump called Russian-purchased Facebook ads a hoax, Mr. Heinrich said.Ive looked at those Russian-sponsored Facebook ads.I certainly hope youve had a chance to review them.Are they, in fact, a hoax?Mr.Stretch said no.The existence of those ads were on Facebook, he said, and it was not a hoax.
A Stylus That Works for Tablet and Wallet:::::Q.What is the difference between a $100 tablet stylus compared with a $10 model?A.Those pricier styluses are often designed to work with a specific tablet line as is the case of the Apple Pencil, the Google Pixelbook Pen and the Microsoft Surface Pen and can include customized features for those devices.For example, Googles Pixelbook Pen integrates with the Google Assistant software and will search the web for words or images you circle on the Pixelbook screen.Photo If you are just looking for a stylus to take handwritten notes or do some basic drawing, the less expensive models are probably fine.The $10 Adonit Mark, the $20 Hand Stylus and the thick-barreled $25 Studio Neat Cosmonaut are all general purpose models that work on most capacitive touch screen devices.Unlike the more expensive stylus models, which sometimes require their own battery power or Bluetooth pairing with a designated tablet, most economy models do not need to be powered and work right out of the package.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story How Do You Use Tech?Advice and tips on the technology changing how you live.For those with artistic inclinations or who want a stylus that was designed to work smoothly with certain tablet hardware and software, the more expensive models have perks.Most include a wider degree of tilt and pressure sensitivity, which lets you vary the weight and shading of the lines drawn on the tablet screen, much like a pen on paper.The higher-end tablet pens are often more responsive, with less lag time between when you put the tip to the glass and when you see your handwriting or sketches appear.Forking over a hundred dollars for a digital writing stick may be too much of an extravagance for many people.In the middle ground, you can also find accessories that offer more features than the basic models but cost less than a high-end stylus.The $40 Sensu Artist Brush & Stylus includes two artists tools (including a digital paintbrush) in one device that works with most touch screens, while the $75 Adonit Pixel promises smooth response, pressure sensitivity and shortcut buttons, all while working on a wider variety of iOS devices than the Apple Pencil.

Sony’s Fortunes Improve, From Rising Profit to a Return for Aibo:::::It remains a bit player in smartphones, the product that made Apples fortune, but sustained demand for the devices has enriched Sony regardless.It is a major supplier of image-sensing circuits used in smartphone cameras, including the iPhones, which means it has shared, to some degree, in its competitors success.Sony has also closed or sold off costly factories.It still sells televisions under its brand name, but like Apple its focus now is on design and marketing rather than production, which is increasingly left to contractors.Other businesses, like the PlayStation video gaming line and an insurance company that Sony part-owns in Japan, have been steadily profitable.Its entertainment arm is more financially volatile, but it has lately profited from hits like Spider-Man: Homecoming.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.All of that added up to what Atul Goyal, an analyst at the securities firm Jefferies, called blowout results for Sonys latest quarter.The company said on Tuesday that it had earned an operating profit before taxes and other reductions of 204 billion yen, or about $1.79 billion, in the three months through September.That was more than four times what it made in the same period last year.Sony also upgraded its profit forecast for the full financial year, which ends in March, from 500 billion to 630 billion, which would be an all-time high.Investors piled into Sonys shares on Wednesday in response.The stock closed up 11 percent at 4,918, the highest level since the start of the global financial crisis in 2008.Japanese share prices have been buoyant across the board lately, and the countrys benchmark Nikkei 225 index has reached multidecade highs while Wall Street and other markets have also surged.Still, Sony was Japans most sought-after stock on Wednesday.Lovers of the Aibo might be tempted to see karma at work.Sony first introduced the dog in 1999, saying it hoped robotic animal companions would become as ubiquitous as the real thing.That never happened, and Sony stopped making the Aibo in 2006.The mechanical dogs small but devoted fan base was crushed.Sony hopes that the world is now ready for artificially intelligent consumer robots, and that it can be a leader in the technology.The new Aibo uses Sonys image sensors to interact with the world, and the company says it will be capable of learning, to a limited degree for instance by repeating behaviors that owners praise.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The dog goes on sale in Japan in January for 198,000, or about $1,750.Combining robotics and A.I.is a way for Sony to play on its strengths, Sonys chief executive, Kazuo Hirai, who has driven the companys restructuring since taking over in 2012.We have multiple projects in development, and one of them is Aibo.
House Intelligence Committee Releases Incendiary Russian Social Media Ads:::::Schiff: Change your algorithms to downplay outrage.Representative Adam Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the House intelligence committee, got to the heart of the Facebook and Twitters dilemma: its business models are built on generating viral content.Part of what made the Russia social media campaign successful is that they understood algorithms you use that tend to accentuate content that is either fear-based or anger-based, said Mr. Schiff, who then asked the companies what their societal obligation is to change those dynamics.The companies pushed back on the idea that their algorithms only reward viral content, which would make the sites vulnerable to the most outrageous posts.Yes we do have an obligation to prevent foreign interference in the election.We take that obligation seriously, Mr.Stretch of Facebook said.With respect to the algorithm, our goal is to provide the most relevant information.Its primarily driven by friends and family.Thats the core of Facebook.Senators train their fire on Facebook.Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, who has largely spearheaded the effort prodding Facebook into handing over data, immediately went after the social media giant in his questioning.In a seven-minute exchange, most of Mr. Warners time was spent dressing down Mr.Stretch for what he characterized as a lack of responsiveness from Facebook as his office repeatedly asked for more data on the extent to which Russian meddling influenced the election.Advertisement Continue reading the main story I have more than a little bit of frustration that many of us on this committee have been raising this issue since the beginning of this year, and our claims were frankly blown off by the leadership of your companies, Mr. Warner said.Mr. Warner hammered his point with blown-up prints of some of the Facebook posts that circulated.One featured an illustration of Hillary Clinton in a fistfight with a picture of Jesus, an inflammatory ad aimed at riling up conservative Americans.Several senators trained their attacks on Facebook on Wednesday for its inadvertent role in the Russian influence campaign, a repeat of Tuesdays Senate Judiciary subcommittee hearing.I must say, I dont think you get it, said Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, who was also at Tuesdays hearing.I went home last night disappointed.I asked specific questions, I got vague answers.Facebook defends its reasons for taking down ads.As senators pressed Facebooks general counsel on Facebooks role in the election, one of the hallmarks of Facebooks explanation has been the issue of authentic accounts.Since Facebook went public with its findings, the companys reasoning for taking down more than 80,000 fake, Russian-linked ads, was not the type of content they posted, but because those responsible for them had misrepresented who they were when creating the accounts.That distinction is key for Facebook.Outside of some parameters like nudity or incitement to violence, executives at the company are wary of becoming the arbiters of what content is or is not allowed on Facebook, fearing accusations of censorship.We dont take for granted that each one of you uses Facebook to connect with your constituents, and that the people you represent expect authentic experiences when they come to our platform to share, Mr.Stretch said in his opening remarks on Tuesday.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Burr asked if Facebook would have shut down the 470 Russian-linked accounts if they werent fake.Does it trouble you it took this committee to look at the authentic nature of the users and the content?Mr. Burr asked Facebooks general counsel.Mr.Stretch didnt directly answer.The authenticity issue is the key, Mr.Stretch said, noting that many of those accounts would have been shut down anyway because they violated other terms of service.Photo But ads were only one way Russia influenced the election.Political ads are just part of the problem, Mr. Warner said at Wednesdays first hearing.Russian agents spread nonpaid content through the creation of pages on Facebook dedicated to hot-button issues like race.On Twitter, the Kremlin-connected internet Research Agency used automatic messaging tools known as bots that could quickly spread tweets through multiple accounts.For Facebook, much of the attention has been focused on the paid ads Russian trolls targeted to Americans.However, these ads are just the tip of a very large iceberg, Mr. Warner said.The real story is the amount of misinformation and divisive content that was pushed for free on Russian-backed pages, which then spread widely on the news feeds of tens of millions of Americans.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Twitter is still lowballing Russian intrusion.Earlier this week, Twitter, Facebook and Google revealed new information and numbers showing that foreign interference on their site was worse than they first reported.But the companies all stressed that the amount of Russian propaganda that reached users was just a sliver of the total amount of content their platforms produce every day.But some lawmakers think the companies are holding back information.Twitter said it identified 2,752 accounts controlled by Russian operatives and more than 36,000 bots that tweeted 1.4 million times during the election.The company had previously told lawmakers it found only 201 accounts linked to Russia.The new numbers still seem low, according to Mr. Warner.Im concerned that Twitter seems to be vastly underestimating the number of fake accounts and bots pushing disinformation.Independent researchers have estimated that up to 15 percent of Twitter accounts or potentially 48 million accounts are fake or automated, Mr. Warner said in his opening statement.Photo Mr. Burr also noted the slow reaction by internet companies.With Facebooks acknowledgment that 126 million people were exposed to Russia-linked content instead of the 10 million people they originally estimated, tells me that your companies are just beginning to come grips with the scale and the depth of the problem, Mr. Burr said.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Your actions need to catch up to your responsibilities, he added.Google defends its stance on RT.For a second straight day, Ms. Feinstein asked Google why it continues to allow RT to continue to publish videos on YouTube even though a report from the American intelligence community has described RT, formerly known as Russia Today, as the Kremlins principal international propaganda outlet.Kent Walker, Googles general counsel, walked a fine line, saying that RTs influence goes beyond merely YouTube; he noted that RT is available on cable and satellite television packages.It advertises in newspapers and can be found on hotel television channels.Google has reviewed RTs content and found that no violations to YouTubes community guidelines, Mr. Walker said.He said that the company provides information about the government-funded nature of RT on Google presumably on search results and said it is considering expanding that to YouTube.He didnt elaborate how Google plans to do so.Photo On Tuesday in a separate hearing, Richard Salgado, Googles director of law enforcement and information security, said Google dropped RT from its top advertising tier because of a drop in viewership not because of its content.Ms. Feinstein said Googles answers were unsatisfactory.She repeated an earlier admonition of the tech companies: Were in a different day now.Daisuke Wakabayashi Are American companies beholden to the American government?Despite being located in the San Francisco Bay Area, all of three tech companies position themselves as global platforms.The internet, as Mr.Stretch noted on Tuesday, is borderless.But the distinction presents a number of problems for the companies, particularly on foreign interference in American elections.Are technology companies beholden to protecting the interests of the nations they reside in?Or do they answer to some higher authority?Senator Tom Cotton, Republican of Arkansas, noted that Julian Assange and WikiLeaks continue to use Twitter and other digital outlets to publish document dumps and email leaks, some of which are damaging to Americans.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Is it biased to side with America against our adversaries?Mr. Cotton asked, painting Mr. Assange and WikiLeaks as anti-American.Photo Twitters acting general counsel, Sean Edgett, demurred.We try to be unbiased across the world.Facebook has also faced criticism for allegedly suppressing content at the request of some governments.In Myanmar, whose governments violence against the Rohingya people has been labeled by the United Nations as ethnic cleansing, Facebook is in a bind when it is forced to take sides with either the government or a faction deemed to be outlaws by the state.Recently, Twitter broke ranks with Google and Facebook in its treatment of Russia Today and Sputnik, state-backed media agencies in Russia.Twitter banned RT and Sputnik from advertising on its platform and donated the funds to external research into how Twitter is used for civic engagement and elections.Facebook and the Google-owned YouTube have not taken the same route, citing that RT and Sputnik have not broken their terms of service agreements.But Twitters move puts the company in a difficult position: What if Russia, for example, claims that an American news network is a state-backed propaganda arm in America, and demands that such a network be banned from advertising as well?The executives left a judiciary subcommittee wanting.Top executives for the three companies appeared before a judiciary subcommittee on Tuesday armed with regrets and pledges to do better.The lawmakers appeared to be unimpressed.Facebook came under particularly heavy fire, as senators from both parties pressed the companies on their sluggish responses.Why has it taken Facebook 11 months to come forward and help us understand the scope of this problem, see it clearly for the problem it is, and begin to work in a responsible way to address it?Senator Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware, asked in one pointed exchange.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The senators also raised doubts that efforts outlined by the companies Facebook, for instance, said that it would hire more than 1,000 people to review political ad purchases would protect the United States from outside influence.Im trying to get us down from La-La Land here, said Senator John Kennedy, Republican of Louisiana.The truth of the matter is, you have five million advertisers that change every month.Every minute.Probably every second.You dont have the ability to know who every one of those advertisers is, do you?Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota, pushed the executives to weigh in on legislation that would require the companies to report who funds political ads online.In response, they suggested voluntary efforts already underway but said they hoped to work with lawmakers on such requirements.The House committee will release copies of the Russian ads.The House intelligence committee is expected on Wednesday to publicly release much-anticipated copies of Facebook ads purchased by Russian-linked accounts.The top Republican and Democrat leading the investigation, Representatives Mike Conaway of Texas and Adam Schiff of California, pledged to do so this month after a meeting with Sheryl Sandberg, Facebooks chief operating officer.A few of the ads have leaked out, and others have been described by people who have viewed them, but the release should help cast new light on the Russian efforts.Facebooks bullish posture to Wall Street.Wednesday will be a particularly busy day for Facebook, which will also report its third-quarter earnings at 4 p.m. Eastern, around the middle of the days second hearing.The company, which is used by more than 2 billion people worldwide, is expected to post stellar results, with revenues from advertising jumping 41 percent from the same quarter last year to $9.88 billion.Advertisement Continue reading the main story With its stock trading at a record high and the companys market capitalization over $500 billion more than the gross domestic product of countries like Columbia and Taiwan Facebooks business success clashes with the posture it will present to lawmakers.To members of Congress, Facebook will be contrite and stress the challenges of fixing its technology to prevent abuse of its site by foreign governments.But to investors, the message this afternoon will be decidedly bullish.That contradiction is at the heart of the problem Facebook is confronting.Its business model, all based on advertising, is largely automated and reward the most viral content, even at the sake of the public interest.The problem is worse than originally thought.Facebook, Twitter and Google said on Monday, before their testimony, that the problems on the platforms were much worse than initially disclosed, illustrating the breadth and complexity of Russian efforts.According to testimony by the companies, Russian agents spread inflammatory posts that reached 126 million Facebook users, published more than 131,000 messages on Twitter and uploaded more than 1,000 videos to Googles YouTube service.The latest disclosure will most likely serve to underline complaints among lawmakers that the tech giants have been slow to recognize and react to the significance of the Russian campaign.Mr. Warner has been sharply critical of Twitter, in particular, telling reporters in September that the companys initial efforts showed an enormous lack of understanding from the Twitter team of how serious this issue is.On Wednesday, Mr. Warner and others are likely to bore into the details of the companies internal investigations, questioning their rigor, as well remedies the companies have already volunteered.They will also want to hear about solutions to issues beyond the disclosure of paid political advertising, like the influence of bots and organic posts harnessed by foreign powers.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Transparency in advertising alone, however, is not a solution to the deployment of bots that amplify fake or misleading content or to the successful efforts of online trolls to promote divisive messages, Mr. Schiff said recently.
The Upside of Being Ruled by the Five Tech Giants:::::The Five Can Be Governed Tech is inherently messy.The greatest human inventions tend to change society in ways that are more profound than anyone ever guesses, including the people who created them.This has clearly been true for the technologies we use today, and will be even more true for the stuff we will get tomorrow.The internet, mobile phones, social networks and artificial intelligence will make a mess of the status quo and it will be our job, as a society, to decide how to mitigate their downsides.One benefit of having five giant companies in charge of todays tech infrastructure is that they provide a convenient focus for addressing those problems.Consider Russian propaganda.People have worried about the internets capacity to foster echo chambers and conspiracy theories almost since it began; in fact, in several cases over the last two decades from 9/11 to the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth to birtherism the internet did play a key role in the propagation of misinformation.But because those rumors and half-truths spread in a digital media landscape that was not owned and operated by giant companies one in which information was passed along through a Wild West of email, discussion boards and blogs it was never conceivable to limit that eras equivalent of fake news.Today, it suddenly is.Because Facebook, Google and Twitter play such a central role in modern communication, they can be hauled before Congress and either regulated or shamed into addressing the problems unleashed by the technology they control.This does not mean they will succeed in fixing every problem their tech creates and in some cases their fixes may well raise other problems, like questions about their power over freedom of expression.But at least they can try to address the wide variety of externalities posed by tech, which may have been impossible for an internet more fragmented by smaller firms.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Interested in All Things Tech?The Bits newsletter will keep you updated on the latest from Silicon Valley and the technology industry.This is new stuff everybody is dealing with its not easy, said Rob Atkinson, president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a think tank, and co-author of Big Is Beautiful, a coming book that extols the social and economic virtues of big companies.(The foundation is funded, in part, by donations from tech companies.)So when you discover a problem, scale makes that easier.Youve got one or two big firms, and they have a lot of public pressure to be a responsible actor.The Five Hate One Anothers Guts Over the last few weeks, many people at large tech companies have repeatedly responded to my questions about the dangers posed by big tech with a funny argument: Yes, they would say, the other tech giants really are worrisome so why was I including their company in that group?Advertisement Continue reading the main story It was an odd line.As an outsider to these companies, I tend to worry about the collective power of the Five, especially the way they have managed to control the fortunes of innovative start-ups.But none of the Five see themselves as part of a group each of them worries about the threat posed by start-ups and by the other four giants, which means that none feels it has the luxury to slow down in creating the best new stuff.This dynamic where each company competes mightily against the others suggests some reason for optimism, said Michael Lind, who wrote Big Is Beautiful with Mr. Atkinson.As long as their innovation rents are recycled into research and development that leads to new products, then whats to complain about?You can see this in their product road maps.None of the Five has slowed down investing intended to further expand its area of control for instance, Google keeps investing in search, Facebook is still spending heavily to create new social-networking features, and Amazon remains relentless in creating new ways to let people shop.At the same time, they are all locked in intense battles for new markets and technologies.And not only do they keep creating new tech, but they are coming at it in diverse ways with different business models, different philosophies and different sets of ethics.So, why pre-emptively say that maybe well be harmed in the future that in 2030 theyll jack up their prices or something?Mr. Lind asked.Well, deal with that as it comes.The Five Are American Grown The Five achieved their dominance because they operate in areas that provide massive returns to scale.Thanks to economic dynamics like network effects where a product, like Facebook, gets more useful as more people use it it was perhaps inevitable that we would see the rise of a handful of large companies take control of much of the modern tech business.But it wasnt inevitable that these companies would be based in and controlled from the United States.And its not obvious that will remain the case the top tech companies of tomorrow might easily be Chinese, or Indian or Russian or European.But for now, that means we are dealing with companies that feel constrained by American laws and values.Yes, this is jingoistic; the idea of a handful of American tech giants controlling much of society has helped push regulators internationally to try to limit their power.But we would almost certainly do the same if a bunch of foreign companies attempted to take over our economy.At least its our own giants that we have to fear.I dont mean this list to get the Five off the hook.How we deal with their efforts to capture more power over the economy and our society is perhaps the next great question facing America.But this is a complex problem precisely because there are both advantages and disadvantages to their size.Advertisement Continue reading the main story As I said, tech is messy.
Not the Bots We Were Looking For:::::This type of bot bears little resemblance to the ones demonstrated on the stages of tech campus auditoriums.But each sort of bot is made, in its own way, to exploit untapped opportunity in large-scale automation.Where commercial bot-makers see an almost-too-good-to-be-true chance to simultaneously personify their brands and automate their businesses, political bot-makers see an opportunity to exploit anonymity with a humanlike touch at an inhuman scale.While tech companies stand proudly behind their bots, the people who create prolific and ideological social bots hide behind them.(Their provenance remains murky even today.)Photo Anonymous social bots are obviously distinct from carefully designed software programmed in good faith.Technologically speaking, the efforts of Facebook and Google and Amazon represent the forefront of A.I.research, while crudely scripted social bots must merely clear the low bar of passing for an angry stranger.They were, in the memorable words of one researcher, yelling fools, promoting partisan messages and disinformation or merely registering their simulated agreement or anger, appearing maniacally focused, but not conclusively inhuman.A personal-assistant bot interacts with its users, whereas this breed of social-media bot stages performances for audiences and algorithms alike.But the proximity is toxic, and custody of the word is slipping.Bots, it turns out, make an excellent foil.Angela Merkel, in the run-up to this years German federal election, talked about bots, generally, as if they were an invading army.In May, Hillary Clinton pointed to Russia-backed online efforts including the bots as just out of control.The phrase not a bot now litters the profiles of politically engaged Twitter users (and, presumably, some bots).At the same time, President Trump, or a staff member, has indulged a habit of wandering into Twitters uncanny valley to retweet supportive accounts whose humanity is hard to discern, or which eventually and mysteriously just disappear.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Somewhere between the automated yelling fools of online political discourse and commercial techs dream of increasingly sophisticated helpers is a third sort of social bot, which is both foolish and sophisticated in its own way.My longest and most fruitful relationship with a bot like this began through a private chat group I have with a handful of friends.We installed, as a member of the group, a free piece of software called Hubot officially designed as a coding assistant for workplace chat apps, but which we customized mainly for work avoidance.Most often, Hubot performed menial tasks calling up photos or animations, performing various sorts of searches but it soon came to function as a sort of group storytelling sidekick, developing something like a personality.Hubot lurked, responded and interjected, accumulating an intimate set of routinized in-jokes.Eventually, it learned to (obliviously and dutifully) summon fresh pictures of a famous actor in the service of a joke the origins of which, after a few years, none of us could even remember.It was, like all bots, a tool.What made all the difference was that we were the ones using it, and not as is the case with the bots that have inserted themselves into our national discourse and our living rooms the other way around.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.A 2016 essay by the New York-based think tank Data & Society a so-called botifesto identified this playful sort of bot as an evolutionary precursor to the various expressions of bothood today.The essay described how mindfully created bots, not unlike our version of Hubot, had been functioning in the wild, on public social media.Some were jokes and larks, whose very botness is funny, surreal or poetic: bots that used a social-media personalitys corpus to create a (usually funny, always revealing) surrogate account, or bots that automated the dispersal of information in controlled, open and even journalistic ways.But the botifestos intention was to sound an alarm.Less transparent social bots primarily on Twitter and other social platforms posed a risk to media and discourse.Platforms, governments and citizens must step in and consider the purpose and future of bot technology before manipulative anonymity becomes a hallmark of the social bot, the authors cautioned.This warning wasnt just a prediction; it was based in observation.Anonymous bots masquerading as citizen and political actors had been a creeping feature in foreign elections for years.The 2012 election of President Enrique Pea Nieto of Mexico was supported by armies of automated social-media accounts, which flooded Twitter with supportive messages.Peabots became a feature of online Mexican political discourse through at least 2015.But bots hadnt yet run rampant on American tech companies home turf.Manipulation by A.I.was typically seen as something that was happening somewhere else, M.C.Elish, a researcher at Data & Society who contributed to the report, told me.We only notice something when its arrived on our doorstep.This arrival is likely to result in action.Twitter, for example, insists that it has been working hard on the problem.One of the most frequently proposed solutions to the problem of manipulative anonymity among researchers in the field is some form of bot disclosure a requirement, enforced by social platforms, that an account operated by third-party software disclose that fact.(Wikipedia, for example, already does this.)Bot disclosure could plausibly stem the tide of bots intended to exert crude influence or to harass people.Humans would, in theory, be able to interact with bots electively, and to better judge some sources of information or expressions of sentiment.A grand sorting could begin to restore order, but Twitters discourse nightmare didnt start with bots and wont end with them.Social automation is both disruptive and revealing.Twitter in particular dehumanizes users in the process of giving them access to one another, so of course bots could thrive there and of course theyd closely resemble our worst-tweeting selves.Voice-and-text-activated assistants help monopolistic companies further consolidate power, and they complicate the stories we tell ourselves about privacy, as we invite the eyes and ears of the worlds most ambitious tech businesses into our most personal spaces.Alexa reminds us what Amazon wants; Twitter bots show us how online mass communication breaks down.What was truly great about Hubot, the cobbled-together, inscrutable, mostly useless chat automaton, was the suggestion it made, through each absurd routine: that online, its necessary that we build spaces for ourselves.
Google Docs Glitch That Locked Out Users Underscores Privacy Concerns:::::Some of these people sought answers, and notified others, on Twitter.Obviously this is raising questions in a lot of peoples minds about the level of surveillance in internet tools, like cloud-based tools, Rachael Bale, whose tweets gained traction, said on Tuesday.Ms. Bale, a reporter for National Geographics Wildlife Watch, said that while what happened was problematic, she was not too taken aback.We know Google has access to all kinds of information about us, she said, adding that professionally, she avoids using Google Docs for anything sensitive.A Google spokesman said in a statement that a code push caused a small percentage of Google Docs to be incorrectly flagged as abusive, which caused them to be automatically blocked.A fix is in place and all users should have full access to their docs, the statement said.Protecting users from viruses, malware and other abusive content is central to user safety.We apologize for the disruption and will put processes in place to prevent this from happening again.Mr. Gardner said the complexity of the technology and its widespread use carried considerable risks.A small tweak to the rules on what to flag or not can produce false positives like we saw today, he said.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.Its clear that Google wants to be able to exert conditions on what content can be shared, he added.It needs to automate that via machines due to scale.And it shows that mistakes in what to reject can be made, with highly impactful consequences.Googles automated systems periodically scan certain file types in Google Drive that are shared with other users to detect abuse and protect users, a Google spokesman said on Tuesday.Some examples include antivirus scanning, malware and phishing detection.Google Docs is part of the Google Drive suite.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Leighton Pritchard, a computational biologist who also tweeted about the error he experienced, said that even though what happened on Tuesday was a glitch, it did shed light on how many users do not take the time to read terms of service agreements.The default state is we ignore them, he said.We click yes because we want to use the thing thats useful to us.Lots of things can slip by us that way.I asked them directly if this was a result of an automated sweep for content, Mr. Pritchard said of Google.They said they couldnt say at the moment and would update us on the Google Groups page.One user on the Google Groups page, a help forum for those affected, said: I hope Google realises the seriousness of this issue.If they want this thing to function as a professional tool that people can trust, and not a toy, this has to stop right now.Someone else posted a message from the Google Docs support team that read: It appears our automated scan flagged your Google Form as potentially suspicious due to the types of information it requests from others.Generally, using a Google Form to collect confidential information such as IDs, passwords, bank account numbers, and passport numbers violates our Terms of Service.The user said the message made no sense.We did none of these things.While Googles privacy policy does not explicitly say that it scans files in Google Docs, it does say that it collects information from Gmail messages, G+ profile, photos, videos, browsing history, map searches, docs, or other Google-hosted content.Our automated systems analyze this information as it is sent and received and when it is stored, the policy states.Mr. Gardner emphasized the importance of being mindful that your cloud activities are most likely being assessed, and that the process is far from perfected.We should all be keenly aware that any and all content we create, handle or amend inside of these cloud services is being evaluated and scrubbed, and its not being done by people, its by machines, he said.And neither the machines nor their programmers are infallible.Whats more, this is still an immature set of technologies, so teething pain is to be expected.
Samsung Unveils New Management to Quell Leadership Crisis:::::Photo HONG KONG Samsung Electronics, the South Korean tech giant, announced a new slate of executives on Tuesday in an effort to bring stability to its top ranks.The company, a global name in smartphones and microchips, has been suffering from a leadership vacuum.The crown prince of its controlling family was sent to prison this year on bribery charges.The familys patriarch has been in a coma since 2014.Three weeks ago, a senior executive responsible for one of its most successful businesses abruptly resigned.The troubles at Samsungs management have not diminished its status as an innovative and highly profitable powerhouse in the technology world.That point was underscored on Tuesday, when the company reported a record-high profit for the second quarter in a row.But the newly appointed executives, who have been drawn from Samsungs deep ranks of professional managers, could help ensure the company can run while the fate of the powerful family that built the Samsung empire remains under a cloud.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The three executives appointed on Tuesday to run Samsungs major business units are Kim Kinam, who will lead its lucrative components business; H.S.Kim, its new consumer-electronics chief; and D. J. Koh, who will lead the mobile-device division.The three men are expected to serve as co-chief executives once they are elevated to the companys board, a decision that requires shareholder approval.
How to Fix Facebook? We Asked 9 Experts:::::The single most important step Facebook and its subsidiary Instagram, which I view as equally important in terms of countering misinformation, hate speech and propaganda can take is to abandon the focus on emotional signaling-as-engagement.This is a tough proposition, of course, as billions of users have been trained to do exactly this: react.What if there were a trust emoji?Or respect-based emojis?If a palette of six emoji-faced angry-love-sad-haha emotional buttons continues to be the way we engage with one another and how we respond to the news then its going to be an uphill battle.Negative emotion, click bait and viral outrage are how the platform is being used to divide.Given this problem, Facebook needs to help us unite by building new sharing tools based on trust and respect.Kevin Kelly Photo Co-founder of Wired magazine.Facebook should reduce anonymity by requiring real verification of real names for real people, with the aim of having 100 percent of individuals verified.Companies would need additional levels of verification, and should have a label and scrutiny different from those of people.(Whistle-blowers and dissidents might need to use a different platform.)Facebook could also offer an optional filter that would keep any post (or share) of an unverified account from showing up.Id use that filter.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Ro Khanna Photo Democrat representing Californias 17th Congressional District, which includes sections of Silicon Valley.Ultimately, whether from tech companies or Congress, what people want is more transparency.Facebook should expand on its Hard Questions blog to explain how its news feed algorithms work, how it uses data in targeting and how it makes decisions about third-party verification and removing offensive content.It should make it simple for users to provide feedback and be responsive to their concerns.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Interested in All Things Tech?The Bits newsletter will keep you updated on the latest from Silicon Valley and the technology industry.The company also should make its executives readily available to the press, and they should spend time on Capitol Hill to explain their decision-making.Everyone understands that new technology platforms are not perfect, and that bad actors find ways to abuse them.The key is for Facebook to be upfront about technical challenges, open about its mistakes and willing to answer the tough questions honestly.If it does that, it will continue to earn the publics trust.Eli Pariser Photo Chief executive of Upworthy and author of The Filter Bubble.Facebook should open itself up for independent research.Right now, Facebook is a black box: Its very difficult, and in many cases impossible, for researchers to independently look at behavior on the platform.While opening private data to research creates risks, theres a ton of explicitly public data on the platform that Facebook makes difficult to query at scale.Facebook could also open up many of the tools advertisers currently use for free use by research scientists.It would be a bold move for transparency, and one that would help us understand much better whats happening on the worlds most important social platform.And itd be wise to do this before regulators forced them to.The company should also optimize for time well spent.Facebooks greatest superpower is figuring out how to eat as much of our attention as possible.But as Tristan Harris and others have pointed out, that attention often doesnt yield much leaving us poorly informed and feeling worse about ourselves.Instead of measuring clicks and likes, what if Facebook optimized for how much value an article or video or game gave us weeks or months afterward?The company could survey the kinds of content weve spent the most time on, and ask us which gave us the most and least value, as a way to balance our impulsive present selves with our greater aspirations.Kate Losse Photo Early Facebook employee who recounted her time at the company in her book, The Boy Kings: A Journey Into the Heart of the Social Network.It would be interesting if Facebook offered a vintage Facebook setting that users could toggle to, without News Feed ads and like buttons.(Before likes, users wrote comments, which made interactions more unique and memorable.)Advertisement Continue reading the main story A vintage Facebook setting not only would be less cluttered, it would refocus the experience of using Facebook on the people using it, and their intentions for communication and interaction.Somehow, no matter how smart the Facebook algorithms and behind-the-scenes data processing get, the site felt more engaging as a tool for human communication when interaction was primarily driven by what users wanted to do and say, rather than where the algorithms want people to look.Alice Marwick Photo Assistant professor of communication at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.Facebook should allow users to sort their news feed chronologically by default on all platforms, rather than rely on an algorithmically sorted News Feed.This would increase the diversity of items in the News Feed, and would make it more likely that users were exposed to people and information that didnt support their own confirmation bias.It should also greatly increase the human oversight of ad targeting systems specifically, oversee algorithmically generated categories (rather than basing them solely on user-inputted interests).Political and interest-based advertising should be under much stricter scrutiny than, say, the advertising of T-shirts or hair products.Ellen Pao Photo Chief diversity and inclusion officer at the Kapor Center for Social Impact and a former chief executive of Reddit.Facebook needs to replace its focus on engagement quantity with interaction quality.To really do that means replacing at least half of the leadership team and board with underrepresented people of color who are informed and value diversity and inclusion and, as my colleague Freada Kapor Klein suggested, have

something that would aid the public, and board members must also take that public benefit into account when making decisions.Mark Zuckerberg has said that Facebooks goals are bringing us closer together and building a global community.Worthy, beautiful goals, but easier said than done when Facebook is also stuck delivering ever-increasing profits and making its platform serve the needs of advertisers.What if Facebook were actually free to do what it says it wants to?What if it didnt need to devote so much energy to the evil sides of the business, whether catering to filter bubbles, addicting and manipulating users, seizing data, bending over backward for advertisers and destroying competitors?As a nonprofit or public benefit corporation (like Kickstarter), Facebook could be a much better institution.It could shed its two masters dilemma, truly pursue its lofty goals and become a firm of which its users and the world could actually be proud.
In Self-Driving Race, Waymo Sets Its Own Terms:::::ATWATER, Calif. A self-driving car is not a self-driving car is not a self-driving car.That is the message Waymo, the autonomous vehicle division of Alphabet, Googles parent company, tried to send on Monday, when it invited a group of reporters to visit Castle, a facility in Californias Central Valley that it has been using as a training course for its self-driving vehicles.Castle, which is built on a decommissioned Air Force base roughly 120 miles from San Francisco, resembles a miniature city, with many of the realistic elements a self-driving car might encounter on the road like cul-de-sacs, traffic signals and a smattering of potholes.Waymo has been putting its test vehicles through their paces here since 2013, and conducting some 20,000 tests of different road situations.And on Monday, the company was offering rides in its latest prototype, a Chrysler Pacifica minivan outfitted with a cluster of sensors and cameras.But first, John Krafcik, Waymos chief executive, wanted to give a vocabulary lesson.Lets talk about self-driving, he said.Theres a lot of confusion about what the terminology means.He rattled off a list of terms that have been used to describe vehicles with varying levels of self-driving ability: autonomous, driverless, semiautonomous, fully self-driving, partially autonomous, semi-driverless.Its really a bit of a problem, isnt it?he said.If Mr. Krafcik seems annoyed, its because the self-driving hype cycle is running at full volume these days, with companies from Uber to General Motors to Tesla noisily promoting their progress toward autonomous vehicles.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Its hard to know where this all ends.Will the winner be the company that develops a vehicle capable of driving along a preprogrammed route, in ideal weather conditions, in certain cities?Or will it be the vehicle that can drive itself anywhere, rain or snow?Is it enough to build a vehicle that drives itself most of the time, or is a truly driverless car one in which the passenger can safely take a nap?Does it count if a company produces just a handful of expensive prototype vehicles, rather than something that can be mass-produced and sold by the tens of thousands?Photo Waymo has set a narrow target.It is aiming for Level 4 autonomy, an official classification for a vehicle that is capable of driving itself, with no human behind the wheel, in most environments and road conditions.It believes that nothing short of Level 4 counts as autonomous, and that bypassing Level 3 (a lower classification, in which some human attention is still required) is necessary to keep people safe on the roads.Humans, the company says, can easily lose concentration while driving with Level 3 autonomy, even though they often need to take over at a moments notice.
Russian Influence Reached 126 Million Through Facebook Alone:::::The Russia-linked posts were an insidious attempt to drive people apart, Colin Stretch, the general counsel for Facebook who will appear at the hearings, said in his prepared remarks.He called the posts deeply disturbing, and noted they focused on race, religion, gun rights, and gay and transgender issues.Facebook, Mr.Stretch said, was determined to prevent it from happening again.The new information also illuminated when Facebook knew there had been Russian interference on its platform.Several times before the election last Nov. 8, Facebook said its security team discovered threats targeted at employees of the major American political parties from a group called APT28, an agency that United States law enforcement officials have previously linked to Russian military intelligence operations.Facebook cautioned that the Russia-linked posts represented a minuscule amount of content compared with the billions of posts that flow through users News Feeds everyday.Between 2015 and 2017, people in the United States saw more than 11 trillion posts from Pages on Facebook.Twitter, in its prepared remarks, said it had discovered more than 2,700 accounts on its service that were linked to the Internet Research Agency between September 2016 and November 2016.Those accounts, which Twitter has suspended, posted roughly 131,000 tweets over that period.Outside of the activity of the Internet Research Agency, Twitter identified more than 36,000 automated accounts that posted 1.4 million election-related tweets linked to Russia over that three-month period.The tweets received approximately 288 million views, according to the companys remarks.Twitter noted that the 1.4 million Russia-linked election tweets represented less than three-quarters of one percent of all election-related tweets during that period.Google, in its prepared statement, said it had also found evidence that the Internet Research Agency bought ads on its services and created YouTube channels to upload short videos about divisive social issues including law enforcement, race relations or Syria.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Google said it had found 18 channels that were likely associated with the Russian agents that posted political videos to YouTube.All told, those accounts now suspended uploaded more than 1,100 videos totaling 43 hours of content from 2015 through the summer of 2017.Google said, in general, those videos had very low view counts that added up to 309,000 views between the middle of 2015 and late 2016.Only three percent of the videos had more than 5,000 views and there was no evidence that the accounts had targeted American viewers, the company said.Photo The internet search giant also confirmed earlier reports that the Internet Research Agency had purchased search and display ads from it.Google said the group had bought $4,700 in ads but none of them had targeted users by their political leanings, which was a targeting tool that Google added before the election.Google had been investigating a separate $53,000 in ad purchases with political material from Russian internet or building addresses, but discovered that those were not related to the Kremlin.While we found only limited activity on our services, we will continue to work to prevent all of it, because no amount of interference is acceptable, wrote Richard Salgado, Googles director of law enforcement and information security, and Kent Walker, Googles general counsel.The two men were scheduled to testify at separate congressional committees on Tuesday and Wednesday.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.For Facebook, Google and Twitter, the discovery of Russian influence by way of their sites has been a rude awakening.The companies had long positioned themselves as spreading information and connecting people for positive ends.Now the companies must grapple with how Russian agents used their technologies exactly as they were meant to be used but for malevolent purposes.That has led to thorny debates inside the companies.For Facebook, the problem is less straightforward than finding Russia-linked pages and taking down content.Executives worry about how stifling speech from non-American entities could set a precedent on the social network and how it could potentially be used against other groups in the future.So Facebook has focused on the issue of authenticity or the fact that the Russian agencies did not identify themselves as such as a reason for taking down the accounts.Many of these ads did not violate our content policies, Elliot Schrage, vice president of policy and communications at Facebook, said in a company blog post earlier this month.That means that for most of them, if they had been run by authentic individuals, anywhere, they could have remained on the platform.Earlier this month, Senators Amy Klobuchar and Mark Warner introduced a bipartisan bill to require internet companies to identify those who paid for political ads on the tech companies platforms.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Facebook has been promoting its strengthened advertising disclosure policies as an attempt to pre-empt the bipartisan bill.Last week, Facebook began rolling out new features that provide insight into who is paying for ads, and it will maintain a publicly viewable database of ads purchased on the network.The company is also stepping up its counterintelligence and security measures.Facebook has said it is working with Twitter, Google and other companies to spot sophisticated threats earlier, and will continue to coordinate with law enforcement when appropriate.The company said it shuttered 5.8 million fake accounts in October 2016, and removed 30,000 accounts attempting to influence the French elections this year.Google also said it plans to increase its transparency for political ads.The company is working to issue an annual report about who is buying political ads and how much they are spending.The company also said it planned to create a publicly accessible database into what election ads ran on Googles AdWords for example, web search ads and YouTube.Google said it will identify the advertisers paying for political ads within a link accessible from the ad.But Google said it did not intend to take any further action against state-backed Russian news channel RT, which has built a massive online audience through YouTube.The American intelligence community has described RT as the Kremlins principal international propaganda outlet, but Google said the organization had not violated any of its policies or misused the service.Last week, by contrast, Twitter said it would ban RT and Sputnik, another Kremlin-backed news organization, from advertising on its service.
As Apple and Facebook Chiefs Visit, Xi Jinping Vows Deeper Reform:::::Photo SHANGHAI Just days after being likened to a king by President Trump, President Xi Jinping of China on Monday reiterated his commitment to reform while holding court before a group of wealthy and influential business leaders from his country and the United States.Mr. Xi, speaking at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing during an event shown on national television, addressed topics such as globalization, innovation and Chinas relationship with the United States at a gathering of executives who included Tim Cook, the chief executive of Apple; Stephen Schwarzman, the chief executive of the Blackstone Group; and Mark Zuckerberg, Facebooks chief executive.The reception was one of Mr. Xis first public appearances with foreign visitors since a key Chinese Communist Party congress elevated him to the same exalted status as Mao Zedong, the countrys founding father, and Deng Xiaoping, who led the country from 1978 until 1989.The event just a week before Mr. Trump is scheduled to make his first visit to China was most likely arranged to signal Chinas status as an economic superpower and peer of the United States.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Chinese diplomats have used past business summits to promote their countrys economic clout and influence with American companies before testier meetings with United States leaders and diplomats.On a 2015 trip to the United States, for example, Mr. Xi stopped in Seattle to visit American technology executives before going to Washington to meet with President Barack Obama.
Power Up Your Phone by Hand or by Sun:::::Q.As recent storms and power outages have shown, we are now deeply reliant on cellphones for communication, especially since many people have gotten rid of their landlines.If theres no electricity, what options do you have for charging a phone battery?A.Backup batteries only last for so long, but hand-cranked chargers and miniature solar panels are two options for restoring a little power to your mobile phone.Adding an alternative charging device to your household emergency kit (along with the flashlights and candles) is one way to stay in contact with others, but keep in mind that for large-scale outages, network cellular service and Wi-Fi routers will most likely be down as well.Several companies make hand-cranked chargers, including Etn and K-TOR.Prices start at about $17 for a simple crank and go up from there.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story How Do You Use Tech?Advice and tips on the technology changing how you live.To use one, connect the phone to the device with its USB charging cable and then turn the crank continuously until you see the phones battery level move up a notch or two.Depending on the devices involved, this can take several minutes of cranking, but you should be able to get enough power to make an emergency call which can be helpful if, say, your house is having power problems of its own and you need to call an electrician.Photo If hand-cranking does not appeal to you, Etn also offers solar-powered solutions and K-TOR has a pedal-powered charger for about $200.Portable solar-powered chargers can supply energy to devices in emergency and nonemergency situations (like camping) without physical effort.Wirecutter, a New York Times company that reviews products, tested 70 solar battery chargers and found the $51 Anker PowerPort Solar Lite to be the best model for juicing up mobile devices.Smartphone cases with built-in solar chargers are another option, even for everyday use.SnowLizard makes cases for current iPhone models and the Portable Solar Shop site sells cases for several Android phones.

Here’s What You Need to Know.:::::Paying for It Apple is selling the iPhone X with two options for storage capacity: 64 gigabytes for $999 and 256 gigabytes for $1,149.There are various ways to pay that hefty price.The simplest route is to pay for the device outright.This is the least confusing option because your wireless bill will contain charges only for your phone plan, and you can do whatever you want with the device like sell it or switch to a different wireless carrier whenever you want.You can also opt to spread out the payments with a monthly installment plan.For example, if you are a Verizon customer, you can choose to pay off the $999 iPhone over 24 months for $41.62 a month.This is a nice option because spreading out the payments does not incur interest fees.Another option is to go for an early upgrade plan, which lets you pay a flat monthly rate and upgrade to a new iPhone annually.Its essentially leasing a new phone every year.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Internetting With Amanda Hess Our critic discusses everything thats wrong, weird and totally sad about the internet in five videos.Sign-up for email notifications.There are various early upgrade plans on the market.With Apples early upgrade program, you can pay $49.91 a month, and once youve made 12 payments, you can trade in your iPhone to upgrade to the next one and continue paying that monthly rate.(Im not a fan of this path because I suggest cherishing your devices for as long as you can before upgrading.)Similarities to the Cheaper iPhone 8 Before you splurge, consider your options.Apples iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus, which share many features of the iPhone X, have starting prices of $699 and $799.The cheaper iPhones have the same computing processor as the iPhone X, so they are just as fast, and their 12-megapixel rear cameras are on a par with the rear camera on the iPhone X.So whats the difference?Mainly, the screen.The iPhone X has a 5.8-inch screen that takes up the entire face of the device, with the exception of a notch at the top containing an infrared camera system.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The iPhone 8 has a 4.7-inch screen, and the iPhone 8 Plus has a 5.5-inch screen.Both of the cheaper iPhones have bezels the border surrounding the display whereas the iPhone X has eliminated the bezel.Other than screen size, the screen technologies differ.The iPhone X is the only Apple phone that uses OLED, a type of display that can be made thinner, lighter and brighter, and with better color accuracy and contrast than its predecessor, LCD.So the screen on the iPhone X looks more vibrant than the iPhone 8 Plus and iPhone 8, which still use LCD.Last but not least, the iPhone X has a unique infrared face scanner.The technology, called Face ID, uses the infrared camera system on the front of the phone to scan the contours and shape of a persons head to unlock the device and authorize mobile payments.The iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus have normal front-facing cameras for snapping selfies.Photo How Face Recognition Replaces the Fingerprint Sensor The primary way you can unlock an iPhone X is with the face scanner.The premium phone lacks Touch ID, the fingerprint sensor that has been a popular feature on iPhones for several years.Face ID is brand new there hasnt been anything like it on a smartphone before.It works by spraying an object with infrared dots to gather information about the depth of an object based on the size and the contortion of the dots.The imaging system can stitch the patterns into a detailed 3-D image of your face to determine if you are the owner of your smartphone before unlocking it.Because the shape of a persons head is unique, the likelihood of bypassing facial recognition with someone elses face is one in a million, according to Apple.Older facial recognition systems worked by using the camera to take a photo of yourself and comparing that with an image that was stored on the device.All a thief would need to do to fool the system was hold a photo of your face in front of the camera which some people already did with Samsungs facial-recognition feature.The false acceptance rate of older face recognition systems was one in 100.It will be interesting to see how early adopters react to Face ID, and whether it will work well with many different kinds of faces.If youre skeptical or turned off by the idea of your phone constantly scanning your face to unlock your phone, you could always get an iPhone 8 or iPhone 8 Plus, which still have Touch ID.
Mark Warner: Tech Millionaire Who Became Tech’s Critic in Congress:::::This week, Mr. Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, will push for new answers.Executives from Facebook, Google and Twitter are set to testify at congressional hearings on Tuesday and Wednesday about the election and the power of their platforms.Lawmakers are increasingly taking a critical tone with Silicon Valley, with Mr. Warner among the harshest.He has already pushed a bill requiring the companies to disclose who paid for digital political ads, the biggest legislative effort so far to regulate the companies.Mr. Warners position is a sharp reversal.Before entering politics, he built a fortune that at one time was estimated at around $200 million as a technology and telecommunications investor and executive.His political identity, first as governor of Virginia and then as a senator, has been wrapped in promises to bring 21st century jobs.He has a broad and close network of tech executives and investors.Photo Mr. Warner is emblematic of the shifting politics for technology.Mark didnt come to this point with the social media companies lightly, said Saxby Chambliss, a retired Republican senator from Georgia who regularly meets with Mr. Warner and the Intelligence Committee chairman, Senator Richard Burr of North Carolina, a Republican, to discuss the Russia investigation.The reluctance of the technology companies to take seriously the investigation into Russian election meddling pushed Mr. Warner over the edge, Mr. Chambliss said.Advertisement Continue reading the main story That is a poor attitude for American companies, Mr. Chambliss added.Mark will make sure this issue is highlighted because it needs to stop.Ahead of the hearings, Twitter and Facebook have scrambled to disarm lawmakers with announcements of voluntary changes to their advertising businesses.Sheryl Sandberg of Facebook, for example, spent a couple days in Washington promising more disclosures.Twitter announced it would disclose who buys political ads on its site, and it blocked two Russia-based media organizations from purchasing advertisements.Twitter is taking an appropriate and welcome step, Representative Adam Schiff of California, the leading Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said last week.The companies say the internal investigations and answering lawmakers questions are a top priority.In their announcements on voluntary ad disclosures, Twitter and Facebook said their stricter policies for who can place political ads and promises to make those purchases public are signs of their commitment to correcting their mistakes.We look forward to answering lawmakers questions, said Joel Kaplan, vice president of global public policy for Facebook, in a statement.We take this issue very seriously and think its important Congress gets the full picture of what happened, including what we know about Russian activity on our platform, and is able to share its assessment with the American public.But lawmakers said the companies, who have been interacting privately for months, still have a long way to go.Last week, congressional aides said the online giants were pushing back against lawmakers.The companies argued against the ad disclosure bill and dragged their feet to participate in a hearing on Tuesday.Lobbyists for Facebook explained how their voluntary efforts on political ad disclosures could work better than regulations.Twitter has not addressed its problems with automated accounts, known as bots, that can quickly spread propaganda or fake news.In addition, not all social media companies have announced that they will tighten rules for buying political ads, one of the most pressing issues.And even if they do, lawmakers should still make more disclosure a legal requirement, said Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat from Minnesota, who is a co-sponsor of the disclosure bill with Mr. Warner and Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.If their policies comply with our bill, they should support our bill and maybe can use their policy as a standard when we pass our bill, Ms. Klobuchar said.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Much of the harshest criticism so far is coming from Democrats like Mr. Warner and Ms. Klobuchar, which could limit the fallout for the tech companies.The Republican chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Mr. Burr, has been more reserved than Mr. Warner, for example.Many Republicans are reluctant to add any regulations to businesses.Some are also afraid of crossing other party members or President Trump, who regularly play down Russian interference in the election.Photo Republicans have slowly begun calling for more scrutiny of the companies.But lawmakers who are more oriented toward free markets have been reluctant to regulate the rapidly evolving industry.Other top regulators, particularly those appointed by Mr. Trump, are also considered unlikely to take strong action against the industry.The top antitrust enforcer at the Justice Department, Makan Delrahim, said in an interview last week that his agency would watch to see whether the size of technology companies hurts competition, but that size alone was not justification for action against them.There are people who think big is just bad, Mr. Delrahim said.He invoked the name of Robert Jackson, the top antitrust enforcer for the agency about 80 years ago, who said he was reluctant to try to break up big companies just for the sake of doing so.That has made it easier for Mr. Warner to assert himself as a leading voice about the power of the tech companies as unexpected as it may be.Mr. Warner accumulated his wealth with an early investment in the cellular service provider Nextel, which was sold to Sprint in 2005 for $35 billion.Mr. Warner then became a start-up investor at Columbia Capital, which had an office in Alexandria, Va.He used his fortune to run for governor of Virginia, talking on the campaign trail about bringing work force training and tech-oriented economic development to rural parts of the state.After serving a term, he was elected to the Senate in 2008.And even with his recent criticism of the industry, he regularly taps a broad network of tech executives and investors for counsel.Advertisement Continue reading the main story During the summer, Steve Case, the founder of AOL, stayed at Mr. Warners vacation home on Marthas Vineyard.For years, the two have met regularly to talk about techology-related policy issues, like how artificial intelligence could alter the future of labor.But during this years trip, they discussed the Senate intelligence committees Russia investigation and the power of social media platforms and their role in the election.His thinking has evolved, Mr. Case said.Even though Im sure this has some benefit with his profile, all things being equal, I think he has approached this with some reluctance because hed rather be focused on issues like the future of work.And Mr. Warner sees no contradiction in his evolution to being considered a sharp prod of Silicon Valley.Look, Im pro-tech.Im pro-innovation, he said, standing and shuffling side to side like a basketball player on defense.On the bookshelf near him was a textbook, Science and Engineering, and a small business self-help book called Grow Regardless: Of Your Businesss Size, Your Industry or the Economy ... and Despite the Government!He went on: What I fear is 2018.If you look at Russian intervention in the American elections, in terms of sowing chaos, they had pretty good R.O.I., he said, pulling from his past life with the business acronym for return on investment.There is too much at stake, he said.
What Virtual Reality Can Teach a Driverless Car:::::There are still questions hanging over this research.Most notably, because these algorithms learn by analyzing more information than any human ever could, it is sometimes difficult to audit their behavior and understand why they make particular decisions.But in the years to come, machine learning will be essential to the continued progress of autonomous vehicles.Todays vehicles are not nearly as autonomous as they may seem.After 10 years of research, development and testing, Googles cars are poised to offer public rides on the streets of Arizona.Waymo, which operates under Googles parent company, is preparing to start a taxi service near Phoenix, according to a recent report, and unlike other services, it will not put a human behind the wheel as a backup.But its cars will still be on a tight leash.For now, if it doesnt carry a backup driver, any autonomous vehicle will probably be limited to a small area with large streets, little precipitation, and relatively few pedestrians.And it will drive at low speeds, often waiting for extended periods before making a left-hand turn or merging into traffic without the help of a stoplight or street sign if it doesnt avoid these situations altogether.At the leading companies, the belief is that these cars can eventually handle more difficult situations with help from continued development and testing, new sensors that can provide a more detailed view of the surrounding world and machine learning.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Internetting With Amanda Hess Our critic discusses everything thats wrong, weird and totally sad about the internet in five videos.Sign-up for email notifications.Waymo and many of its rivals have already embraced deep neural networks, complex algorithms that can learn tasks by analyzing data.By analyzing photos of pedestrians, for example, a neural network can learn to identify a pedestrian.These kinds of algorithms are also helping to identify street signs and lane markers, predict what will happen next on the road, and plan routes forward.The trouble is that this requires enormous amounts of data collected by cameras, radar and other sensors that document real-world objects and situations.And humans must label this data, identifying pedestrians, street signs and the like.Gathering and labeling data describing every conceivable situation is an impossibility.Data on accidents, for instance, is hard to come by.This is where simulations can help.Recently, Waymo unveiled a roadway simulator it calls Carcraft.Today, the company said, this simulator provides a way of testing its cars at a scale that is not possible in the real world.Its cars can spend far more time on virtual roads than the real thing.Presumably, like other companies, Waymo is also exploring ways that its algorithms can actually learn new behavior from this kind of simulator.Photo Mr. Pratt said Toyota is already using images of simulated roadways to train neural networks, and this approach has yielded promising results.In other words, the simulations are similar enough to the physical world to reliably train the systems that operate the cars.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Part of the advantage with a simulator is that researchers have complete control over it.They need not spend time and money labeling images and potentially making mistakes with these labels.You have ground truth, Mr. Pratt explained.You know where every car is.You know where every pedestrian is.You know where every bicycler is.You know the weather.Others are exploring a more complex method called reinforcement learning.This a major area of research inside many of the worlds top artificial intelligence labs, including DeepMind (the London-based lab owned by Google), the Berkeley AI Research Lab, and OpenAI (the San Francisco-based lab founded by Teslas chief executive Elon Musk and others).These labs are building algorithms that allow machines to learn tasks inside virtual worlds through intensive trial and error.DeepMind used this method to build a machine that could play the ancient game Go better than any human.In essence, the machine played thousands upon thousands of Go games against itself, carefully recording which moves proved successful and which didnt.And now, DeepMind and other leading labs are using similar techniques in building machines that can play complex video games like StarCraft.That may seem frivolous.But if machines can navigate these virtual worlds, they can make their way through the physical world.Inside Ubers autonomous car operation, for example, researchers have trained systems to play the popular game Grand Theft Auto, with an eye toward applying these methods, eventually, to real world cars.Training systems in simulations of physical locations is the next step.Bridging the gap between the virtual and the physical is no easy task, Mr. Pratt said.And companies must also ensure that algorithms dont learn unexpected or harmful behavior while learning on their own.That is a big worry among artificial intelligence researchers.For this and other reasons, companies like Toyota and Waymo are not building these cars solely around machine learning.They also hand-coded software in more traditional ways in an effort to guarantee certain behavior.Waymo cars dont learn to stop at stop lights, for example.There is a hard and fast rule that they stop.But the industry is headed toward more machine learning, not less.It provides a better way to train the car to do tasks like identifying lane makers, said Waymos vice president of engineering Dmitri Dolgov.But it becomes even more important, he explained, when a car needs a much deeper understanding of the world around it.Robotics and machine learning go hand in hand, he said.
Virtual Reality Gets Naughty:::::By 2025 pornography will be the third-largest VR sector, according to estimates prepared by Piper Jaffray, an investment and management firm.Only video games and N.F.L.-related content will be larger, it predicted, and the market will be worth $1 billion.Were getting more and more of it every day, said Mark Kernes, a senior editor at AVN Media Network, which covers the industry.We are leading the technology in this area.Sex sells, and where there is money to be made, there will be entrepreneurs who want to adopt it and make money from it, some by offering it for free to increase clicks.Pornography is what rushed along the first printing press, and spurred developments in the internet, online payment systems and other technology.Now its time for virtual reality, Mr. Kernes said: Im pretty sure there is more porn VR out there than regular VR.Headsets Are Just the Beginning Ms.Darling first experienced regular old VR at E3, a conference for the video-game industry.Excited by the pornography possibilities, she found a college student on Reddit who knew the technology but lacked a star.Before long, Ms.Darling started streaming weekly VR segments live from her bedroom in Los Angeles.Photo She was one of the first VR webcam women, according to Mr. Kernes.She then started a company named VRTube.xxx to make the technology, now licensed to Cam4.com, which employs over 40 performers.Though the pornography industry as a whole is challenging to regulate, considering the potential for abuse, disease and exploitation, the virtual kind comes with extra moral and maybe legal issues.For example, can you use someones likeness to have sex with them in virtual reality?Advertisement Continue reading the main story Virtual reality is like the Wild Wild West, said Bryony Cole, the host of Future of Sex, a podcast that explores technology and sexuality.At this years AVN Adult Entertainment Expo, a convention and trade show held each January in Las Vegas, the latest advancements in virtual reality pornography were on display.CamSoda, a website that specializes in live sex videos, had an exhibit featuring pornography stars dressed in plunging bathing suits and waving visitors into the booth.They were showing off OhRama, a small canister that attaches to virtual reality headsets and releases scent during the action.Believe it or not, the scents were created by the girls, said Mr. Kernes, who was there.Its sweet and musty.They know what they like.Photo There are also companies that are adding taste and touch to the experience.Another big player is CamasutraVR, a start-up using 142 cameras that all look at one person, or one body part.They are creating images from that, which they are hoping will be indistinguishable from an actual person, Mr. Kernes said.Im sure those people wished they had been using that VR system at home.Still other virtual reality companies were showing off their partnerships with sex toy companies to create vibrators or penis pumps that link to VR material.As the action ramps up so does the vibrations of the vibrator, he said.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.One of the most buzzed-about inventions has been the sex robot.The first one, Harmony, was introduced in May by a company named Realbotix.In seductive videos posted on YouTube, Harmony shows off her long legs, her firm breasts, her full lips, her lifelike hand gestures, even her intellect.How do you feel about sex?an unknown presenter asks her in one video.Sex is one of the most fascinating things in the world, she responds in a raspy voice.I dont see anything wrong with it.Harmony can connect with virtual reality so the user can interact with her in that space; she can perform all the acts the viewer is watching.Its a little bit of a video game combined with sci-fi, said Matt McMullen, the C.E.O.and creative director of Realbotix.The company has been making dolls for 20 years that were linked to artificial intelligence but not virtual reality.Based on our experiences with thousands of clients, Mr. McMullen said, people do use them for sex, but there is something more that exists.We focus on companionship.Photo Virtual reality has been nicknamed the empathy machine because it allows people to feel like they are truly connected to the action.Its neurological, said Holly Richmond, a somatic psychologist based in Los Angeles and Portland, Ore. You arent just watching and thinking about it.You are feeling it, and its not just your genitals.There is literally a mind-body connection.Advertisement Continue reading the main story When Ms.Darling does live X-rated performances, users can leave comments and chat to one another on the side of the screen.The people who are in virtual reality tell the other people watching me in 2-D to stop being jerks and knock it off, she said.They feel like they know me and are in the bedroom with me.Many sex therapists and educators are interested in the new technology, just as a dentist might be with the latest plaque-detection gizmos.Ms. Richmond worked with BaDoinkVR, a virtual-reality company in Rochester, N.Y., to create Virtual Sexology, a series of free videos that help men and women overcome common sex problems.A recent video, updated in June, takes women into the bedroom where they see how one blond, busty woman arouses herself before sex.She sits in front of her partner massaging her arms, her legs, her breasts.As her breathing heats up, a voice-over says that some women need to be physically touched before feeling any desire for sex.The first video, aimed at men, was the most downloaded video on BaDoinkVR.com in 2016 an impressive feat considering it was competing with noneducational pornography.Ms. Cole, the podcast host, is most excited about how virtual reality can be used in sex education.What if we had young people watch videos where they practice consent or practice identifying at-risk behaviors?she said.Or they can be in a room with someone who said, I contacted herpes and this is my experience.That is way more informative than a gonorrhea slide.Photo Indeed.Barbara Rothbaum, a professor in the department of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Emory University School of Medicine and the director of Emorys Veterans Program, is studying how virtual reality can help treat people suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder caused by military sexual trauma.The program is building scenes that take victims to barracks, tents, private living quarters, latrines, offices or remote buildings and vehicles, where the trauma may have taken place.The idea is that going back to these places virtually will help victims confront their memories so they can move forward with more internal peace.But for virtual reality to work, the scenes have to be so lifelike that users get lost in them and take them for reality.They have to feel like they are participants, not just observers.We can create 3-D bodies in virtual reality and do whatever we want with them, Ms. Cole said.As the technology becomes good enough to make that happen, issues are bound to arise.Mr. McMullen said an issue his company has is clients commissioning dolls that look exactly like people they know in real life, maybe an ex-girlfriend they never got over or someone about whom they fantasize.His company requires written consent from the model for his or her likeness to be used.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Ms. Cole said VR companies are going to have to address this same problem as they get better at customizing avatars to look exactly like what their customers desire.What are the lines between reality and fantasy and what can we do in this space?she said.What does consent mean in virtual reality?Can you do something to your girlfriend in virtual reality that you wouldnt do in real life?If you are using someones likeness in virtual reality, do you require their permission?And what about revenge porn?That will be even harsher in virtual reality.She is worried about the technology assimilating into the culture as easily as dating apps, drawing people away from flesh-and-blood encounters.Certainly partners will also have to negotiate whether virtual-reality sex constitutes cheating.It is, after all, much more lifelike than traditional pornography.But Mr. McMullen said a lot of people accuse his sex robot of doing that, but he believes he is helping alleviate a bad situation, not causing it.There are people who are already lonely, and people who live their lives being alone.They work all day and come home to an empty house, he said.This is just offering an alternative to those types of people.They dont have anyone else.
Amazon Key Is a Lot Less Scary Than My Post-1-Click Remorse:::::So, too, may more information about our choices, according to a 2008 study, The Blissful Ignorance Effect: Pre versus PostAction Effects on Outcome Expectancies Arising From Precise and Vague Information, published in The Journal of Consumer Research.Researchers found that the less knowledge consumers had about something before a purchase, the better they expected it to be and the more they convinced themselves that they liked it afterward.This reduction of cognitive dissonance is easier inside and after leaving a store, which never reveals anything negative about its products and doesnt typically burden the consumer with an onslaught of information that might impede an impulse purchase.But the sprawling internet bazaar is filled with scathing critiques, and every pertinent spec exists somewhere online for the diligent buyer to seek out.That one-star rating is hard to forget when your product is failing in the exact way the unhappy reviewer described.The most obvious difference between brick-and-mortar and online shopping is physicality, both of the item itself and the consumers presence in the store.Beyond the potential pitfall of not getting exactly what you thought you were buying online, a problem that is minimized when you can assess the product in person, the lack of tactile interaction may reduce our connection to the object.Martin Lindstrom, the author of several books on branding, has conducted studies on what makes consumers buy a product and how they feel about it after.In one, 34 percent of people who asked an employee for a product in a supermarket and were made to touch it ended up buying it; just 21 percent did if the employee merely pointed it out to them.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Of the Moment The lifestyle newsletter from the Styles, Travel and Food sections, offering the latest trends to news you can use.In a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study of 20 subjects, when the senses of smell and touch were paired with pictures of a product, the right medial orbitofrontal cortex, a region of the brain involved in the perception of pleasantness, was activated more strongly than when those senses were independently engaged.(On its own, smell was the most important sense.)The tactile experience doesnt end in the checkout line.After purchasing an item, the consumer typically takes it home.This act of carrying it into ones domestic space can bolster ones proprietary pride: You are now responsible for its existence in your world.That act, plus roaming through aisles beforehand and going from shop to shop, can also be physically and mentally tiring.But ordering online for an anonymous deliveryman to leave the item at ones doorstep or, with the help of Amazon Key, just inside is impersonal and not enervating.Its the difference between the estrangement of ordering takeout and the intimacy of cooking for oneself.And a pavement-pounding, shop-till-you-drop marathon may recall an even more primal method for acquiring nutrients.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Youre coming back to hunters and gatherers, Mr. Lindstrom said of in-store purchases.Dopamine kicks in when were buying stuff theres a reptile brain that tells us we need to gather things before winter happens.The more we have to fight for things, the less likely we are to return it after.When its delivered on Amazon Prime, you forget it was so hard to get this product.The tactility of how one finalizes the transaction itself can have an effect on remorse, too.Mr. Lindstrom found that 93 percent of consumers feel a stronger connection to cash than to credit cards and are more careful when spending with it.Likewise, for the least tactile connection he studied, Amazons 1-Click Ordering, 70 percent of respondents said it made them spend more money than even with a credit card.But whereas cash-based transactions lead to more immediate remorse, 89 percent of shoppers said they feel guiltier when they receive their credit card statements after 1-Click orders than when they pay in cash.The remorse still exists with online shopping; its just deferred, with extra pain later.Shopping on a website featuring attractive models or beautiful homes may engender the same sense of inadequacy that leafing through catalogs can, unlike picking them up in person, and that visual memory may linger when the object has been delivered, leading to remorse.Buying something online can also lead quickly to a social-media search after the fact for friends and strangers superior products (or better use of the same product).The sneakers I bought in this troublesomely bottomless marketplace were for casual wear, but I also needed a new pair of running shoes, a purchase that I undertook with more serious online research: reading reviews from specialized publications and individual users, comparing models from different years, taking quizzes to determine what was best for my particular stride.But even the highest-rated sneakers had their detractors, and those damning, all-caps review headlines (SHODDILY MADE, THEY RUINED IT) made me hesitate whenever I was on the verge of adding them to my virtual shopping cart.A week after searching in vain and the ensuing deluge of targeted ads, I visited a nearby running store.I tried on a few pairs and solicited opinions from one employee, then picked the sneakers that felt best.Within 20 minutes I was walking out with them, glad to have given my money to a local business over a soulless national chain.There is undoubtedly a better running shoe out there for me, and I could probably find it if I spent enough time scouring the internet.But je ne regrette rien.
Hearing Amazon’s Footsteps, the Health Care Industry Shudders:::::An Amazon spokeswoman, Lori Torgerson, refused to comment on rumors or speculation about Amazon entering the pharmacy business, but she shared a statement that suggested other motivations for the paperwork.Wholesale licenses are required for Amazon Business to sell professional-use only medical devices in certain states, she said.There is little doubt, though, that Amazon is interested in at least some aspects of the pharmacy business.Brittain Ladd, a supply chain consultant who worked at Amazon until earlier this year on groceries and other initiatives, said he participated in discussions about how Amazon could enter the category, including through acquisitions.The pharmacy business was always a topic of interest when I was with Amazon, and there was a sincere desire on the part of Amazon to create a better customer experience across pharmacy and health care as a whole, he said.While Mr. Ladd said he isnt privy to the companys current strategy, he believes existing pharmacy companies are right to be worried.My advice is that executives at pharmaceutical companies should crush all assumptions when it comes to Amazon and their ability to enter, innovate and reimagine the pharmacy business and health care, he said.If Amazon decides to enter the market, it could take a variety of avenues, analysts said.The easiest way in would be to set up a mail-order pharmacy that focused on price-sensitive customers without health insurance or who have high-deductible plans that require them to pay for some drug costs upfront.To do this, Amazon would need retail pharmacy licenses in every state a hurdle, certainly, but not an insurmountable one, the analysts said.They can at least dip their toe in the water with the cash-pay customers, and learn the business, said Ana Gupte, an analyst for Leerink Partners.She said cash-paying customers account for 5 percent to 10 percent of the $560 billion prescription drug business.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The idea could prove attractive to customers who already go to Amazon for a wide range of shopping items, from shoes to electronics to diapers.Retailers like Target and Walmart have added pharmacies to bring in extra business for a similar reason.Amazons recent acquisition of Whole Foods could also provide a physical location for pharmacies.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.A large part of the infrastructure is already there, said David Maris, an analyst for Wells Fargo.In a call with analysts this week, Timothy C. Wentworth, the chief executive of the pharmacy-benefit manager Express Scripts, indicated a willingness to work with Amazon to reach these cash-paying customers.We certainly see that as something where if they wanted to move into a space, we could be a very natural collaborator, he said.If Amazon wanted to go bigger, Ms. Gupte and others said, it could sell to insured customers and even serve as a pharmacy-benefit manager, overseeing drug coverage for people on behalf of insurers and large employers.This would be far more complex.It would likely require Amazon to either acquire a pharmacy-benefit manager or enter into a partnership with an existing one.Expanding the pharmacy business without the aid of a major pharmacy-benefit manager would be tough, because the benefit managers serve as gatekeepers to insured patients, deciding which pharmacies they can and cannot use.The benefit managers also operate their own mail-order pharmacies, which might make them less willing to accommodate Amazon.Some said they expect that if Amazon chooses to enter the health care business, it would do so in a big way.The company could attempt to provide comprehensive services to patients, doctors and others, far beyond selling drugs.Nadina J. Rosier, the health and group benefits pharmacy practice leader at Willis Towers Watson, said other areas the company could explore include offering virtual doctor consults, or using the Amazon Echo, its voice-controlled smart device, for health care applications.No matter the short-term steps Amazon is taking, Ms. Rosier said, her research has demonstrated that it is clearly looking to revolutionize how health care is delivered in some way.But while Amazon has a track record for upending major industries, from books to groceries, she said health care is complicated and there would be intense pressure to get it right.It is just a sensitive topic, she said.We dont have as much scrutiny of how much you paid for your jeans, or your shoes.
At Facebook, Hand-Wringing Over a Fix for Fake Content:::::On one side are employees who idealize Facebooks lofty goals of unfettered speech and do not think the company should be in the business of censoring what its users have to say.On the other side are workers who worry that the companys hands-off approach has already caused problems ones that will grow worse if nothing is done.The algorithms Facebook sets up that prioritize and control whats shown in its powerful newsfeed are a lot more consequential than the ads, said Zeynep Tufekci, an associate professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill who closely follows social media and technology.The company seems stuck between exercising this massive power as it wishes, but also terrified about the conversation about its power and how to handle it.Next week, Facebooks general counsel will be among several tech industry executives expected to testify at a series of Congressional hearings about the role the technology industry played in Russian interference of last years election.Facebook has acknowledged that an organization with ties to the Kremlin purchased $100,000 worth of ads related to the election and has promised to crack down on such advertising.Since Facebook disclosed the existence of those ads and posts with Russian ties last month, the company has attempted to tamp down fears it abetted interference in the election.It has also added rules meant to improve disclosures of political advertising in an attempt to show users exactly who is behind the ads they saw run through their newsfeeds.And on Friday, the company began a test of new features designed to give users a better understanding of the people and organizations buying advertising on Facebook.That included providing users with a searchable database of ads being served to them.But misleading ads were often a small component of the misinformation campaign.Investigators believe the Internet Research Agency, a so-called troll farm that has been linked to the Kremlin, amassed enormous followings for various Facebook Pages that masqueraded as destinations for discussion about all sorts of issues, from the Black Lives Matter movement to gun ownership.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Aided by Facebooks finely tuned ad-targeting tools, the Russian firm would pay to place posts in the News Feeds of users.The ad product, called a promoted post, was designed to look little different than the rest of the content flowing through the News Feed.Users who responded in a positive manner to the advertisements were prompted to subscribe to related Facebook Pages or Groups run by the Russians.If they did, it meant that nonpaid, organic posts would begin to appear in the users News Feeds.From there they spread, being shared and reshared among the users network of friends.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.The tactic was effective.Some of the pages, like Blacktivists, which focused on racial issues, had more than 360,000 users who liked the page even more than the main Black Lives Matter page.Facebook is not the only big internet company wrestling with the issue.But at Mr. Zuckerbergs company, the issue has been particularly troublesome, given how easy it is to spread messages to tens of millions of Facebook users.Whether something is removed from Facebook is often dictated by its terms of service, which define standards of behavior on the network.Those standards prohibit posting nudity and threats of violence.But misleading users even outright lying arent necessarily against the rules.And thats hard to police.So far, Facebook has focused on the issue of authenticity and identity on the platform.Facebook removed hundreds of ads last month, not because of the content they contained, but because the Russians running the pages did not disclose their real identities.We want people to be able to come to Facebook to talk about issues of public interest, and we know that means people will sometimes disagree and the issues they discuss will sometimes be controversial, Monika Bickert, head of product policy and counterterrorism at Facebook, said in a statement.Thats O.K.But its important to us that these conversations happen in an authentic way, meaning we have to be speaking as ourselves, with our real identities.That line of reasoning may not hold up for long, as Facebook is being forced to deal with policy discussions outside the United States.In Myanmar, Facebook is caught between the government and a persecuted minority group of Muslims, the Rohingya, who face a misinformation campaign on Facebook in posts often from top government leaders.Facebook has said little publicly about the situation but there is intensifying pressure to respond.One of the solutions discussed internally at Facebook has been whitelisting, in which algorithms would decide which content makers would be allowed to publish or advertise on Facebook, according to two people familiar with the companys internal deliberations.They have also discussed blacklisting, in which the algorithms would decide which content makers could not post.Advertisement Continue reading the main story But in closed-door meetings at Facebooks Menlo Park, Calif., headquarters and in Washington, Facebook employees have expressed concern that such a move could have effects on other publications and content makers that are not spreading false or divisive news.Others worry that acting too hastily could establish precedents that would lead to a situation, for example, where human rights activists using Facebook to coordinate protests in Syria would be forced to identify themselves.They also worry that any effort to quash certain content in the United States could only aid censors in other countries.As for a technical solution, some hope artificial intelligence can help Facebook sift fact from fiction.But todays A.I.technology is not advanced enough to do the work on its own.Perhaps unsurprisingly, Mr. Zuckerbergs solution is to double down on his community concept.He has said publicly that strengthening social bonds on Facebook will lead to a positive outcome, despite whatever reservations his employees and the general public may have.Every day, I say to myself, I dont have much time here on Earth, how can I make the greatest positive impact?Some nights I go to bed and Im not sure I made the right choices that day, Mr. Zuckerberg said at the June conference.I can tell you, those doubts dont go away, no matter who you are.But every day you just get up and try to make the world a little better.
A War of Words Puts Facebook at the Center of Myanmar’s Rohingya Crisis:::::In Myanmar, Facebook is so dominant that to many people it is the internet itself.And the stakes of what appears on the site are exceptionally high because misinformation, as well as explicitly hostile language, is widening longstanding ethnic divides and stoking the violence against the Rohingya ethnic group.Photo For example, since the government crackdown against the Rohingya began, Zaw Htay, a spokesman for the countrys de facto leader, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, has shared dozens of posts on his Facebook page and Twitter account that include images said to show Rohingya burning their own homes.Many of these images have been debunked, yet they still stand.First-person accounts from Rakhine State establish a coordinated crackdown against the Rohingya minority by the military and by ultranationalist groups, driving more than 600,000 refugees across the border into Bangladesh.Facebook does not police the billions of posts and status updates that flow through the site worldwide each day, relying instead on an oftentimes confusing set of community standards and reports by users of direct threats that are then manually assessed and, in some cases, removed.After the 2016 United States elections, Facebook rolled out a set of guidelines to help users identify fake news and misinformation.The company does not regularly remove misinformation itself.Facebook has no office in Myanmar, but the company has worked with local partners to introduce a Burmese-language illustrated copy of its platform standards and will continue to refine its practices, said a spokeswoman, Clare Wareing, in an emailed statement.Human rights groups say the companys approach has allowed opinion, facts and misinformation to mingle on Facebook, clouding perceptions of truth and propaganda in a country where mobile technology has been widely adopted only in the past three years.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Under the rule of the military junta, strict censorship regulations deliberately made SIM cards for cellphones unaffordable to control the free flow of information.In 2014, restrictions loosened and the use of mobile technology exploded as SIM cards became affordable.Facebook users ballooned from about two million in 2014 to more than 30 million today.But most users do not know how to navigate the wider internet.Photo Facebook has become sort of the de facto internet for Myanmar, said Jes Kaliebe Petersen, chief executive of Phandeeyar, Myanmars leading technology hub that helped Facebook create its Burmese-language community standards page.When people buy their first smartphone, it just comes preinstalled.Mr. Petersen said local media and news outlets should help combat misinformation in a technology sector still in its infancy.There are still some challenges here, and there are of course very big differences between big cities and rural communities, he said.I think its really important that people focus on educating this new generation of digital users.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.In the meantime, Facebook has become a breeding ground for hate speech and virulent posts about the Rohingya.And because of Facebooks design, posts that are shared and liked more frequently get more prominent placement in feeds, favoring highly partisan content in timelines.Ashin Wirathu, the monk, has hundreds of thousands of followers on Facebook accounts in Burmese and English.His posts include graphic photos and videos of decaying bodies that Ashin Wirathu says are Buddhist victims of Rohingya attacks, or posts denouncing the minority ethnic group or updates that identify them falsely as Bengali foreigners.Facebook has removed some of his posts and restricted his page for stretches, but it is currently active.In an interview, Ashin Wirathu said that if Facebook did remove his account, he would simply create a new one.He added that if anyone did not like his Facebook posts, they can sue me.Posts from verified government and military Facebook accounts also carry misinformation.Some, for example, refuse to acknowledge the Rohingya as an ethnic group deserving of citizenship rights, despite the fact many have lived in Rakhine State for generations.Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, the commander in chief of Myanmars armed forces who has carried out the crackdown on the Rohingya, has more than 1.3 million users on his verified account.A post from Sept. 15 describes the operation as a response to an attempt of extremist Bengalis in Rakhine State to build a stronghold, after an Aug. 25 attack on remote border posts by a Rohingya militant group.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Rohingya activists also use Facebook, documenting human rights abuses, often with graphic images and videos as evidence.Sometimes the company has taken these down.Ms. Wareing, the Facebook spokeswoman, said the company removed graphic content when it is shared to celebrate the violence.She said the company would allow graphic content if it was newsworthy, significant or important to the public interest, even if it might otherwise go against the platforms standards.Richard Weir, an Asia analyst with Human Rights Watch, said the situation was complicated.Its a really delicate balance here between things that are violent and posted by people who would seek to inflame tensions and those that are trying to disseminate information, Mr. Weir said.Its difficult to know where exactly to draw the line.Some of the social media conversation is happening privately.For instance, chain messages on Facebook Messenger before Sept. 11 this year falsely warned of a planned Rohingya attack against Buddhists.Written like a chain letter, the message called for people to share it, and many people were put on edge as it spread.I was nervous about it, said U Tin Win, a teacher from Mandalay, the countrys second-largest city, who received the letter.I dont know who started the message, but I ordered my family not to go outside that day.Mr. Weir said that people in Myanmar relied on social media for their news.The government can sort of trot out its own views and spread them very rapidly, in addition to a bunch of other nonstate entities, he said.Views about people in Rakhine State, about the origins of population and about things that may or may not have happened fly around Facebook extremely quickly and can create unstable situations.
Britain Says North Korea Was Behind Cyberattack on Health Service:::::They encrypted the information on them and then demanded payment of $300 or more in Bitcoin to unlock the devices.In Britain, the attack resulted in the abrupt cancellation of patients operations and delays in medical appointments at dozens of hospitals that struggled to retrieve essential medical information and patient histories.Britains National Audit Office said on Friday that at least 6,900 appointments had been canceled during the attack, which affected more than one-third of Englands 236 N.H.S.trusts.Up to 19,000 appointments may have been affected, it said.Hospital authorities have said that no patient data was compromised or stolen during the attack.But it had particular resonance in Britain where the N.H.S., though chronically underfunded, is a vaunted part of the nations identity.Mr. Wallace warned that it was difficult to respond to a cyberattack committed by a hostile state.North Korea, which has ambitions to develop a nuclear weapon and has been repeatedly testing missiles despite international sanctions, has also proved adept at sowing havoc through cyberattacks.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.North Korea has been potentially linked to other attacks about raising foreign currency, he said, in an apparent reference to an attack last year in which North Korean hackers tried to steal $1 billion from the New York Federal Reserve, and almost succeeded before being stopped by a spelling error.The North has an army of 6,000 hackers, and experts in Britain and the United States say their ability to wage effective cyberattacks has improved.In 2014, the country unleashed a cyberattack against Sony Pictures aimed at blocking the release of a satirical film deemed disrespectful of its leader, Kim Jong-un.Mr. Wallace said it was imperative for Britain to reinforce its efforts to defend against future attacks.Its a salient lesson for us all that all of us, from individuals to governments to large organizations, have a role to play in maintaining the security of our networks, he said.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The National Audit Office said on Friday that the WannaCry attack had been relatively unsophisticated and could have been prevented had the N.H.S.followed rudimentary procedures to protect its systems.It said that N.H.S.management had recklessly ignored security recommendations.Amyas Morse, the head of the National Audit Office, on Friday criticized the preparedness of the N.H.S.The WannaCry cyberattack had potentially serious implications for the N.H.S.and its ability to provide care to patients, he said in a statement.He added that the N.H.S.needed to get its act together.In the immediate aftermath, Amber Rudd, the British home secretary, acknowledged that, despite several warnings of a possible attack, the N.H.S.had been ill prepared to defend itself and was vulnerable because its computers had outmoded software.While the ransom demanded in the attack in Britain was modest, the National Audit Office said evidence indicated that no N.H.S.organization had paid, which experts say could have encouraged further attacks.
How to Stop Waking Up the iPhone:::::Q. I just got a new iPhone and have noticed that every time I pick it up or move it, the screen pops on by itself instead of me turning it on with the switch.Is this a problem with the phone?A.The iPhone 6s and later models include a feature called Raise to Wake that senses when you pick up the device and then automatically flips on the display screen so you do not have to fumble around with the Home or power buttons when you want to check something.If you have just purchased a new iPhone or had not upgraded your hardware in a few years, the sudden activity can seem a little unsettling.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story How Do You Use Tech?Advice and tips on the technology changing how you live.When you lift the phone and the display wakes up, you land on the iPhones lock screen.You can see your alerts without having to unlock the phone if you have notifications set to show up there.(Some people prefer not to, out of privacy concerns.)Raise to Wake also saves you a step if you need to snap a photo in a hurry because as you lift the phone, you can swipe the screen to the left to quickly jump to the iPhones Camera app.Swiping up from the bottom of the screen summons the iOS Control Center, where you can change the music volume, use the iPhones flashlight, switch on Airplane Mode and adjust other settings without having to unlock the phone and fiddle around in the main Settings app.Photo If you do not want your notifications visible to people nearby or worry your phones battery is taking too much of a hit when the screen pops on each time you move the device, you can turn off Raise to Wake.To do that, unlock your iPhone, tap the Settings app on the Home screen, select Display & Brightness and tap the button near Raise to Wake to disable the feature.
Making YouTube Safer for Children:::::Q.Does YouTube have parental controls?A. YouTube has a Restricted Mode you can enable in the settings for the mobile app, or within the web browser used to watch the videos.Restricted Mode attempts to scan and filter out the adult-oriented content posted to the site so young viewers do not see it, but YouTube admits the setting is not 100 percent accurate.To evaluate videos, the site uses information from posted clips, like a videos description, title, community-guideline reviews, metadata embedded in the file and any age restrictions added by the person who posted it.YouTube has been known to tinker with the filter settings to keep them current, although doing so last spring inadvertently banned nonexplicit L.G.B.T.content a move that the company, which issued an apology, reversed.(As a general civility bonus, however, Restricted Mode also blocks any comments posted to videos.)Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story How Do You Use Tech?Advice and tips on the technology changing how you live.Schools, libraries and other public computers may have Restricted Mode already enabled, but you can activate the setting on the computers and devices you use.To turn on the setting in a web browser, select your YouTube account icon in the top-right corner of the screen, and when the menu opens, select Restricted Mode and flip the button to the On position.Older versions of the YouTube web interface have a Restricted Mode button at the bottom of each page.If you use multiple browsers on your computer, you need to turn on Restricted Mode in each one.To activate the content filter in the YouTube app for Android, make sure you are signed into your YouTube or Google account, and tap your profile picture or the menu icon in the upper-right corner of the screen.From the menu, choose Settings, then General and then Restricted Mode.Photo To do the same in the iOS app, tap your profile icon in the corner, select Settings and then tap Restricted Mode filtering.Select the Strict option to start screening out inappropriate clips.If you are trying to keep children from stumbling into inappropriate video content, setting them up with the YouTube Kids site instead is another option; apps are available for Android and iOS devices, along with a parental guide for using the service.Depending on your hardware and software, you may also be able to use parental controls built into the operating system to restrict access to apps and sites you would rather the children not see; third-party programs to police online activity are also available.
When the iPhone Disturbs You About Driving:::::Q.Ever since I upgraded the software, my iPhone freaks out whenever Im in a cab because it thinks Im driving.Im tired of tapping the Im not driving button how do I tell the phone I dont drive?A.The recent iOS 11 software update includes a new safety component of the Do Not Disturb feature for silencing notifications one that blocks most calls and alerts to the phone while you are driving.If enabled, the new safeguards kick in automatically when the iPhone makes a Bluetooth connection to the cars dashboard or its motion sensors pick up movement and acceleration similar to that of riding in an automobile.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story How Do You Use Tech?Advice and tips on the technology changing how you live.The iPhone can also mistake the forward motion of a train or a bus for riding in a car.And as you have discovered, taxi passengers may also notice their phones are temporarily disabled unless the Do Not Disturb control is switched off.If you never drive yourself and want the iPhone to stop pestering you when you are taking mass transit, tap open the Settings icon and choose Do Not Disturb from the main Settings screen.Scroll down the bottom of the screen until you get to Do Not Disturb While Driving.Tap the Activate button to switch the setting from Automatically to Manually.Photo For those who do drive and want to use the feature, you can change the auto-reply message the phone sends to people who text you while you are on the road.Theres also the option to choose the specific people (or groups) in your Contacts list who get an automatic message from you while you are focused on driving.If you prefer to use the Do Not Disturb feature in manual mode, you can add a shortcut icon to the iPhones Control Center.Open the Settings app, select Control Center and then Customize Controls.Tap the Plus (+) button next to Do Not Disturb While Driving icon to add it to the Control Center screen, where you can quickly tap the setting on or off.
The iPhone X Is Cool. That Doesn’t Mean You Are Ready for It.:::::And although the face scanner for unlocking the device is impressive and creepily accurate, in many situations, it didnt work as quickly as a fingerprint scanner.It also failed to unlock the phone when I wore a pair of Persol sunglasses.The iPhone X feels ahead of its time, perfect for a target audience of technology enthusiasts and obsessive photographers.Everyone else may want to wait awhile to buy.An iPhone X overview First, the basics: The iPhone X has a 5.8-inch screen that is larger than the 5.5-inch display on the iPhone 8 Plus and the 4.7-inch screen on the iPhone 8.Yet the iPhone Xs overall body is smaller than that of the iPhone 8 Plus (though a little bit larger than that of the iPhone 8).Apple managed to squeeze a larger screen onto a smaller body by eliminating the iPhones bezel, which is the border surrounding the display.The screen takes up the entire face of the device, with the exception of a notch at the top containing the infrared face scanner.In the process of removing the bezel, Apple also eliminated the home button.As a result, controlling the iPhone X mostly involves using touch gestures.When inside an app or unlocking the phone, swiping up from the bottom brings you to the home screen.Thats simple, but other functions are trickier.To open the app switcher, a popular feature, you swipe up from the bottom and hold your finger for a second.Many times, I lifted my thumb too soon before opening this shortcut.(On past iPhones, you would just press the home button twice to open the app switcher.)Apple has included a shortcut on the phone called Reachability, which lowers the top of the screen to make it easier for one-handed users to reach for buttons or apps on the top row with their thumb.To engage it, swipe downward from the bottom of the screen.Yet it often took me multiple attempts to swipe the sweet spot before successfully opening it.It is much easier to use Reachability with other iPhones: you just tap the home button twice.I struggled with the new iPhone controls when I ran into a bug.One morning, the Amazon app was loaded on the screen then it froze.I tried swiping up to leave the app, then holding two physical side buttons down to shut down the phone, but to no avail.Advertisement Continue reading the main story I fumbled around for at least 10 minutes before I read a guide that revealed that pressing three physical buttons in a sequence would force a restart.These are troubling signs for how less technologically inclined people may respond to the iPhone X.For the last decade, the iPhone has been a computer that anyone can use without reading an instruction manual.With the iPhone X, that is no longer the case.Testing Face ID Apples Face ID, the official name for its face scanner technology, works by spraying an object with infrared dots and stitching the patterns into a detailed 3D image of your face to determine whether you are the owner of the smartphone before unlocking it.Face ID continues to update this map of your face with more information every time you unlock your smartphone whether you are wearing a scarf or a hat or growing facial hair.In addition, Face ID can authorize mobile payments, log in to apps and create animated emojis that mimic your face movements.I put Face ID through dozens of tests and it recognized my face in most situations, including when I wore a beanie, Ray-Ban sunglasses or goggles for my Halloween costume or draped a dog toy over my head.It worked in pitch dark at night and outside on a sunny day.But Face ID worked inconsistently or not at all when I lay the iPhone X flat on a table or my night stand, wore a gas mask for my Halloween costume, walked around in bright sunlight at a park or wore Persol sunglasses.(According to Apple, these particular sunglasses probably blocked the part of the infrared spectrum used by Face ID.)It also didnt work when I tried using the face scanner while slurping a bowl of noodles.Ultimately, it was faster to unlock the iPhone 8 with Touch ID, the fingerprint sensor, than it was to unlock the iPhone X with Face ID in most situations.Unlocking with a fingerprint sensor is one rapid gesture: You hold your fingerprint over the sensor, and the phone unlocks in less than a second.With Face ID, you have to wait for the camera to scan your face, which sometimes takes more than a second; you can swipe up to unlock the phone before or after the scan completes.Advertisement Continue reading the main story To be fair, Touch ID sometimes failed to scan my fingerprint on previous iPhones, like when my hands were sweaty, damp or dirty.Over the long term, Face ID is likely to save more time than using Touch ID because Face ID only failed in rare circumstances.The wow factors Before reviewing the iPhone X, I used an iPhone 8 Plus for two weeks for comparison.Both devices have a similar rear camera system with two lenses.The two cameras work together to show the pictures main subject in sharp focus while gently blurring the background.Apple calls this Portrait mode, also known as the bokeh effect.Photo The dual-lens camera is extremely compelling, with Portrait mode making photos of even the most mundane things like a bowl of ramen look artistic and stunning.But the drawback was that the iPhone 8 Plus was so bulky that it was miserable to carry around and using the device with one hand felt impossible.That means the iPhone Xs dual-lens camera and phone size may be a major draw for people.The iPhone Xs camera is slightly better than the camera on the iPhone 8 Plus because one lens has a higher aperture to let in more light.As a result, Portrait mode photos looked better (subjects were even clearer in the foreground), and so did photos taken in low light.Another must mention: the screen.It uses OLED technology, a type of display with better color accuracy and contrast than its predecessor, LCD.That made the screen on the iPhone X look more vibrant than the ones on the iPhone 8 Plus and iPhone 8, which still use LCD.I also preferred the colors on the screen to those on the Samsung Galaxy Note 8, the $950 phablet that earned top ratings for its display.The Samsung devices display colors looked bluer and less natural than those on the iPhone X.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story How Do You Use Tech?Advice and tips on the technology changing how you live.Bottom line In terms of features, the iPhone X is the most impressive smartphone ever made.Its worth the $999 but that doesnt mean you should buy it.I wouldnt hesitate to recommend the iPhone X to my tech-crazed friends in Silicon Valley, but the iPhone 8 is just as fast while being simpler and more familiar to use.Then again, if you are willing to get up early to line up for a $999 phone, you are probably the target demographic for the iPhone X anyway.Make sure you wear something comfortable.
Encountering Robots While Still Using Fax Machines in Japan:::::Earthquake apps like QuakeFeed are also helpful in quake-prone Japan, not to mention as early indicators of nuclear tests in North Korea.Since I make a lot of calls to analysts and government officials in the United States either very early in the morning or late at night (Tokyo is 13 hours ahead of New York and Washington), I try to use WhatsApp or Skype to call people abroad since my Japanese cell plan charges extra for overseas calls.My small beef with the academics who specialize in Japan and the Korean Peninsula is that so many of them seem incapable or unwilling to use internet-based calling apps.Photo What interesting tech trends do you see emerging in Japan that haven't yet reached the United States?Robots!I frequently run into a version of Pepper, a child-size cartoonish robot made by SoftBank, the Japanese conglomerate.Its founder, Masayoshi Son, has recently talked about the coming Singularity, in which artificial intelligence outstrips humans.I encountered an android tourist greeter at a mall, and television news programs frequently feature some new application of robotic technology, from restaurant servers to nursing home caregivers.For personal texting, Line, a communications app that started after the 2011 earthquake and tsunami, is extremely popular.So I communicate with friends, my staff and even the woman who cuts my hair using Line.Part of the reason it's so popular here is its wide variety of emoticons and digital stickers.How do you use tech differently in Japan than you did in the United States?The weird thing about Japan is that although it seems technologically advanced, it is still behind the times in many ways.As The Times has written before, the fax machine is still a cherished piece of technology in Japan.Many sources demand that we send requests for interviews and sample questions via fax and will simply not accept an email.I cant remember the last time I sent or received a fax in the United States.Photo My 11-year-old son has a small keitai, or kids cellphone, that is programmed so he can only call or receive calls from me, my husband or his sister.By the time we left Brooklyn in 2016, it seemed like most kids his age either didn't have a phone at all, or had a smartphone.A lot of Japanese children, as young as age 6, have such keitais, which enable them to independently travel on subways and walk to and from school on their own while still being reachable.We often run into very small children on their own on the subway platform, the small phones dangling from their backpacks.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mobile payment systems have been slow to gain traction in America.How about in Japan?Unlike China, where people pay for almost everything with smartphones, Japan is resolutely a cash-based society.There are many restaurants that will not accept credit cards, much less mobile payments.Japan has a prepaid card, known as Suica, that is mostly used to pay for train fares but can also be used to pay for items from vending machines or convenience stores as well as taxi rides.Mobile payments via Suica have been available on mobile phones in Japan since 2006.Although these systems have been around for years, this technology hasnt spread to popular devices like the iPhone until recently.Beyond your job, what tech product are you currently obsessed with using in your daily life?FaceTime, Skype and WhatsApp are lifelines for staying in touch with friends and family back home.My 13-year-old daughter regularly talks to her best friends in Brooklyn and in England on FaceTime, and the other day I Skyped into a meeting of my Brooklyn book group.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story How Do You Use Tech?Advice and tips on the technology changing how you live.I really only began posting regularly to Instagram once I moved to Japan, because I want everyone at home to be able to see what Im seeing every day, here and in South Korea, where I travel regularly to report.Japan and Korea are visually sumptuous places, and, yes, I am one of those clichd people who post photos of their lunches.My daughter is obsessed with Snapchat and streaks, an activity whose point I have yet to grasp.But I have been surprised by the number of times she'll tell me that she has seen some news item on Instagram or Snapchat, an activity whose point I wholeheartedly endorse.Not long after we moved here, we caved and bought AppleTV and subscribed to a VPN so that we could keep up with our favorite American TV shows and movies.Much as I think it is important to experience as much of the local culture as possible, I know that keeping on top of the popular culture from home is a way of staying connected to friends and family, too.Streaming, though, is often sluggish, and the screen will freeze in the middle of a show while we stare balefully at the loading spinner.The robotics industry is important to Japan.Meanwhile, personal digital assistants like Siri and Google Assistant are trendy in the United States.Where do you think this is all taking us?Unlike in the United States, where workers fear automation taking over their jobs, robotics are embraced here in Japan by the government, corporate sector and broader society.The government is anti-immigration, so one of its oft-cited solutions to a declining population and shrinking labor force is to rely increasingly on artificial intelligence.Whether robots can actually accomplish all the tasks they are being promoted for is an open question.I wonder whether something as personal as nursing home care can really be outsourced to robots.As a parent, I would hate the thought that robots would be used in day care facilities, unless it was just for food preparation or cleanup.
A Stylus That Works for Tablet and Wallet:::::Q.What is the difference between a $100 tablet stylus compared with a $10 model?A.Those pricier styluses are often designed to work with a specific tablet line as is the case of the Apple Pencil, the Google Pixelbook Pen and the Microsoft Surface Pen and can include customized features for those devices.For example, Googles Pixelbook Pen integrates with the Google Assistant software and will search the web for words or images you circle on the Pixelbook screen.Photo If you are just looking for a stylus to take handwritten notes or do some basic drawing, the less expensive models are probably fine.The $10 Adonit Mark, the $20 Hand Stylus and the thick-barreled $25 Studio Neat Cosmonaut are all general purpose models that work on most capacitive touch screen devices.Unlike the more expensive stylus models, which sometimes require their own battery power or Bluetooth pairing with a designated tablet, most economy models do not need to be powered and work right out of the package.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story How Do You Use Tech?Advice and tips on the technology changing how you live.For those with artistic inclinations or who want a stylus that was designed to work smoothly with certain tablet hardware and software, the more expensive models have perks.Most include a wider degree of tilt and pressure sensitivity, which lets you vary the weight and shading of the lines drawn on the tablet screen, much like a pen on paper.The higher-end tablet pens are often more responsive, with less lag time between when you put the tip to the glass and when you see your handwriting or sketches appear.Forking over a hundred dollars for a digital writing stick may be too much of an extravagance for many people.In the middle ground, you can also find accessories that offer more features than the basic models but cost less than a high-end stylus.The $40 Sensu Artist Brush & Stylus includes two artists tools (including a digital paintbrush) in one device that works with most touch screens, while the $75 Adonit Pixel promises smooth response, pressure sensitivity and shortcut buttons, all while working on a wider variety of iOS devices than the Apple Pencil.
How to Get Cortana’s Undivided Attention:::::Q.How do I make the Cortana software on my Windows 10 PC ignore everybody else in the house and respond only to my voice?A.For Microsofts Cortana virtual assistant to obey only one voice, the software has to get to know that voice.So you need to do a few training exercises so the program recognizes you and doesnt respond to other voices.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story How Do You Use Tech?Advice and tips on the technology changing how you live.To start training, open the Cortana settings; in the new Windows 10 Fall Creators Update, open the Settings app from the gear-shaped icon on the Start menu.In the Settings area, select Cortana.Next, in the Cortana settings box, click Talk to Cortana on the left side of the box.In the Hey Cortana area, make sure the Let Cortana respond to Hey Cortana setting is turned on and then click the Learn how I say Hey Cortana link.Photo This opens the Cortana panel, where you will be asked to repeat six phrases displayed on the screen.Click the Start button in the Cortana window and follow along as the software guides you through the voice training.(Some users have reported buggy and nonresponsive behavior when trying to use Cortanas voice-learning feature, but Microsofts online support forums have troubleshooting suggestions.)Once you complete the required phrases, return to the main Settings app and go back to the Cortana area.Now that the software has had a full introduction to your voice, click the button next to Try to respond to only me.
Power Up Your Phone by Hand or by Sun:::::Q.As recent storms and power outages have shown, we are now deeply reliant on cellphones for communication, especially since many people have gotten rid of their landlines.If theres no electricity, what options do you have for charging a phone battery?A.Backup batteries only last for so long, but hand-cranked chargers and miniature solar panels are two options for restoring a little power to your mobile phone.Adding an alternative charging device to your household emergency kit (along with the flashlights and candles) is one way to stay in contact with others, but keep in mind that for large-scale outages, network cellular service and Wi-Fi routers will most likely be down as well.Several companies make hand-cranked chargers, including Etn and K-TOR.Prices start at about $17 for a simple crank and go up from there.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story How Do You Use Tech?Advice and tips on the technology changing how you live.To use one, connect the phone to the device with its USB charging cable and then turn the crank continuously until you see the phones battery level move up a notch or two.Depending on the devices involved, this can take several minutes of cranking, but you should be able to get enough power to make an emergency call which can be helpful if, say, your house is having power problems of its own and you need to call an electrician.Photo If hand-cranking does not appeal to you, Etn also offers solar-powered solutions and K-TOR has a pedal-powered charger for about $200.Portable solar-powered chargers can supply energy to devices in emergency and nonemergency situations (like camping) without physical effort.Wirecutter, a New York Times company that reviews products, tested 70 solar battery chargers and found the $51 Anker PowerPort Solar Lite to be the best model for juicing up mobile devices.Smartphone cases with built-in solar chargers are another option, even for everyday use.SnowLizard makes cases for current iPhone models and the Portable Solar Shop site sells cases for several Android phones.
The iPhone X Arrives Friday. Here’s What You Need to Know.:::::Paying for It Apple is selling the iPhone X with two options for storage capacity: 64 gigabytes for $999 and 256 gigabytes for $1,149.There are various ways to pay that hefty price.The simplest route is to pay for the device outright.This is the least confusing option because your wireless bill will contain charges only for your phone plan, and you can do whatever you want with the device like sell it or switch to a different wireless carrier whenever you want.You can also opt to spread out the payments with a monthly installment plan.For example, if you are a Verizon customer, you can choose to pay off the $999 iPhone over 24 months for $41.62 a month.This is a nice option because spreading out the payments does not incur interest fees.Another option is to go for an early upgrade plan, which lets you pay a flat monthly rate and upgrade to a new iPhone annually.Its essentially leasing a new phone every year.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Internetting With Amanda Hess Our critic discusses everything thats wrong, weird and totally sad about the internet in five videos.Sign-up for email notifications.There are various early upgrade plans on the market.With Apples early upgrade program, you can pay $49.91 a month, and once youve made 12 payments, you can trade in your iPhone to upgrade to the next one and continue paying that monthly rate.(Im not a fan of this path because I suggest cherishing your devices for as long as you can before upgrading.)Similarities to the Cheaper iPhone 8 Before you splurge, consider your options.Apples iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus, which share many features of the iPhone X, have starting prices of $699 and $799.The cheaper iPhones have the same computing processor as the iPhone X, so they are just as fast, and their 12-megapixel rear cameras are on a par with the rear camera on the iPhone X.So whats the difference?Mainly, the screen.The iPhone X has a 5.8-inch screen that takes up the entire face of the device, with the exception of a notch at the top containing an infrared camera system.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The iPhone 8 has a 4.7-inch screen, and the iPhone 8 Plus has a 5.5-inch screen.Both of the cheaper iPhones have bezels the border surrounding the display whereas the iPhone X has eliminated the bezel.Other than screen size, the screen technologies differ.The iPhone X is the only Apple phone that uses OLED, a type of display that can be made thinner, lighter and brighter, and with better color accuracy and contrast than its predecessor, LCD.So the screen on the iPhone X looks more vibrant than the iPhone 8 Plus and iPhone 8, which still use LCD.Last but not least, the iPhone X has a unique infrared face scanner.The technology, called Face ID, uses the infrared camera system on the front of the phone to scan the contours and shape of a persons head to unlock the device and authorize mobile payments.The iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus have normal front-facing cameras for snapping selfies.Photo How Face Recognition Replaces the Fingerprint Sensor The primary way you can unlock an iPhone X is with the face scanner.The premium phone lacks Touch ID, the fingerprint sensor that has been a popular feature on iPhones for several years.Face ID is brand new there hasnt been anything like it on a smartphone before.It works by spraying an object with infrared dots to gather information about the depth of an object based on the size and the contortion of the dots.The imaging system can stitch the patterns into a detailed 3-D image of your face to determine if you are the owner of your smartphone before unlocking it.Because the shape of a persons head is unique, the likelihood of bypassing facial recognition with someone elses face is one in a million, according to Apple.Older facial recognition systems worked by using the camera to take a photo of yourself and comparing that with an image that was stored on the device.All a thief would need to do to fool the system was hold a photo of your face in front of the camera which some people already did with Samsungs facial-recognition feature.The false acceptance rate of older face recognition systems was one in 100.It will be interesting to see how early adopters react to Face ID, and whether it will work well with many different kinds of faces.If youre skeptical or turned off by the idea of your phone constantly scanning your face to unlock your phone, you could always get an iPhone 8 or iPhone 8 Plus, which still have Touch ID.
Animal Crossing Pocket Camp: everything you need to know about the mobile game:::::Update: Data miners have already started digging into the code for Animal Crossing and may have uncovered some as-yet-unconfirmed features that could be coming to the game.According to Shacknews When sifting through the game's APK, they uncovered plans for garden mechanics which involved different kinds of plants, plant and soil conditions and even plant breeding information.There were also different in-game facilities discovered such as hospitals, restaurants, schools and shops as well as a variety of weather effects.Even more excitingly, it looks like there may be plans to introduce outfits inspired by a variety of famous Nintendo characters such as Link, Samus and Mario.None of these features have been confirmed by Nintendo and these features may remain in the code without ever coming to fruition.It is still interesting to see how big this game has the potential to become, though.Original article continues below... Nintendo has finally revealed details about Animal Crossing's mobile debut in a 15 minute Nintendo Direct broadcast and there's a lot to take in.What's promising, though, is that this looks as close to a fully-fledged Animal Crossing title as we dared to hope for mobile.The first and most important thing to know is that the game is free-to-play and will be released in late November for iOS and Android devices.Anyone looking to pre-register and receive an alert as soon as the game is released can do so on Nintendo's website.In Animal Crossing Pocket Camp youre tasked with setting up and managing a holiday camp, rather than an entire town.It's an appropriately home-from-home setting for mobile.Craft and build furniture and friendships In a mechanic thats reminiscent of the cat collecting hit, Neko Atsume, its your job to fill this camp with furniture and items thatll make it pleasant and draw in animals to come and visit you there.From what was revealed in the Direct broadcast, we understand there's a crafting system whereby you gather resources, such as cotton and wood, to build furniture that's presented in a pre-set catalog.Once you have the right resources for the furniture you want to build you can craft it in an in-game menu and place it wherever you like in the camp.One way to gather resources is by helping the various animals that populate the world.You can fulfil requests and receive rewards or simply trade items with them.Once a villagers favourite kind of furniture is in the camp, theyll hang around more and maybe become your friend.Its a petty world but we understand the appeal of a nice cushion.When animals start hanging around Camp Demanding a little more, youll have a friendship level with them and raising it is simply a matter of chatting with them or fulfilling requests.Leaf Tickets and Bells are your currency Theres a wide range of items available to craft from benches and cacti to guitars.There are even larger amenities like pools to build, although these take a little longer to complete.If you urgently want to add an item to your camp but you dont have enough materials to craft if or you want to move the building process on a little faster, you can use something called Leaf Tickets.Ah money, naturally this is where Tom Nook comes into play.Leaf Tickets can be earned simply by playing the game and levelling up, but you can also buy them with your real-world money.Its amazing what people will pay to impress the adorable animals in Animal Crossing's world so Nintendo may have landed on the right combination of mainstream brand popularity and monetisation.Free-to-play is a model that's proven far more successful for Nintendo's Fire Emblem mobile game than the one-off purchase price that was applied to Super Mario Run.Given the widespread popularity of Animal Crossing, the free-to-play with microstransactions approach was undoubtedly the right one from a business standpoint.Bells are still the in-game currency of choice, though, and you can collect these in the usual way of shaking trees and selling items you dont need.Travel in real-time To get all the crafting materials you need in the game youll need to travel between settings in your camper van.Theres a beach, an island, a forest, a river and more and each one will have items exclusive to that location.Animal Crossing is played in real-time and the world will gradually change between day, evening and night just as it does around you.Different animals will appear at different times so itll be worth playing at night to meet some more nocturnal creatures.Shop and customise There are activities to take part in other than crafting.Shopping in the marketplace is a great way to pick up some fancier furniture items you can't craft on your own or new clothes from familiar traders.You can also decorate your camper van in the way you like both inside and outside (yes you can even add a second floor) and retreat in there for some quiet time.Get social with real-life friends In Animal Crossing mobile theres a social element.This being Nintendo were not surprised.While you can just chat to the local animals, you can also invite your real-life friends to you camp by swapping your player IDs.You can exchange items with your friends, get decorating ideas from them and just wander around their campsite.If you add someone to your friends list in the game you can return to visit them any time, no player ID required again.The game will have seasonal events and limited-time items and outfits through game updates which will become available through free updates once the game has launched in November.We imagine this will make Christmas and New Year the first exciting events.To watch the Direct broadcast for yourself you can find it below:
The 10 best 4K TVs of 2017:::::Best 4K TVs Buying Guide: Welcome to TechRadar's round-up of the best 4K TVs you can buy for any budget in 2017.Far from being the niche high-end technology that it was a few years ago, 4K resolution (also known as Ultra HD) has more recently exploded into the mainstream.If you're buying even a mid-range TV these days it's more than likely going to be 4K, which means four times the resolution of traditional HD displays.Thankfully there's now a lot of content for the new standard.Netflix and Amazon both offer 4K streams, Ultra HD Blu-rays are increasingly common, and even gaming is getting in on the action with the 4K toting Xbox One X .But making a good 4K TVs isn't just about how many pixels you can push to a screen; it's about the quality of those pixels.To that end, there's even newer technology that we're excited about, like High Dynamic Range and Wide Colour Gamut, that promise to take all those new pixels and make them truly shine.If the world of TV buying feels unapproachable when you're first getting into it, don't worry.Give it some time and it will all make sense.Plus, you've got us here to help you pick out the best 4K TV on the market.Over the years, hundreds of TVs have passed through our reviewers' doorsteps.Using that wealth of experience, we've created a list of the best 4K TVs.We constantly update the list with the latest and greatest panels, so if you see things shuffled around a bit since the last time you were here, don't freak out.Without further ado, here are ten best 4K TVs we've tested in 2017: Additional resources: Need to give your TV's sound a boost?Check out our guide to the best soundbars available.Ultra HD Blu-rays are a fantastic way of watching 4K content without worrying about buffering.Check out our guide to the best Ultra HD Blu-ray players for some suggestions.1.The best 4K TV of 2017: LG OLED C7 Stunning pictures at an affordable price puts OLED back on top Stunning contrast-rich pictures Gorgeous ultra-thin design Excellent operating system Lacks brightness vs LCD At the top of our list for 2017 is the LG OLED C7 available in both 55 and 65-inch iterations.It's here because it delivers better brightness and light control than last years C6 (something we weren't sure was even possible), making it a high dynamic range performer that doesn't sacrifice OLEDs class-leading standard dynamic range capabilities.It delivers its new picture thrills at a price that finally makes OLED a financially viable alternative to top-end LCD sets making it, beyond a doubt, one of 2017s most irresistible TVs.There are other OLEDs worth considering this year (see: Sony's A1E OLED or LG's B7 and W7) but we think the OLED C7 offers the best price-to-performance ratio of any TV under the sun in the year 2017.Read the full review: LG OLED C7 (OLED55C7) 2.The best mid-range 4K TV: Sony Bravia X900E An fantastically sleek and capable set 49-inch: Sony XBR-49X900E | 55-inch: Sony XBR-55X900E | 65-inch: Sony XBR-65X900E | 75-inch: Sony Bravia XBR-75X900E Excellent motion handling Great contrast HDR isn't the brightest Remote doesn't feel as premium Although LCDs haven't quite achieved the same black levels as their OLED rivals, the Sony X900E's HDR performance comes tantalizingly close.This is achieved through the set's direct LED backlight, which allows it to achieve a brightness uniformity that edge-lit displays often fall short of.Add in fantastic detail and motion handling, and you've got yourself a set that strikes an excellent balance between price and performance for mid-range 4K TVs, and is well worth a look ... even if its Android TV interface can feel a little cluttered, and its remote a little cheap.Read the full review: Sony BRAVIA XBR-X900E 3.The best budget 4K TV: TCL P-Series (55P607) TCL's 55P607 is simply the best budget TV of 2017 Bright, colorful HDR Roku TV is amazing Upscaling isnt world-class Poor black level performance TV manufacturers have long sought the formula to a great performing TV at a bargain price and, speaking for the last seven years since LED LCD hit the mainstream, have never quite achieved that perfect balance.Until now.For us, TCLs P-Series 55P607 does just that it packs powerful technology under the hood, including support for WCG and Dolby Vision, in an affordable package that will only get cheaper once the seasonal sales start in November.If you like your TVs bright, colorful and well-stocked with the latest display technologies, the TCL P-Series 55P607 should be at the top of your list.Read the full review: TCL P-Series (55P607) 4.The best premium 4K TV: Sony BRAVIA A1E Sony's brand-new flagship TV for 2017 is returning to OLED 65-inch: Sony A1E OLED Gorgeous picture quality Innovative and excellent sound Its not very bright Android TV is clunky If you have the money to bankroll them, the 55A1 and the A1 OLED series overall are crowd pleasers in just about every way.Their picture only design has been beautifully realized, managing to be simultaneously subtle and dramatic.Their vibrating screen delivers a far more powerful and effective sound performance than Id thought possible, too.The real stars of the show here, though, are the A1s exquisitely detailed, contrast-rich and colorful pictures.These prove emphatically what weve long suspected: More brands using OLED technology can only lead to good things.Read the full review: Sony A1E OLED 5.For the brightest HDR: Samsung Q9F QLED Series Phenominally bright panels do wonders for HDR content 65-inch: Samsung QE65Q9FAM Fantastic color levels Very bright screen HDR color banding can occur Backlight clouding can be an issue Samsung was the first brand to introduce an HDR-compatible screen back in 2015, but it's not been resting on its haunches ever since.Samsung's latest flagship, the Q9F, is a perfect example of this.It ups the brightness to 1500 nits, 50% higher than the level required for UHD Premium certification, making it one of the brightest TV we've ever tested.Outside of an impressive-sounding number this brightness has a real impact on the set's image quality.Detail is preserved in even the brightest areas of the image, and colors are exceptionally vivid and bright.That means even non-HDR content looks fantastic thanks to Samsung's SDR upscaling technology.No TV is perfect, and the Q9F can occasionally suffer from some backlight clouding around bright objects and some settings cause color striping in HDR colors, but in all other respects this is the best television around at the moment.Read the full review: Samsung Q9F QLED TV 6.For the cinephile in your life: Sony XBR-65Z9D Sonys 2016 flagship TV set new standards Brilliant SDR picture quality Ground-breaking backlight LOOK AT THAT PRICE TAG Limited effective viewing angle Look, there aren't many people out there willing to drop 5,500 on Sonys 2016 flagship TV.But those who are will be teated to some of best images this side of a high-tech movie theater.There's just nothing better in the LED-LCD world.In fact, it might just be the holy grail of television for 2016: a TV able to combine the extreme, high dynamic range-friendly brightness of LCD technology with a 600 LED backlight arrangement capable of getting LCD closer than ever before to the stunning light control you get with OLED technology.If all that wasn't enough, the 65Z9D also sports the X1 Extreme video processing system and the latest version of Sonys reliable Triluminos wide color technology for unlocking the extended color spectrums associated with HDR sources a must-have if you want to get the most from your movie collection.Read the full review: Sony XBR-65Z9D 7.The best entry-level OLED: LG OLEDB7 Series LG's entry level OLEDs continue to impress 55-inch: LG OLED55B7V | 65-inch: LG OLED65B7V Excellent all-round image quality Complete HDR support Great smart platform No Dolby Atmos passthrough Mediocre onboard audio LG's 'B' line of OLEDs has consistently offered a great entry point into the display technology without compromising on what makes it so exciting.And the B7 series is no different.Contained within the TVs is exactly the same panel that's powering the more expensive C7 , E7 and yes even the W7 LG televisions, which means an exceptional bump over last year's OLED panels at a much lower price.So where has LG saved the money?In a word, sound.The B7's downward firing speakers are the worst all the company's OLED TVs.Not only that, but the set is also currently unable to pass Dolby Atmos to an external sound system over HDMI (although a firmware update to fix this is on the way).If however, you're content to put up with a standard surround sound experience, then the B7 is a fantastic entryway into a piece of TV tech that still feels futuristic in 2017.Read the full review: LG OLED B7 8.For great-value HDR: Sony BRAVIA XBR-X850E Series 4K HDR TV that doesnt destroy your bank account 55-inch: Sony XBR-55X850E | 65-inch: Sony XBR-65X850E Great value Good HDR pictures HDR isnt very bright Android TV is frustrating By introducing its exceptional X1 video processor further down its TV range than ever before and being brave enough to dial down the brightness a bit to deliver a more even, immersive backlight experience, Sony's struck mid-range gold with the X850E Series.While it's not the brightest or most colorful TV on the list, the simple fact is that few TVs weve seen in recent times have balanced price, contrast, brightness and color quite so all-round effectively as the 65X850E.If you're looking for a great TV that doesn't destroy the bank account, Sony's X850E series is the clear winner.Read the full review: Sony XBR-65X850E 9.For the best black levels: LG OLEDE7 series OLED isn't done getting better just yet 55-inch: LG OLED55E7 | 65-inch: LG OLED65E7 Gorgeous picture quality Thinness of OLED Minor picture noise problems LCD TVs are still brighter overall Thanks to the thinness the technology affords, OLED televisions often look striking, but LG's OLEDE7's 'picture on glass' design looks especially fantastic.Sure, the E7 might not have the same sexy allure as LG's flagship from this year, the crazy-expensive OLED W7 , but frankly the E7 offers a very similar level of quality at a much lower price.It still looks great, it's still packing Dolby Atmos, and although it can't boast the wallpaper thinness of the W7, it's not far off.If you want almost all the high-end features LG's OLED series have to offer without taking out a second mortgage on your home, the E7 OLED is a worthwhile, cost-effective addition to any home theater.Read the full review: LG OLED E7 10.The best budget QLED: Samsung Q7F QLED TV Samsungs entry-level QLED TV really shines 65-inch: Samsung QE65Q7FAM Gorgeous colors Unprecedented brightness Amazing upscaling Poor black levels Apps hang periodically QLED is delivering on Samsungs promise of better, brighter screens at a more affordable price, with the Samsung Q7F leading the charge as the manufacturers entry-level set.Unfortunately, though, the Samsung Q7F QLED is an extraordinary TV hindered by ordinary issues.Its one of the brightest, most colorful and we daresay one of the most enjoyable TVs to watch from Samsung in 2017.And while it would be nice to unequivocally recommend it, some damning black level performance, issues with off-axis viewing, audio and operating system performance keep on the most beautiful TVs from being one of this years best.Read the full review: Samsung Q7F QLED TV

spectacular 4K and HDR impact.58-inch: Panasonic TX-58DX902B | 65-inch: Panasonic TX-65DX902B Bright, contrast-rich pictures Clever and usually effective local dimming technology Chunky bodywork Some motion blur Panasonic was so obsessed with nailing high dynamic range picture quality on its flagship 4K TV series for 2016 that it came up with an all-new 'honeycomb' LCD panel technology.This puts physical dividers between the areas of the different 'zones' of picture illuminated by its direct-lit backlight system to cut down on the usual LCD problems of backlight clouding around bright HDR objects, and even introduces a new diffuser filter to try and stop the light 'breaks' between different LED zones looking too obvious.Even this doesn't completely solve LED's light control issues with very extreme HDR content, but it certainly does enable the TV to deliver picture quality with HDR sources that for the majority of the time are second only to Samsung's KS9500 TVs for their combination of dynamism, detailing and sheer spectacle - and the DX902s cost hundreds of pounds less than their Samsung rivals.Read the full review: Panasonic DX902 6.LG OLED B7 Series LG's entry

audio LG's 'B' line of OLEDs has consistently offered a great entry point into the display technology without compromising on what makes it so exciting.The B7 series is no different.Contained within the TVs is exactly the same panel that's powering the more expensive C7, E7 and yes even the W7 LG televisions, which means an exceptional bump over last year's OLED panels at a much lower price.So where has LG saved the money?In a word, sound.The B7's downward firing speakers are the worst all the company's OLED TVs.Not only that, but the set is also currently unable to pass Dolby Atmos to an external sound system over HDMI (although a firmware update to fix this is on the way).If however, you're content to put up with a standard surround sound experience, then the B7 is a fantastic entryway into a piece of TV tech that still feels futuristic in 2017.Read the full review: LG OLED B7 7.Panasonic EZ1002 OLED Panasonics flagship TV takes OLED to another level 65-inch: Panasonic TX-65EZ1002 Stunning contrast performance Unprecedented colour accuracy No Dolby Vision support Some occasional vertical banding With a price tag of nigh 6,000, the 65EZ1002 needs to be special.Fortunately, it is.By implementing a number of features usually reserved for the professional mastering monitor world, Panas flagship OLED is able to deliver the most consistently beautiful and accurate pictures seen to date, with both HDR and SDR sources.It also offers a highly effective smart system, and a strong audio performance from its built-in soundbar.For AV enthusiasts keen to reproduce their favourite directors vision at home with no expenses spared, the 65EZ1002 is simply as good as it gets.8.Philips 65PUS7601 Brilliant backlight controls make this surprisingly affordable Philips 4K TV one of the year's most pleasant surprises.65-inch: Philips 65PUS7601 Excellent backlight control Great price for the picture quality on offer Complicated picture set up Android TV interface is clunky and impersonal On paper the 65PUS7601's pictures shouldn't really work.It only delivers 700 nits of brightness versus the 1000 nits we're seeing from the highest-level TVs this year, and it only hits around 76% of the expanded 'DCI-P3' colour range usually considered necessary for a premium HDR experience.The reality of watching the 65PUS7601, however, is that once you've wrestled with a rather complicated picture set up system it produces one of the most immersive and spectacular pictures the TV world has to offer.Particularly key to its success is its direct LED backlight system, which manages to deliver a good (albeit not full) sense of HDR without causing nearly as many backlight clouding distractions as any of its more extravagantly bright rivals.The 65PUS7601 does this, moreover, while also giving you the hundreds of apps available via Google's Android TV smart platform and costing many hundreds of pounds less than other direct-lit 4K rivals like the Panasonic DX902s and Samsung KS9500s.Read the full review: Philips 65PUS7670 9.Sony XE93 series Bright HDR images and rich colors make this set one worth considering 55-inch: Sony KD-55XE9305 | 65-inch: Sony KD-65XE9305 Bright HDR with rich colors Great HD upscaling Issues with blooming around bright objects Sluggish interface The Sony XE93 range is the more premium range that sits alongside the XE90 above and it's certainly a more ambitious set.The XE93 features a Sony innovation known as 'slim backlight drive' which attempts to deliver areas of concentrated light in the screen while maintaining a slim form-factor.For the most part this system performs admirably, and creates fantastically bright images that have real punch and intensity to them.But the system does have it's issues with keeping this brightness to the bright areas of the image, where it can occasionally see this light 'bleed' out into darker parts of the image.Thankfully this set is also no slouch in the sound department; it's happily one of the better sounding TVs out there.So the XE93 is a great looking set, but while it may be much more premium than the XE90 listed above, it doesn't quite go all the way in justifying its increased cost.Read the full review: Sony 55XE93 or the Sony 65XE93 10.Panasonic DX750 range An eye-catchingly affordable way to bag yourself outstanding 4K standard dynamic range and decent HDR pictures.50-inch: Panasonic TX-50DX750B | 58-inch: Panasonic TX-58DX750B | 65-inch: Panasonic TX-65DX750B Good all-round picture quality Friendly smart TV interface Some backlight concerns with HDR Only gives a watered down HDR experience The Panasonic DX750s are some of the cheapest TVs around to offer both 4K and HDR playback.Yet despite their affordability they are also very likeable performers.In fact, with the standard dynamic range sources we still spend the vast majority of our time watching they're nothign short of excellent thanks to their winning combination of 4K sharpness, strong contrast and natural, nuanced colour tones.With HDR the situation is a little less emphatic, as the screen doesn't have the colour or brightness range to provide a truly full blooded HDR performance.There are various occasional backlight distractions with HDR playback too that you have to work hard in the set up menus to try and minimise.Actually, though, for most of the time the DX750s still look good with HDR and deliver at least a flavour of the extra colour and light dynamics that make it so special.Add to all this Panasonic's friendly, customisable Firefox TV smart engine and you've got a TV range that offers fearsome amounts of bang for your buck.Read the full review: Panasonic DX750
The best free website builder 2017:::::Creating a website used to be the domain (geddit?)of professional designers and coders, but thanks to free website builders, these days it's something anyone can tackle.The problem is that there are so many website creation applications and services vying for attention that it can be difficult to know which one to opt for this is where we can help.We've collated the very best free website builders available, including a mixture of offline software and online tools.It's usually quicker, easier and more efficient to create and edit a site entirely online with a WYSIWYG editor, but if you want complete control over every aspect of your site's design and hosting, you'll need a desktop-based free website builder.So whether you're looking to create a site for your business, a new blog or you just fancy creating an online presence for yourself, here are the best website builders to help you out.If you want to create a website as quickly as possible, look no further than Wix.It's so easy to use, you'll have a great-looking site online in mere minutes The easiest way to build a website, with a wizard and a WYSIWYG editor Wix offers you two ways to build your website.Both involve creating it online, and both are as quick and painless as possible.The simplest option is to use the Wix ADI (Artificial Design Intelligence) website builder which will guide you through a series of questions before automatically creating a site for you.There is scope for customization, but the focus here is really on fast results for anyone who is terrified of designing websites.A more hands-on approach is available if you decide to use the standard Wix Editor.There are literally hundreds of stylish templates to choose from -- and, yes, they are genuinely impressive which you can tweak and tailor to your needs using a beautiful WYSIWYG editor.Despite being a cloud-based website builder, Wix gives you a great degree of control over the look of your site and placement of page elements.You can also liven it up using the App Market to add features such as a newsletter and live chat.This power and flexibility make Wix the best free website builder around for creating your own site.WordPress is the tool for choice for many blog owners.It takes a little getting used to, but once you've mastered it, you'll love its flexibility Wordpress is ideal for static sites, portfolios, online stores and blogs Causing a slight degree of confusion, there are actually two different versions of WordPress.The more complex version can be downloaded from wordpress.org, and you will need to upload it to your own web space and install it using the automated online installer.You can then customize the templates and use add-ons to make the site your own.This is the route many bloggers go down, but there is a simpler option for people who dont want the hassle of fiddling about with scripts and getting dirty with hardcore editing.The hosted version of WordPress lets you create your own site on wordpress.com.You can create everything from a blog or photo site, to a fully fledged online store, and there are a number of templates to choose from.Whether you're creating a static site, or a blog-style site with regularly updated content, the online editor is a joy to use and allows just about anyone to create an impressive, professional-looking site.With the only downside is the limited range of plugins and templates compared with the desktop website builder.WebSite X5 makes building a website on your desktop easy, with good looking templates and an intuitive site builder A flexible desktop website builder, free exclusively for TechRadar readers Incomedia WebSite X5 normally sells for 14.90 (about US$20/AU$25), but it's free to download for TechRadar readers.Unlike WordPress and Wix, WebSite X5 is a desktop website builder, which means you can work on your site offline and have more freedom to make your site look exactly the way you want.There's a range of ready-made templates to choose from, or you can create your own design from scratch.Next, build up your site map, showing the hierarchy of your pages and how they connect to one another a feature you won't find in most web-based site builders.Once that's done, you're ready to start building your pages using Website X5's simple drag-and-drop interface, which includes tools for editing both rich text and photos.If you don't want to be tied down to an online site builder, WebSite X5 is the tool for you.CoffeeCup Free HTML Editor isn't a WYSIWYG website builder, but it provides a live preview of your site as you write it Ideal for hand-coding, Free HTML Editor is packed with time-saving extras CoffeeCup Free HTML Editor is one of a dying breed of web building programs that don't use a CMS (content management system).While not in the same league as the likes of Adobe Dreamweaver, Free HTML Editor packs quite a professional punch.With split screen code/preview views, it's possible to see the effect the changes you make have straight away.To help you get started quickly, there are a number of templates built into the program, and there are some very nice features such as tag and code suggestions as you type.For absolute beginners the program might seem a little overwhelming to start with, but it's worth sticking with it assuming you have some HTML knowledge.There is one slight issue; a number of features, such as spell-checking and code optimisation, are only included in the paid-for version of the program.If you've used WordPress before, you might be interested in the most powerful Joomla.It's not as easy to use though, so beginners are better off sticking with a simpler option like Wix Another free website builder with online and offline versions Joomla is a well-known name in the CMS world.It may not be as popular as WordPress, but it offers the same two options: build a site using the web app at joomla.com and having it hosted on the company's servers, or download the software from joomla.org and host it yourself.If you choose the latter option, you'll notice that the interface is much less approachable than WordPress.It's not completely impenetrable, but there are lots of menus and options to work through and it doesn't feel quite as polished as WordPress.Joomla's online website builder is nearly as complex, but doesn't involve the same setup process, making it a bette option for beginners.Its key selling point is its huge collection of themes and extensions, which provide endless ways to customize the way your site looks and works.
The best free data recovery software 2017:::::Discovering that you've lost data without backing it up can be heart-stopping, but it isn't necessarily the end of the world.With the best free backup software and a little patience, there's a good chance that you'll be able to restore your precious data whether it's an individual file or an entire partition.Perhaps most importantly, you will probably be able to do it for free rather than having to pay a small fortune to call in the experts.It's important to install a data recovery tool now, before you've lost any files; installing one after the event risks overwriting the data you've lost.There's no guarantee that your lost data will be recoverable, but this free software will give you the best possible chance Flexible free data recovery software for any emergency Automatic or manual scans Clear interface Data quality indicators One of the best things about Piriform Recuva is the wealth of ways to use it: manual scanning, wizard-driven scanning, and via the context menu.For anyone who feels as though they need a little help using the software, the wizard on hand to provide guidance, but there is also the option of taking manual control of the scanning and recovery process.The scan can be customized to look in particular locations, or for particular types of files, and Recuva uses a traffic light guide to how likely it is that you'll be able to recover an item intact.You also have the option of right clicking a folder or the Recycle Bin if you know you have deleted a file from a particular location.It's all very easy, and the results speak for themselves.Upgrading to Recuva Professional for US$19.95/19.95/AU$24.95 adds the ability to work with virtual hard drives, access to premium support, and automatic software updates.These are nice additions, but the free version of Recuva will be plenty of most users.Intuitive data recovery software to get you out of sticky situations Clear interface Convenient filters Data quality indicators When it comes to ease of use, it's hard to beat Wise Data Recovery.Although this free data recover software doesn't have a wizard-led interface, there are no complicated configuration settings to worry about either.Tracking down recoverable data is a simple matter of selecting the drive you want to check and clicking 'Scan'.Alternatively, you can use keywords to search for recoverable files so you dont have to wade through quite so many results.Whichever route you choose, recoverable data is presented in an Explorer-like tree structure that makes it easy to tell where it was originally stored.Like all the best free data recovery software, Wise Data Recovery uses a traffic light system to indicate the health of files (and therefore how likely it is that you'll be able to recover them intact, and there's a file preview feature so you can identify files that have been detected.You can recover individual files, or entire folders at once, but selecting numerous files in several locations means performing several operations.Recover data from lost partitions if the interface doesn't put you off Can recover lost partitions Can save data to a networked drive Interface may be intimidating PC Inspector File Recovery goes further than many data recovery tools in that it will detect partitions that have been lost, even if the boot sector or file system has been damaged or deleted.This could be a real life-saver in an emergency, potentially helping you get data back even if your hard drive is not visible within Windows.Beginners might find the terminology and design of PC Inspector File Recovery intimidating, and even some more advanced users may find the workflow a little confusing to start with.Take some time to learn your way around it, and you'll find a powerful data recovery program but one that seems to get better results with FAT and FAT32 drives.Data recovery made easy, provided it's under 2TB Simple to use Convenient searchable results Only recovers 2GB data Finding recoverable data with EaseUS Data Recovery Wizard Free is very simple: select a drive or folder and wait for a few minutes while it completes its scan.You can browse through the recoverable data using a Windows Explorer style interface and filter them by type or opt to search for specific files.Data recovery is effective, but the Deep Scan option is very slow, so you'll need to be patient.The installation of this software is a mixed experience.The installer, importantly, advises not to install to the same drive that you want to recover data from because this could overwrite data and render it unrecoverable.It also, sadly, tries to enrol you in a customer experience improvement program, without explaining what this entails.It's worth noting that the free version only allows for the recovery of up to 2GB of data, so it's not going to be suitable for all circumstances, but it will be enough to get you out of most sticky situations.A powerful and flexible data two-part recovery toolkit Recover partitions and files Cross-platform TestDisk has no graphical interface Presented as a pair of tools rather than a single integrated solution, TestDisk and PhotoRec together can recover data from both lost partitions and files.TestDisk takes care of the partition side of things.The fact that it's a command line tool with no graphical interface might off-putting at first.If can set this to one side though, there's help on hand to guide you through the process of working with your drives.TestDisk offers support for so many file systems, it should cater for most eventualities.PhotoRec is the component for recovering files.It's available with a command lint interface, but unlike TestDisk there's also a GUI for less confident users.It may not be as intuitive as some of the other recovery software in this listing, but it's effective.PhotoRec is cross-platform and can be run as a portable app from a USB stick, which means you don't have to install it on your PC and risk accidentally overwriting the data you want to recover.

there are plenty of deals out there where you get calls and texts as well for less money.Barmy but true.View this data only SIM deal from Three Should I go SIM only?If you a) want to save some money; b) don't want to be tied into a lengthy contract; or c) both of the above, then SIM only is well worth considering.In fact, you're probably one of two people if your thoughts are indeed turning to SIM only: You're coming to the end of your contract and your network is calling you a million times a day to get you to upgrade.Well if your phone is dying a death or you just fancy a change, head to our best mobile phones deal page to see what bargains are lurking, but otherwise going SIM only on your current phone is a no-brainer.You'll wind up paying much less than you are under contract, and you can stick to a rolling 30 day contract so that if your circumstances change, you can get out of the arrangement tout suite.It's time for a shiny new smartphone and you want to get the best value humanly possible.You'll have to find a few hundred quid up front for the handset (be sure to check our SIM free comparison chart) but box clever and you'll end up paying less over the next 24 months (see below).Plus, if you're a commitment-phobe, most SIM-only plans don't require you to sign up for two years like you would with a normal contract.Is SIM only cheaper than contract?It can be.Teaming a SIM only plan with a standalone SIM-free handset could save you a few quid.It's usually the case when a flagship phone hits the market and contracts are made deliberately expensive.Take the Samsung Galaxy S8 as a prime example, where you could have saved over 100 over two years by splashing the 800-odd for the handset and slipping in a cheap SIM card.Not all the savings you can make are as extravagant, and on big data it's frequently more cost effective to dive into a contract instead.But if you can afford to splash a few hundred pounds up front then the savings over the next couple of years could well be worth it - especially if you can bag a bargain on Black Friday 2017.Is my phone unlocked - can I use a new SIM in it?The times have passed since most phones were locked to a network and you had to pay a dodgy backstreet 'engineer' to unlock it.Nowadays, it's standard practice for networks to let you use whatever SIM you want in the phone as soon as you've paid up the original contract (or earlier if you pay them a fee) - and Three ships all its handsets unlocked from the outset.The exception, alas, is Apple iPhones.They're generally sold locked to the original network that you purchase them with for the life of the handset.Very frustrating if you're looking for a tasty SIM only deal once your 24 month sentence is up.The good news is that your iPhone (or any other mobile before the end of your contract) can be unlocked - the bad news is that most networks make you pay for the privilege.Insert a friend or family member's SIM into your phone to see whether it's already unlocked and, if it isn't, look for your network below to see how to cut ties with them: EE Once six months have gone by on your contract, you can call EE on 0800 956 6000 and pay them 8.99 to unlock your phone.It says it will take around 10 days to complete.PAYG phones can be unlocked for free.Once six months have gone by on your contract, you can call EE on 0800 956 6000 and pay them 8.99 to unlock your phone.It says it will take around 10 days to complete.PAYG phones can be unlocked for free.O2 As long as you don't own a Samsung Galaxy S8 or S8 Plus (they can't be unlocked until you've paid off your contract), you can unlock any O2 phone -

the iPhone 5 was Apple's first mobile with a nano SIM, while Samsung began using the smallest size in its Galaxy S6.Before you purchase your new SIM, double-check the manufacturer's website to see what size you require.And if you're simply not sure, most networks now simply send out a triple SIM, so you'll get one of each size.How do I keep my old number?Ever heard of PAC codes and wondered what a classic 80s arcade game had to do with telephone numbers?It actually stands for Porting Authorisation Code, and it's the set of digits that you need to grab from your old network to let you transfer over your existing mobile number.If you're on one of the major networks, you can see what phone number you can contact them on here: EE 07953 966 250 07953 966 250 O2 0344 8090202 0344 8090202 Vodafone 03333 040 191 03333 040 191 Three 0333 300 3333 0333 300 3333 ID 0333 003 7777 0333 003 7777 GiffGaff 43431 from your handset 43431 from your handset Virgin 0345 6000 789 0345 6000 789 BT 0800 800 150 0800 800 150 Tesco 0345 301 4455 0345 301 4455 Sky 03300 412 524 03300 412 524 Asda 0800 079 2732 If you want to grab a bargain SIM only plan above, but it's on your existing network then your network won't release a PAC code and you'll be forced to take a new phone number.At least you would have, if it wasn't for this clever (if convoluted) work-around.You have to order a free pay-as-you-go SIM from another network.Once you have it, you can tell your old network that you're moving and they'll give you that precious PAC code.Then, once your number is registered to the substitute network, simply get another PAC code from them.Take that to your old network, and they'll move your number to your new contract.Simple - kind of!What contract length should I get?Unlike with a contract, there's a lot more flexibility available when it comes to how long your SIM only plan will last.Two year commitments are virtually unheard of, with the norm being either one year or rolling one month contracts for ultimate flexibility.You can often get better prices if you tie yourself in for 12 months, especially on larger data tariffs.But sticking to one month at a time means that you can effectively hand pick a new plan to suit you every 30 days or so.How much data do I need?Because you can change your plan up more regularly than a normal, lengthier contract, it's less crucial to get this nailed from the start.But if you're thinking of grabbing a 12-monther or just put a personal pride on getting things right first time, then we'll help you pick out the sweet spot of data for you.Firstly, check your phone to see how much data you've been using to date, and whether you have the tendency to use more than your current allowance every month.Then, if you're still unsure, check out our guidance: 0-1GB Tiny amounts of data on SIM only deals could be a blessing or a curse.If you're putting it in a rarely used phone that will scarcely be away from wi-fi then you're quids in.But if you end up with one because your head's turned by the incredible price, then you could end up paying more if you continually go over your allowance.Tiny amounts of data on SIM only deals could be a blessing or a curse.If you're putting it in a rarely used phone that will scarcely be away from wi-fi then you're quids in.But if you end up with one because your head's turned by the incredible price, then you could end up paying more if you continually go over your allowance.2-3GB For anybody who needs data for little more than the occasional Google Maps route planning, 2GB and 3GB plans come cheap and give you much more freedom to check the football scores and scroll Facebook away from the wi-fi without danger.For anybody who needs data for little more than the occasional Google Maps route planning, 2GB and 3GB plans come cheap and give you much more freedom to check the football scores and scroll Facebook away from the wi-fi without danger.4-8GB If you can't leave the house without having a music streaming service like Spotify pouring into your ears, then it might be worth paying for some extra GBs of data.If you can't leave the house without having a music streaming service like Spotify pouring into your ears, then it might be worth paying for some extra GBs of data.10-16GB This is a significant amount of data and some networks offer it for a very appetising price.Whether streaming music, downloading podcasts, watching social media videos, or all three is your thing -

it's human nature to want 'unlimited' anything if offered.But you should think genuinely about whether you really need it in a world where the likes of WhatsApp and Skype let you call and text for free over wi-fi or 4G.If you decide that a few thousand monthly minutes and texts should do you, then you could shave off some cash from your bill.What's the best mobile network for SIM only?While EE, O2, Vodafone and Three are generally considered the major four networks for contract plans, when it comes to SIM only there are some other key players are well worth a look.See what we think of them below, and whether you'll get any free perks to help persuade you to sign up.Plus, we'll tell you about a couple of other SIM sellers that might be able to wrangle you an even better deal.EE SIM only deals If you want fast and furious 4G, then your choice has to be an EE SIM only deal.Its speeds are around 50% faster than the other major networks, which is really noticeable if you like watching films or football on the move.And EE gives you three free months of BT Sport, as well as six months of Apple Music.View all: EE SIM only deals O2 SIM only deals O2's best claim for your contract is with its Priority rewards -

Nvidia teases a new Titan X Collector’s Edition graphics card:::::Nvidia continues to surprise us with new graphics cards, and today it just released a teaser for a new Titan X Collectors Edition.Although Nvidia only offered up an extremely short 13-second video, seen below, weve nevertheless scrubbed through it frame by frame for juicy tidbits.Theres no mention of specs, much less anything, but we do see this collectors edition card sporting a new reference design from Nvidia.It appears to be much more linear and industrial.Whats more, it appears that Nvidias next design for its best graphics cards will include more lighting with a green light clearly illuminating the graphics cards vapor chamber and heatsink fin array that will still sit beneath a small acrylic window.Interestingly, it looks like the lighting could be customizable, as in one frame of the video theres a second glowing red graphics card opposite of the Titan X Collectors Edition.This could just be symbolism of the eternal struggle between Nvidia and AMD, but the team red does not produce a part that looks anything like whats in the video.Image 1 of 2 What could be customizable lighting Image 2 of 2 A closer look at the acrylic fan cover?It also seems like the fan on this new GPU will also stick out from the frame with its own acrylic element, but the short glimpse of it is heavily shrouded in darkness.Its possible that Nvidia will announce the Titan X Collectors Edition at CES 2018 , especially considering it has a scheduled keynote at the show.Strap in, because Titan X Collector's Edition could well be the design we see on the component makers forthcoming, next-generation Volta architecture .
Best gaming monitor 2017: the top 10 gaming screens of the year:::::When you dont have one of the best gaming monitors, video games are just games.So, without one of these amazing displays, you you just wont be able to experience PC games the way they were intended.However, not every display is ideal for every system.While some of the best gaming monitors are 1080p, 60Hz and ready for mid-range parts, high-end enthusiasts will demand more pixels and frames from their displays.When you start talking about genres, high-speed shooters are going to demand high refresh rates and low response times, if your aim is to top those scoreboards.Thats where monitors like the curved Samsung CFG70 really shine.Otherwise, so long as your system is equipped with high end components like the best graphics cards and processors, you might prefer a 4K, Ultra HD gaming monitor that prioritizes image clarity.So, with the best gaming PC on-hand, youll obviously need the best gaming monitor to go along with it, in order to really test the limits of your rigs hardware.From 4K monitors and ultra-wide displays to blazing fast monitors with high refresh rates and little to no input lag, weve found the best of the best.Youll find our list of the best monitors below, but first, let us help you figure out how to decide on what panel is right for you.How to buy the best gaming monitor in 2017 When you are shopping for the best gaming monitor 2017 has to offer, there are a few things that you should consider before you decide on what display should grace your desk.By studying the following terms and specifications, you can make sure you pick the best gaming monitor for your needs which also means you're not paying extra for additional features that you dont need.Screen size: When shopping for the best gaming monitor, one of the most crucial things to think about is screen size.Larger display sizes can contribute to more immersive gaming experiences, as the game fills more of your field of vision, but you'll need to make sure you have the room to feature a large monitor.It also goes without saying that larger monitors will usually mean a higher price.Aspect ratio: The aspect ratio of a gaming monitor determines the width and height of the screen.Most widescreen monitors have an aspect ratio of 16:9, while older monitors had a more square 4:3, which will likely look pretty outdated in 2017.Ultra-wide monitors with aspect ratios of 21:9 are quickly gaining prevalence they offer a wide view of your games, and many ultra wides have made our list of the best gaming monitor 2017.Resolution: Another important factor when looking for the best gaming monitor for your needs is resolution.Here, the higher the numbers, the sharper the picture.. You will, however, need a more powerful graphics card for anything over full HD (1,920 x 1,080), even if many gaming monitors feature resolutions as high as 2,560 x 1,400 (WQHD) and 3,840 x 2,160 (4K).Refresh rate: When youre looking to primarily play Counter-Strike, or shooters like it, refresh rate is especially important.The higher the refresh rate, the more frames per second (fps) it can support, which lends to a smoother experience on high-refresh-rate displays.A 60Hz refresh rate is most common, with refresh rates rising to 144Hz and even 200Hz.Response time: The best gaming monitors have low response times, which means the action remains fast and fluid, with little to no input lag.The lowest response time for TN monitors (we explain this in the next section) is 1 millisecond, whereas the newer IPS monitors usually have more delayed, 4ms response times.When youre playing games competitively, its crucial to keep this number as low as possible in order to combat lag.Panel type: This is where things get a little technical.The type of panel the gaming monitor uses will largely contribute to its response time and image clarity.TN panels (twisted nematic) have the lowest response times, and they are usually cheaper as well, but they generally dont have great viewing angles.IPS panels (in-plane switching) have fantastic viewing angles and color reproduction, but usually higher response times.Meanwhile VA panels (vertical alignment) sit between the two, though the slow response times makes these panels rare amid the best gaming monitors.Viewing Angle: Most people play games while positioned in front of their gaming monitor, but this may not always be the case, particularly when youre among spectators.A monitors viewing angles tell you what angle you can look at the monitor from and still clearly make out the image.The closer these numbers are are to 180, the better your viewing experience will be when standing further to either side of the monitor or looking at it from above or below.G-Sync and FreeSync: You'll likely notice that many of the best gaming monitors in 2017 come with either G-Sync or FreeSync technology sometimes both.This helps keep frames per second (fps) smooth, combats screen tearing and diminishes input lag.G-Sync is developed by Nvidia, so you'll need an Nvidia GPU, and the tech is built into the monitor, which can bump up their price tag.Meanwhile FreeSync was developed by AMD but, as it is free to use by manufacturers, the monitors usually cost less.Best gaming monitor 2017 Now that you know what to look for, here's our list of the best gaming monitors in 2017.This list is constantly being updated with newly reviewed products, so you can rest assured that we're recommending only the very best gaming monitors for your needs.1.AOC Agon AG352UCG A curvy ultrawide that even has G-Sync Screen size: 35-inch | Aspect ratio: 21:9 | Resolution: 3,440 x 1,440 | Brightness: 300 cd/m2 | Response time: 4ms | Viewing

panel that prides itself on its stately 3,440 x 1,440 resolution and G-Sync capabilities, making it our top choice for the best gaming monitor in 2017.This means when paired with an Nvidia graphics card, this monitor uses G-Sync to eliminate screen tearing without adding stress to your PC hardware.Whats more, you can expect better response times from the AOC Agon than with its closest competitors, meaning lower latency in games like Overwatch or Lawbreakers that rely on faster pacing.The only downsides are that the AOC Agon is rather bulky and quite pricey as well.Weighing in at 26 pounds (11.8kg) total, youll want to be sure your desk can support it.Read the full review: AOC Agon AG352UCG 2.BenQ PD3200U A large 4K screen for your desk Screen Size: 32-inch | Aspect Ratio: 16:9 |

Inexpensive relatively Design is a little bland Professional tools are niche Takes up a lot of space The BenQ PD3200U might be primarily aimed at business and CAD professionals, but that doesnt mean it doesnt have anything to offer people who want one of the best gaming monitors.Because of its focus on graphic design and business, its able to offer simply phenomenal viewing angles, meaning that no matter where youre sitting, or where your spectators are, youll be able to get immersed in the action.Plus, unlike many 4K monitors, you dont have to mess around with the settings in order to get the best picture possible every single unit is individually calibrated and prepared by BenQ before its shipped.All of this culminates in the fact that at under 800 bucks for a 32-inch 4K monitor, its one of the most inexpensive ways to get into 4K gaming without sacrificing utility to a smaller 4K display.Read the full review: BenQ PD3200U 3.Asus MG248Q A budget monitor with 144Hz and Adaptive Sync Screen size: 23.6-inch | Aspect ratio: 16:9 | Resolution: 1,920 x 1,080 | Brightness: 350 cd/m2 | Response time: 1ms | Viewing angle: 170/160 | Contrast ratio: 1 million:1 | Color support: SRGB 100%, Adobe RGB 72% | Weight: 16.98 pounds 144Hz refresh rate 1ms response time TN panel Adaptive Sync for AMD, Intel only If you're looking for a budget gaming monitor, and don't mind making a few compromises (it features a 1080p resolution and twisted-nematic, or TN, panel rather than IPS), then you'll be very pleased with the Asus MG248Q.It makes up for any shortcomings with lightning fast response times and Adaptive Sync, making this the best budget gaming monitor in 2017.Adaptive Sync is of interest to gamers, as it reduces screen tearing if you have an AMD graphics card, a clear demonstration that the MG248Q tailors to the budget gamer.On the other hand, even Nvidia fans can rejoice at the 144Hz refresh rate.But, without the right GPU equipped, you might be better off saving for the G-Sync equivalent Asus ROG Swift PG248Q.Read the full review: Asus MG248Q 4.BenQ Zowie XL2540 A monitor tailored to the needs of professional gamers Screen size: 24-inch | Aspect ratio: 16:9 |

Expensive Limited appeal beyond pro gamers You might not believe it at first glance, but the BenQ Zowie XL2540 is every bit the gaming monitor that the other monitors on this list are.And though it may not seem it from the outside looking in, it does its job remarkably well too, sacrificing dazzling lighting effects for a zippy 240Hz refresh rate and nigh-instantaneous 1ms response time.Theres no G-Sync or FreeSync, as this monitor assumes you already have a rig thats plenty capable of eliminating screen tears on its own.Instead, this monitor keeps it simple by supplying you with lots of visual presets, an S Switch control pod for managing those presets and even a pair of adjustable light screens.If you're a professional gamer, then this is the best gaming monitor for you.Read the full review: BenQ Zowie XL2540 5.Samsung CHG90 QLED The widest ultra-wide Screen Size: 49-inch | Aspect Ratio: 32:9 | Resolution: 3,840 x 1080 | Viewing Angle: 178/178 | Contrast Ratio: 3,000:1 | Color Support: N/A | Weight: 33 lbs Flawless image quality Impressive Color reproduction Smooth 144Hz refresh rate Expensive Only 1080p vertically With this display, Samsung not only brings QLED to gaming monitors in a big way, but they also offer the widest ultra-wide monitor on the market today.Coming in at 49.5 inches, this behemoth will take up a lot of space, likely peeping over the sides of your desk, but with its impressive 3,840 x 1080 resolution and HDR, youll at least be blown away by the image.Even if you decide not to play in this resolution (it will require a beefy rig), you can still use all of the extra screen real estate to have a browser or a movie playing on the same screen.The only real drawback is the monstrous price tag.But for a display this premium, it may very well be worth it.Read the full review: Samsung CHG90 QLED 6.Alienware 25 FreeSync, G-Sync and everything in between Screen size: 24.5-inch | Aspect ratio: 16:9 | Resolution: 1,920 x 1,080 |

thing you can say about the Alienware 25 gaming monitor is that it wont discriminate against your PC.Although its often the case that gaming monitors support Nvidia G-Sync or AMD FreeSync, not both, to eliminate screen tearing, the Alienware 25 can be configured either way.That comes in handy, even if its more expensive for the Nvidia model.Still, the Alienware 25 isnt entirely function over form.Instead, it boasts a strikingly exotic design, complete with the AlienFX RGB lighting weve all come to expect from the Dell subsidiary.And if thats not enough to sell you on the Alienware 25, it wields a buttery smooth 240Hz refresh rate that will push any stout rig to its limits.Read the full review: Alienware 25 7.Asus ROG Swift PG248Q Faster than you can say G-Sync Screen size: 24-inch | Aspect ratio: 16:9 | Resolution: 1,920 x 1,080 | Brightness: 350 cd/m2 | Response time: 1ms | Viewing angle: 170/160 | Contrast ratio: 1,000:1 | Colour support: Adobe RGB 74% | Weight: 9.5kg Cheapest G-Sync display on the market Amazing 180Hz refresh rate Just two display inputs Only 24 inches If you care more about frame rate than graphics or resolution, this one's for you.Because of its very impressive 180Hz refresh rate, the Asus ROG Swift PG248Q takes the 60fps gold standard for gaming and triples it provided you're equipped with a rig that can handle the extra stress.While you're unlikely to enjoy Forza Horizon 3 at 180fps on Ultra settings given its high demand, a higher refresh rate is more than welcome in fast-paced, competitive games that don't necessarily depend on a wealth of resources.Plus, as one of the most affordable G-Sync displays on the market, it helps that you can rely on the monitor to prevent screen tearing, too.Read the full review: Asus ROG Swift

equipped with AMD FreeSync for screen tear elimination and a 21:9 aspect ratio best suited for games and cinema.Despite the resolution being lower than a lot of other widescreen displays on the market, theres no denying that the LG 34UC79G-B pulls off a crisp image nonetheless and with stunning color accuracy at that.Plus, you can change the height, which is more than can be said for even

Best Nintendo 3DS games: 20 titles you should take on the go:::::Though it's been somewhat eclipsed by the impressive new hybrid Switch, the Nintendo 3DS has continued to thrive as an exclusively handheld platform.Though this is in part because Nintendo has committed to keeping the platform alive, it's also because Nintendo has always had impressive degrees of success when it comes to its handheld consoles.The company is able to boast some of the highest handheld sales in history and given the fact that the 3DS has amassed sales of over 67 million on its own, there would be no sense in dropping such a strong hardware safety net just yet.Though production of the new 3DS has now ended, the recent release of the 2DS XL was a reaffirmation of Nintendo's support for the platform.The Nintendo 3DS XL and the new 2DS XL are surprisingly powerful handheld consoles despite their small size.Mobile gaming is increasingly popular and though Nintendo is entering into this market itself, there's still a large proportion of gamers who are looking for portable games with more depth than you can currently find in the app store.Sure, you can now get Mario on your mobile but if you'd rather have the full Super Mario experience you're still going to have to turn to the 3DS XL.And as much as we love Pokemon Go, we don't want to miss the full experience of Pokmon Sun and Moon.No matter what kind of game you like to play, you'll find something to suit your tastes on the 3DS XL or 2DS XL, and you won't be able to find many of the titles anywhere else.From slow and easygoing life simulators like Animal Crossing, to fast-paced platformers like Super Mario 3D land you're not short of options.Don't forget given the console's age you're always likely to find good titles in summer sales as well as during Black Friday.No 3DS?Check out our guide to the best New 3DS and New 3DS XL deals So read on for the 20 best 3DS games, or if you're looking to dip your toe into the more retro DS library, then check out our list of the best Nintendo DS games .
The 21 best Nintendo DS games: all the titles you absolutely need to revisit:::::We hope you've got the candles ready the Nintendo DS is about to enter its teenage years.Yes, we know, we can't quite believe it either but it really has been over 12 years since Nintendo first launched its dual-screen handheld.Given the number of consoles that have spawned from the original DS the DS Lite, DSi, the 2DS and the 3DS it's safe to say Nintendo's form factor experiment was a success and we're now well accustomed to using a dual-screen.Nintendo has arguably been the leading company in the handheld market since the original Game Boy.Since its success there, it's really only gone from strength to strength with its handhelds.Rather than allowing its success to make it complacent, though, Nintendo has used its position of strength to push boundaries and do more interesting things with its handheld consoles.It's Nintendo's refusal to play it safe that's probably helped it stay so successful in this area.The dual-screen design might have been a risk but it was obviously a worthwhile one since we've seen it evolve and improve from the DS through to the new 3DS.That said, no matter how good a console's design and no matter how many innovations it makes, it won't stand the test of time without good games to keep players interested.That's another big reason the Nintendo DS has been such a success; it has a great, and still playable, selection of games on offer and some of them are now undeniable classics.As good as the DS is, though, by this point the majority of us will no doubt have replaced our Nintendo DS with its chunkier and more powerful successor the Nintendo 3DS.That said, as it's still part of the DS family the new handheld offers full backwards compatibility, giving full access to some unmissable DS titles as well as the greatest titles from the 3DS.Don't worry if you haven't upgraded and still have your original DS, though; we recommend you hold onto it just to make sure you don't miss the chance to play a true classic.To give you a better idea of exactly what games you should be looking to pick up, we've put together this list of what we think are the best titles out there.From excellent original titles such as Pokemon Black and White 2 to classic SNES ports like Kirby Super Star Ultra, you're guaranteed to find something you like.Even though a large number of games available on the Nintendo DS are ports, they're drastically improved and their effective integration of the console's dual-screen helped to redefine the handheld gaming experience.So, rather than wait for Nintendo to continue its relentless march forward with the launch of its game-changing console/hybrid handheld, the Nintendo Switch, we think you should take the chance to pick up these great Nintendo DS titles while you still can.
iPhone X release date, price and features:::::Update: We've now published our full, in-depth look at the hands in our iPhone X review - head over there now to see just how impressive this new handset is (spoiler... it's pretty damn good).Today's iPhone X release date feels like it's been 10 years in the making, as Apple finally launches its long-awaited all-screen smartphone.It's here, but the question we're answering in our full review is: is it with that stunningly high iPhone X price?Now that the November 3 release date is here, we've explored that issue after a great amount of testing.Even for Apple's most loyal fans who have already decided to get iPhone X, there's a big problem - they may not be able to buy it right away.Finding it in stock is going to be extremely difficult today, as iPhone X pre-orders in the US and in the UK sold out in under ten minutes a week ago.We've been testing the iPhone X all week and even have a video of our early thoughts in an ongoing iPhone X diary .Early findings show strong performance for features like Face ID and the impressive nearly bezel-less new screen.Apple promises that the limited supply is the only bad news about the iPhone X, which is pronounced 'iPhone 10', saying it's worth your money and any extra wait time due to its revolutionary new features.This is the phone you want, not the good, but very ordinary iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus.The iPhone X is the flagship phone that takes Apple's 10-year-old smartphone design in a bold new direction.It also leaves behind the familiar physical home button and tried-and-tested fingerprint sensor.Is it worth the high iPhone X price and wait?What are the big features you need to know about?Slide down to unlock the biggest new iPhone answers.iPhone X arrives in stores today, Friday, November 3 Pre-orders began on Friday, October 27 Supply is extremely limited The iPhone X release date was today, Friday, November 3, and pre-orders began last week Friday, October 27, seven days in advance.All of this is later than the usual September launch date for new iPhones.Estimates have put two to three million available for launch, meaning some people may chose the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus out of necessity.The release date delay is being attributed to the Samsung-made OLED screens being in short supply, and recent reports suggest Face ID components may be causing even further delays and stock shortages.Apple denies this, and has only officially stated that the iPhone X was originally slated for 2018. iPhone X was instantly out of stock on pre-order day, and in some parts of the world will be hard to find going into next year.Expect retailers to lure you to their stores with a chance of getting an iPhone X on Black Friday and Cyber Monday.For those living in the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Kuwait or Qatar, iPhone X pre-orders also started on October 27, though the handset will arrive in stores a day later, on November 4. iPhone X price More expensive than any other iPhone 64GB iPhone X: $999, 999, and AU$1,579 256GB iPhone X: $1,149, 1,149, AU$1,829 US carriers are charging $42 a month The iPhone X price starts at $999 / 999 / AU$1,579, which makes it the most expensive iPhone ever made.And that's for the iPhone X with 64GB of storage.You also have to take into account the various models, storage sizes, and, in the US, the sales tax.Buying an iPhone 8 Plus with 256GB of storage will cost over $1,000 in the end.The 64GB iPhone 8 is more prominently advertised as $699.The iPhone X is going to be another jump in price.The 256GB iPhone X will cost $1,149, 1,149, AU$1,829.Sadly, there's no option in between, if you were hoping for a 128GB iPhone X.There just isn't one.It's also available in the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Kuwait and Qatar, with the 64GB iPhone X costing AED/SAR 4099 while the 256GB model is AED/SAR 4729 US carriers like Verizon and AT&T are charging $42 a month for one year and allow you to upgrade to a new iPhone next year if you trade in your device.The Apple's iPhone Upgrade program starts at $49.91, but includes AppleCare+.Regardless of how you're paying for it, the iPhone X is expensive.Below you can watch our guide to teach you the key differences between the iPhone X, iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus.iPhone X design New glass design that enables wireless charging Bigger display, but smaller than Plus phones Easier to hold than an iPhone Plus phone, too Remains water-resistant and comes in only two colors Apple managed to make the iPhone X bigger, yet smaller at the same time.It'll have a more expansive 5.8-inch edge-to-edge screen (that's the bigger part), but the size is actually smaller than a Plus-sized iPhone.It also feels lighter.How?The iPhone X dimensions give you a shorter height of 5.65 inches (143.6 mm) and, importantly, a smaller width of 2.79 inches (70.9 mm) vs a Plus phone.It weights a lighter 6.14 ounces (174 grams), too.The iPhone X will be easier to hold in one hand.Even if you were turned off by the size of the Plus models but are enamored by the screen size, you'll still be able to upgrade to iPhone X without a problem.That's good news because the front and back of the phone are now made of glass, eschewing the usual aluminum casing.(but you'll definitely want an iPhone X case).Like last year's iPhone, the iPhone X is waterproof, or water-resistant.It has an IP 67 rating, which means the phone can be 1m (about 3.3 feet) under water for 30 minutes, according to Apple's tests.What iPhone X colors will you be able to get on day one?Space Gray and Silver will be the only two options available.No red, gold, rose gold or that rumored blush gold colors this time around, which is disappointing.iPhone X screen Vibrant 5.8-inch edge-to-edge AMOLED screen Apple's 'Super Retina Display' makes its debut Quad HD+ display with a 2436 x 1125 resolution Apple's new iPhone X screen is considered an all-screen display, or what it calls a 'Super Retina Display.'It's not elegantly named, but it comes with perks.It uses a 5.8-inch OLED display, a first for an iPhone compared to the LCD displays used before.Apple says it's the first OLED that's 'great' enough to be on an iPhone.This is also Apple's first edge-to-edge display, which means it lacks bezel at the top and is missing the home button at the bottom, replacing them with more screen.It doesn't have curved screen sides like Samsung's phones, however.It goes well beyond the 1080p screen ceiling Apple gave us on past phones and it'll crank the resolution of 2436 x 1125 pixels, delivering a Quad HD+ picture.The iPhone X display is built for HDR and its superior contrast video playback.It can deliver a 1,000,000:1 contrast ratio on Dolby Vision and HDR10 content, and it can play Netflix in HDR.3D Touch returns for more granular pressure-sensitive touchscreen controls, which usually amount to hidden shortcut menus within apps and on the home screen.If you're upgrading from an iPhone 6, this will be hugely new to you.iOS 11 will be retooled to fit the iPhone X display a little better, with more features (that you can read about below).No more home button Bezel-less iPhone X screen eliminates the home button Flick an open app upward to return to the home screen Control Center is now a swipe-down-from-the-top gesture You won't find a physical home button on the iPhone X, or any home button at all.Apple's all-screen design doesn't have room for it or the fingerprint sensor.Having no home button and Touch ID sensor is going to be the biggest change that long-time Apple users will have to get used to the new iPhone controls.How do you return to the home screen without a home button?Simply flick an open app upward from the bottom, like you're throwing it away.This, oddly enough, is your new home button.You bypass the lock screen the same way (once you're authenticated with Face ID or a password).The fanned-out multitasking menu can be accessed by dragging an app upward, but pausing for a second (don't let go) and it'll appear with other open apps.You can also swipe along the very bottom edge of the screen to switch between apps more quickly.This shortcut is akin to the browsing the watch faces gallery on an Apple Watch.Since the swipe-up-from-the-bottom gesture is now occupied by the return to home mechanic, Control Center has been moved to a swipe down gesture.Just slide your finger down from the top-right-aligned battery icon and you can see the new iOS 11 Control Center dash.Swiping from the top on the left side of the screen reveals the notifications screen.The Sleep/Wake button has been renamed the side button (also matching the Apple Watch).Holding it in for a second summons Siri, and double pressing it brings up Apple Pay, which can now be authenticated with Face ID.Apple likens all of these swipes to slide to unlock, which everyone misses.We'll have to test out the new gesture mechanics see if this has the same natural feeling.This could become second nature, though some people will undoubtedly complain at first (they always do).Face ID replaces Touch ID Unlock your phone simply by looking at it More secure than the fingerprint sensor Also used in conjunction with Apple Pay Without Touch ID, how do you unlock your iPhone X?Apple claims to have made this easy with the debut of Face ID."It's the future of we how unlock our smartphones," said Apple senior vice president of worldwide marketing Phil Schiller at the company's launch event.To pull this off, the iPhone X uses its front-facing 7MP TrueDepth camera and its multiple sensors, including a sophisticated dot projector to map your face.It even works in the dark thanks to an infrared camera, according to Apple.Apple claims that Face ID won't be spoofed by photos, which Samsung had an issue with on the Galaxy S8 and Note 8.The company went so far as to work with Hollywood mask makers to prevent even the most advanced hackers from breaking into your new iPhone X.And don't worry, it'll work with sunglasses and can be disabled in times of crisis, according to senior vice president of Software Engineering Craig Federighi.You can disable Face ID by holding in the side button for a few seconds, say if a robber demands that you hand over your smartphone.Touch ID letting someone else into your phone 1 in 50,000 chance of happening.The chance a thief (or the FBI) can look at your iPhone and unlock it with Face ID?It's now a 1 in 1,000,000 chance, claims Apple.Face ID's debut did have what seemed like failed moment at the Apple event, but the company explained that it was due to a number of failed attempts by the stage crew.The iPhone X tried to authenticate their faces, unbeknownst to them, while they handled the new phone.It then reverted to asking Federighi for his passcode during the live demo.Oops.The science behind Face ID is extremely complex and interesting.It's almost ripped from the headlines from a newspaper one that's printed in the future.What has us most intrigued is the fact that it gets better at recognizing your 3D mug over time and even adapt to the evolution on your face.Apple promises that Face ID won't mind when you get a haircut, grow a beard or start looking fabulously younger.It'll still 'just work' - and in our tests we found that it really does work well.iPhone X dual-lens camera Redesigned 12MP dual-lens camera Telephoto lens OIS and a wider aperture Portrait Mode enhanced by Portrait Lighting Apple says it has redesigned its cameras, though it sticks with much of the same specs as last year: You get 12MP cameras with every new 2017 iPhone.Of course, if you want a dual-lens camera you have to go with the iPhone X or iPhone 8 Plus, and if you want optical image stabilization on both the wide-angle and telephoto lenses, you'll have to buy the iPhone X. OIS helps make up for hand shakiness when taking photos.The camera lens actually moves with your unsteady hands.Now it's on the telephoto lens, too, so you photos with 2x optical zoom can be blur-free as well.The iPhone X camera sensors are also larger and faster, capturing what Apple calls "deep pixels" with either an f/1.8 aperture (wide-angle) or improved f/2.4 aperture (telephoto) lens.It also uses its new A11 Bionic chip and machine learning to optimize for scenes even before an image is taken.Last year's Portrait Mode gave us bokeh-rich (background-blur-added) portrait photos.This year, Apple is introducing Portrait Lighting.It can transform the light in a scene, going as far as changing a background, or apply lightning to a persons face, as if they were being hit by lights in a studio.It reminds us of a live version of Instagram, but done on the phone's default camera app and smartly focused on a person's face, not the entire photo.iPhone X video recording in 4K hasn't changed, but capturing a slow-motion has.It can now record 240 frames per second in 1080p, up from doing it in 720p.The compromise of capturing slow-motion video at a lower resolution is gone.Apple's ridiculously tricked out TrueDepth camera 7MP front-facing camera takes Portait Mode selfies TrueDepth is full of face-mapping sensors Apple's iPhone X TrueDepth camera is no ordinary selfie camera.Its 7MP again, but packs more technology than we've ever seen in a front-facing camera array.It adds Portrait Mode to your selfies, giving us the first iPhone that doesn't have a single fixed-focus camera.This means your selfies can exhibit that stylish background blur, too.Depth of field is way better than the Beauty Mode that's popular on Android phones.The blur effect deserves to be on the background, not your skin.What else is packed into the screen cut-out at the top besides the 7MP camera?An infrared camera, flood illuminator, proximity sensor, ambient light sensor, speaker, microphone and sophisticated face-mapping dot projector.The TrueDepth camera is a beast, between Portrait Selfies, Portrait Lighting Selfies (nope, it's not just on the back camera), Face ID, and Animoji.Animoji Combines animations with emoji, of course Mirrors your facial expressions quite accurately Like a more advanced versions of a Snapchat mask Animoji has Apple taking emoji to the next level, utilizing its TrueDepth camera to mirror your facial expressions on a animals or... other creations, yes, like the poo emoji.A dozen of these animated emojis will be available in Apple's Messages app, and the camera will be able to bring them to life by tracking 50 of your facial muscle movements.It's more than just intrigued eyebrow looks.The iMessages app is already exploding with fun stickers and special effects and we didn't think we'd be using a year ago.The same is being said of Animoji.If they seems a bit meaningless and silly now, check back with us in a year.It's no surprise that Apple is working with Snapchat on using the front-facing camera to bring new, more realistically contoured masks to its photo-sharing app.There's a lot of potential behind this expression-driven creation.iPhone X specs A11 Bionic has six cores and is 25% faster than iPhone 7 CPU Doubles the number of efficiency cores to be 70% faster Translates into more power for 3D games and AR Apple has debuted its new 'A11 Bionic' chipset with the iPhone X, and it'll have a six-core processor to power all of the latest 3D games and AR technology.What does that mean?The six-core iPhone X chip has four efficiency cores, double the two efficiency cores on the four-core iPhone 7 Plus.That translates into a 70% faster CPU efficiency cores.What are the other two cores?They're the high-performance cores, and while the new iPhone X and last year's iPhone have two cores each, Apple says they're 25% faster and the iPhone X can even use all six at the same time for a turbo boost.It's smartly designed.We wont know the RAM for certain until someone pries open an iPhone X, as Apple doesnt reveal its RAM specs.But a Chinese regulatory agency has listed it as having 3GB, while one earlier report also suggested the iPhone X will come with 3GB of RAM, the same amount we saw Apple pack into the iPhone 7 Plus.iPhone X battery life and fast charging Lasts two hours longer than last year's iPhone 7 First fast-charging iPhone: 50% recharge in 30 minutes Apple gave us a big headline at the iPhone X launch: it will last two hours longer than the standard-sized iPhone 7.It'll amount to all-day battery life, depending on usage.You can easily pare down battery consumption with low-power mode in iOS 11 to have it last even longer.Apple hasn't said the actual size of the battery, but according to TENAA (a Chinese regulatory agency) it has a 2,716mAh one - that's bigger than the 2,691mAh iPhone 8 Plus, but not by much.What's interesting is that the iPhone X will be the first Apple phone (along with the new iPhone 8 and 8 Plus) with fast-charging capabilities.This can give you a 50% charge in just 30 minutes.Previously fast charging was limited to newer iPad Pro tablets and the original 12.9-inch iPad Pro.You will have to spring for the separately sold Lightning-to-USB-C cable and adapter - and that's a whopping $75 / 75 / AU$100.The iPhone X comes with a normal lightning cable and underpowered 5W charging adapter smaller than even the iPad charger.Wireless charging with AirPower Apple's AirPower pad can charge multiple devices iPhone X also charges with existing Qi chargers Plugging in your iPhone X could be as easy as dropping it on a wireless pad, and that's the idea behind the new iPhone X wireless charging feature.Sure, wireless charging isn't new (yes, it's been on Android phones for years), but Apple will debut a new AirPower charging pad in 2018.It can charge every new Apple product: an Apple Watch, AirPods and the iPhone X.The pad itself uses a USB-C cable for power, just like Apple's MacBook and MacBook Pro.This wide-shaped charging pad makes it easy to recharge everything at once compared to plugging each gadget in with a Lightning cable or fetching that inductive Apple Watch charger.However, Apple didn't lay out how much the hassle-free AirPower pad will cost, and we know it won't launch until next year.AirPower also requires a new AirPods case, one that has wireless charging built into it.Just when you thought iPhone X was expensive enough, it makes you want to buy all sorts of accessories (that's how they get you, right?).Convenience often has a high price and a long wait.In the meantime, Mophie and Belkin are making wireless chargers, and standard Qi chargers should work, though most will simply charge a single device.Want to look for a charging pad?Here are the best wireless chargers right now Augmented Reality features Apple just created the world's largest AR ecosystem New demos are launching with iOS 11 It even works on older devices (A9 chip and higher) Apple is very bullish on augmented reality, favoring AR over VR.CEO Tim Cook mentions AR during every one of Apple's quarterly earnings calls these days.iOS 11 is already transforming the world into a virtual playground, with games that create digital objects on empty tables when you look through an iPhone or iPad.Home furnishing giant IKEA, meanwhile, is creating practical furniture measuring tools.And that's just the tip of the iceberg.That's why AR is going to play a big part on the iPhone X, although any exclusive features it gets may be minimal, as older iPhones has AR capabilities, too.You can find out more about the iOS 11 AR experience on the iPhone and iPad, which is coming to all Apple devices with an A9 chip or newer.
HTC U12: what we want to see:::::Update: HTC has revealed plans to make dual-lens phones next year, so the HTC U12 may well be one of them.The HTC U11 is an enormously impressive phone, but one with a headline feature that doesnt quite convince, especially in the face of the flashy Samsung Galaxy S8.So theres room for improvement, and weve got a whole list of ways the HTC U12 (or whatever it ends up being called) could be the improvement we want to see.If HTC implements all of our suggestions it could well have a five-star phone on its hands.But before we get to that theres the important matter of when the HTC U12 is likely to launch, what its likely to cost, and what specs and features it might include.We dont have definitive answers to any of those questions just yet, but we have some ideas.Cut to the chase What is it?HTC's next flagship phone HTC's next flagship phone When is it out?Probably mid-2018 Probably mid-2018 What will it cost?A lot, expect around $649/649/AU$999 Dont expect the HTC U12 any time soon, as it was only in May 2017 that the HTC U11 was announced and June that it hit stores.Given that new models typically come out around once a year were probably looking at a May 2018 launch for the HTC U12, especially as the HTC 10 also launched in the month of May, and as the HTC U11 Plus has only just arrived.Then again, the HTC One, HTC One M8 and HTC One M9 all launched in March of their respective years, so an earlier launch is possible, but were pretty certain the U12 will launch in early to mid-2018 anyway.Its sure to cost a lot.The HTC U11 sells for $649/649/AU$999, so youll probably have to pay at least around that much for the HTC U12.HTC U12 news and rumors We dont know anything about the HTC U12 yet, but HTC has revealed that it will start making dual-lens phones again in 2018, so the HTC U12 may well be one of them.We can also take some educated guesses about the upcoming phone.Edge Sense (the ability to interact with the phone by squeezing it) will probably make a return, since this is a brand-new feature and one which HTC heavily hyped.It hasnt entirely lived up to the hype, but maybe the necessary improvements will have been made for the HTC U12 version.The design of the HTC U11 and HTC U11 Plus is also new and generally impressive, so wed think a similar, though probably refined, design will be used for the HTC U12.That means a rounded glass shell with a two-tone color that changes depending on the angle you look at it.Wed also expect HTC will keep the water resistance from the HTC U11, while the companys impressive BoomSound audio is likely to make a return in some form.And HTC is likely to use the latest flagship Snapdragon chipset, which might be the Snapdragon 845.What we want to see The HTC U11 is a four and a half star phone, but for the HTC U12 to get five stars the following changes would help.1.Improvements to Edge Sense HTC largely sold the U11 on the strength of Edge Sense, yet while being able to do a short or long squeeze of the phone to launch apps, turn on the torch and take photos is a nice idea, it feels a bit half-baked.Its not sensitive enough for one and while you can choose what you want it to open or activate it doesnt go deep enough right now.Its set to get better, with more customization coming, but we hope its a truly essential feature by the time the HTC U12 launches.2.Better battery We dont want to be too hard on the HTC U11s battery, its actually quite decent.But its one of the many phones that requires a daily charge, rather than one of the very few that can last two days or more.It also didnt do brilliantly in our video test, where we play a looped video for 90 minutes and record the battery drop.So hopefully the HTC U12 will last longer, either through a bigger battery (topping the U11s 3,000mAh must surely be doable) or via clever tweaks and optimizations.3.A snappier snapper The HTC U11 has a generally great camera, but theres noticeable shutter lag.This is surprising from such a powerful phone, but its a problem thats long plagued HTCs handsets and can be frustrating, even leading to missing the perfect shot.Overall, the HTC U11 is one of HTCs best camera phones ever, but wed like to see a higher shutter speed for the HTC U12.In fact, we dont want to see any noticeable pause at all when we take a photo, it should be instant.4.Smarter Sense Companion Although not hyped as much as Edge Sense, HTCs Sense Companion is just as useful and shows just as much room for improvement.This AI app monitors the weather, your location, your calendar, your battery level and how much youre using your phone and gives you alerts accordingly.That could mean reminding you to charge your phone before you head off to a meeting, or telling you when youre using your phone too much.It also gives you suggestions of places you might want to go for lunch nearby, but these never feel as useful as turning to Google, while telling you youre using your phone a lot isnt that helpful either if the app isnt going to motivate you to use it less.So developing these features more for Sense Companions inevitable HTC U12 outing would make it a far more useful app.5.Fewer fingerprints As great as the design of the HTC U11 is, it picks up more fingerprints than almost any other phone weve come across.So while wed be fine with seeing the same shiny glass finish on the HTC U12, hopefully the company will have found a way to repel prints, as well as making other small refinements to whats generally a stunning look.6.Front-facing speakers HTCs phones are known for great audio, whether listening through headphones or the built-in speakers, and the HTC U11 is no exception, but we miss the front-facing BoomSound speakers of old.In the HTC U11 one fires from the earpiece and the other from the bottom edge, which both makes them easy to cover and means audio is less impressive when the phone is facing you as it will be when watching videos or playing games.We doubt HTC will move back to front-facing speakers for the U12, but we wouldnt complain if it did.7.A brighter screen The HTC U11 has a flagship-class screen.Its big, sharp and generally looks great, but its not quite as bright as the screens on some phones, and that, coupled with it being quite reflective, can mean its tricky to use comfortably in bright sunlight.Its auto-brightness needs some tuning too, so that its less likely to either blind you or need manually turning up.Theyre small complaints, but ones that we hope are addressed by the HTC U12.
Best wireless chargers for iPhone 8, iPhone X, Samsung Galaxy S8 and more:::::No one likes wires, and wireless charging allows us to put down our phones on a desk, bedside table or even a coffee shop counter to pump more power into them without having to plug in a wire.The newly launched iPhone X, iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus all support wireless charging, while Android devices such as the Galaxy Note 8, Galaxy S8, Galaxy S8 Plus and the US version of the LG G6 will all work with these pads too.Some phones that don't come with wireless charging built-in will also work with the pads below thanks to accessories, such as the Moto Z range where you can buy a Moto Mod to allow for wireless charging.Below we've put together a guide to some of our favorite wireless charger options on the market right now, and each should work with all devices that support the Qi wireless charging standard.Some will also work with the competing standard AirFuel, which is a combination of PMA and AW4P tech, but we'll note where that's possible.Own an older iPhone?Here's how to wirelessly charge your iPhone 7?Note: Some of the wireless chargers below will allow for fast wireless charging on the iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus and iPhone X, but that feature won't be available until Apple releases a new software update that's expected to land later this year.Until then you'll only be able to wirelessly charge your iPhone at normal speeds.We'll be sure to test the feature and update this guide when the update lands.Mophie wireless charging base Officially made for the iPhone 8 and iPhone X Specifically designed for new iPhone models Small form factor Only charges one device at a time One of the new charging plates released alongside the iPhone 8 and iPhone X is the Mophie wireless charging base, which will allow for fast wireless charging speeds on those phones when the software update is pushed out by Apple later this year.Right now it'll charge up any Qi enabled device as fast as your normal wall charger would, but it also has an attractive design and is very easy to use thanks to a great grip that will keep your phone securely on the charging plate.RAVPower Fast Wireless Charger A cheaper alternative Low price Compatible with all Qi enabled phones May need cleaning often One of the more affordable fast-charging pads we've found comes from RAVPower and you can buy it right now to work with your Qi compatible phone.The plastic rimmed design does mean it'll often get dust caught inside it, so you may find yourself cleaning it more often than other chargers, but the upside is it offers good grip so your phone won't move, and the fast-charging tech features are appreciated too.The low price is the real highlight of the RAVPower charger though, as it's much more affordable than a lot of other options out there at the moment.Belkin Boost Up wireless charging pad Another officially made for iPhone option Sleek look Removable wall adaptor Larger design Another option officially made in partnership with Apple, the Belkin Boost Up pad will work with any device that supports Qi wireless charging, but is specifically built for iPhone.Fast wireless charging will work with this pad later in the year, but right now it'll charge up any compatible phone you have at acceptable speeds.The Belkin is a bit larger than the two other wireless charging pads above on this list, but if size isn't an issue for your desk or bedroom table, this could be a good choice as your way to charge up your phone.Fonesalesman WoodPuck Bamboo Edition A welcome change from plastic Light and stylish Audible charge notifications No LED May not work with thicker cases Theres something deliciously anachronistic about wooden tech products, and the WoodPuck is a great example - people are always surprised that it can charge a phone.Despite the name, its made of sustainable tortoiseshell bamboo rather than a more traditional wood, which makes it handily light.Its also not one of the giant pandas preferred varieties, so youre not depriving a bear of its tea.WoodPuck uses the Qi standard and comes in a choice of two colors, Cappuccino and Espresso, to match your preferred aesthetic.Ikea RIGGAD work lamp Save space on your nightstand Its also a lamp USB port for second device Very limited case range Only one color option If we asked 100 people what they keep on their bedside table, the top two answers would probably be a phone charger and a lamp.This Ikea design combines the two in a stylish, practical piece of lighting tech using the Qi standard.It feels deeply futuristic plopping your phone on your bedside lamp and know it's charging.Its also really nicely designed: the lamp is mega-flexible, comes in neutral colors and has a handy non-slip cross to keep your phone on the right spot.What a bright idea.Buy the IKEA Riggad in the UK and in the US Samsung multi wireless charging tray Surprisingly stylish Looks great with matching speaker Charges three devices No fast charging, even on Samsungs Two phones look slightly awkward This unusual-looking charger wouldnt look out of place in a high-end tech boutique.Between its circular and rectangular charging sections, its capable of charging any two Qi devices wirelessly with a wired USB port for adding a third.Two subtle blue LEDs indicate the charger status of each pad, which shouldnt be bright enough to disturb your sleep.However, the round portion of the tray is clearly designed for the wireless charging Bluetooth bottle speaker from the same product line, and looks a fair bit clumsier with a smartphone across it.If you happen to have the speaker, its night light feature plus this charging tray makes for a super-stylish nightstand combo.Ikea NORDMRKE triple wireless charging pad Keep everyone off their phones at dinner Charges four devices simultaneously Well-priced Too big to be portable 2m cable could be longer OK, its more expensive than the lamp (and doesnt have a lamp), but the Swedish supergiants other excellent offering in the wireless department can charge no less than three devices at once.Oh, and did we mention it has a USB port too?So thats four devices, potentially covering the whole family (or one really dedicated gadget fan).As before, it uses the Qi standard and has a range of matching cases, as well as two design options: white and wood.This simple, stylish design is pretty much exactly what wed expect from an Ikea wireless charger, but without a hex key in sight.Buy the Ikea Nordmarke charger in the UK and in the US Or you can wait for this... Apple AirPower charging pad Apple will also provide its own first-party charging pad for all its new wirelessly charged products.It's called AirPower and will have room for your Apple AirPods, an Apple Watch 3 and an iPhone X, so you can have all three of your devices charge in one place.Apple doesn't plan to launch the AirPower charging pad until 2018, so it's going to be a long wait until we get to use this option.

Google Pixel 3: what we want to see:::::The Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL are among the best phones of 2017, so theres every chance the inevitable Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL will be among the best phones of 2018, and were already hearing early rumblings about them.Little is known yet, but well update this article as we hear more, and in the meantime weve taken some educated guesses at the likely release date, price and features.Weve also come up with a list of all the main things we want from the next phones in the range, from a customizable Active Edge to screen improvements and more.Cut to the chase What is it?The next pure Android flagship from Google The next pure Android flagship from Google What will it cost?Likely upwards of $649 / 629 / AU$1,079 Likely upwards of $649 / 629 / AU$1,079 When is it out?Probably October 2018 The Pixel 2 launched on October 4 2017, while the original Pixel and Pixel XL launched on October 4 2016, so it seems reasonable to assume that the Pixel 3 will launch on October 4 2018.And assume is all we can do for now, as there arent any release date rumors yet.But even if it doesnt end up landing on that day or in October it will almost certainly be towards the end of the year, in order to leave the customary years gap between launches.Price is another thing we can only guess at for now.As the Pixel 2 starts at $649 / 629 / AU$1,079 and the Pixel 2 XL starts at $849 / 799 / AU$1,399, the Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL may well have similar prices.But if anything theyre likely to cost more, since the Pixel 2 XL costs more than the Pixel XL launched at, and since smartphone prices at the high-end seem to be rising in general.The Pixel 2 XL is even more expensive than its predecessor Google Pixel 3 news and rumors We havent heard much about the Pixel 3 yet, but we have heard that it might already be in the works, or rather, that three new Pixel phones might be.According to a trusted source speaking to Droid Life, the phones are codenamed crosshatch, albacore and blueline, and supposedly two of them will be considered premium, while one is thought of as high-end.That split sounds like it might be similar to what Apples done with the top-end iPhone X and the slightly lower-end iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus.So in other words we might get a Pixel 3, a Pixel 3 XL and then something even higher-end above them.Thats if this rumor is accurate and all three models launch, which they may well not, especially as three models were for a while rumored for the Pixel 2 range.One of those three Pixel 3 models has additional evidence for it, as mentions of crosshatch have been spotted in a comment on an AOSP (Android Open Source Project) listing.Its worth noting also that all these codenames are types of fish, which was true of previous Pixel handsets as well.What we want to see The Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL got 4 stars and 4.5 stars in our reviews respectively, so theres still room for improvement, and adding the following features to the Pixel 3 would be a step in the right direction.1.Smaller bezels The Pixel 2 has sizeable bezels, hopefully the Pixel 3 won't From the iPhone X to the Samsung Galaxy Note 8, many 2017 flagships have all but eliminated bezels, but not the Pixel 2.This is a phone which still has quite large bezels above and below the screen, and while they serve a purpose (housing the front-facing speakers) wed like to see them worked on for the Pixel 3.Hopefully Google and its manufacturing partners will find a way to significantly slim down the bezels without sacrificing speakers on the front.2.Customizable Active Edge Active Edge on the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL lets you squeeze the sides to launch Google Assistant.Its a handy feature, but unlike on the HTC U11 thats all it does and it cant be re-mapped.For the Pixel 3 we want the feature to return, but we want it to be context-sensitive, so for example if used in the camera app it would perhaps take a photo, and for the core functionality to be customizable, so you can use it as a shortcut to whatever app or feature you want.3.Camera app improvements The Pixel 2 has a great camera, but the app is far from perfect Despite just being a single-lens one, the camera on the Pixel 2 is among the best youll find on a smartphone, but the software could use some work.For example, wed like gesture controls for timed photos and the ability to switch between the main and selfie cameras with a swipe, like you can on Samsung and LG phones.Theyre little tweaks, but theyd make using the camera a little faster and a little more pleasant.4.A return of the headphone jack Despite taking a dig at Apple for ditching the headphone jack when launching the original Pixel, Google has also got rid of it for the Pixel 2, which is a decision wed like to see reversed for the Pixel 3.We dont expect that to happen, if anything ever more handsets are going to start removing the port, but for many users its an inconvenience and the benefits of its removal just dont seem overly compelling.5.Wireless charging The Pixel 2 range has reasonable battery life and supports fast charging, but doesnt have wireless charging, which is a major omission, especially now even Apple is supporting it.We expect wireless charging to become a lot more popular in the next year, thanks to the iPhone 8 and iPhone X, so it will stand out even more if the Pixel 3 doesnt support it.6.Screen improvements The screens on both the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL show room for improvement The standard Pixel 2 has just a 1080p screen, which isnt particularly sharp for a flagship in 2017, so wed like to see it upgraded to QHD for the Pixel 3.The Pixel 2 XL meanwhile is sharp enough, but in our review we found that the viewing angles arent great and nor is it especially vibrant, so wed like to see work done to improve those aspects for the Pixel 3 XL.7.Better water resistance The Pixel 2 range sports IP67 certification, which means it can survive being submerged up to 1 meter deep for up to 30 minutes.That should be plenty, but these are flagship phones were talking about and some rivals offer more.The Samsung Galaxy S8 for example has IP68 certification, meaning it can be submerged 1.5 meters deep for the same duration.Its a small change, but one that could at the very least give buyers more peace of mind that their expensive purchase is fully protected against rain and spills.
Lenovo takes control of Fujitsu’s PC division in an effort to shore up sales:::::In a move that has been in the works since over a year ago, Lenovo is set to bolster its computer business which has slipped in terms of performance this year by snapping up a majority stake in Fujitsus PC division.Fujitsu Client Computing Limited (FCCL) was spun off by Fujitsu in early 2016, and later in the year, the company said it was exploring a strategic cooperation with Lenovo.That has come to fruition with FCCL becoming a joint affair owned by Lenovo, Fujitsu, and the Development Bank of Japan (DBJ) with Lenovo having a 51% stake, and DBJ owning a 5% stake (with Fujitsu having the rest, naturally).Lenovo will initially pay Fujitsu $156 million (around 120 million), with a further up to $112 million (85 million) to be paid depending on the companys performance running up to 2020.Retaking the top Doubtless Lenovo hopes that this will help shore up its PC sales figures, which as mentioned have taken a bit of a dive this year, with the company losing its number one spot in the global market to HP Inc.Previous to that, Lenovo was top dog in the PC arena for quite some time, but back in July, going by Gartners figures for Q2 2017, it lost that crown with shipments dropping by 8.4% year-on-year, whereas HP grew by 3.3% to overtake the Chinese giant.Via: Reuters
Samsung executive shake-up masks potential power vacuum:::::All new company bosses face a challenge but the new faces in charge of Samsung seemingly face a less daunting challenge than most.Despite the fact that the current chairman of the company has been hospitalized for three years and his son, the heir apparent, is in jail, things look decidedly rosy.In normal circumstances, the kind of upheaval at Samsung would normally cause analysts to look concerned and the share price to wobble.This week has seen the heads of the three Samsung divisions: components, consumer electronics and mobile devices all being replaced.Kinam Kim, Hyunsuk (HS) Kim, and Dongjin (DJ) Koh will succeed vice chairman Oh-Hyun Kwon, presidents Boo-Keun Yoon and Jong-Kyun Shin, respectively.The shake-up didnt stop there, the company also unveiled a new CFO, Roh Hee-chan, formerly CFO of Samsung Displays, while the former CFO, Lee Sang-hoon, becomes chairman of the group.Thats another radical change: its the first time the company has split the chairman and chief executive officer duties.It looks disruptive but the company announced an impressive set of financial results earlier this week.The company is sitting on a cash pile of 76 trillion won (52.22 billion) making it one of the most cash rich in the world.The shareholders are certainly happy right now; the company has massively increased its dividends by 20% and is looking to keep dividends at a high level for the next few years.So, with profits running high, with booming demand for its core products and piles and piles of cash in the bank, everything seems to be looking good for the new bosses.Its more common practice to take command of a business when the situation looks a bit rocky or at least flat its less common to take the helm when the company is riding at a peak.But appearances can be deceptive its not always easy taking over at the top.Theres an interesting parallel here with the world of football (or soccer as they call it in the US).Ask David Moyes about the perils of taking on a successful business.When he succeeded Alex Ferguson as Manchester United, he seemingly had it all.The club had just won the English Premier League, it was in the lucrative Champions League, had one of the most recognisable brands in world football and was one of the richest clubs on the plant.Yet within months, Moyes was gone and, even now, four years later, the club has stumbled just below the top level.The problem that Moyes faced is the same underlying problem that Samsung faces a previous leader whose influence still holds sway.It wasnt quite the same thing of course, Ferguson retired to spend more time with his wine collection and racehorses, while Samsungs co-vice chairman and heir apparent Jay Y. Lee contemplates his five-year prison sentence.Return to the fold Theres rather too much speculation regarding Lees future: is he going to win his appeal and return to the fold?Are the three new divisional chiefs really just keep the seat warm until Lee comes back even if its in five years time?One thing thats been universally agreed is that Lee will return at some point; his father, the current chairman, has been in a coma since 2014 and all the signs pointed to Lee Jr as being the next leader.Despite the booming financial results, the path ahead isnt going to be an easy one.Samsung appears to have shrugged off the difficulties it had with the exploding Note 7 although it now appears to be running into another set of problems, according to a Samsung forum, with the recently launched Galaxy 8 appearing to be non-responsive.These appear to be isolated problems with the new product and are sure to be resolved, but it does highlight the fact that, in the highly competitive world of mobile phones, just one false move can leave a company looking vulnerable.What Samsung has going for it is its chips division: the semiconductor business is booming theres a growing demand for components for mobile phones and other devices.And while the Android phone business is going to be under competitive pressure from Apple, Samsung neatly hedges its bets by selling components to its US rival.Its a solid position to be in.But while the short term business looks positive, the potential for management disruption is great.The three new division chiefs: Messrs Kinam Kim, HS Kim and DJ Koh have had long and distinguished careers in their respective fields but thats not the same as leading an international company in a competitive market places.And while the jailed Lee is still in the background, questions are going to remain.Are the three new co-CEOs strong enough personalities to make the right decisions or are they keeping the seat warm for Lees return?If the former; will there be a power struggle in the future?If the latter, is there going to be a decision-making vacuum in the interim?Samsung has two things going for it: the market is strong at the moment, there are little signs of any choppy waters ahead (and even if there were, its cash pile will keep the company afloat).Its certainly one differentiating factor from football, where keeping going is not enough.The second factor in the companys favour is the presence of Lee-sang Hoon as the chairman both from the viewpoint of the continuity that he offers and the fact that the separation of the roles of chairman and chief executive (a first for Samsung) will offer better governance, providing greater strength to the company.These could have been troubling times for the company and they still could be but theres sufficient optimism for the future.Certainly, the shareholders arent complaining ... not yet, at least.
The iPhone X - now with 24K Gold plating:::::Is Apple limiting your color choices for the iPhone X with just Silver and Space Gray offerings?Or maybe you're expecting more bling out of a device that's over AED 4,000?You want a Gold iPhone X!If you're looking to get heads turned, you might want to check out the 24K Gold plated edition of the iPhone X.It's priced at AED 6,329 for the 256GB model, which is about AED 1,600 (roughly $400) more than what Apple charges for a "regular" iPhone X.It's basically the Space Gray version of the iPhone X with the metallic frame polished with 24K Gold.We think it looks a bit tacky, but what do geeks know about fashion and bling.As per axiom, it ships on the 15th of November, which is much earlier than you'd get if you were to buy a stock iPhone from Apple right now.In fact, this is probably cheaper than what you'd find the iPhone X for on dubizzle at the moment- those "unwanted gifts" sure are expensive.Other than the Gold plating, the iPhone X is exactly the same as a stock iPhone X with a 5.8inch Super Retina screen, a TrueDepth Camera with FaceID and the A11 Bionic chipset
Call of Duty WWII (2017) trailers, release date, news and features:::::Update: Call of Duty WW2 is now on sale.Keep an eye out for TechRadar's review and beginner's guide to the game which will be coming soon!Original article continues below...It's official: the Call of Duty franchise is returning to WWII in 2017.We've now seen the official reveal trailer, courtesy of a worldwide reveal on April 26.The Call of Duty franchise faced its toughest year yet in 2016.While the futuristic Infinite Warfare sold pretty well, it was surpassed by other shooters in nearly every way.Titanfall 2s slick campaign put it to shame, while Battlefield 1s 64-player battles in open terrain made the familiar Call of Duty formula feel stale.In the words of Activision, Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare underperformed expectations, and fans have been calling for a shake-up of the series for this years release.Thankfully, there are early signs that their voices have been heard.Heres everything we know about this years Call of Duty game so far, including a tonne of intriguing rumors.Cut to the chase What is it?The yearly installment to the biggest FPS franchise around The yearly installment to the biggest FPS franchise around When it is out?November 3, 2017 November 3, 2017 What platforms?PS4, Xbox One and the PC Trailers and images Call of Duty: WWII's reveal trailer was released on April 26 and confirmed many of the rumors that we'd previously heard about the game including its World War II setting.The trailer features a group of American soldiers as they storm the beaches at Normandy, before cutting to showing a tank convoy being ambushed in the countryside.The trailer ends with a pretty epic action montage, featuring all manner of gruesome delights.In the months since the original reveal trailer we've also seen the release of a multiplayer-focussed trailer, and a trailer focussed around the game's zombie mode.On August 14, we also got a private multiplayer beta trailer that highlights the new classes and some of the maps we can look forward to when the game enters private beta on PS4 on August 28, 2017.Most recently, at Gamescom 2017, Activision dropped the new Headquarters game mode trailer that gives us some insight into what we can expect when we get our boots on the ground later this year.Check it out for yourself below: Image 1 of 9 Screenshots Image 2 of 9 Image 3 of 9 Image 4 of 9 Image 5 of 9 Image 6 of 9 Image 7 of 9 Image 8 of 9 Image 9 of 9 News and features Release date The game has been confirmed to have a worldwide release of November 3, though customers who pre-order the game will get access to a private beta.It's not clear whether there will be different beta access for different platforms just yet, but we'll update as soon as we know more.Main campaign So, Call of Duty is taking players back to WW2 in a "return to its roots."All of the footage in the game's trailer was heavily focused on iconic WW2 imagery with plenty of plane and tank-warfare, beach landings, brutal combat and a distinctly Band of Brothers feel.It's been revealed that in the main campaign players will take control of a 19 year old soldier from Texas called Red Daniels who's fighting on the front lines along with his squadmates in the 1st Infantry division.Though Daniels will be the "primary protagonist", players will also play as another soldier and Daniels' best friend called Zussman.The story will largely follow their journey with their squadmates across a range of well-known historical locations from the war.Michael Condrey noted in an interview with GamesRadar, however, that players would see a diverse and more "global" extended cast that acknowledges the Allies were more than the UK and the US and the Axis force included more than German Nazis.Players can expect to see, he promises, "powerful performances on both sides of the war" from both male and female characters.In light of this, Condrey confirmed one other playable character from the French Resistance called Rousseau.Though Rousseau will be playable, it's unlikely the game will focus on her for very long, as Condrey also added that in order to keep the story meaningful and keep players attached to the main characters the game would primarily have players "stay with the squad [...] with Daniels."In a recent Q & A on the PlayStation blog, studio head Glenn Schofield confirmed that players would play a number of other characters that Red Daniels meets on his journey for short periods and Rousseau is indeed one of these characters.The main story will, however, primarily follow Red.Female characters will also, however, be playable in multiplayer.Gameplay Call of Duty WW2 is trying very hard to move away from the idea of the player being a single super solider that can take down the entire Axis force on their own and as a result some big gameplay changes are being implemented.These changes will focus on making the player interact more with their AI squard.For example, if you find yourself low on ammo at some point, your squard will be able to share ammo with you.This, according to Condrey, is "one of several mechanics" where players must take advantage of different and highly varied skills offered by their wider squad in order to survive.Another example of this is that rather than ducking for cover in order to regenerate health, players must seek out the medic in their squad in order to receive health packs.Glen Schofield has said that AI has been improved so that when players interact with their AI squad they'll feel genuinely intelligent and the interactions will have real meaning to the player.Apparently, it will be possible for the player to lose members of their squad as they play through the game, which will also have an impact on the kind of help they'll be able to receive: You can be separated from guys with key abilities that would change how you play if youre not with the ammo guy then you have less ability to replenish your ammo.There will also be scripted deaths, though it's next to impossible they will result in the loss of any character with a key ability required to complete the campaign.Multiplayer Of course, there will be multiplayer and as a result of the jump back in time it will be slightly different.No more boost jumps and high-tech gimmicks now it's back to a more historically accurate arsenal.Not only has the historical setting had an impact on the game's weapons, it's also going to have an effect on the multiplayer maps and how players interact with them.This time multiplayer maps will feature real and iconic locations from the war and the different weapons and technology available to players will mean that they'll have to adapt their strategy from what they've grown used to in other Call of Duty titles.A big new addition to multiplayer mode is Headquarters which will allow players to be social and interact with one another.Comparisons are being drawn to Destiny's Tower or hubs in World of Warcraft for a better idea of how this is intended to work.According to Sledgehammer Games, Call of Duty WWII won't be purely a first person experience and a third person view will occasionally happen in multiplayer mode's social space.It makes sense that in an area where players are able to interact and show off their items the camera would enter third person mode.New multiplayer mode with a story As well as the traditional online multiplayer, Call of Duty WW2 will introduce a new multiplayer mode with a story called War.This mode will take the form of "a series of objective-driven conflicts" which will focus on Axis versus Ally team-based gameplay.Zombies Zombies will, once again, be making a return in Call of Duty WW2.The cast for this mode includes some big names including David Tennant, Katheryn Winnick, Elodie Yung and Udo Kier.In an interview with PlayStation Blog the game's lead Jon Horsley said that players can expect to see more of what they know and love in terms of the mode's four-play cooperative gunplay and seemingly endless hoards of Nazi zombies.This time around, however, Sledgehammer hopes it's made the scariest zombie mode yet.In terms of setting and plot, Horsley revealed that Zombie Mode will be set in a small Bavarian village towards the end of WWII.In a desperate attempt to turn around the war effort, the Third Reich has created an army of the dead and players will be placed in this small village to recover a number of works of art where they'll explore appropriately sinister areas such as sewers, labs and tombs, taking on these zombie creations as they go.It'll also be possible to use tools and machines in the environments to kill enemies when guns just don't feel like enough.You can check out the reveal trailer for the Zombie's mode below.Hands on impressions Single player Though we didnt get to try out Call of Duty WWIIs single player campaign for ourselves, we were invited to watch a short hands-off demo which lasted just under 10 minutes.The demo took us to a portion of the campaign mode where the protagonist, Red Daniels, is on a mission with his squadmates to capture a church at the centre of an old European town.The demo showed us the first-person experience of controlling Daniels through the towns twisting streets, showing off the games smooth combat controls and impressively realistic graphics.Depending on how you feel about dismembered bodies it might sometimes border on too realistic.However, capturing the visceral brutality of war is a well-documented aim of Sledgehammer Games for this title and that comes across in this demo's explosive and bloody combat.Squad goals The demo also gives us a peek at the games new squad abilities which are replacing mechanics such as health regeneration.Where your character was once able to regenerate their health on their own, theyll now rely on one of their squadmates called Zussman to throw health packs to them when needed.This is an interesting mechanic and we liked the idea behind it as well as the visuals of it in action.Other than that, the demo didnt show us too much that took us by surprise - explosive, cinematic and heroic it was what we would expect a good-looking Call of Duty campaign trailer to be.Mutiplayer mode It was for the games mutliplayer mode that we got to pick up the controller and try out the three different game modes: Team Deathmatch, Domination and the brand new War.Team Deathmatch and Domination are both very familiar forms of multiplayer for anyone thats already played a Call of Duty game.In Deathmatch you essentially run around the game map with your team, shooting down enemies on the other side, while in Domination you do the same with the added challenge of capturing and keeping flags.Playing War Its the games new War node that is by far the biggest and most exciting addition to Call of Dutys multiplayer and its clear that Sledgehammer Games is excited about it.War is the franchises first narrative-driven objective based multiplayer mode and casts players into one of two camps: attacking or defending.In this mode, the attacking team must try to push across the games map by completing a set of four of tasks.In the game we played the first involved capturing an enemy building, the second required us to build a bridge, the third saw us capturing an ammo depo, while the final challenge was escorting a tank through a towns streets.The attackers only have a limited amount of time to complete their tasks and if they dont manage to do so, victory goes to the defenders.War is a very different kind of multiplayer experience for Call of Duty but its a very welcome addition.It feels fresh and intense and its nice to find yourself working with your squad to do something other than protect a flag.Not only that the sense of progression moving through the tasks gives is very satisfying in a game mode that usually leaves you feeling like youre running around the same corner of a map over and over again.Whether it has longevity and becomes a mode players will repeatedly return to is yet to be seen, but our hopes are high for it.Back to the roots Sledgehammer Games decision to return the Call of Duty franchise to its roots in WW2 was definitely a clever one in our eyes.It may not feel like it, but its been 10 years since we saw a Call of Duty title set in this era and game development technology has come a long way since then.From what little we played, Call of Duty WWIIs combat is largely the standard affair weve become used to, just in a more historical setting than were used to seeing.Though multiplayer mode was as fast-paced and fun as ever, its certainly a good thing that the more narrative-driven War has been added.Though the new main campaign offers something new on its own and will no doubt draw in many fans, War is a new feature with replayability value in the part of the game most of the franchises fans will spend the majority of their time, offering a value which will no doubt satisfy many players.Digital Deluxe Edition With the Digital Deluxe Edition you'll get access to the beta period, but you'll also get a season pass for the game which means any content released for the game after its release will be free for you.This version is available as a digital download only and will set you back slightly more than the Standard Edition with prices starting at 89.99/$99.99.Pro Edition The Pro Edition is essentially the Digital Deluxe Edition but in physical form and that means a nice steelbook cover and additional physical merchendise depending on which retailer you purchase from.The Pro Edition is exclusive to Gamestop in the US for $99.99 but it can be purchased from several UK retailers.Both Amazon and Game UK have the Pro Edition for 89.99, though it's worth noting that Game has an exclusive poster and Divisions Bonus Pack for its pre-order customers.
Ionity is European for 'big-ass EV charging network':::::Infrastructure is still a major issue preventing widespread adoption of electric vehicles, but a number of automakers hope to solve that problem by banding together in Europe.Ionity is the name for the group of automakers attempting to link Europe with a network of high-speed EV chargers.BMW, Ford, Daimler and Volkswagen Group are all putting time and money into Ionity, because without a network, there won't be anywhere to charge the billion or so EVs these companies plan on debuting over the next two decades.Enlarge Image Ionity The goal is to get 400 fast-charging stations on "major European thoroughfares" by 2020.The group has already broken ground on an initial run of 20 stations in Germany, Norway and Austria, with the intention of getting 50 established by the start of 2018.That number will expand to about 100 by the end of 2018, and it'll just keep growing from there.Ionity's network won't be some namby-pamby group of trickle chargers offering barely any range.These chargers will be capable of providing up to 350 kW per charging point, or nearly three times the power of Tesla's current batch of Superchargers.There aren't any vehicles that can take advantage of this charging speed yet, but Ionity's members are working to fix that.As mentioned earlier, the whole point of this exercise isn't to burn through cash for funsies.Each automaker involved in Ionity intends on releasing long-range EVs within the next few years, and adding this network of chargers will only grow the appeal of going electric.While four automakers all have equal shares in Ionity, the group has left the doors open for any other automaker that wants to get in on the action.The more OEMs participating, the more money can be spent on the venture, which in turn only makes the network better and more appealing for consumers.
Hyundai's N division gets freaky with Apple ad director:::::I'm not about to pretend like I understand advertising, but after watching a new ad for Hyundai's N performance division, it's confirmed that I really don't understand advertising.Hyundai's first batch of commercials for its performance vehicle lineup is... weird, to say the least.It seems to be a simultaneous send-up of traditional luxury advertising with a heapin' helpin' of the surreal.Oh, and there's a car in there, too, along with some engine noises."We want people to rethink their views of Hyundai as a practical, compromise choice, to a brand which shows people through the power of 'N' that they make cars that are fun to drive and which aren't like anything else out there," said James Temple, chief creative officer at R/GA London, the agency responsible for the ads, in an interview with Adweek.If the direction seems familiar to you, that's because it very well might be.This ad campaign's director is Tom Kuntz, who made the "Appocalypse" video for Apple, as well as a number of other weird music videos and ad spots.The first vehicle to appear in Hyundai's performance-oriented N lineup is the i30 N, a hatchback that we get in the US as the Elantra GT.Its 2.0-liter I4 puts out 276 horsepower and 260 pound-feet of torque in its top spec, which puts it in the mix with other hot hatches like the Volkswagen GTI and Honda Civic Type R. It's a strong initial offering, and while there is no confirmation yet, I hope we can see some Stateside N vehicles in the coming years.

Twitter overhauls rules on how it handles abusive behavior:::::James Martin/CNET Twitter is revamping the rules for how it expects its users to behave following criticism of how the platform enforces its policies.The new rules, which Twitter released Friday, don't alter the fundamentals of its previous rules but rather seek to clarify its policies and enforcement.The updates incorporate feedback from the company's global Trust and Safety Council to include more details and examples to provide greater context."We have worked on this clarified version of our rules for the past few months to ensure it takes into account the latest trends in online behavior, considers different cultural and social contexts, and properly sets expectations around what's allowed on Twitter," the company said in a statement.The update comes roughly two weeks after Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey tweeted that the social network would be rolling out changes to how it monitors content and protects its 328 million users from online bullying and harassment.Abuse is nothing new to Twitter users, but the platform has been under increased pressure since October's #WomenBoycottTwitter protest, which urged people to forgo tweeting for a day to prod Twitter into improving how it vets content.Friday's revisions address areas including self-harm, graphic violence, adult content and spam.But the greatest attention will be on abusive behavior.The company explains that when evaluating alleged abuse, it will consider whether the "behavior is targeted, if a report has been filed and by whom, and if the tweet itself is newsworthy and in the legitimate public interest."The company has come under criticism for how it handles abusive behavior on the site, particularly in relation to how it deals with tweets from President Donald Trump.Many have wondered why some of his tweets aren't being deleted by the social media platform, despite their apparent violation of Twitter's rules.One particular tweet in October was interpreted by many as a threat of violence against North Korea's leadership.Twitter acknowledged that Trump's tweet had caused an uproar but said it was allowed to stay because of its "newsworthiness."Twitter's media policy Help Center page has been updated with examples of content the company considers to be "graphic violence" or "adult content."Twitter said the policy will be updated again on Nov. 22 to incorporate examples of prohibited hateful imagery Twitter said it will discuss its enforcement options in a separate update on Nov. 14.Solving for XX: The industry seeks to overcome outdated ideas about "women in tech."Special Reports: All of CNET's most in-depth features in one easy spot.
'Future Man' makes video games real, then everyone pukes:::::Brandon Hickman/Hulu More than one hard-core gamer has dreamed that real life could be as action-packed and exhilarating as the title they've spent so much time trying to conquer.In the upcoming Hulu sci-fi comedy series "Future Man."that dream comes true for Josh Futterman (see what they did with the name there?), played by Josh Hutcherson of "Hunger Games" fame, But the result is more about raunchy humor than epic action sequences or mind-bending science fiction storylines.Futterman is a janitor who lives with his parents and spends every spare moment obsessively trying to finish an unbeatable first-person shooter.When he finally becomes the first to defeat the game, two of the characters travel back in time from an apocalyptic future, Terminator- style, to inform Futterman that he has completed a training program that identifies him as the savior of humanity.This key scene in the opening episode also sets the tone for the humor that will dominate the series: Futterman greets one of the very excitable and violent visitors from the future by incidentally soiling his pants with X-rated bodily fluids.The gross-out humor continues over the first seven episodes that I was able to preview as Futterman and the two freedom fighters known simply as Tiger (played by Eliza Coupe) and Wolf (Derek Wilson) hop back and forth through time, bumbling attempts to save the future while inciting plenty of vomiting, campy gore and assorted moments of vulgarity along the way.The humor comes courtesy of executive producers Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg and creators Kyle Hunter and Ariel Shaffir, the team behind the animated 2016 raunch-fest "Sausage Party."The plot of the show almost doesn't matter.But for the record, it's a mash-up of "The Last Starfighter," "Back to the Future" and "Terminator," a fact that the constant references to the films will never let you forget.After the first couple of episodes, the time traveling sci-fi premise and nods to gamer culture fade into the background to make way for the over-the-top physical comedy and abundant pop culture references that Rogen and Goldberg joints (pun intended) are known for.If you're a nerd looking for a smart sci-fi comedy that speaks to you, "Future Man" is probably going to disappoint.The closest the show comes is with a funny episode that seems almost entirely dedicated to lampooning "Avatar" director James Cameron.But the episode includes just as many jokes about Cameron's earlier 1997 blockbuster "Titanic," letting all the geeks know that we are not necessarily the show's target audience.Just because "Future Man" doesn't quite deliver the savvy, nerdy laughs of an Edgar Wright production (such as "Shaun of the Dead," "Scott Pilgrim vs. the World" and "The World's End"), that's not to say it isn't often hilarious and worth watching.The relationship that develops between Wolf and the disembodied artificial intelligence that runs James Cameron's smart home is particularly funny, and there's plenty of other digs at tech staples like Apple and Siri that also land.If you set your expectations low and can tolerate some gratuitous vomiting and an exploding head every now and then, "Future Man" just might be the temporary escape from the present you're looking for.All 13 episodes of the show will premiere November 14 on Hulu.Technically Literate: Original works of short fiction with unique perspectives on tech, exclusively on CNET.Crowd Control: A crowdsourced science fiction novel written by CNET readers.

Trump's Twitter account deletion came from 'rogue employee':::::Twitter It was an absence that lasted just 11 minutes, but it got everyone's attention.For that length of time on Thursday -- about as much as it takes to make a pot of coffee -- Donald Trump's personal Twitter account went missing.We're talking here about one of the main ways that the president of the US communicates to the world, a form of expression that's nearly synonymous with who Trump is.It's also a source of controversy that has had critics wondering if Twitter might ever pull the plug.Trump has credited the social media platform with helping him win the White House, but some close to the president reportedly worry that his prolific and strongly worded tweeting could have dire consequences.The New York Times reported earlier this year that members of his staff are desperate for him to slow down with the tweets.So a hiccup to the @realDonaldTrump account, which has more than 41 million followers, has some serious reverb.President Trump noted as much on Friday morning, hours after his account had been reactivated.He tweeted, somewhat cryptically, about the impact of his tweeting.My Twitter account was taken down for 11 minutes by a rogue employee.I guess the word must finally be getting out-and having an impact.Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 3, 2017 Who's to blame?During the outage, which started shortly before 4 p.m. PT, visitors to the account found a message that the page didn't exist.About an hour later, Twitter's @TwitterGov account tweeted to say that the Trump account had been "inadvertently deactivated due to human error."Two hours after that, the @TwitterGov account placed the blame on a customer service employee spending their last day with the company.Trump used the term "rogue employee."Earlier today @realdonaldtrumps account was inadvertently deactivated due to human error by a Twitter employee.The account was down for 11 minutes, and has since been restored.We are continuing to investigate and are taking steps to prevent this from happening again.Twitter Government (@TwitterGov) November 3, 2017 Through our investigation we have learned that this was done by a Twitter customer support employee who did this on the employees last day.We are conducting a full internal review.https://t.co/mlarOgiaRF Twitter Government (@TwitterGov) November 3, 2017 Questions remain about how the employee had that level of access to be able to delete an account, or what other sorts of tampering might be possible.Buzzfeed News cited a "former senior employee" of Twitter describing relatively easy access to certain account controls.Twitter didn't respond to a request for additional comment.The incident, coming after months of criticism of how Twitter handles the president's account, prompted speculation that the account may have been suspended.Many have wondered why the company doesn't delete some of his tweets, given their apparent violation of its rules.Twitter's rules forbid using the service to make violent threats, either direct or indirect.Accounts violating that rule may be subject to a temporary or permanent suspension, Twitter warns.Suspensions aren't uncommon on the site.Roger Stone, a longtime associate of Trump, was suspended by Twitter on Saturday after lashing out at CNN anchor Don Lemon.In January, pharmaceuticals executive Martin Shkreli was given a Twitter timeout for harassing a freelance journalist.The focus on Trump's status on the site intensified during a war of words with North Korean leadership last month, during which the president tweeted that if North Korea's foreign minister "echoes thoughts of Little Rocket Man, they won't be around much longer!"The tweet was interpreted by many, including the foreign minister, as a threat of military action against the country.Twitter acknowledged that Trump's tweet had caused an uproar but said it was allowed to stay because of its "newsworthiness."Trump has other accounts he can tweet from besides his personal account, which has 41 million followers.He can also send tweets from official accounts such as @POTUS, which has nearly 21 million followers, or @WhiteHouse, which counts nearly 16 million followers.First published Nov. 2 at 4:09 p.m. PT.Updateat 5:19 p.m. PT: Added tweet from @TwitterGov.Update at 7:20 p.m. PT: Added tweet about rogue employee.Update, Nov. 3 at 6:45 a.m. PT: Added tweet from President Trump.Solving for XX: The industry seeks to overcome outdated ideas about "women in tech."Special Reports: All of CNET's most in-depth features in one easy spot.
Art meets science in the kitchen of a top Barcelona restaurant:::::Up Next 24 things you should never, ever go...
On assignment in the fire zone with iPhone X:::::
Science passes the taste test at these top restaurants:::::This is part of CNET's "Dining Redefined" series about how technology is changing the way you eat.Crunch!My teeth pierce the crisp outer shell and sink through a fine layer of honey-infused dough, allowing the creme fraiche with its precious cargo of glossy caviar to spill over my tongue.The little black pearls pop like starbursts between my teeth, each sending a salty hit into the creamy, crispy, fluffy mix.Chef Eduard Xatruch of Disfrutar in Barcelona likes to call this dish "the best sandwich in the world."I choose to fondly remember it as a fried pillow of joy sent from heaven to save my tastebuds from yet another plate of patatas bravas.Cooking this bite-size masterpiece in hot oil while maintaining the freshness of its cool, soft center is no easy feat, but these magic tricks are a big part of what Disfrutar, an experimental Catalonian restaurant filled with natural light, is all about.Andrew Hoyle/CNET It's fiddly work that's preceded by months of research in the team's lab in the basement of the restaurant -- all to get the science of it right.It's also this innovation that earned Disfrutar the accolade of the One to Watch in the World's Best 50 Restaurants Awards 2017.Serving up foams and multi-sensory theatrics at the dinner table -- sometimes referred to as molecular gastronomy or modernist cuisine -- are considered the hallmarks of scientific cooking.That style has fallen out of favor with food critics these days, but just as technology has infused itself into most aspects of our lives, top restaurants are embracing science and innovation in the kitchen in other ways.You just may not see it."The way to think about it is that the techniques have become embedded in many kitchens already (think sous vide), but perhaps chefs are now moving on from drawing attention to the science of cooking and focusing more on the end result," said Charles Spence, a gastrophysicist (yes, that's a thing) who runs Oxford University's Crossmodal Research Laboratory.Restaurant-goers might therefore need to look beyond what is served to see the science at work, because in some cases in can be more than just a dish -- it can be a whole new ethos of running a restaurant.Waste not, want not When it comes to science in cooking, one area that is seeing innovative leaps is how restaurants handle waste, according to Adam Coghlan, UK editor of Eater."Food waste and sustainability is absolutely rightly becoming much less avoidable for chefs than it perhaps once was," he said.Doug McMaster is best known for pioneering no-waste cooking at Silo in Brighton, an English seaside resort town about a two-hour drive south of London.McMaster is taking that concept to his new project, Cub, in London.It's a joint effort with his friend Ryan Chetiyawardana, also known as Mr Lyan, the man responsible for Dandylyan, which won the World's Best Cocktail Bar 2017 in the 11th annual Spirited Awards -- a sort of Oscars for the drinks industry.In the entrance to Silo, McMaster told me, he has a vast stainless top-of-the-range composting machine.He calls it "the biggest oxymoron," because there's usually nothing to put in it due to his approach of using every bit of a product."It's only waste if you don't know what to do with," he said."But we do know what to do with it, so it's not."A similar approach to cooking is being taken at Cub, except using up byproducts from ingredients will also be carried over into drinks, which will be carefully matched with the dishes.For one drink, McMaster pickles rose petals that fall in a local florist's shop and mixes the leftover pickle juice with run-off liquid from the sourdough bread he makes (milling his own flour, of course).The pair have had plenty of experience doing this having previously worked on a project that involved making wine without using grapes.So what did they use?"Everything else," said Chetiyawardana.They matched the flavor profiles of wines they liked to other ingredients like rehydrated jams, dried fruits, herbs and spices and attempted to re-create them.Andrew Hoyle/CNET Flavor profiling -- the breaking down of flavors into their component parts to better understand how they taste -- is a science they will continue to use at Cub to find innovative ways to use up foodstuffs that would normally be waste.In charge of this is their third partner in the project, Arielle Johnson, a fellow at MIT Media Lab and formerly the head of research at Rene Redzepi's MAD Symposium in Copenhagen, an annual gathering of chefs, farmers and academics.For the trio, it's about going back to the drawing board and taking another look at ingredients and ways of cooking that might have fallen out of favor, and using modern flavor profiling to suggest ways in which they might delight the tastebuds.Extracting tech from technique At Disfrutar, the end goal is the same, but the emphasis is more on developing new techniques.I watch as sous chef Nil Dulcet squirts creamed corn into spherifying gel, bringing it back to life as corn kernels and reassembling them into a corn ear.When I try it, there's all the taste of corn, but with all the texture of silk.The chefs at Disfrutar have pioneered this technique, called "multispherification," which allows the spherified balls to cling together when set."For us, this is the best of creativity, to be able to make new things and new concepts," said Xatruch."When you make one technique or one concept you can [use it to] make hundreds of different dishes."Andrew Hoyle/CNET But while their techniques might be avant garde, their tools are not.Setting up a new restaurant gave the chefs free reign to install whatever equipment they liked, but inside the kitchen there was no sous vide or 3D food printer in sight.Xatruch insists that to be creative you only need your hands, not "strange machines."The only tech that stands out is a cheap pressure cooker purchased on a research trip to South Korea, which helps them ferment ingredients.They are no different than the machines used in Asian households for years.It's what they're putting in them -- simple, but nontraditional ingredients like cauliflower, for example -- that are different.The embrace of techniques like fermentation and other "more primitive styles of cooking" are for Coghlan where exciting change is occurring in the restaurant industry.He sees innovation as "the reclaiming of old practices that went out of fashion, rather than introducing new technology that's in fashion."Meat-free menus Science and tech are central to one hot trend: creating vegetarian dishes that would satisfy even the most meat-inclined omnivores.The immense popularity of the veggie-friendly, lab-grown Impossible Burger is proof that the consumption of an alternative protein source can become a bucket-list dining experience.Perhaps we're not all dining out on crickets just yet, but edible insects are certainly making the restaurant scene more interesting for those keen to cut down on meat."Restaurants will become more creative and innovative as more is known and explored in this area of food science," said Coghlan."The price of meat is rocketing and it just becomes unsustainable for restaurants to carry on buying meat and serving meat at an affordable price."The movement toward better sustainability has its roots in nose-to-tail cooking -- where every part of an animal is used on a menu -- but is now becoming more radical by moving away from meat altogether.Cub, which has an almost entirely meat-free menu, will only use animal products if they fit within its ethos by deriving from organic food systems rather than industrial farming.At launch, it has no meat dishes on its menu, which was a conscious decision, McMaster said."I feel like it's a responsibility of ours to do the right thing."As for the customers, they don't seem to mind or even notice."It wasn't until the end that we realized we had had no meat or fish," wrote a reviewer for London lifestyle site the Handbook about the restaurant.Andrew Hoyle/CNET For Coghlan, science is a means to an end, a way for some chefs to be creative in the kitchen."It's those things that matter more than what gel you use to spherify an olive," he said.Science may have fallen out of fashion, but many top restaurants continue to make it work for them with creative approaches.For Disfrutar, it resulted not only in the aforementioned accolade, but a Michelin star and rave reviews from critics.(According to The Times it is "currently the best restaurant in Barcelona.")Crucially, science isn't the only thing the restaurant does well -- it fulfils its basic mission: Disfrutar is Spanish for "to enjoy," and enjoyable it definitely is.Rebooting the Reef: CNET dives deep into how tech can help save Australia's Great Barrier Reef.The Smartest Stuff: Innovators are thinking up new

Rep. Adam Schiff: We're just getting started on Russia fight:::::Alex Wong / Getty Images Rep. Adam Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said there's a lot more work to be done when it comes to the Russia problem.Top executives from Facebook, Google and Twitter traveled to Capitol Hill this week to testify before Schiff's committee, along with two other Senate subcommittees, to discuss the use of their platforms by Russian foreign agents to interfere with last year's US election.Lawmakers from both sides of the political aisles spent hours grilling the Silicon Valley execs on what steps they're taking to stop Russia from manipulating their platforms.The hearings were the latest twist in the high-profile investigation into Russia's influence over the US election, with Congress looking to hold Silicon Valley accountable for its role.At issue in the overall inquiry is how much the Russian government may have attempted to influence the electorate and whether President Donald Trump or anyone working for him was knowingly involved.Trump has repeatedly denied involvement.Now Playing: Watch this: Senators show frustration with Facebook, Google and Twitter Part of the purpose of these committee hearings was to gauge whether regulations are needed to help prevent this kind of information manipulation.Such legislation has already been proposed in the Senate.The Honest Ads Act, sponsored by Sens.Mark Warner, a Democrat from Virginia; Amy Klobuchar a Democrat from Minnesota; and John McCain, a Republican from Arizona, would require social networks to meet the same standards that political ads on TV and radio must meet.CNET caught up with Schiff after the hearing to hear his thoughts on how the Silicon Valley execs performed and where the inquiry into Russian meddling may go from here.Below is an edited excerpt from the conversation.Are you satisfied with the performance of the Facebook, Google and Twitter lawyers at the House Intelligence Committee hearing?Schiff: We should view this hearing as just the beginning of oversight and discussions.There is only so much you can cover in a couple of hours.A lot of questions that were asked [during the hearing] are going to need a lot of follow up.Both in terms of understanding the full extent of the use of the Russian use of the platforms, but also understanding more broadly how these platforms might accentuate some of the divisions in our society that made us so vulnerable to the Russians.What kind of follow-up would you like to see?Schiff: We'll be releasing all the Facebook ads and targeting information and that will help us by allowing outside experts to analyze that and share information with us that may not be readily apparent to us.I've also asked the companies to work together on the joint report to the Congress.They are in a far better position to understand how the Russians used their platforms and built interest in one platform to target people using another platform.Other committees will be interested in some of the broader issues in terms of how these algorithms work and what the societal impacts are.Several lawmakers during the hearings today were dismayed that it took the companies so long to admit that the Russian interference was significant.How seriously do you think they take this problem?Schiff: They were slow to realize the use of their platforms during the campaign by Russia.They've acknowledged as much.One of the things we tried to get a sense of in the hearing is once they were made aware of it, how exhaustive has their internal forensic work been and how much work still needs to be done?They've admitted that they were slow to see it and the question now is where do we go from here?What about legislation?Do you think the Honest Ads legislation introduced in the Senate is necessary?Schiff: I do.It's almost inevitable that we will have a statutory requirement or regulatory requirement that political ads on social media have the same transparent disclosure that ads do on TV, in print media and on radio.Those disclose who is paying the freight.That will almost certainly happen.Beyond that we have a lot more oversight to do before we can consider any other further regulation.What do you think about the elections coming up in 2018 and beyond?Congressman Mike Quigley, a Democrat from Illinois, noted that right before the House Intelligence Committee hearing began, a "fake news" story was the top trending item on Twitter under the hashtag #NewYorkAttack.Will the platforms be ready for 2018?Schiff: On the one hand, we will be better prepared to ferret out some of this content.On the other hand, the Russians will be more sophisticated in hiding the origins of their social media propaganda.So we will continue to try to identify the bad actors out there.In terms of broader issues around the propagation of false and divisive news and misinformation like what we saw on Twitter during the hearing regarding the New York terror attack -- that is a big problem.And we are going to keep the focus on it.The Trump campaign during the election was retweeting and resharing a lot of this Russian sponsored information.Do you think they just weren't savvy enough to recognize what was real and what wasn't?Schiff: In some cases, it may be that they were duped.In some cases, it may have been willful blindness.In other cases, it may have been a desire to push whatever false or negative information that was out there without really caring whether it was true or not.The president continues to do that today, so why should it have been different during the campaign?Are you looking into whether there was a connection between what the Russians were doing and whether they were coordinating with the Trump campaign?Schiff: I look at the social media campaign the Russians did as a kind of independent expenditure and in cases where you have a group doing an independent expenditure, even a domestic actor, there are often allegations that a so-called "independent" group is in fact working in coordination with the campaign, we have to do an investigation.We have to find out if this particular campaign by the Russians was truly independent or whether there was some level of coordination.It's too early to reach a conclusion about that.The Smartest Stuff: Innovators are thinking up new ways to make you, and the things around you, smarter.iHate: CNET looks at how intolerance is taking over the internet.
iPhone X captures California wine country destruction:::::Standing in the remains of what was once her bedroom, a woman in her 40s wearing a red shirt wields a wood-framed wire-mesh screen to sift through piles of fluffy gray ash and twisted metal.It's been three weeks since an inferno raced through California's wine country, destroying more than 8,000 buildings, but the smell of smoke still lingers in Santa Rosa, one of the cities hardest hit by the largest wildfire in the state's history.Residents of Sonoma's county seat are beginning to comb through the ashes, returning to a devastation that's been compared to being flattened by a nuclear bomb.James Martin/CNET Homes are leveled in Coffey Park and Fountaingrove, two neighborhoods in Santa Rosa, home to more than 175,000 people.The fires destroyed nearly everything, including everyday household items that are now toxic ash.That includes remnants of paint, propane, pesticides, plastics, fertilizers, gasoline and other chemicals.All that toxic debris has to be removed by the Environmental Protection Agency before any rebuilding can begin.It's the critical first step in recovery -- done before property owners can sift through what's left or before the Army Corps of Engineers can begin construction.I was one of the first photographers to test the front and rear-facing cameras on Apple's iPhone X, which is being released Friday.I also live in the San Francisco Bay Area, where smoke and ash blanketed the region for more than a week as wildfires rampaged through Sonoma and Napa counties, just 50 miles north of the city.Now that the fires have been contained, I wanted to document what needs to be done before Napa and Sonoma counties -- some of the most beautiful spots in Northern California -- can emerge from such unimaginable devastation.James Martin/CNET And I wanted to use the iPhone X to do it.So I went to Santa Rosa with the EPA on Wednesday as they cleared a path through the toxic mess.James Martin/CNET After the first half hour of shooting, I realized I wouldn't need the DSLR camera I always have with me.The iPhone X did what I needed it to do.First steps "We are here to collect all household hazardous waste from all the burned parcels in Sonoma County," says Tom Dunkelman, fire response leader for EPA District 9 in Northern California.Dunkelman estimates the EPA will have to clear about 6,200 parcels of property in the area.It takes about 10 minutes to survey and remove waste from a standard-size neighborhood lot.The EPA crew here today numbers five to six technicians in full hazard gear, with other teams operating simultaneously throughout the county.James Martin/CNET "We've been collecting since Friday," Dunkelman tells me, "so it makes this day five.So far we've cleaned up more than 2,000 properties."The EPA has three goals.First: to prevent chemicals from further contaminating the environment.Second: to make sure it's safe for other cleanup workers to come onto the property.And third, to properly (and safely) dispose of hazardous waste."We know our pace will slow down as we get into the more rural parts of the county, but we're trying to get everything done as fast as possible so that everybody else can start removing the ash and debris and start rebuilding," he says.James Martin/CNET I watch crews move through each parcel and identify toxic hotspots.It starts as one crew member -- kitted out in a white protective suit, yellow boots, green gloves and respirator -- walks around with a safety monitor to make sure the air is safe for the others to breathe.They follow behind, probe the ashes, collect gas and chemical containers and carry them to the curb.Everyone stays clear of the unstable structures still standing."If we see anything unusual -- anything explosives or radioactive, asbestos -- we have a second follow-up response team that comes in to address it."Dunkelman says.It's a long and difficult process to remove such debris.I shot this story in one day, taking several hundred photos.I made only basic edits on the images for contrast, color and saturation, either right on the iPhone X or in Adobe Lightroom the same as I would for any project.Closeups were often shot in Portrait Mode.James Martin/CNET After I got home and scanned through the photos, I was shocked by the power and beauty of the images I'd captured with a phone.The fire was more devastating than I had ever imagined.These images will make sure I never forget.Want to help the Napa and Sonoma wine country recover?You can send donations to the American Red Cross.
Amazon shuts down Fresh grocery delivery service in some areas:::::James Martin/CNET Don't get too used to those fruit and vegetable deliveries.Amazon is shutting down its Fresh grocery delivery service for some people in the US.According to emails sent to customers in parts of Pennsylvania and New Jersey, which were seen by Reuters, AmazonFresh deliveries will stop after 30 Nov.There are also posts on Twitter that suggest services will be cut in Maryland and California.Now Playing: Watch this: Here's how Amazon's new in-home delivery service works These revelations come after the online retail giant purchased Whole Foods for $13.2 billion earlier in the year.Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.9 things Alexa can't yet do: Our wishlist of features Amazon needs to add to its smart assistant.The Smartest Stuff: Innovators are thinking up new ways to make you -- and the world around you -- smarter.
iPhone X goes on sale, bringing out the true Apple superfans:::::Claire Reilly/CNET Production problems?Forget it.The iPhone 8?A distant memory.Throwing down more than a grand for the latest and greatest iPhone?That's what they're here for.The iPhone X went on sale around the world on Friday, drawing crowds and long lines as Apple fans patiently waited to get their hands on the very best iPhone money can buy.And spend money they did.The iPhone X (that's pronounced "ten" not "ex") just scrapes in under 1K in the US and UK, with a starting price of $999 and 999, respectively.Now Playing: Watch this: Apple fans finally get hands on with the iPhone X But in Australia, one of the first countries in the world to start selling the device, that price goes up to AU$1,579.And if you want the larger 256GB capacity, you'll spend a whopping AU$1,879.(That's $1,149 or 1,149 in the US and UK.)This second launch, which comes more than a month after the launch of the iPhone 8, is the latest wrinkle in the annual gathering of Apple fanboys, gadget enthusiasts and publicity seekers.Apple's decision to stagger the launches presented consumers with the dilemma of buying the more readily available iPhone 8 immediately, or holding out for the supposedly supply-constrained iPhone X. Claire Reilly To the people who showed up today, there was no question which iPhone won out.They turned out in droves, despite (or maybe because of) early murmurings of production delays and reports that Apple might ship only half the number of devices it originally planned.For many, it's the only way to get the device on launch day, with pre-orders for the Nov. 3 shipping date selling out in as little as 10 minutes.Now, customers are facing delays of up to six weeks to get the true flagship Apple phone.Sydney Apple's flagship Australian store in Sydney was the first in the world to sell the new iPhone, and early birds were queuing since the start of the week to be able to buy it off the shelf.First through the doors were Sydneysiders Bishoy Behman, who'd been lining up for a week to buy the iPhone and who livestreamed the event on his iPhone 8 Plus, and Mazen Kourouche, who queued from Friday morning after preordering "literally the minute" orders opened last week.So why buy the iPhone X when you have a weeks-old device in your hand?"It's the new iPhone.It's a new generation," said Behman, who bought one 256GB iPhone X for himself and one to sell."I'm excited for this.The 8, not so much."A software engineering student and part-time tech blogger, Kourouche did an unboxing for me in the store."The notch doesn't seem to be intruding," he says, referring to the black section at the top of the screen."I'm going to have to get used to no home button."Next to him, 19-year-old Chinese studies student Jesse Goodwin plays with the Face ID he's just set up, but he has some doubts."When I'm in China, I wear a face mask so I won't be able to unlock the phone."Huang Shuxian for CNET Japan Japan was hyped about the iPhone X as well, as lines at the Apple Store in Shibuya district in Tokyo stretched to at least two streets away.Apple has a considerable fanbase in Japan, so it was no surprise to find that there was huge interest in the new phone.China Over in Beijing, lines at the Apple Store in Sanlitun weren't as crazy long as they were in Japan.With five different outlets in China's capital city, Apple iPhone X buyers were more spread out.Still, there was plenty of enthusiasm for the new phone.Serial Apple queuer Lloyd Yu, 31, who works at a startup, was first in line since 5 a.m., and got two 256GB iPhone Xs in Space Grey.He already owns an iPhone 8 Plus and wanted to upgrade because he's a big fan of Apple."Everything Apple does, I accept, because everything Apple designs, is the best," said Yu, adding that he's also looking to try out Face ID.Yu, who's apparently a familiar face to Apple employees, was seen hugging and chatting with staff.By the time he left the store, surprisingly, the lines seemed to have grown larger compared to earlier in the morning, a response that's considerably different from Apple's iPhone 8 lackluster launch.Aloysius Low/CNET Singapore Rain didn't dampen the spirits of Apple fans in Singapore, who queued to buy the iPhone X from the sole Apple store in South East Asia.Zoey Chong/CNET Queues started early, with 52 year-old Singaporean homemaker Ala Ahmed telling CNET she'd been waiting since 6.30 a.m. Thursday to get four iPhones for her son and his friends who were away serving their national service.But others came from much further afield.Kittiwat Wang and Supakorn Rieksiri, two 22-year-old students from Bangkok, Thailand, preordered their iPhones online and flew to Singapore to pick them up.The two friends said devices get to Singapore much earlier than Thailand, making it worth the short flight.Further down the queue, student Christine Nguyen, also 22, came from Vietnam with four friends for launch day, saying she'd waited for the iPhone X because the iPhone 8 hadn't seemed too different from earlier models.London First to get their hands on an iPhone X in the UK was son of celebrity chef Marco Pierre White, Marco Pierre White Jr.The 22-year-old handed over his payment in cash, flashing 50 notes at waiting photographers and grinning as he picked up two 256GB iPhone Xs, one black, one white.Andrew Hoyle/CNET The celebrity offspring, who is also a model, said he had been waiting two days in the cold.He claimed to also already have an iPhone X, given to him early by a friend who worked at Carphone Warehouse, supposedly bringing his total up to three.What is he going to do with all those iPhones?"I don't know, man," he said, adding that he hadn't really given it much thought."I'm going home to sleep."Pierre White live-streamed his Apple Store experience on his Samsung phone."I'm glad to be back with Apple," he said.Andrew Hoyle/CNET Lines outside the store were longer than they have been in recent years.Without about 250 people in line, there were significantly more takers for the X than there were for the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus in September, when only about 20 people bothered to show up to the capital's Regent Street store for opening time.The most talked-about feature by far during the wait was the huge display, which drew admirers despite the controversial "notch.""It's the screen that I really got it for," said Troy Kennedy, 28, from London as he picked up his 256GB iPhone X in slate grey.He'd initially bought an iPhone 8, but returned it when he decided he wanted the X."It's been a really long time waiting for Apple to release a really bad-ass product," he said.New York The scene at the Apple Store along Fifth Avenue in Manhattan was even more hectic than usual on an iPhone launch day.That's because the store wasn't even there, replaced with a smartly decorated -- but temporary -- space nearby housed inside the former FAO Schwarz toy store (yes, the one from the movie "Big").The Apple Store's iconic glass cube was torn down and tall, green barriers encircled the area, making room for a construction site that will eventually give way to a remodeled glass cube and store.Instead of crowds gathering around the cube, the lines for the new iPhone X were bunched up alongside the temporary location, right next to the construction site.Just in time for the store's opening, the media gaggle was hurried inside to witness Apple employees countdown from 10 (very on message for this particular launch) and high five entrants as they eagerly showed up to relieve themselves of $999 or more.There was no obligatory media circus to interview the first person to snag an iPhone X, since there was not enough room.Instead, the scene in the store was a mess of activity and commerce, with plenty of folks flashing piles of cash to grab Apple's latest gadget.Supplies, at least at the Fifth Avenue store and the location on the Upper West Side, seemed plentiful.Apple Store Upper West Side (Manhattan) had More iPhone Xs than we thought we would.They had not run out at 10AM.pic.twitter.com/eCOYwrsa2C David Carnoy (@DavidCarnoy) November 3, 2017 Stefan Dumitrescu, an 18-year-old Romanian studying film in New York, was at the Fifth Avenue store and bought three iPhone Xs using a large stack of hundred dollar bills, with plans to keep one and give the other two to his mom and sister back in Romania this holiday.Ever the Apple fan, he bought an iPhone 8 a few weeks ago.But he dropped it from a car window and it broke, so the device is now with AppleCare.When asked by an Apple employee if he wanted AppleCare coverage on one of his new phones, he replied: "Not anymore.I'm going to be careful this time."At another section of the store floor, Louise Howard, 54, of Manhattan, was purchasing two iPhone Xs."The other one is for my cycling instructor, because he's a very handsome man," she said, quickly adding he will be paying for it."He's not that handsome."First published Nov. 2 at 3:38 p.m. PT.Update,

iPhone X models stolen from Apple Store in San Francisco:::::James Martin/CNET Well, that's one way to skip the iPhone lines.Three "husky" men in hoodies driving a white Dodge van broke into a UPS truck Wednesday while it was parked outside a San Francisco Apple Store.It was delivering 313 of Apple's new iPhone X devices, according to a police report.The theft happened between 11:15 a.m. and 11:30 a.m. PT.The total value of the stolen merchandise was estimated to be more than $370,000.The iPhone X, which becomes available in stores Friday, starts at $999 apiece.The suspects haven't yet been caught.Each phone was cataloged with a description and serial number, which meant the police report was one of the "fattest" Sgt.Paul Weggenmann had ever seen, he said.People who planned to pick up their preordered iPhones at the Stonestown store will still get their devices on time, a person familiar with the matter said.Stealing iPhones has long been a lucrative business, but Apple's "Find My iPhone" and remote lockout feature have caused a drop in stolen devices.For enterprising thieves, the key is getting an iPhone before those services have been set up.What makes this theft especially notable is that it comes just before the launch of the iPhone X, one of Apple's most high-profile products in years.Apple bills the gadget as the "future of the smartphone."The device may end up becoming the hottest Apple has ever sold.Customers preordered more than twice as many iPhone X units in the first four days than the previous record holder, the iPhone 6, according to data from Slice Intelligence.It set that record despite reportedly sparse supplies, which have pushed some preorder deliveries to mid-December.Nov. 3 availability for the iPhone X disappeared within minutes when preorders began early Oct. 27.As for the theft, the UPS driver had locked the cargo area after parking outside the Stonestown Galleria mall in the southwest Lakeside neighborhood of San Francisco, according to the police report.A janitor spotted the suspects unloading boxes from the UPS truck and into a Dodge van and snapped a photo."It's suspicious they were able to get that large a haul on that day," he said.UPS said it's working with law enforcement investigating the theft.The theft was earlier uncovered by local San Francisco television station, KTSF.
Creating a CG Spider-Man for 'Homecoming':::::Up Next 24 things you should never, ever go...
How 'Homecoming' visual effects spun a CG Spider-Man:::::To play Spider-Man, Tom Holland drew on his background as a dancer to athletically throw himself into spectacular stunts.But "Spider-Man: Homecoming" also features an entirely computer-generated digital double -- and not always for the reasons you might think."Homecoming" is available for home viewing in the US now, and swings onto Blu-ray and DVD in the UK on 20 Nov. To find out more about creating computer-generated (CG) characters for effects-driven blockbusters like "Homecoming", I caught up with Theo Bialek, visual effects supervisor at Sony Pictures Imageworks, which was responsible for the film's climactic fight scenes.To create each action-packed sequence, "Homecoming" director Jon Watts filmed Holland and Michael Keaton, who plays the villainous Vulture, on sets and against green screen.These "plates" -- shots of actual actors and stunt performers on real sets -- were composited to create a finished shot, or used as reference by Bialek and his visual effects team to build their CG characters.Of the 300 or so shots Bialek's team created for the film's finale, more than a hundred involved an entirely CG Spider-Man.CNET: How do you decide when to use plates featuring real footage of the actors and when to use a digital double?Bialek: There's some shots that were plates, and then they switched them to all-CG because they wanted to do an action that was different to what they shot.But generally we push the client to use a plate as much as we can, just because when you have a lot of all-CG shots next to each other it's harder to pull that off and still keep the audience grounded and not pulled out from it.It's always nice to have shots in there that are real to bookend the CG, or interspersed, to keep us anchored.Sometimes there'd be a plate shot and they didn't like the way the ears came out of the mask so we would replace the head, or just do the shot all-CG.Wait, you'd literally completely replace Spider-Man's head because they didn't like how the ears looked?Bialek: Yeah, the ears stick out from the mask.Or if the suit just didn't look quite right in that particular shot because of a stain on it or something like that.That was rare, though.Now Playing: Watch this: Spinning a CG Spider-Man How did you draw on the real footage of the actors, and why did you look at footage where they messed up a stunt as well as when they got it right?Bialek: A lot of times we'd look at something we animated and it just didn't feel right, and it was hard to put your finger on exactly why because he was doing all the things he should be doing.Then you go and you look at the reference and you realize his knee knocks over and hits this other knee and it kind of buckles in on itself when he's taking his weight or when he steps back.You wouldn't always think to put that in.It would be the way that he would kind of relax his shoulders, or when he was talking how he might try to use his hands a little bit -- just keying in on those mannerisms.What kind of individual mannerisms did you identify in Tom Holland and Michael Keaton?Bialek: For Tom, the way he runs, his gait.When you look at the mo-cap you can tell it's Tom.It's the way his shoulders drop and the way he holds himself, his posture.Keaton, not so much.He was a little more difficult because when we're doing him all-CG, he would be in his exoskeleton wingsuit.His mannerisms wouldn't be translated to his suit because you wouldn't move naturally in a suit that's confined to an armature.We would key into how he paced himself because the character he's playing doesn't move super-fast.His suit allows him to fly quickly, but he wouldn't react faster than a normal person.Now Playing: Watch this: Spider-Man vs the Vulture's villainous visual effects Spider-man wears a mask, so you can't see his face in action scenes.From an effects point of view is that a blessing, or is it difficult to make a blank face relatable?Bialek: That's a huge blessing.It's so much easier to pull off.For almost all of the shots in the beach battle Spider-Man has his mask off and he's got a CG face, but it's at a distance and there's a lot of smoke and firelight flickering so the facial animation and the hair simulation didn't have to hold up to being a close-up shot.When he's wearing the mask and there's dialog, we still animate it underneath the mask.When he's breathing hard, we have the mask kind of suck in and suck out.Those are things you want to keep it relatable, so it doesn't feel like a puppet or something.For more on "Spider-Man: Homecoming", find out why the toughest effect was Tony Stark's hair and why director Jon Watts knows how Peter Parker feels.Now Playing: Watch this: How the "Spider-Man: Homecoming" invisible jet fight...

Travel through another dimension with 'Twilight Zone' reboot:::::That's the signpost up ahead.Next stop, "The Twilight Zone" reboot.CBS is bringing the classic sci-fi anthology series back on CBS All Access, the network's subscription streaming service, CBS CEO Leslie Moonves announced during the company's earnings call Thursday.(Disclosure: CBS is CNET's parent company.)Moonves didn't offer many details on the reboot, but sources told The Hollywood Reporter the show will come from "Get Out" filmmaker Jordan Peele's Monkeypaw Productions, and that Marco Ramirez, executive producer of Netflix drama "The Defenders," will serve as showrunner.CBS called the report "not confirmed and very premature."A CBS spokeswoman declined to elaborate.The original "Twilight Zone," hosted by the smooth-voiced Rod Serling, ran on CBS from 1959 to 1964.It consisted of 156 memorable episodes, all shot in black and white and featuring self-contained short dramas, often with psychological or science-fiction-based twist endings.Peele's 2017 hit movie "Get Out" was called "a queasy African-American version of 'The Twilight Zone'" by Variety."The Twilight Zone" has already been revived twice, once from 1985 to 1989 and once for one season in 2002 and 2003."Twilight Zone: The Movie" came out in 1983.CBS All Access is home to the new series "Star Trek: Discovery," which was recently renewed for a second season.
The 5 'House of Cards' endings we'll probably never see:::::Spoiler alert: Events from all five seasons of "House of Cards" are discussed below.Better go binge before reading on.Almost five years after changing the landscape of television, the Netflix political drama "House of Cards" appears to be collapsing in a manner befitting its title.Allegations of sexual assault against Kevin Spacey and the actor-producer's botched apology were followed by word this week that production of the show's sixth and final season has been suspended indefinitely.Netflix The off-set controversy is appropriate in a sad and troubling way for a show that made its name with an over-the-top political story line and cast of ruthless and craven antiheroes.The show's first few seasons also earned wide acclaim, awards nominations, and wins for Spacey, co-star Robin Wright and director David Fincher.Along the way, "House of Cards" changed how we watch television, when Netflix made all 13 episodes of the first season available at the same time.Almost overnight, the show made binge-watching a mainstream phenomenon and transformed Netflix and other streaming services into major players in television.But now, nearly half a decade in to the series, it seems we may never get to learn what becomes of the most murderous couple to ever occupy the White House, just as the series was taking a major turn.Even if we've binged our last season of the show, we can still imagine what could have happened in season six to wrap up the whole thing.With that in mind, here are five suggested endings to the show that changed how we watch shows.The British ending The Netflix production of "House of Cards" is adapted from a trilogy of BBC miniseries that aired in the 1990s.The original version sees British Francis ascending to the height of power, only to eventually die in an assassination setup by his wife.It would be interesting for the series to stay true to its roots and find a way for Claire to have Frank taken out in order to make him a martyr and rehabilitate his public image and legacy.This plot twist would have the added bonus of making it significantly easier for Claire to have "her turn," her way.Surely this was at least considered for the series finale script that we may never see.Leave it where it is A key thread throughout the series has been the slow but steady ascent of Claire Underwood toward a more powerful position than that of her husband, Francis.The couple has remained loyal to only two things: each other and the pursuit of power.But season five finally brought these two pursuits onto a collision course, leaving us to wonder if the Underwoods might finally go to war with each other.The final moment of what may be the last episode ever produced gives us a recently sworn-in President Claire Underwood refusing to answer calls from her exiled husband before looking straight into the camera and saying simply: "My Turn."It's actually a rather fitting ending to the whole thing, which leaves the door open for a spinoff series without Spacey.Doug's revenge Season five ends with loyal Underwood foot soldier and former Chief of Staff Doug Stamper under house arrest as he prepares to take the fall for Francis' murder of the reporter Zoe Barnes.For those interested in seeing justice done in the "House of Cards" universe, Stamper could be the key to a satisfying ending.Having lost everything, and unable to lean on the crutches of alcohol or workaholism as in the past, Stamper could see the light in a final season.Perhaps he learns that LeAnn Harvey survived the car crash the Underwoods set up to murder her at the end of season five and decides to take the Underwoods down with him.It would add a nice bit of catharsis and comeuppance to the show's roiling pit of death, deception and darkness.The war of the Underwoods I suspect this may be what the actual plan for season six entailed: We see Francis and Claire finally go to war with each other as Claire begins her presidency using the promise of a pardon as leverage over her husband.I could see the feuding easily filling a final season, only to end with the long-awaited demise of the Underwoods and the beginning of a Mark Usher administration that promises to be no less dirty.Then we all wait for the announcement of the Campbell Scott and Patricia Clarkson-led spinoff series with just as much madness and corruption, but this time from two tragically underappreciated actors finally getting their breakout roles.The "Fear of the Underwoods' Dead" Just think how much better the show could be with zombies.Season six could be when we learn of the voodoo spell cast on the Underwoods at Elysian Fields that results in all their victims rising from the dead to exact their brain-eating revenge.It could be the only satisfying way for the show to complete its trajectory toward more darkness.Final scene: a zombie-fied Zoe Barnes turns to the camera and utters the line, "Now, it's my turn," through her decomposing face before chowing down on Frank's cerebrum.Now that's vanguard television.Let us know in the comments below how you'd end one more season of "House of Cards."You can

DOJ undecided on AT&T-Time Warner deal:::::Roberto Machado Noa/Getty Images Will it be an amicable deal -- or a federal case?That's the question hanging over a megadeal between AT&T and Time Warner Cable valued at $85 billion as of last year.According to The Wall Street Journal, the US Department of Justice is looking into how it would build a case against the acquisition in federal court, if it comes to that.Sources told the Journal that the regulatory agency is just as likely to reach a settlement with the companies that would let the deal go forward without running afoul of antitrust law.At the heart of the Justice Department's quandary is whether AT&T, the second-biggest wireless carrier in the US, will create a monopoly by buying Time Warner, the second-biggest cable company in the US.Combining the companies would place two huge consumer markets under one banner, making it so more consumers would pay all their bills for internet access and cable television to the same company.Market analysts predicted smooth sailing for the deal, and the possibility of a lawsuit makes things more uncertain, according to the Journal."When the DOJ reviews any transaction, it is common and expected for both sides to prepare for all possible scenarios," AT&T said in a statement, noting that "vertical" mergers are always approved because they don't eliminate competitors from the marketplace."While we won't comment on our discussions with DOJ, we see no reason in the law or the facts why this transaction should be an exception."Time Warner didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.First published at 2:44 p.m. PT.Update, 3:16 p.m.: Adds comment from AT&T.
Why UN cybercrime chief calls attacks an economic issue:::::There isn't a day that goes by where we don't see a company or government losing an enormous amount of data, according to Neil Walsh, Chief of the UN Office on Drugs & Crime Global Cybercrime Programme.TechRepublic's Dan Patterson met with Walsh to discuss what companies can learn from cyberattacks targeting governments and NGOs.It's getting increasingly harder for companies and organizations to retain trust from the public after experiencing a cyberattack, he said.Every time there is a hack, or a loss of a large amount of data, the public loses confidence.While there may be confusion about who should take responsibility for cybersecurity in an organization, "this is a corporate responsibility."SEE: Cybersecurity in 2017: A roundup of predictions (Tech Pro Research) "Cybersecurity is as important as keeping your staff physically secure," he added.And until companies recognize that and make it routine, cyberattacks will continue to happen.Because everyone plays a role in cybersecurity, Walsh suggests for individuals to do three things: Keep your data backed up on a separate device which isn't online, and keep your software up to date, and be careful what you click on.Once cyberweapons are created and leaked, there isn't a way to confine them.Cybercriminals will take something that may have been used for one purpose, and then turn it into something that causes much more harm, and can be used for many other techniques."The broader harm that comes from that continues to echo," he said.With the IoT and the amount of devices emerging into the market, "we got to do what we can to try to secure things like this from the public because ultimately, as we see from every ransomware attack, it hits countries across the globe.It has an impact on poverty, it has an impact on economy, it has an impact on prosperity.This isn't just technology.This impacts people's lives here and now," he said.For more cybersecurity tips, subscribe to TechRepublic's Cybersecurity Insider newsletter.Subscribe Also see Image: iStock/BeeBright
Microsoft to close Windows 10 free upgrade loophole:::::Microsoft is quietly closing the final loophole that allows PC users to claim a free Windows 10 upgrade.The last remaining way for Windows 7 and 8.1 users to claim the upgrade is using the "assistive technologies" exception.That exception will soon be shut down, with Microsoft updating its page for assistive technologies to include the line: "The accessibility upgrade offer expires on December 31, 2017".Microsoft left the upgrade available to those who use assistive technologies, but stressed at the time that the offer was not intended as a workaround for all Window users.The Get Windows 10 upgrade programme, under which anyone running a supported version of Windows could make the switch, officially ended on July 29, 2016.The change to the FAQ appears to have been made in the past week, to coincide with the release of the Fall Creators Update.As pointed out by Ed Bott on ZDNet, the change will likely have very little effect on uptake of Windows 10, as enterprises are not exploiting this loophole, and individuals and small businesses that rejected the upgrade for more than two years are unlikely to have much appetite to switch.In May this year, Microsoft said that Windows 10 had been installed on some 500 million devices, and while the userbase is still increasing, its rate of growth does seem to be slowing.Image: Microsoft Be your company's Microsoft insider with the help of these Windows and Office tutorials and our experts' analyses of Microsoft's enterprise products.Subscribe to our Microsoft Weekly newsletter.Subscribe More on Windows 10 Fall Creators Update
US DOT reveals drone safety program that could pave the way for business use of UAVs:::::The US Department of Transportation is working on regulatory measures to allow the safe operation of drones, US Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao announced Thursday.The new, three-year Drone Integration Pilot Program will pair public entities with partners in the drone industry to create ideas on how to safely integrate drones into US airspace, according to the announcement.The partnerships will have to operate under limits from the FAA.An FAA federal register notice explained the timeframe for interested parties to apply.Applicants have 20 days from the notice's posting to submit a notice of intent to complete a full application to the FAAthe first step in the process.Interested parties, including local, state, and tribal entities, have 35 days from the posting to request to be involved.SEE: Drone policy template (Tech Pro Research) Approved applicants will be able to deploy drones within 180 days.Chao labeled the program a key priority, saying the application, and later the deployment process, will move quickly.The DOT will select a minimum of five partnerships, according to a DOT press release."These partnerships will allow local communities to experiment with new technologies like package delivery, emergency drone inspections, and more, on terms that work for them and in ways that support a unified and safe airspace," Chao told hundreds of drone operators and industry leaders at the announcement.The DOT cited research by Association of Unmanned Vehicle Systems International, saying drone usage can mean up to 100,000 new jobs.The program is designed to safely encourage innovation while giving governments more legal certainty regarding drone regulation.It gives tech companies a chance to develop and deploy new methods of using drones, helping them bring their tech to a larger stage.Other industries with the potential for immediate impact include photography, agriculture, and emergency management, according to the release.If the pilot program is successful, businesses may have new ways to do things, especially when it comes to shipping or delivering services.The program could be the regulatory step necessary to turn drone shipping experiments into a serious logistics business.Companies such as UPS and Amazon have already been experimenting with shipping with drones.The 3 big takeaways for TechRepublic readers The DOT is launching a partnership program to pair public and private entities to develop new, safe ways to use drones.After submitting a letter of intent within the next 20 days, selected private sector applicants could begin deploying drone operations within 180 days.This could be the regulatory measure that paves the way for drone-based shipping and other drone-based products or services.Stay informed, click here to subscribe to the TechRepublic Next Big Thing newsletter.Subscribe Also see

Mobile data leak of 46M users could put entire population of Malaysia at risk:::::The data of more than 46.2 million mobile phone subscribers whose phone numbers were attached to Malaysian service providers has been leaked online.The leaks were originally spotted by tech website lowyat.net in October, which confirmed the leak details in a later report.According to a Reuters report on the leaks, there was also an attempt made to sell the data on the dark web.Being that the Malaysian population is roughly 31 million people, the nation's entire population could have potentially been impacted by this data leak, Reuters reported.So, what information is at stake here?According to lowyat's initial report, the data included personal user information, ID card numbers, mobile phone numbers, SIM card information, and addresses.Both postpaid and prepaid numbers were affected from providers such as Altel, Celcom, DiGi, Enabling Asia, Friendimobile, Maxis, MerchantTradeAsia, PLDT, RedTone, TuneTalk, Umobile, and XOX.SEE: Information security incident reporting policy (Tech Pro Research) In addition to the mobile data, databases belonging to the Malaysian Medical Council (MMC), the Malaysian Medical Association (MMA), and the Malaysian Dental Association (MDA) were also leaked, lowyat reported, with 81,309 total records at risk.According to lowyat, service providers have not taken any action to mitigate the effects of the breach since it was first discovered on October 19.While it's up to the authorities to ultimately determine the source of the breach, lowyat encourage the providers to step up and do more."We are urging the telco and MVNO companies mentioned above to alert and start immediately replacing the SIM cards of all affected customers, especially those who have not updated their SIM cards since 2014," the lowyat report said."While the leaked data alone isn't sufficient to clone the SIM cards, the information available can be exploited to initiate multiple social engineering attacks against affected users."The investigation remains ongoing, but Malaysia's multimedia minister Salleh Said Keruak told reporters that several potential sources have been identified, and the government is working to finish its probe soon, Reuters reported.Malaysian citizens and frequent travelers who may have a separate Malaysian phone number should remain cautious with the amount of sensitive data they transmit via their smartphone.Contact your mobile carrier in order to receive a replacement SIM card, and change any passwords you think may be impacted.The 3 big takeaways for TechRepublic readers Some 46.2 million data records belonging to mobile users on Malaysian telcos were leaked, in an attack that was spotted and confirmed by website lowyat.net.Leaked data includes personal user information, ID card numbers, mobile phone numbers, SIM card information, and addresses, which could potentially affect all Malaysian citizens.Databases belonging to the Malaysian Medical Council (MMC), the Malaysian Medical Association (MMA), and the Malaysian Dental Association (MDA) were also leaked, putting 81,309 total records at risk.Stay informed, click here to subscribe to the TechRepublic Cybersecurity Insider newsletter.Subscribe Also see
Top 5: Things to know about Apple's Face ID:::::Apple's facial recognition system for iPhone X is not the first, but it is getting a lot of attention because it replaces fingerprint authentication entirely on the phone.Should you trust that?Here five things to know about Apple's Face ID: 1.Your face stays on the phone.Or rather, the mathematical representation of your face scan stays in the Secure Enclave.Apps and the OS itself just get a yes or no on the match, nothing else is shared.2.The face updates over time.If you grow a massive beard between logins you may have to enter your passcode, but the system will then update to take account of the changes.SEE: Mobile device computing policy (Tech Pro Research) 3.Masks supposedly can't fool it.The system works when your eyes are open and looking at the device.Apple claims it worked with Hollywood experts in special effects to make sure a really good mask wouldn't unlock phones.It uses a second neural network to spot attempts at spoofing.4.You're being scanned by infrared.The TrueDepth system that's part of FaceID uses infrared so you can even unlock the phone in dark rooms.Apple says this is safe to use under normal conditions.SEE: Special report: Cybersecurity in an IoT and mobile world (free PDF) (TechRepublic) 5.No matter what you look like, Apple says Face ID should work.The company has claimed it trained the system on billions of images and claims it used a representative group of people.That means Face ID should work the same no matter your gender, age, or ethnicity.You now know a little more to help you decide if you want to rely on Face ID in your phone.Or at least you know enough to know it should still unlock even when your face still shows the shocked look at how much you spent on the iPhone X.For more about news and tips about Apple products, subscribe to our Apple Weekly newsletter.Subscribe Also see:
Australian bank allows iPhone X Face ID logins: User dream or security nightmare?:::::Australia's Commonwealth Bank (CBA) is now the nation's first to allow customers to access their accounts using the facial recognition technology built into Apple's iPhone X, the bank announced Friday.All iPhone X users can now use Face ID to securely login to the CommBank app."Our customers use secure fingerprint logins on the CommBank App about 30 million times a month," Pete Steel, Commonwealth Bank's executive general manager of digital, said in a press release."Extending that functionality to Face ID is part of our ongoing work to provide a better banking experience to our customers through simple, easy and secure features."Face ID performs in-depth mapping of a person's face using more than 30,000 points of referencemaking it one of the most secure ways to log into an account, according to the bank.SEE: Enterprise IoT Research 2017: Benefits, Trends, and Security Concerns (Tech Pro Research) "While we strive towards convenience and ease of use, we don't implement new technology without being able to guarantee security for customers," Steel said in the release.The question remains: Is this truly secure?The answer: Yeswith caveats."Authenticating to a banking website using facial recognition from a registered phone is much more secure than using a password, which is the most common method used amongst online banks," said Gartner analyst Avivah Litan."CBA is wise to take advantage of the iPhone's enabling biometric authentication capabilities."The big caveat is that CBA must make sure the process they use to enroll their customers in Face ID is airtight, Litan said."It's not up to Apple to certify that the user using their iPhone is the user CBA expects him or her to be.That's up to CBA," she said."The enrollment process is the easiest way for criminals to circumvent biometric authentication from a smartphone.The criminal can just pretend to be someone else when they register for the CBA banking application (and biometric authentication)."But assuming the enrollment process is secure, using facial recognition to log into a bank from a registered iPhone is much more secureand potentially more convenientthan using a password, Litan said.The system would also likely be safe because the face template always resides on a secure chip in the iPhone, and is never transmitted outside the phone, according to Anil K. Jain, a Michigan State University professor who researches biometrics."For telebanking, the only information that is being communicated to the bank server is whether a customer trying to access an account is indeed the true owner of the account, verified by the Face ID," Jain said.Many banks currently use Touch ID for mobile authentication.Any apps that previously used Touch ID will now be able to support Face ID as well, and the new method is much more secure according to Apple.It's likely that we'll continue to see other banks and businesses begin using this technology.However, gaining trust from customers may be the largest hurdle to facial recognition adoption, as CNET's Alfred Ng reported.The 3 big takeaways for TechRepublic readers 1.Australia's Commonwealth Bank is now the nation's first to allow customers to access their accounts using the facial recognition technology built into Apple's iPhone X.2.Logging in to a bank account with facial recognition is more secure than using a password, experts say, so long as the process the bank uses to enroll their customers in Face ID is completely secure.3.It's likely that many businesses that were using Touch ID will now use Face ID.Image: CBA Keep up to date on all of the newest tech trends.Click here to subscribe to the TechRepublic Next Big Thing newsletter.Subscribe Also see
Cisco unveils AI-powered voice assistant to schedule and manage meetings:::::Cisco is launching an enterprise-ready voice assistant designed to streamline meetings, the company announced Thursday at its Partner Summit.Billed by the company as the first AI-powered assistant meant for businesses, the Cisco Spark Assistant helps users call others in their organization, as well as start, end, or join meetings without typing or dialing according to a Cisco press release.Using MindMeld's machine learning technology, the assistant takes the voice assistantcommonly used for personal daily activitiesbrings it to the conference room.Leaving the call-in process up to AI may reduce the chance of human error and delay while expediting the process.SEE: IT leader's guide to the future of artificial intelligence (Tech Pro Research) "During the next few years, AI meeting bots will be joining our work teams.When they do, people will be able to ditch the drudgery of meeting setup and other logistics to become more creative than ever," Rowan Trollope, general manager of Cisco's Applications Group, said in the press release.The assistant will be released in phases, beginning with the Cisco Spark Room 70 early in 2018.Available in multiple size models, Spark Rooms are conference rooms outfitted by Cisco with smart screens and cameras, according to Cisco's website.The service will eventually roll out to all Spark clients and devices, but a timeframe for that wasn't released.More like a trial, the first phase will only include a small group of users, and they will only have select features.Much like with Alexa or other voice assistants, the initial users can say, "Hey, Spark," and then start the meeting or call someone.User feedback from the first phase will be used to make the assistant smarter, the release said.Additional features, like creating meeting summaries and assigning tasks, are in the works, according to the release.Some businesses are already using voice-activated devices to help their companies, using things like Alexa skills to make work orders or fetch data.But those assistants are personal devices programmed to help with business efforts.Cisco delivers over 50 billion minutes of meetings each year, and used that knowledge to design a device specifically for enterprises.The 3 big takeaways for TechRepublic readers Cisco announced its first voice assistant created for enterprise use, initially focusing specifically on meetings.Users will be able to start, join, and end meetings with just their voice.They will also be able to call anyone in their organization via the assistant, called Cisco Spark Assistant.The assistant, which will start to release in early 2018, can help streamline business meetings, allowing users to skip mundane tasks so they can focus on the meeting itself.Stay informed, click here to subscribe to the TechRepublic Next Big Thing newsletter.Subscribe Also see
AI: How big a deal is Google's latest AlphaGo breakthrough?:::::Earlier this year Google revealed AlphaGo Zero, a machine-learning system that in a short space of time was able to become a world master at the notoriously complex game of Go.AlphaGo Zero played "completely random" games against itself, and then learnt from the results.In just three days it was able to defeat by 100 games to 0 the version of AlphaGo that defeated the Go world champion Lee Se-dol in March 2016, a victory hailed as a milestone for AI development.After 21 days of playing itself it had gone even further, besting AlphaGo Master an online version of AlphaGo that won more than 60 straight games against top Go players, and within 40 days was able to beat all other versions of AlphaGo.At the time, DeepMind lead researcher David Silver said that achieving this level of performance in a domain as complicated and challenging as Go "should mean that we can now start to tackle some of the most challenging and impactful problems for humanity".But what is the significance of the extraordinary success of AlphaGo at the game of Go and how does it advance the practical capabilities of AI?Go is more limited than the real world Joseph Sirosh, Microsoft's corporate VP for AI & research, said that while AlphaGo is an impressive demonstration, its real-world applications are limited.Image: Microsoft "The thing about AlphaGo, we see it as a very unrealistic problem, because it is a completely self-contained problem," he said."You can develop as much training data as you want, there's no variability, it's completely deterministic.Peter Norvig is director of research at Google Inc and author of a seminal book on artificial intelligence.He agrees there are a limited number of possibilities in a game of Go compared to many real-world environments."It is true that Go is fully observable and deterministic (literally black and white): players can see the whole board, and they know exactly what will be the result of playing a stone," he said."Many 'real world' problems (such as robot navigation) take place in partially-observable and non-deterministic environments.So in those two respects, Go is easier."However, the complexity of Go is such that taking place in a deterministic environment is of limited help to computers, as the brute force approach of running through all the possibilities doesn't work.Go has about 200 moves per turn, compared to about 20 in Chess.Over the course of a game of Go there are so many possible moves that searching through each of them in advance to identify the best play is too costly from a computational point of view."The uncertainty and thus the challenge in Go comes from predicting the future.A player doesn't know what the opponent will do, and in fact players don't know for sure what their own future moves will be," said Norvig."That means that the Go environment becomes effectively nondeterministic: there is uncertainty about the ultimate outcome of a move."Predicting whether, say, a given Go move will effectively stop an opponent's ladder before it reaches safety therefore turns out to be similar to the real-world problem of deciding whether slamming on the brakes will stop a car before it reaches the intersection in both cases we rely partially on a model of the "physics" of the world, and partially on experience in past similar situations."Again, it is true that in Go we theoretically have a 100% accurate model of the physics of the world, but without near-infinite amounts of computation, we can't make use of that model to reason dozens of moves into the future.A Go player (whether human or machine) has to rely on pattern recognition and experience."Data isn't as readily available in the real world Sirosh also says the way AlphaGo gathers training data, by playing random matches of Go against itself, also puts it in an advantageous position compared to a machine-learning system trying to master real-life tasks."AI and machine learning is constrained by what you can learn," he said."If you're in an environment where there is unlimited data available to learn, then you can be incredibly great at it, and there are many, many ways you can be great at it."The smarts about AI comes when you have limited data.Human beings like you and me, we actually learn with very limited data, we learn new skills with one-shot guidance."That's really where AI needs to get to.That's the challenge.We are working towards enabling true AI."Image: Google Google's Norvig says there is significance in demonstrating a system can explore and learn on its own, in a "rich and complex environment" without the need for external training data."In one sense it is true that AlphaGo has access to "unlimited training data," because of the accurate model," he said."But the way I look at it is that AlphaGo starts with no training data whatsoever, and has to explore and decide which positions are worth exploring further.No data is just given to it; it has to make good choices to create data."Starting from random play, it learns to channel its explorations effectively so that in 3 days of exploration it can play at world champion level, and in a few weeks greatly exceeds what all other expert players have done over centuries of dedicated study."Up to this month, most computer scientists would have said this is not possible."Real-world applications The success of AlphaGo and its variants won't necessarily have a significant effect on enterprise, according to Sirosh, who views it as more of an academic achievement."AlphaGo is an interesting computer science accomplishment, this is algorithm development.[But] I don't think it is necessarily a big meaningful step," he said."It does allow you to explore a whole bunch of things, related AI algorithms, what are called reinforcement AI algorithms and so on, in that sense it does contribute to the whole thing."But when it comes to real-world applications in enterprises, I'm not sure AlphaGo makes by itself a significant difference."From Microsoft's perspective, he says that pursuing research that will make it easier for people to chat to computers using text or speech will really transform what's possible with AI."Really solving every language in every kind of context, being able to create conversational applications and doing so really well, I think that's an incredibly important part of AI innovation, because no matter what, the vast majority of high-value interactions in this world happen using language."Microsoft's focus on getting AI to understand language has been evident in a string of world-class results in language and speech recognition.Earlier this month, Microsoft's Artificial Intelligence and Research group reported it had developed a system able to transcribe spoken English as accurately as human transcribers.These more accurate algorithms for understanding language supports many of Microsoft's core AI services, whether they are the speech and natural language APIs available via Azure Cognitive Services, the Microsoft Bot Framework collection of services for building chatbots, or the virtual assistant Cortana.For his part, Norvig sees the potential for technologies developed to power AlphaGo Zero to be applied more widely."To what extent is this relevant to real-world applications in enterprises?Since the AlphaGo Zero result is brand new, we'll have to wait and see," he said."But the core technologies behind AlphaGo are certainly relevant to a variety of applications.Consider the problem of recommendations: an e-commerce site has a visitor, and has to choose what products to recommend/display to the visitor."In this example, he said the site's interaction with the visitor can be pictured as a series of turns, and on each turn there is a fixed set of moves to makethe site recommends one or more items from inventory, the visitor chooses a link to click on, or not."As in Go, the key to success is not in memorizing a specific sequence of moves, but in doing pattern recognition and generalizing over past experiences."Find out The Next Big Thing in TechRepublic's newsletter.Subscribe Read more on AI
Managed Applications now available for Microsoft's Azure cloud, signaling rise of Ap/Ops:::::On Thursday, Microsoft announced the general availability of Managed Applications in the Azure Marketplace."Managed Applications, an Azure unique offering, enables you to deploy entire applications and empower your partner to fully manage and maintain the application in your environment," Corey Sanders, director of compute for Azure, wrote in a blog post signaling the announcement.For example, a partner like Xcalar can now deliver both the application and a fully operated solution, rather than just deploying a set of VMsoffering "Ap/Ops," Sanders wrote.Xcalar and other partners will also be able to maintain and service the application solution directly in their partner's Azure environment.This is a first for the public cloud, Sanders wrote."This new distribution channel for our partners will change customer expectations in the public cloud," he added."Unlike our competitors, in Azure, a marketplace application can now be much more than just deployment and set-up."SEE: Azure data platform analysis: Enterprise use cases and services (Tech Pro Research) The inspiration for Azure Managed Applications came from business users and their third-party partners, Sanders wrote.Many enterprises want to transform IT operations, but need the simplicity of fully-managed applications, without infrastructure issues.And partners want to offer their customers more value by adding service operations to their portfolios.The announcement follows Microsoft making the Azure Managed Applications Service Catalog generally available at Microsoft Ignite, allowing corporate central IT teams to create and manage a catalog of solutions and applications to be used by employees.Now, with the addition of Azure Marketplace as a distribution channel, partners can add more value by offering lifecycle and support services, with an incremental, flat monthly fee.With Managed Applications, managed service providers (MSPs), independent software vendors (ISVs) and system integrators (SIs) can build turnkey cloud solutions using Azure Resource Manager templates, Sanders wrote.The application IP and the underlying, pre-configured Azure infrastructure can be packaged into one serviceable solution, enabling "Ap/Ops" and offering the application and operation together.The offering also allows customers to deploy these solutions in their own Azure environment as a sealed service, fully operated and maintained by their partner.Only minimal levels of access are granted for increased security.Because Managed Applications are sealed and immutable, nothing will change in the application or the infrastructure configuration "unless it is an explicit lifecycle operation by the trusted partner," Sanders wrote.Launch partners include Xcalar, OpsLogix, and Cisco Meraki."Whether these solutions are complex applications that are custom-built and maintained by MSPs or packaged applications delivered and serviced by ISVs, you can focus on what you need to do to accelerate your business transformation without having to worry so much about running someone else's software," Sanders wrote.Microsoft has made a number of moves to enhance its Azure services in recent months, including adding Cray supercomputing capabilities to the cloud, in an effort to help businesses more easily scale workloads for artificial intelligence (AI), analytics, and modeling.The tech giant also recently detailed a four-step plan for removing barriers to the cloud.However, Amazon remains the most popular offering in the Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) space at this point in time.The 3 big takeaways for TechRepublic readers 1.Microsoft announced the general availability of Managed Applications in the Azure Marketplace, which allow organizations to deploy entire applications and empower their partners to fully manage and maintain the application in your environment.2.Managed Applications are sealed and immutable, so nothing will change in the application or the infrastructure configuration unless it is an explicit lifecycle operation by the partner.3.The move is one of a number that Microsoft has made in recent months to compete with Amazon in the Infrastructure as a Service space.Image: Richard Morgenstein/Microsoft Stay up to date on all the latest Microsoft news.Click here to subscribe to the TechRepublic Microsoft Weekly newsletter.Subscribe Also see
How AI and machine learning will help the rise of quantum computing:::::"We are in an AI revolution," according to James Barratt, documentary filmmaker and author."AI of course has gone through a number of false springs, but this one seems to have a lot more traction."TechRepublic's Dan Patterson met with Barratt to discuss where artificial intelligence (AI) is headed, and how businesses can take advantage.AI previously was used to enter data, and get back an answer, he said.Now, AI will learn about its users and what they are doing.Virtual assistants, such as Siri and Cortana, are good examples of how AI is currently learning about its users, and giving them useful information like how long it will take them to get to work.Self-driving cars learn in the same way as well, by experience.SEE: IT leader's guide to the future of quantum computing (Tech Pro Research) One thing that's going to happen in the next five years because of AI and machine learning is the advent of quantum computing, according to Barratt.Quantum computing takes advantage of the quantum-related phenomenon to perform operations on data, and process a large amount of data quickly."When quantum computers come online, all encryption will fail," he said."That's something that's going to be a real game-changer," he added."Basically the whole internet will become obsolete, and any kind of security or encryption will become obsolete once quantum computers are online."Find out The Next Big Thing and subscribe to TechRepublic's newsletter.Subscribe Also see
How big data won the 2017 World Series:::::Image: Getty Images/iStockphoto On Wednesday, the Houston Astros won the 2017 World Series.Sports Illustrated predicted it three years ago.It was a slightly tongue-in-cheek prediction at the time, but it wasn't random.It was based on the Astros' prowess with data.When the book Moneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair Game came out in 2003, it spurred every Major League Baseball team to start taking data-based decision making more seriously.But some took it more seriously than others.Both the Astros and the Los Angeles Dodgers, which the Astros beat in the seventh game of this year's World Series, are big believers in data-driven analytics.In 2011, Jim Crane purchased the Astros.That year marked the first time in the franchise's history that it lost 100 games in a single season.Crane's first move was to completely overhaul the team's structure with a focus on hiring experts to make data-driven decisions based on predictive analytics.And by the time Sports Illustrated featured the team on its now-lauded June 2014 cover, the team was on its way to greatness.SEE: Field of digital dreams: Why MLB is betting its future on big data, Wi-Fi, apps, and AR (TechRepublic) The Astros team was full of young players in 2014.But they were in a position to take it all within a few years as Sports Illustrated explained in its in-depth article.The team began using data analytics for both player assessment and in-game decisions and that made the difference and pushed them to the World Series."They really committed to a true teardown transformation," said Vernon O'Donnell, senior vice president of data operations for STATS, which is the official data provider for MLB.Every team in the league is now using analytics to some degree, but the Astros, along with the Dodgers, the Boston Red Sox, the New York Yankees and the Chicago Cubs, are diving deeper than others on data.And it's working.Image: Bloomberg Businessweek "Data analytics played a key role in the Astros win (and the Dodgers' strong performance in 2017 as well).From player scouting, which has developed a much more sophisticated understanding of player value to analytical tools that help managers make smarter on-the-field calls around lineups, relief pitching and field position, the game looks decidedly different in 2017 than it did just a few years ago," said Kyle Bunch, managing director of strategy for R/GA, which works on data strategy with the Dodgers as well as companies such as Verizon and Samsung.And the Astros win will only accelerate the push for deeper dives into data analytics."Teams that aren't investing heavily in analytics have absolutely missed the boat.You see it not just in the Astros, but the Cubs last year and the Red Sox.The Yankees are a classic example.By investing in that way, it's changing how baseball teams are playing.They're getting more home runs, and deeper home runs," O'Donnell said.Both the Astros and the Dodgers are known for their data analytic teams.Both are analytically driven and technically driven as well, which means making sure a team invests in the right resources from a technical perspective, said John Pollard, vice president of business development for Zebra Sports.O'Donnell pointed out that data analytics is so important to the Astros that his company alone has lost six employees to the Astros in recent years.SEE: Going Deep on Big Data (a ZDNet/TechRepublic special report) "The Astros have really invested in data analytics talent.There are other teams who dabble in analytics work with data packages and video and a basic understanding of what it means, but they haven't built a robust internal team that can think about what it means to win in Houston as an Astro," O'Donnell said.Bill Schmarzo, CTO of Dell Global Services, Big Data, said the Astros won based on the team's ability to use data to its advantage."Their success in drafting high potential players like Alex Bregman, Carlos Correa, Dallas Keuchel and World Series MVP George Springer, plus the acquisition via the International Free Agency of Jose Altuve and Yuli Gurriel is a testament to the quality of their scouting analytics to assess and predict talent.Plus their in-game decisionswhere to position players on the field, when to pinch hit, pitcher rotationswere also stellar.But analytics is not about being perfect, analytics are about being better.Analytics is about helping player development, managers and coaches to make better decisions; better decisions than what your competitors are making."Data is so important to teams that they've even been caught stealing from one another.In 2016, CBS News reported that a scouting director of the St. Louis Cardinals had pled guilty to hacking into the player personnel database of the Houston Astros.Moneyball has taught teams another lesson."Data and analytic advantages are fleeting.It doesn't take organizations long to copy what others are doing.So to stay ahead, one has to constantly be innovating and looking for new sources of data and new analytic techniques.It's an analytics arms race out there," Schmarzo said.The Astros have figured out how to integrate "soft" data with "hard" data, Schmarzo said."Baseball has always been blessed with lots of hard, statistical performance data.Heck, Sabermetrics has been trying to make sense of that bounty of hard data for decades.What leading organizations are doing now is incorporating the soft metricsmetrics like resilience, perseverance, heart and chemistryinto their analytics.And the source of these soft metrics is the all-important scouting and coaching staffs.They can purposely place players in stressful situations, and then see (measure) how they react.That's the real powerintegrating data analytics with human intuition.The result will be better decisions," Schmarzo said.SEE: Big data policy (Tech Pro Research) Still, data analytics remains as much of an art as a sciencesuch as determining which player to put in during a hitting streak, or keeping a pitcher in when he's doing well, said Vijay Mehrotra, associate professor at the University of San Francisco and an analytics consultant."Statistical models are based on long term averages.Overall you look at the data and how it compares to long term predictions," Mehrotra said.But in the heat of a game, a manager must make decisions based on what he sees on the field.In this year's World Series, "you saw two sharp contrasts.The Dodgers were a team that was very much bought.It's the highest paid team in baseball.The Astros were much more data driven.They had to be because they didn't have the benefit of the huge payroll.That's your Moneyball parallel," Mehrotra said.Find out the Big Data Essentials in TechRepublic's newsletter.Subscribe Also see
How to install and configure rsyslog for a centralized Linux log server:::::How many Linux machines do you administer?If that number is significant, and those machines are all on the same network, do you get tired of having to secure shell into each machine to view individual log files?What if you could configure all of those Linux machines to send their log files to a centralized server?With Linux (and rsyslog), this is not only possible, it's incredibly easy.I'm going to show you how to do just that.I'll be demonstrating on Ubuntu Server 16.04 machines, but the process is the same (with only a slight moderation in how the software is installed) on every distribution.I will assume you have access to all the machines you need to configure and that you have one Linux server to stand as a dedicated log file device.With that said, let's get this system up and running.Installation Chances are, rsyslog is already installed on your machine.You can find out by issuing the command less /etc/rsyslog.conf.If you see the contents of the rsyslog configuration file, you're good to go.If not, the software can be installed with the command sudo apt install rsyslog.That's all there is to the installation.You'll want to be sure that rsyslog is installed on both the centralized server and all clients that will be sending their log files.SEE: Server deployment/migration checklist (TechRepublic) Configurationserver You must configure the server and the clients differently.First I'll show you how to configure the server.Log into that machine and open up a terminal window.Issue the command sudo nano /etc/rsyslog.conf.Locate the following two lines and uncomment them (by removing the # characters): #module(load="imudp") #input(type="imudp" port="514") Do the same thing for the next two lines: #module(load="imtcp") #input(type="imtcp" port="514") That's all there is the configuration on the server.Save and close that file.Restart rsyslog with the command: sudo systemctl restart rsyslog Configurationclient Now we're going to configure the clients, such that they'll send their logs to the centralized server.To do this, first open up the configuration file with the command sudo nano /etc/rsyslog.conf.Scroll to the bottom of that file and add the line: *.* @@SERVER:514 Where SERVER is the IP address of your centralized log file server.Save and close that file.Now, create a new file with the command sudo nano /etc/rsyslog.d/10-rsyslog.conf.In that file, add the following contents: *.* @@ADDRESS:514 Where ADDRESS is the IP address of your centralized log file server.Restart rsyslog with the command sudo systemctl restart rsyslog.Viewing logs At this point, rsyslog clients are sending their log file entries to your server.If you open up one of the files in /var/log, you will see entries that start with the hostname of your client machines (Figure A).Figure A Log files made more manageable You no longer have to remote into each of your Linux servers to read log files.Instead, log into that centralized server and view your log entries, for each configured Linux client, in one convenient location.That's log files made more manageable.Automatically sign up for TechRepublic's Open Source Weekly Newsletter for more hot tips and tricks.Subscribe Also see
New iOS 11.1 Wi-Fi hack drops malware on your iPhone to steal sensitive data:::::Just one day after Apple released 11.1 to address the Krack Wi-Fi exploit and a long list of other vulnerabilities, iOS has been hacked again.This time it's several zero-day exploits discovered as part of Trend Micro's Zero Day Initiative (ZDI) Pwn2Own hacking contest.ZDI has been scant on details of the exploits, but they have stated broadly what participants have been able to accomplish.What makes a new Wi-Fi exploit particularly alarming is how fast it was discoveredit was just a few weeks ago that the Crack Wi-Fi exploit affecting almost all Wi-Fi capable devices came to light.New iOS exploits aren't limited to Wi-Fi A research team from Tencent's Keen Lab were responsible for uncovering the iOS Wi-Fi exploit and an iOS Safari exploit.A second participant, Richard Zhu ( who goes by fluorescence) managed to successfully exploit Safari on iOS as well.According to the ZDI blog post cataloging the event, the iOS Wi-Fi exploit was accomplished by executing code "through a WiFi bug and escalat[ing] privileges to persist through a reboot."The four exploits needed to accomplish the task earned Keen Lab $110,000.It's also important to note that the device the team attacked was running iOS 11.1.SEE: iOS and Android security: A timeline of the highlights and the lowlights (TechRepublic) Keen Lab's Safari exploit "uses 2 bugs, one in the browser and one in a system service, to exploit Safari," while Richard Zhu "leveraged two bugs to exploit Safari and escape the sandbox - successfully running code of his choice."The exploits earned them $45,000 and $25,000, respectively.The year of using an iPhone dangerously The last thing Apple needs is a revelation of more security holes in its mobile OS.It just patched Krack one day ago, had its secure enclave decrypted recently, has been sending unencrypted Exchange credentials for years, just faced another Wi-Fi attack in iOS 10 with Broadpwn, and was having keychain contents intercepted as plain text.All that has been in the news since July 2017.It simply hasn't been a good security year for Apple, but that's where Pwn2Own comes in: Representatives from Apple, Google, and Huawei are all present at the event to ask questions of the researchers and help their companies understand just what was discovered.SEE: The Complete iOS 11 Developer Course (TechRepublic Academy) ZDI said that it is giving companies 90 days to fix the exploits it discovered: "If a vendor is unresponsive or unable to provide a reasonable statement as to why the vulnerability is not fixed, the ZDI will publish a limited advisory including mitigation in an effort to enable the defensive community to protect users," it said.As always, keeping your devices up to date is an important part of preventing exploits, provided someone isn't working to find a new one just as fast as Apple can close the old ones.Spoiler: They areat least it's the good guys in this case.The top three takeaways for TechRepublic readers: Researchers at a hacking competition were able to drop malicious code onto an iOS device running 11.1 over Wi-Fi.This occurred just one day after Apple patched iOS for the Krack Wi-Fi exploit.The team that exploited iOS Wi-Fi also managed to run an exploit through the iOS version of Safari.Another participant did so as well, enabling him to run "the code of his choice" on the affected device.The competition where these exploits were discovered, called Pwn2Own, is giving Apple 90 days to respond to the discoveries.After that it will release an advisory with mitigation steps so that the cybersecurity community can prevent the exploits' use.Know about the latest exploits as soon as they appear: Subscribe to our Cybersecurity Insider newsletter.Subscribe Also see:
How to minimize the 2 biggest IoT threats:::::"You can classify [IoT] in two broad categories," said Michela Menting, research director for ABI.At the 2017 Mobile World Congress, Menting discussed the two most current threats to IoT devices.The first type of threat, denial of service, is merely considered a nuisance, she said.This type of attack hijacks and disrupts the service on IoT devices across all platforms.Menting said these make up most of the attacks that are actually executed.The second threat, hardcore attacks, are much more rare, but target critical infrastructure with IoT devices and can cause 'life-critical emergencies."SEE: The Power of IoT and Big Data (Tech Pro Research) Menting gave two tips to minimize IoT threats: 1.Understand the risks It's important for users to understanding the risks involved in using an IoT device.Once businesses fully understand the risks the device brings, they can put risk management solutions in place like encryption or firewalls.2.Understand the security risk It's also important to understand the security risk involved at the inception of the product and be aware of their vulnerabilities.It is imperative for manufacturers to implement features to accommodate potential security breaches, and that this should be viewed not as a burden but as a value added to the product."You can't think it's something unimportant, or marginal, it will impact businesses," she said.Subscribe to TechRepublic's Cybersecurity Insider newsletter Subscribe Also see
I've had an iPhone X all week. Here's what's easier and what's still a struggle:::::Skip in Skip x Embed x Share CLOSE How well does Face ID work?We let USA TODAY newsroom staffers test Apple's new facial recognition system.USA TODAY (Photo: Apple) Where did the battery percentage go?How do I reset it?Remind me how to turn the darn thing off!Ive been living now with the iPhone X (officially pronounced ten not ex) since Monday, when Apple supplied me with a review unit of its stratospherically-priced new smartphone.The 256GB phone Ive been using, the same model I woke up at 3 a.m.ET last Friday to preorder on faith, will set you back $1,150.(The 64GB X commands $999.)Since publishing my first impressions of the X on Tuesday morning, Ive been able to spend more time using it.Notably, that meant shooting a bunch of pictures, and as with other premium-priced smartphones, the iPhone X excels in this regard.Youll certainly appreciate the Portrait mode feature that lets you keep a subject in focus while the background is blurred, including when that subject is you in a selfie.Portrait mode debuted on the iPhone 7 Plus and is also on the 8 Plus, but it is not available for the front cameras on those devices.A Portrait Mode selfie automatically can darken the background.(Photo: Edward Caig) The Portrait Lighting effects feature is still in beta but already one of my favorite features.You can get artsy and shoot a portrait with a completely dark background.I predicted that everyone who buys the X will quickly fool around with the animated emojis or Animojis you can send to a friend in a message, from a unicorn to a pile of poo.Animojis speak in your voice when you do and mirror your facial movements.Im sticking with that prediction, judging by the people I unleashed Animojis on or who created their own.Mostly, though, Ive been trying to best navigate the transition from a phone with a home button and the Touch ID fingerprint sensor to one that relies instead on new gestures and facial recognition.Some things have gotten easier, Im still struggling with others, and there have been a few quirks, as well.While Im reluctant to declare that any handset that exceeds $1,000 is worth the ransom, I can say without much hesitation that the iPhone X is the finest smartphone you can buy.More: Don't want an iPhone 8 or iPhone X?There are plenty of alternatives More: iPhone 8 review: An excellent phone forced to the shadows by iPhone X More: Follow USA TODAY Money and Tech on Facebook Changing your behavior The absence of a home button requires a new way to get to your home screen, and I got the hang of swiping up from the bottom of the 5.8-inch OLED display almost from the start.If anything, when I now use an iPhone with a home button, my initial inclination is to swipe up rather than press.Muscle memory is a funny thing.Some of the other navigational stunts you must absorb into your regular routine dont come as naturally.Its simple to get to the app switcher or multitasking screens by swiping up and pausing for a second.But my inclination is to swipe up on a card representing a running app to remove it, when instead you must press down for a moment until a circled red dash appears before you swipe up.Apple should make this process easier.The iPhone X app switcher (Photo: Edward C. Baig) On iPhone Plus devices, Apple introduced a reachability feature that let users of these large display models access the upper portion of the screen while using the phone with one hand.On those models, you would double-tap the home button.Reachability on the iPhone X requires you to swipe down from the bottom edge of the screen, which is a little trickier.Tasks you summon less often require a bigger learning curve.To force restart a frozen phone or one that is misbehaving requires a new drill: You press and quickly release the volume up button, followed by a quick press of the volume down button, followed by having to press and hold the side button until you see the Apple logo.Got all that?You might even have to look up how to turn off the phone.The answer: Press and hold either volume key and the side button key, then swipe to turn off the phone.Holding down the side button, located on the right side of the what some might consider to be the "power button," brings up Siri.A double tap initiates Apple Pay.More: The iPhone's still got it, judging by the lines More: Want the iPhone X?It doesnt have to cost you $1,000 The hidden 'home button' Buried inside the accessibility settings of your phone is a feature known as AssistiveTouch, with tools for people who have difficulty touching the screen or who need an adaptive accessory.If you turn AssistiveTouch on, you can summon a virtual button that gives you shortcuts to the home screen, Siri, notifications and other settings.The feature has been in iOS for awhile.A virtual home button through AssistiveTouch (Photo: Edward C. Baig) Speaking of buttons, Apple has added helpful onscreen buttons for the flashlight and camera to the lock screen, or when displaying notifications.Training Face ID I was able to set up Face ID in less than 15 seconds and was even able to set it up on the fly and then complete an Apple Pay purchase in a store in under a half-minute.But not everyone gets the hang of the Face ID set up right away.Youre supposed to position your face in the camera frame and move your head in a circular fashion, until the outer rim of the frame turns green.You have to do this twice.But I've watched some people try moving the phone in a circular fashion, rather than their face.Training the iPhone to recognize your mug in Face ID (Photo: Edward C. Baig) Where's the battery percentage?On other iPhones, you can flip on a setting to show off the battery percentage indicator on the upper right corner of the display.It's more useful to me than the battery gauge that appears by default.But its gone AWOL on the X, possibly because the notch covering the TrueDepth camera that Apple uses for Face ID, Animojis and augmented reality claims too much real estate.Fortunately, all isnt completely lost.The battery percentage indicator is in Control Center (Photo: Edward C. Baig) The battery percentage indicator is visible inside Control Center, which you can view by swiping down from the upper right portion of the screen.Id rather it come out of hiding on most iPhone X screens.Apple is promising all-day battery life on the iPhone X, two hours longer, the company claims, than on the iPhone 7.And the X (like the new 8 and 8 Plus models) supports wireless charging through an industry standard known as Qi, meaning you can plunk down an X on a compatible pad, cradle or base to juice it up.The charger itself must be plugged in, of course, so wireless charging isn't completely wireless.Unfortunately, wireless charging on the X was extremely slow, at least on the Belkin accessory I used for my tests.Apple says fast wireless charging will arrive via a software update in the future.If you are looking to purchase a wireless charger today, you may want to wait for this update to arrive to make sure it supports the faster speeds.What's more, the phone was only about halfway charged one morning after I left the X on the Belkin pad overnight.On some chargers you may have to make sure the phone is properly aligned on the sweet spot-- as with wired charging, a battery icon on the phone lets you know when the phone is charging.That was the case, or so I thought, on the Belkin.All this bears watching.Face or fingerprint?Apple explains that third-party apps that support Touch ID automatically support Face ID and thats a good thing.Via Face ID, I could get past password-protected screens on my banking and credit card apps, even when the design of such apps hadnt yet been updated to reflect the capability.Be prepared, however, to encounter some confusing messages about Touch ID and Face ID, even when everything otherwise functions as it should.American Express app was designed for Touch ID but Face ID works.(Photo: Edward C. Baig) Speaking of minor issues, given the odd design of the iPhone X, early users are bound to encounter some odd glitches.One such bug I noticed was while watching Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.2 vertically normally you'd view it horizontally the iPhone X's notch blocked the ability to easily jump ahead or behind in the movie.If you pre-ordered the X you'll likely be very pleased with what your money bought you.But you'll have some learning to do.Follow USA TODAY personal tech columnist @edbaig on Twitter Skip in Skip x Embed x Share CLOSE We take a look at the iPhone X and break down the new features.USA TODAY Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2lLSRHK
After Gothamist: how to read Web pages that have gone to their grave:::::Online brokerage TD Ameritrade founder Joe Ricketts speaks Tuesday, Feb. 14, 2012, during a ceremonial unveiling of his portrait.Rickets abruptly shut DNAInfo and the Gothamist web sites Thursday.(Photo: AP Photo/Nati Harnik) The sudden shutdown and erasure of two groups of local-news sites Thursday provided Web users with an unpleasant reminder: The memory hole George Orwell wrote about in 1984 lurks online, and any sites owner can fire it up after firing a sites staff.Readers or writers of the New York and Chicago branches of DNAInfo, or any of the far-flung family of Gothamist sites (LAist, SFist) today find a link to any past news stories lands them on just one page: The announcement by owner Joe Ricketts that he was shutting the publications down.But the Web also offers remedies for Ricketts removal of every story at those city-specific blogs a week after staffers at their NYC newsrooms voted to unionize.One is the Internet Archives Wayback Machine.This San Francisco-based nonprofits frequently-updated database of old Web pages allows you to click through long-gone sites, often including their comments and some photos.You can also share those Archive links in e-mail, blog posts, tweets or anywhere else.What's your favorite reporting from suddenly shuttered DNAinfo & Gothamist?We're putting together a list.Use: https://t.co/8hrTRPmkVK ProPublica (@ProPublica) November 3, 2017 But while the Wayback Machine can be remarkably comprehensiveits collection of the Washington blog DCist includes 1,437 captures of pages from August 18, 2004 to Thursdayit lacks a search function.To get around that, turn to Bing.No, not Google: That dominant search site doesnt return direct links to pages in its search results, instead serving up much longer links that redirect through Google.Click on a Gothamist or DNAInfo result at Google, and youll be instantly bounced to Ricketts message expressing his sadness at not being able to make money from exceptional neighborhood storytelling.At Bing, you can right-click on a search result and then paste it into the Wayback Machine.You can also do this at Yahoo and DuckDuckGo, but those search sites dont let you constrain a search to particular dates the way Bing does.(Disclosure: I also write for Yahoo Finance but have zero involvement with Yahoos Bing-powered search.)Google does, however, offer a different option that can help you read a vanished page for some time after its demise: the cached version it automatically collects, which you can view by clicking the green, downward-facing triangle below a result and selecting Cached.But you cant count on these records sticking around, because if Google thinks a site has outright vanished, it will eventually stop showing links to it in its search results.For example, Google no longer points to the posts I wrote in 2012 for the Consumer Technology Associations blog that vanished after a site redesign the next year.The abrupt annihilation of more than a decade of work sets Ricketts move apart from routine link rot: Internet Archive curator Jason Scott said in a Twitter direct message that hes almost never seen so many posts vanish with zero warning.More often, you should have some advance warning of a sites shaky footing.In those cases, the Archive lets you add that page to its collection that it hasnt already collected.If you paste in an address and the Archive reports that it doesnt have a copy, click the Save this url in the Wayback Machine button at the bottom of the page.Rob Pegoraro is a tech writer based out of Washington, D.C.

The iPhone's still got it, judging by the lines:::::Skip in Skip x Embed x Share CLOSE How well does Face ID work?We let USA TODAY newsroom staffers test Apple's new facial recognition system.USA TODAY Crowds gather at the Fifth Avenue Apple Store ahead of the iPhone X launch.(Photo: Eli Blumenthal, USA TODAY) The iPhone still draws a crowd.A full day before the iPhone X was to go on sale at the Apple Store on New Yorks Fifth Avenue at 8 a.m. local time Friday, eager buyers took up a whole city block, not put off by having to spend a grand or more for the handset.The scenario was repeated elsewhere.Apple told CNBC that between 200 and 500 people were waiting in line in front of Apple Stores in Australia, Singapore and Japan.David Chen, 42, who was first in line on Fifth Avenue, says he is enticed by the iPhone X design.A friend who tried pre-ordering a week ago was told he wouldnt get the phone until close to Thanksgiving.Chen, a New York resident originally from China, says he

See the fake Facebook ads Russians ran on Clinton, guns, race, Christianity:::::Skip in Skip x Embed x Share CLOSE Authorities say 45% of Americans may have seen fake ads and posts from a propaganda agency tied to the Kremlin on Facebook and Instagram.USA TODAY This is one of the Russian Facebook ads intended to stir dissension in the U.S. (Photo: Facebook) Democratic senators are giving us a glimpse of the 3,000 or so fake ads spread on Facebook by a Russian propaganda firm in the days leading up to the 2016 Presidential campaign.Attorneys for Facebook, Google and Twitter have participated in a trio of federal hearings this week in which lawmakers grilled them on how they allowed a Russian influence campaign to buy ads and spread original content on issues including race, religion and gun ownership."We have a problem," Rep. Jackie Speier, D-Calif., told the attorneys during the House Intelligence Committee meeting Wednesday."Russia was able to weaponize your platforms to divide us."More: Facebook expands scope of Russian influence on Americans for second time More: Facebook, taking heat over Russia, tops estimates, warns security could cut into profits While the examples of some ads had leaked previously, Wednesday's release was the broadest publication of these falsified campaigns since this issue emerged.They also included the meta-data, or information the buyer used to obtain the ad through Facebook's automated ad system, from age of the targeted viewer to content they like, and how successful the ads were in getting users to click on them.Here's a look at some of the ads and their divisive nature: Satan and Jesus arm-wrestling This is one of the Russian Facebook ads intended to stir dissension in the U.S. (Photo: Facebook) This ad, sponsored by a fake group called Army of Jesus, called Clinton a Satan whose crimes and lies had proved just how evil she is.Trump on the other hand, may not be a saint, but hes at least an honest man and he cares deeply for this country.Among those who were likely to see this ad were Facebook users who had previously liked Laura Ingraham, God, Ron Paul, Christianity, Bill OReilly, Rush Limbaugh, Andrew Breitbart, Bible and Mike Huckabee.Not My President This is one of the Russian Facebook ads intended to stir dissention in the U.S. (Photo: Facebook) This fake ad helped draw thousands to a real world event in New York City's Union Square on Nov. 12 to protest Donald Trump's victory in the presidential election.Like most of the Facebook ads, this one targeted those aged 18-65, and those who had liked the BlackMattersUS page now known to be fake and friends of those who had.Secured Borders This is one of the Russian Facebook ads intended to stir dissension in the U.S. (Photo: Facebook) This simple ad attracted Facebook users to click on and join the group Secured Borders, which sought a shutdown in immigration.Among those targeted were Facebook users who were Republicans and had liked Donald Trump, Confederate States of America, Dixie, according to the ad information.Blacktivist This is one of the Russian Facebook ads intended to stir dissention in the U.S. (Photo: Facebook) This group, set up by Russians, created this post saying that the Black Panther party was "dismantled by US government because they were black men and women standing up for justice and equality."It targeted Facebook users who liked human rights, African-American culture or Malcolm X.Being Patriotic This is one of the Russian Facebook ads intended to stir dissension in the U.S. (Photo: Facebook) This post invited users to an anti-Hillary Clinton event and attacked the then-candidate as "the co-author of Obama's anti-police and anti-Constitutional propaganda."Most likely to see the post: those interested in Donald Trump, Donald Trump for President, or Donald Trump Jr. Defend the 2nd This is one of the Russian Facebook ads intended to stir dissension in the U.S. (Photo: Facebook) This post aimed at grow a Facebook community of gun rights advocates.Among those targeted with the ad were those who liked Gun Rights, National Rifle Association and The Second Amendment.Buff Bernie: A Coloring Book for Berniacs This is one of the Russian Facebook ads intended to stir dissension in the U.S. (Photo: Facebook) This ad, posted on the LGBT United Facebook page, promoted an actual coloring book released in February 2016.It targeted those who liked the group and their friends.More: Senators threaten new rules if social media firms can't stop Russian manipulation themselves More: Russians used Facebook the way other advertisers do: By tapping into its data-mining machine Follow USA TODAY reporter Mike Snider on Twitter: @MikeSnider.Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2A0Hjm2
Tim Cook tries to convince analysts: the iPhone 8 really is a hit:::::Skip in Skip x Embed x Share CLOSE From the flagship Apple Store in Los Angeles--small lines for the new iPhone 8, a big difference from year's past when people camped out for days to be first.Jefferson Graham reports on #TalkingTech.Jefferson Graham, USA TODAY LOS ANGELES The iPhone 8 and 8 Plus are hits.Huge ones.Really.As Apple fan boys and girls gather to stand outside Apple Stores hoping to be the first to nab the coveted new iPhone X, which goes on sale Friday, Apple CEO Tim Cook tried convincing skeptical analysts that his customers love the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus.Honest.Three friends who are each getting $250 to hold someones place at the #iPhoneX line at Apples flagship store in San Francisco.pic.twitter.com/xpL6GdoeUr Elizabeth Weise (@eweise) November 2, 2017 The 8 and 8 Plus arrived September 22 to generally positive reviews from critics, though many noted the pair was likely to get overshadowed by the X's later launch.During their earnings reports, cell phone carriers complained of anemic interest, because the phones were so similar to last years 7 and 7 Plus.More: iPhone 8 seems to have an iPhone X problem.Awkward.More: Don't want an iPhone 8 or iPhone X?There are plenty of alternatives More: Apple sales gets a boost from 8 days of iPhone 8 Cook was having none of it.Sales exceeded our expectations, he said.Since the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus began shipping, they became our two most popular iPhone models and have been ever since.Anecdotes and analysts have been far less enthusiastic about demand for the 8 and the bigger 8 Plus, raising questions about Apple's unusual strategy of releasing three new phones in one season.When the iPhone 8 went on sale Sept. 22, just a handful of folks waited in line and it was easy to get an online order.The iPhone X, in contrast, has all the makings of a craze: pre-orders for the X sold out within minutes, current orders are backlogged 5 to 6 weeks and enthusiasts camped out in San Francisco and New York the night before the phones hit store shelves.The lure: the iPhone X is the first iPhone to get a major re-design since 2014s iPhone 6, and is touted by Apple as the state-of-the-art phone offering tomorrows technology, with facial recognition to unlock the screen and an edge-to-edge OLED screen offering brighter and richer colors.Apple's last quarter included eight days of iPhone 8 and 8 Plus sales, which helped boost sales to 46.6 million devices from 45.5 million.But was it a hit or a dud?Cook was asked several times on the call to offer input about the mix, including how the iPhone 8 sold compared to other iPhones in the current quarter.Im not going to talk about the mix, Cook said.We have three new iPhones for the first time.People will look at them and decide which ones they want.As Cook was talking to analysts, the first iPhone Xs were selling in Australia, where, Cook reported, there were several hundred people standing outside Apple Stores hoping to buy the units.Until you get all of the (phones) out there, where customers have the ability to demo them, any kind of mix discussion is very early.We've never done a staggered launch before.Well see what happens.Follow USA TODAY's Jefferson Graham on Twitter, @jeffersongraham Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2hAsH6c
Anti-extremist crackdown on YouTube, Facebook, Twitter only solves part of the problem:::::Skip in Skip x Embed x Share CLOSE Experts say the Internet is helping radicalize 'lone wolf' terrorists and encouraging them to act faster than before.USA TODAY An image used to recruit and encourage terrorists by ISIS.(Photo: Terrorism Research & Analysis Consortium) SAN FRANCISCO After a string of deadly terrorist attacks in Europe and the U.S., Facebook, Twitter and Google moved to more aggressively flag and boot terrorist recruiters and propaganda arms from their platforms.That may not be enough.In the wake of a truck attack by a self-proclaimed ISIS supporter in New York City Tuesday evening, which left 8 dead, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo called the Internet "the training ground" for violent attackers, echoing a frequent complaint by lawmakers that the major Internet platforms still make it too easy for extremists to learn and organize.In the case of Sayfullo Saipov, a 29-year-old truck driver from Uzbekistan, at least some of his motivation came from online.He told investigators during an interview in his hospital room on Wednesday that he was inspired to carry out an attack in the United States by ISIS videos he watched on his cell phone.Investigators found 90 videos and 3,800 photos of ISIS-related propaganda on one of two cell phones found in the truck he had rented, according to a criminal complaint filed by federal prosecutors on Wednesday.They included videos that appear to be of a prisoner being run over by a tank, ISIS fighters shooting a prisoner in the face, a video of a beheading and a video providing instructions on how to make an explosive device.From the wording of the complaint, it appears the videos had been downloaded to the phone and were not streamed from the Internet.It wasn't clear where Saipov had obtained the videos or the images found on the phone.In past attacks, the search for means and motivation has quickly shifted to the availability of how-to and inspirational content found online and frustration from lawmakers followed in rapid succession.For instance, the suicide bomber who in May killed 22 people at the end of an Ariana Grande concert in Manchester, England used YouTube videos to learn how to build the explosive device.More: Facebook, Google, Twitter pressured to do more to fight terrorism on platforms More: UK official: Get terrorist content off Facebook, YouTube and Twitter More: YouTube says it's removing terrorist and extremist content faster More: YouTube redirects ISIS recruits to anti-terrorist videos Experts who study the networks that distribute extremist material say U.S. companies are doing a much better job of keeping terrorists and their supporters of their platforms.But even as they do so, those who seek it out are shifting where and how they look.Facebook, Google and Twitter are now removing extremist content at a rapid clip.And if youd asked me that same question two years ago, I would have given you a different answer, said Seamus Hughes, deputy director of the program on extremism at George Washington University.Facebook has ramped up efforts to remove terrorists and posts that support terrorism.It says it uses artificial intelligence to help track down content in addition to relying on staff and the larger Facebook community, including matching to detect known terrorism photos or videos and or wording that might praise or support terrorist organizations.Facebook general council Colin Stretch said Wednesday during a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing that Facebook is aiding law enforcement in its investigation.Google is blocking more terrorist content on its YouTube platform and using targeted advertising so that when people search for terrorist content, theyre instead shown videos that undermine extremist recruiting efforts.Twitter says new tools allow it to be faster, smarter and more efficient about taking down accounts that violate its policies on terrorist content.From January through June, it suspended almost 300,000 terrorist accounts, a 20% drop from the previous period.Of those, 75% were suspended before their first tweet.Still there, just more hidden Those moves haven't wiped out the videos and viral posts that would encourage a curious would-be recruit to find a calling.They've just made it more difficult.It used to take just seconds to find links to beheading videos and other violent propaganda readily available on mainstream social media in the United States, said Veryan Khan, editorial director of the Terrorism Research and Analysis Consortium, a research and analysis repository of information about terrorism.Today the process takes more steps.Searching for information about certain topics, say the carnage in Syria or the situation in Palestine, quickly leads to websites or YouTube videos.While the material and videos might be violent and raw, theyre not actually advocating anything, so they dont get taken down."And we wouldnt want them to be, these things are really happening.Its not fake, its just really sad, Khan said.However finding those and commenting on them might then lead to a user receiving a short-term link to a private discussion on an encrypted platform such as Telegram.Once there, the Web surfer can find an entire ecosystem of anti-Western thought and material that may raise red flags on other networks.This includes videos in multiple languages, well-designed online magazines, manifestos, downloadable posters and chat groups.More: After first fatal terror attack since 9/11, New York reaction combines regret, satisfaction More: NYC terror attack: What we know now about the truck attack in Manhattan This is where the Internet is able to leverage what once might have simply been a slight bent towards an anti-Western worldview into full-blown activism, or worse.People tend to seek content that confirms their biases and make them comfortable with their preexisting world view.Unfortunately that holds true with extremists too, said Brian Levin, director of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino.Already primed The kind of person drawn to the material is also changing.Even three years ago someone researching information about the Syrian conflict or Islamic State wouldnt have been too far from stumbling on an ISIS recruiter who would be required to lure them in, said Hughes.Only then would their move toward extremism have begun.Today, people go looking for this kind of material.Theyre already primed.Its not like theyre saying, Oh, heres an ISIS video.I didnt even know this existed.Theyve already bought into it, he said.That process almost always involves a combination with interactions online and with people they know in real life.Yes, theyre online.But theyre also sitting next to their best friend in the same room, watching the videos, said Hughes.The radicalization process is also becoming shorter, in part because of the constant drumbeat of attacks worldwide.Images of Paris, London, Barcelona, Birmingham and New York are in and of themselves a kind of propaganda mechanism, said Levin.Too much to stop Even if the Internet were to be shut down tomorrow, the sheer amount of Jihadist material available on hard drives around the world would be used to continue to push these ideas, say experts.Still, the more obstacles that can be put in people's way the better.Trouble finding copies of the slick ISIS online propaganda magazine Rumiyah could be the difference between someone giving up on the idea of perpetrating an attack and one being carried out.Other worry that pushing things into the corners is more dangerous than having them in plain sight.The more effective we are at limiting their ability to communicate these concepts , the more they go back down these holes and which to me is scarier.Id rather know what theyre planning, said Khan.Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2zZzi10

Digital discounts: Which online retailer has the lowest prices?:::::Skip in Skip x Embed x Share CLOSE Online Shopping is easier than ever, but is it cheaper?Buzz60 A new study has some answers.A new study shows there is a clear low-price leader when it comes to online shopping.(Photo: Getty Images) As Americans head into the holiday shopping season, many wonder which online retailer has the lowest prices.That, of course, has no absolute answer.Prices vary and on certain items at different times, any digital shopping service may have the lowest price.Over a broad selection of items tracked over time, however, a clear winner does emerge.The result may not shock you, but how close the gap between No.1 and No.2 has gotten may.Which online retailer has the lowest prices?Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) still has the cheapest prices, edging out rival Walmart (NYSE: WMT) by 2.9%, according to an analysis of the prices of 52,000 items by Profitero, an e-commerce analytics company.The research shows that the brick-and-mortar chain has made major progress since 2014 when it was 9% more expensive than the digital leader.Profitero compared identical, in-stock products, with daily prices averaged over a three-month period from June to August 2017.In addition to comparing Amazon and Walmart, the report also examined Walmart's Jet.com, Target (NYSE: TGT), and other specialist retailers.Jet came in 12.3% pricier than Amazon while Target lagged at 16.9% more expensive.All of what the report defined as "specialist retailers," came in well behind Amazon.These companies, which included Staples, Best Buy, and Home Depot were dramatically more expensive than the online retail leader.Staples came in at 49% pricier than Amazon while digital pet supplies store Chewy.com led the specialist category by being "only" 7% more expensive than Amazon."This year there's been a marked rise in discussion about an online price war," said the report's author, Profitero SVP of strategy & insights Keith Anderson in a press release."In our biggest ever study, we've set out to illuminate the pricing dynamic at play and to better understand the high-stakes race to the bottom we're currently witnessing between Walmart.com and Amazon.com."More:Seasonal demand: Wages for U.S. workers growing, albeit slowly More:Fingerlings: This year's hottest holiday toy is already flying off shelves More:Package wars: Postal Service eyes next-day Sunday delivery for holidays This is good for shoppers For consumers, it's fair to say that in nearly all cases, if you shop at Amazon or Walmart you will get a better price.The two companies are close enough that it's worth checking both of them before making a major purchase."While lower prices are good news for shoppers, suppliers and retailers will inevitably feel the pressure as we head into peak holiday season, as this price war is only set to intensify," said Anderson.Having the largest online (Amazon) and brick-and-mortar chain (Walmart) as the two cheapest digital retailers puts every other chain in a bind.It's likely impossible to be profitable by competing on price, so other retailers must find other ways to differentiate themselves.Best Buy has done that, to a point, with service, but most chains are going to struggle to compete.This report shows that when it comes to digital sales there are two clear leaders and everybody else.That's not likely to change this holiday season and it's possible that it becomes even more pronounced.Amazon and Walmart lead the way using their size and buying power to force prices down.That squeezes other retailers out and is good for consumers as long as the two pricing leaders have to compete with each other.Skip in Skip x Embed x Share CLOSE Walmart is doing what their competitor Amazon can't do, throw holiday parties.Buzz60 John Mackey, CEO of Whole Foods Market, an Amazon subsidiary, is a member of The Motley Fools board of directors.Daniel B.

Russians used Facebook the way other advertisers do: By tapping into its data-mining machine:::::Skip in Skip x Embed x Share CLOSE Facebook, Twitter and Google are set to testify at a Senate subcommittee hearing to help find solutions to Russian disinformation.Video provided by Newsy Newslook Russians used Facebook exactly the way it was intended: To spread information farther and faster than a cold virus in a kindergarten classroom.(Photo: LOIC VENANCE, AFP/Getty Images) SAN FRANCISCO Facebook's top lawyer Colin Stretch says it was unacceptable that a Russian organization linked to the Kremlin targeted Americans with Facebook posts and ads to sow discord in the tense political climate surrounding the 2016 presidential election.Yet Russian operatives used Facebook exactly the way it was intended: Spreading information farther and faster than a cold virus in a kindergarten classroom, reaching as many as 146 million Americans on Facebook and Instagram.And that's a wake-up call to Facebook's 2 billion-plus users, who for years have allowed the quiet culling of their personal data in exchange for the free service without much thought to what happens to that data, let alone whether a foreign power could exploit it to stoke outrage over polarizing issues from gay rights to gun rights.In hearings on Capitol Hill this week, lawmakers showed off some of the ads that Russian operatives bought on Facebook.One called "Being Patriotic" promoted a "Miners for Trump" rally in Pennsylvania, a swing state.Another ad from "Heart of Texas" claimed Hillary Clinton was "despised by the overwhelming majority of American veterans.""What were talking about is a major foreign power with sophistication and ability to involve themselves in a presidential election and sow conflict and discontent all over this country," Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) said during a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing Wednesday."This is a very big deal."More: See the fake Facebook ads Russians ran on Clinton, guns, race, Christianity More: Facebook's Zuckerberg says he's 'dead serious' about Russia, warns security spending will hurt profits Lawmakers pressed Facebook on just how easy it was for Russians to target American users.The answer: Facebook created a multibillion-dollar digital advertising business by allowing marketers to pinpoint exactly whom they want to reach by selecting criteria such as location, demographics, behavior and interests all information that Facebook collects each time someone logs in."Facebook is designed to amplify messages that are extreme and emotional and that's exactly what's happened.Facebook is designed to allow people to send messages to a lot of people for very little money and that's exactly what's happened," says Siva Vaidhyanathan, professor of media studies at the University of Virginia and author of Antisocial Media, an upcoming book on Facebook."Combine the two and it's a perfect propaganda machine for anyone who wants to distract or disrupt a democratic republic."A Facebook post by the popular Blactivist account later discovered to be a fake account created by Russians.(Photo: Facebook) Political pressure mounted this week as executives from Facebook, Twitter and Google answered questions on Capitol Hill about election interference by Russians on their platforms.Russia has denied any meddling in the election.Facebook knows you better The current political storm has its roots in Facebook's data-obsessed success.The giant social network is constantly hoovering information from what you post there: your age, gender, education and income level, job title, relationship status, hobbies, political leanings, what TV shows and movies you like, what kind of car you drive.It also tracks which pages you like and the ads you click on, the phone you use and your Internet connection as well as the sites you browse on the Web.It buys information from data brokers that gather detailed information from public records and previous purchases and purchasing behavior, among other things, ranging from the value of your home to whether you carry a balance on your credit card.When you combine that information with what Facebook already knows about you, it's arguably the most complete consumer snapshot on earth."Facebook is collecting more data than anyone except the U.S. government," said Logan Young, a vice president of strategy at BlitzMetrics, a digital marketing company that focuses on Facebook ads.Just as Facebook tries to show people what they want to see in their news feed, Facebook uses the data it collects to try to show people the kinds of ads that are most relevant to them.For example, a baseball clothing line can target people interested in baseball, not just people who like sports.Or a make-up line for African-American women can target African-American women, instead of all women.But ad targeting can be abused.The media has uncovered potential misuses of advertising tools including the ability to target people who expressed interest in anti-Semitic topics such as "jew hater" and the ability to exclude specific racial and ethnic groups when placing housing ads.After potential misuses were reported to Facebook, it removed those capabilities.Facebook first disclosed in September that Russian actors bought ads to meddle in the U.S. election.Among the content created by the Russian propaganda agency was a popular "Blacktivist" account that posted videos of police brutality, publicized rallies and urged black people to "wake up."Another fake account, "Being Patriotic," argued that Black Lives Matter activists who disrespected the American flag should be "immediately shot."More: Russian fake accounts showed posts to 126 million Facebook users More: Facebook: 10 million people saw Russia-backed election ads More: Facebook makes political ads more transparent ahead of Russia hearings More: Facebook political ads are coming out of the shadows why you should care The campaigns that fooled some activists demonstrated just how effective Facebook advertising can be, even on a relatively small budget.Facebook estimates that 470 Russian-backed accounts from the Internet Research Agency produced 80,000 posts and bought 3,000 ads on Facebook between January 2015 and August 2017.In all, the Russians spent about $100,000, according to Facebook.About 75% of the ads were targeted broadly at Americans and 25% of the ads were targeted specifically to certain parts of the country.By targeting key demographic groups in swing states, such as Michigan and Wisconsin, two states that were critical to Trump's election win, the Russians could have swayed public sentiment with a relatively small advertising budget, Young says.The possibility that a foreign power used Facebook to influence voters has made Americans uneasy.Just 18% of Americans say the amount of data possessed by companies like Facebook is a good thing and 78% see it as a bad thing because of the potential for misuse, an Axios survey found this week.User ranks keep growing Yet it's not clear that greater public understanding of how much Facebook knows and how that information can be used for ill will turn off users.Over the years, people have grown accustomed to ads hounding them on Facebook.Victoria Heckstall, a 26-year-old lifestyle blogger from Newport News, Virginia, says about half the time it's as if Facebook ads read her mind.Through one ad, she bought a facial mask that she's still using, through another she discovered a nearby kickboxing gym where she now has a membership."That ad was right on point.I was thinking about trying a new fitness program," Heckstall says."I still have the membership.It's one of the best investments ever.I am really glad I came across the ad when I did."Facebook's General Counsel Colin Stretch speaks before a Senate Committee on the Judiciary, Subcommittee on Crime and Terrorism hearing on Capitol Hill in Washington, Tuesday, Oct. 31, 2017, on more signs from tech companies of Russian election activity.(Photo: AP Photo/Andrew Harnik) That consumer acceptance has helped Facebook build a service that's used by 1.3 billion people every day and a digital advertising business that is second only to Google.On Wednesday Facebook continued its hot earnings streak, recording its best quarter yet and showing how highly effective Facebook ads are in targeting its users.The only alternative for consumers would be to delete their accounts.But very few have.For many, having a Facebook account isn't just a convenience, it's a necessity, like having a social security number or a phone number .Facebook may not charge a fee for its service, says Andrew Keen, but "we pay with our data, with our digital blood."The author of an upcoming book How to Fix the Future: Staying Human in the Digital Age, Keen says he doesn't have a Facebook account because he's not willing to pay that price.Follow USA TODAY senior technology

Equifax special committee says executive stock sales were not insider trading:::::Skip in Skip x Embed x Share CLOSE Equifax breach exposed driver's license data for almost 11 million.Elizabeth Keatinge (@elizkeatinge) has more.Buzz60 The signage at the corporate headquarters of Equifax Inc. in Atlanta.Credit report company Equifax said Monday, Oct. 2, 2017, that an additional 2.5 million Americans may have been affected by the massive security breach of its systems, bringing the total to 145.5 million people who had their personal information accessed or stolen.(Photo: Mike Stewart, AP) Equifax said a special committee formed by its board to examine executive stock sales prior to the disclosure of the massive data breach this summer found nothing wrong with the trades.The committee found that four executives sold shares between July 28 and August 2, including John Gamble, the CFO, Joseph Loughran and Rodolfo Ploder, who run two of its business units, and Douglas Brandberg, a senior staffer in investor relations.The sale of $1.8 million in stock within days of the internal discovery of the breach sparked widespread criticism.It previously had been known that three executives sold shares.Equifax discovered the breach in late July but didn't disclose it to the public until Sept. 7.It affected the personal identification information for more than 145 million people.The committee's six-page report on its findings, released Friday, concluded that none of the executives knew about the security breach when they asked to clear their stock trades.The committee also concluded that the sales were properly approved, followed company policy, and weren't insider trading.Equifax said the committee interviewed dozens of people and reviewed more than 55,000 emails, text messages, phone logs and other documents."The conclusion that the Company executives in question traded appropriately is an extremely important finding and very reassuring," said Mark Feidler, Equifax's non-executive chairman.Shares of Equifax fell 0.8% in pre-market trading.CNBC is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.Its content is produced independently of USA TODAY.Skip in Skip x Embed x Share CLOSE Richard Smith, who is now retired, outlined how the company handled the breach in congressional testimony.Video provided by Newsy Newslook Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2hBwVui

Gothamist, DNAinfo blogs abruptly shut down after union vote:::::New York City's skyline.The publisher of popular city-based blogs including Gothamist and LAist, and the news site DNAinfo, has pulled the plug on the sites.(Photo: AP Photo/Mark Lennihan) NEW YORK (AP) Two popular New York City news sites and their satellites in Chicago, San Francisco and elsewhere were shut down a week after their New York staffs voted to unionize.Joe Ricketts, the billionaire CEO of DNAinfo and founder and former chief executive of what is now TD Ameritrade, said in a post on the site Thursday that the decision was due to business reasons, although he has previously been outspoken against unions."Businesses need to be economically successful if they are to endure," he said."And while we made important progress toward building DNAinfo into a successful business, in the end, that progress hasn't been sufficient to support the tremendous effort and expense needed to produce the type of journalism on which the company was founded."Late last week, the editorial staffs of the New York outlets voted to unionize with the Writers Guild of America, East, AFL-CIO.The companion staffs in Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Washington did not, although they all were apparently shut down on Thursday.A total of 115 journalists will be out of work as a result, according to the New York Times.A guild spokesman said the union is "deeply concerned" about the decision."It is no secret that threats were made to these workers during the organizing drive," spokesman Jason Gordon said."The Guild will be looking at all of our potential areas of recourse and we will aggressively pursue our new members' rights.We will meet with management in the near future to address all of these issues.We are currently working with the staff at DNAinfo and Gothamist to support them in this difficult time."Ricketts also is the owner of the Chicago Cubs.He founded DNAinfo in 2009 and bought Gothamist earlier this year.He did not mention the union vote in his statement Thursday, but previously posted a commentary on his personal blog titled, "Why I'm Against Unions At Businesses I Create."He said in the commentary that "unions promote a corrosive us-against-them dynamic that destroys the esprit de corps businesses need to succeed.And that corrosive dynamic makes no sense in my mind where an entrepreneur is staking his capital on a business that is providing jobs and promoting innovation."A spokeswoman for Ricketts did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Unlike DNAinfo, which was more shoe-leather news, Gothamist offered quirky takes on New York City life, from news to restaurant reviews to to-do guides.It had a lively comments section and sister sites such as SFist in San Francisco, Chicagoist and LAist in Los Angeles.Ricketts' statement noted that DNAinfo and Gothamist daily news reports were sent to a half-million email inboxes.Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2hBekyO
Don't want an iPhone 8 or iPhone X? There are plenty of alternatives:::::Skip in Skip x Embed x Share CLOSE USA TODAY goes to the Apple hands on room to check out the iPhone X, 8 and 8 Plus and Apple Watch.USA TODAY Samsung Electronics' Galaxy S8 and S8+ smartphones (Photo: Lee Jin-man, Lee Jin-man, AP) On Tuesday Apple introduced a radically redesigned iPhone X with a slew of impressive new features and, as expected, a $1,000 price tag.For some, this may be the iPhone they have waited years for.Others may be intrigued by the new iPhone 8, which features a design similar to the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus but adds iPhone X features like wireless charging and an improved camera at a more affordable price tag.Before you commit to plopping down hundreds of dollars, however, you should know there are quite a few very good Android alternatives.More: iPhone X first look: Intriguing, fancy and pricey More: iPhone X is Apple's latest attempt at a Samsung killer.But it's coming late.More: iPhone X pricing, features vs. iPhone 8 and 8 Plus: Which is better for you?Best phone for most people: Samsung Galaxy S8 The Samsung Galaxy S8 already packs many of the new features Apple added to the iPhone X, including a sharp 5.8-inch edge-to-edge display, facial recognition, and fast wireless charging, in addition to the already standard water resistance.While the iPhone X's dual camera may trump the Galaxy S8s 12-megapixel single shooter, the S8 still has an impressive camera.More: Screen stealer: Why iPhone owners will envy the Galaxy S8 The biggest reason the S8 has this spot, however, is its price.An unlocked, 64GB Galaxy S8 currently sells for $724.99 on Samsung's site, but the company has an aggressive promotion running (perhaps coincidentally tied to the busy smartphone season) that allows you to trade many popular older devices for $200-$300 off.Under the promotion, you can even get $200 for trading in a five-year-old iPhone 5, assuming the device powers on and there is no other major damage to the phone or screen.At $424.99 or $524.99, it's hard to beat the S8.Runner-up: Samsung Galaxy Note 8 Samsung's Galaxy Note 8 smartphone is shown off in Berlin, Germany.(Photo: Sean Gallup, Getty Images) The Note 8 is an impressive device that has nearly all the same features as the S8 but with a slightly larger display, dual-cameras and support for the S-Pen stylus.While it is a strong device on its own, unless you really want the S-Pen or dual cameras, at $929.99 for the 64GB unlocked version before trade-in (Samsung also has an identical trade-in offer available) you are better off saving the money and going with the S8.More: Samsung Galaxy Note 8 is solid phablet and it doesn't catch fire Runner-up: HTC U11 HTC's U11.(Photo: HTC) The HTC U11 is one of the sleekest devices on the market.While it lacks an edge-to-edge display, dual cameras or a headphone jack, it is a top performer that is also gorgeous, not withstanding the fact that it is fingerprint prone.The 16-megapixel rear camera is a particular standout and it has other 2017 staples such as water resistance and a sharp display.However, at $649.99, you are still better off going for the Galaxy S8.On a budget: OnePlus 5 The side of the OnePlus 5.(Photo: Eli Blumenthal, USA TODAY) The OnePlus 5 is the latest device from popular Chinese smartphone manufacturer OnePlus.For $479 unlocked for the 64GB version, the OnePlus 5 continues the company's tradition of offering top-of-the-line specs at a much more affordable price.While the display is not edge-to-edge or as crisp as others on this list, the OnePlus 5's 5.5-inch screen is still sharp and the processor in here is the same Qualcomm chip that powers the Galaxy S8, Note 8 and HTC U11.More: iPhone rival OnePlus 5 brings sleek refinements, but not perfection The dual-rear cameras on the OnePlus are not as strong as the others mentioned here, , and the phone lacks water resistance and only works on AT&T or T-Mobile's networks, limiting its appeal.But at less than $500, it represents one of the best deals you can find for a top smartphone, especially if you're on a budget.Runner-up: Moto Z2 Play The Moto Z2 Play.(Photo: Motorola) At $499 unlocked ($408 on Verizon) the Moto Z2 Play is a strong rival to the OnePlus 5.Like the original Z Play from 2016, the Z2 Play has excellent battery life, a nice metal design and support for Motorola's line of MotoMods attachments that let you add accessories such as a gamepad, speaker or projector (all sold separately).The 12-megapixel rear camera is similarly not as strong as the best from Apple, Samsung and HTC and the processor in here is slower than the one in the OnePlus.But again, for the price, the Z2 Play is a solid option.What's coming While the phones on this list are the best of what is out today, Apple is far from the last major manufacturer to have new phones in the works for this year.Essential phone and optional 360 camera (Photo: Kenzo Fong Hing (Essential)) Google is said to be refreshing its Pixel line in October while LG's recently announced V30, with a sleek design and beautiful OLED display, should hit store shelves in the next few weeks (exact pricing and release date are still TBA).There are also new entrants to the smartphone space, including Essential from Android creator Andy Rubin, which packs plenty of promise if it can beef up its camera (and other areas) via software upgrades.And if you are looking to save even more, consider models introduced last year that are still are on the market, including the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, Galaxy S7 and original Google Pixel.These should only get cheaper when the latest phones arrive.In short, there are plenty of good options if you're looking for a new phone this fall.Follow Eli Blumenthal on Twitter @eliblumenthal Read or

Want the iPhone X? It doesn’t have to cost you $1,000:::::Skip in Skip x Embed x Share CLOSE The iPhone X is expected to sell out fast--Jefferson Graham has tips on how to navigate the pre-order sales process on #TalkingTech.(Photo: Apple) The new iPhone X has given Apple fans plenty of reasons to be excited.Its the first drastically redesigned iPhone in ten years, with a full edge-to-edge OLED display, facial recognition and improved cameras that are ready for augmented reality.It also is the first with a nearly $1,000 starting price tag.While the price may be off-putting, with pre-orders set to begin this Friday, carrier offers have begun to appear and carry some good news.Assuming you have a semi-recent iPhone (iPhone 6 or later) or one of a variety of Android devices that aren't cracked, broken or water-damaged, you should be able to save several hundred dollars off the cost of the X, in many cases getting you more credit for your old phone than you would by trading it in to an online "reCommerce" site like Gazelle or uSell.Here's a breakdown of who will pay what.More: iPhone X orders: Here's how to nab one if you simply cannot wait More: Follow USA TODAY Money and Tech on Facebook First, the catch: Payment plans As to be expected, there is a catch with all of these deals.Each carrier is offering the iPhone X trade-in, assuming you finance the phone on one of their respective monthly payment plans.These plans are the equivalent of the old two-year contracts, allowing you to get the phone at a discount while presumably keeping you locked into a carrier for the next 12-24 months.The one (current) bright side is that thanks to increased competition, all the major carriers have various promotions where they are willing to buy you out of your current payment plan so long as you agree to switch to their network.More: T-Mobile plus Sprint: If you're a customer, here's why a merger would matter Sprint Sprint has one of the better trade-in deals available, offering $350 off the cost of an iPhone X if you trade in an iPhone 6 or later or if you trade in one of a variety of recent Android phones (including the Samsung Galaxy S7, S7 Edge, S8 and S8 Plus).As with other discounts, the credits will be applied to your monthly bill within two billing cycles, allowing you to get the 64GB iPhone X for $22.22 per month for 18 months on the company's Sprint Flex payment plan.The "limited time" offer is available to both new and existing subscribers and also includes the company's "iPhone Forever" program which will allow you to upgrade to next year's presumed newest iPhone.(Photo: Apple) T-Mobile T-Mobile will give you $300 off an iPhone X with the trade-in of a "qualifying device", a list that includes the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, 6S and 6S Plus, 7 and 7 Plus and the 8 and 8 Plus.The discount will be doled out as monthly bill credits over 24 months.Like Sprint, T-Mobile's program will allow you to trade in your iPhone X for a new device once 50% of the device has been paid off.T-Mobile's payment plans for the iPhone X range from $279.99 down and $30 per month for the 64GB model to $429.99 down and $30 a month for the 256GB version, after which you own the phone.Those who would prefer to lease the phone, and gain the flexibility to upgrade to a different device once every 30 days, can get the 64GB iPhone X for $0 upfront and monthly payments of $41.56 over 18 months as part of the company's "Jump on Demand" program.The 256GB iPhone X is $429.99 upfront and then $24 per month under this program.More: Genius new uses for that old iPhone More: How to make the most money selling your old iPhone Verizon Have an iPhone 6S, 6S Plus, 7 or 7 Plus?Verizon will give you $300 off a new iPhone X. IPhone 6, 6 Plus or SE?You can save $200.Trade-in of a Samsung Galaxy S7, S7 Edge, S8 and S8 Plus will also receive $300 off, as will the trade in of an LG G6, last year's Google Pixel or the Motorola Z2 Force.Older devices such as the Galaxy S6, S6 Edge or Note 5 will be eligible for $200 off.The savings will be distributed as credits on your monthly bill, applied over 24 months.Though be warned, Verizon requires you to have (or switch to) one of the company's unlimited plans.The waterproof iPhone X will be available for preorder starting Oct. 27.(Photo: Apple) AT&T AT&T's offer is seemingly the weakest of the four major carriers.The company's website revealed early Friday morning that it will be offering up to $300 in monthly bill credits for those upgrading in trading in their iPhone 7 Plus or up to $200 in credits for other devices.As of this writing it is unclear what the breakdown will be per device.Apple For those not interested in being locked into a carrier and would prefer the discount upfront, Apple will allow you to trade in your old iPhones as part of its trade up program.Values vary depending on the device, with the iPhone 6 netting you $145 off and last years iPhone 7 Plus saving you $375.Apple delivers the payments in the form of Apple gift cards or instant store credit if you are purchasing a new device.While Apples program isnt as generous for older devices, you can at least trade-in your old iPhone 5 for $40, getting you something for your five-year-old phone.Follow Eli Blumenthal on Twitter @eliblumenthal Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2hdHR1h
Apple sales gets a boost from 8 days of iPhone 8:::::Skip in Skip x Embed x Share CLOSE Jefferson Graham tests the Google Pixel 2 XL smartphone camera--is it the best one ever, as some have said?He compares to the Apple iPhone 8 Plus in a beach shootout on #Talking Tech.LOS ANGELES This year, Apple's new iPhone sales bump had to wait a quarter.Apple's fourth fiscal quarter, the one that ends just before holiday shopping begins, historically has one great week of sales to report the new iPhone released in late September.But this year, Apple shifted its sales strategy to introduce two new slightly improved models, the 8 and 8 Plus, and a third phone, the X. iPhone 8's went on sale Sept. 22, but Apple held back the big guns for Nov. 3, when the state-of-the art, $999 X hits store shelves.People now lining up for an #iphonex at 5th Apple Store NYC pic.twitter.com/JeN8rWTO9C Ed Baig (@edbaig) November 2, 2017 Apple still was able to blast through forecasts, reporting revenue of $52.6 billion, up 12% from the year ago quarter, and easily beating analyst expectations of $50.7 billion for the September-ending quarter collected by S&P Global Market Intelligence.Net income rose 19% to $10.7 billion and earnings per share climbed to $2.07, topping forecasts for $1.87.It sold 46.6 million iPhones, in line with forecasts of 46 million and up from 45.5 million a year ago.Of the iPhone figures cited, "we believe less than 10% of that is the 8," says Daniel Ives, an analyst with GBH Tech Research.The rest would be other iPhones like the 6S, 7 and 7 Plus, as well as the entry-level SE edition.Apple didn't break out sales of the various iPhones, and declined the invitation to do so, despite many requests from analysts on a conference call.Apple CEO Tim Cook did say that that once the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus went on sale, they "became our two most popular iPhone models and have been ever since."The iPhone 8 and 8 Plus phones were well received by critics but were so similar to the previous 7 and 7 Plus models that carriers reported less interest in the new phones than years past.The new X phone, which goes on sale Friday, got rave reviews this week, sold out of initial orders quickly, and has a backlog of 5-6 weeks for delivery."The jury is still out whether the iPhone 8 was a mistake," says Ives."We wont know for several quarters.It was soft out of gate, but we'll have to see how it does in the next quarters."Apple shares rallied 3% after hours.Vincent Brown has been here since 6:45 with friends.Runs a bakery in the Bronx, excited for the camera which will help his business pic.twitter.com/hWIyMKLS8r Eli Blumenthal (@eliblumenthal) November 2, 2017 Now all eyes are on the next quarterly result, which will have two months of sales of the X, and 3 months of the 8 and 8 Plus.Analysts expect the holiday quarter to move 81 million iPhones, up from 74.8 million iPhones in the year-ago holiday quarter.These iPhone sales should translate to a sales windfall.Apple expects sales of $84 billion to $87 billion this quarter; analysts forecast $84.6 billion.Beyond the iPhone, Apple said it sold 10.3 million iPad tablets, up 11% from the year ago quarter, and 5.3 million Macintosh computers, up 10%.What's emerged as the No.2 category after iPhones for Apple is Services, which includes iTunes, Apple Music and iCloud.It had its best quarter ever, Apple said, with $8.5 billion in revenues, up 34% from the year-ago quarter.The company hired two veterans from Sony TV to run its fledgling division, and according to the Hollywood trade publications, Apple is looking to spend $1 billion on originals, including a remake of Steven Spielberg's Amazing Stories TV anthology.Follow USA TODAY's Jefferson Graham on Twitter, @jeffersongraham Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2A49kcB

Test flight: Aboard the innovative HondaJet:::::Honda has developed a private jet as well as the second generation NSX sports car.(Photo: Nancy Trejos, USA TODAY) OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY AIRPORTI grab the best seat on Hondas light business jet, which is about to take off from this airport about six miles outside of downtown Columbus towards New Jerseys Teterboro Airport.Im sitting next to pilot Tom Maurer, who has been test flying HondaJets for about six years.Maurer has several sheets of paper that hes poring through with instructions on speeds to reach at various points on the route.But he doesnt really need the paperwork.He has three 14-inch landscape displays and two touchscreen controllers in front of him, and he maneuvers them like one would an iPad.He gets all the information he needs from the screen, developed by GPS technology company Garmin -- route, weather information, and details on aircraft around him.During the 85-minute flight, he barely has to hold on to the control wheel.Everything is automatic.He keeps up with radio chatter, answering questions from air traffic control.But for the most part, he is changing frequencies and following instructions.It reduces the workload, he says.You dont really have to touch the knobs.Its quite a change for a former Navy man who has been flying planes for about 27 years.But hes enjoying it.The single-pilot HondaJet, the first of which flew in June 2014, has a patented over-the-wing engine that maximizes cabin and storage space.It also reduces cabin noise.For a small planeit has a height of 14.9 feet and a length of just over 42 feetit can reach an altitude of 43,000 feet.Its highest speed is 422 knots at Flight Level 300.It can climb 3,990 feet a minute.Its not unusual for car manufacturers to delve into the aviation industry.Saab, Mitsubishi and Toyota also develop private jets.Honda Aircraft Company estimates that because of its unique design, the aircraft gets 17% better fuel efficiency for a typical mission of an aircraft its size.The HondaJet was the brain child of Michimasa Fujino, an engineer who is now the CEO of Honda Aircraft Company, a Honda subsidiary.He first sketched the design in 1997.Ten years later, Honda Aircraft Company broke ground on a new world headquarters and production facility at Piedmont Triad International Airport in Greensboro, N.C. Today, 20 years after Fujino came up with the idea for the HondaJet, the company has delivered 58 planes at a price tag of about $5 million each.The aircraft is certified in the USA, Mexico, Europe, Canada and Brazil.It will also soon spread its wings to China.But Honda is best known for its cars, and it is continuing to make advances with its flagship, the second-generation Acura NSX, a two-seat, mid-engine sports car.The price tag can reach nearly $200,000.The vehicle is produced at Performance Manufacturing Center in Marysville, Ohio.The operations there began 40 years ago with about 64 people building motorcycles.Now, the facility spans 8,000 acres with about 15,000 employees.The campus houses not just the plant, but offices and tracks for test-driving.Priced from $1,900 to $7,500, clients can customize their experiences to test drive an NSX, tour the factory, and visit the Honda Heritage Center, a museum that tells the story of the Japanese companys presence in North America.Those who have purchased a vehicle can even watch their actual car being made.Its a customizable, modular experience, says Matt Sloustcher, manager of public relations for Acura, Hondas luxury brand.On a recent Wednesday, I get to do all three over the span of 11 hours.We take off from Teterboro around 8 a.m. and land in Ohio about 90 minutes later.The jet can fit up to seven people, including the crew.The cabin itself is almost 5 feet in height and 5 feet in width.The seats are comfortable and can be adjusted, either reclining or sliding farther into the aisle.There's a pull-out table if we want to eat.Controls above adjust the window shades.There is a very well-concealed toilet in the back of the aircraft.Other options can be added to the aircraft, such as Wi-Fi.Its a smooth and quiet ride, even allowing for a short nap.Upon arrival, we're whisked off to the Honda Heritage Center, where we see almost every vehicle that Honda has created, including a 1971 N600 and a 1980 Elsinore CR250R motorcycle.Employees, even top executives, wear white jumpsuits or white jackets.The museum is free and open to the public.Next, we head to the testing facility, where we drive the NSX around a couple of sometimes very winding tracks, including a 7.5 mile high-speed one.Our last stop is the plant where we watch a car being manufactured.The painting is done by a robot, but much of the work is accomplished by hand.We stop to watch two employees install an engine before turning it over to a machine.Its not technology just for technology, but technology that helps augment the craftsmanship, says Ted Klaus, vice president of strategic research.After our tour, we return to the airport for our ride back home.This time Im not in the drivers seat, but Im happy to sit back to enjoy the views as we approach the Manhattan skyline.Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2A09Gky
Massive federal report to give in-depth look on climate change in the U.S.:::::Skip in Skip x Embed x Share CLOSE Trump environment chief: US to end Obama climate plan (2) Video provided by AFP Newslook Thousands are protesting President Trump's climate change policies on Saturday as part of the Peoples Climate March.(Photo: rui_noronha, Getty Images/iStockphoto) A federally mandated report set for release Friday will provide an in-depth examination of how climate change is already affecting Americans.The National Climate Assessment is prepared by the nation's top scientists every four years for the president, the Congress and the public.This is the fourth such report.The last version, released in 2014, was the largest, most comprehensive U.S.-focused climate change report ever produced.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said the report is an "authoritative assessment of the science of climate change with a focus on the U.S., and serves as the foundation for efforts to assess climate-related risks and inform decision-making about responses."A draft of the report released in August found human activities are causing the average temperature to quickly rise in the U.S., and Americans are already feeling the impact of climate change.Scientists from 13 federal agencies also found that recent decades have been the warmest of the past 1,500 years.It also said many lines of evidence demonstrate that human activities, especially emissions of greenhouse (heat-trapping) gases, are primarily responsible for recent observed climate change.The draft report concluded that even if humans immediately stopped emitting greenhouse gases, the world would still feel at least an additional 0.50 degrees Farenheit of warming over this century compared to today.Since that is unlikely, the projected actual rise is more than 3 degrees, according to the report.More: Draft climate change report at odds with Trump administration On Wednesday, a group of nine Democratic senators, led by Al Franken, D-Minn., sent a second letter to Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, asking what the Trump administration will do with the report findings and how the president will be briefed on climate change."Unless serious action is taken to rapidly reduce emissions, the United States will continue to warm several degrees over this century, with damages to infrastructure, ecosystems, and human health," the letter said.The second part of the assessment which focuses on the impacts of climate change on human systems and ecosystems will be released as a draft for public comment Friday, NOAA said.The expected contents of the report contradict claims by President Trump and his team, who have continually downplayed the human contribution to climate change and questioned the ability of scientists to predict its effects.Earlier this year, President Trump said he planned to withdraw the U.S. from the landmark Paris climate agreement, which requires countries to establish ambitious targets to reduce the greenhouse gasses that cause global warming.Contributing: John Bacon, USA TODAY Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2hAg4s5

AT&T is adding free HBO to subscribers of its Unlimited Choice plan, a perk it gave subscribers of its pricier Unlimited Plus in April.(Photo: AT&T) AT&T's $85.4 billion acquisition of Time Warner may be facing a fight with the Justice Department that could force concessions to sealing the deal announced a year ago.The DOJ's antitrust division is at work on an antitrust suit should the department opt to sue as a way to block the deal, The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday, citing people familiar with the situation.The Justice Department has been reviewing the merger since early this year.But AT&T CEO and Chairman Randall Stephenson has said he expects the deal to close by the end of the year.Analysts have predicted the Trump Administration's generally pro-business stance would override Trump's personal distaste for the deal.AT&T (T) shares fell 1%.Time Warner (TWX) shares lost 4%.AT&T downplayed the possibility the landmark deal, which would form a entertainment-telecom colossus better positioned to fight the increasing stretch of Internet giants into entertainment, could get derailed.When the DOJ reviews any transaction, it is common and expected for both sides to prepare for all possible scenarios," said Fletcher Cook, AT&T's vice president for global media relations, in an emailed statement."For over 40 years, vertical mergers like this one have always been approved because they benefit consumers without removing any competitors from the market.While we won't comment on our discussions with DOJ, we see no reason in the law or the facts why this transaction should be an exception.Similarly, Wall Street analysts have been positive on the deal's prospects."The development is a little surprising," said Tuna Amobi, an equity analyst at investment research firm CFRA.Previous transactions such as the Comcast 2011 acquisition of NBC Universal resulted in some conditions such as giving up any management control but not its 30% stake in online video service Hulu."This type of action is certainly not unprecedented ... (and) could be a strategy by the government to extract more concessions from both parties," he said."Im still inclined to believe the deal has a better chance than not of being approved."During the campaign, then-candidate Trump criticized the deal, saying the merger would give too much market power to one company, and he frequently has attacked Time Warner unit CNN for its coverage.The deal, announced in October 2016, would marry AT&T, which is the largest pay-TV provider and No.2 wireless carrier with a content powerhouse that owns HBO, CNN, TNT and Warner Bros. film studio.As the DOJ prepares a case, it is discussing potential settlements that would gain the deal's approval with some conditions, the Journal reported.However, timing of any announcement is uncertain and an agreement is not close at this time, the Journal says.The outcome on the merger could go either way, it reported.Follow USA TODAY reporter Mike Snider on Twitter: @MikeSnider.Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2A0nc7z
$7,500 electric car tax credit goes away under GOP plan. Not good for Tesla.:::::Skip in Skip x Embed x Share CLOSE If you're thinking of buying an all-electric or hybrid car, here are a few things to consider.USA TODAY Jeff Solie plugs in his electric Tesla sedan at his home in New Berlin, Wis., on July 13, 2017.(Photo: Morry Gash, AP) The House Republican tax plan would ax the tax credit for electric-vehicle buyers, dealing a blow to the ambitions of Tesla and other battery-car makers as they try to give the nascent technology mainstream appeal.The tax overhaul proposed Thursday would eliminate the tax credit of up to $7,500 that's currently offered to buyers of vehicles such as the Tesla Model 3, Chevrolet Bolt and Nissan Leaf.The tax credit is viewed as crucial to propelling technology that's currently more expensive than comparable internal combustion engine cars.Proponents of eliminating the incentive say the government shouldn't pick one technology over another, or should cut most tax credits to simplify the overall code and lower rates.Genevieve Cullen, president of the Electric Drive Transportation Association, criticized the credit's proposed elimination.The association "continues to believe that a reformed tax code should include a robust set of incentives to support the electrification of transportation," Cullen said in a letter to Rep. Kevin Brady, R-Texas, chairman of the Ways and Means Committee.While most analysts expect electric cars to reach cost parity with traditional vehicles in the coming years, the tax credit's swift demise could undermine momentum for the technology.More: Tesla production snags delay Model 3 electric car More: General Motors to switch to electric vehicles as gas vehicles die a slow death More: Volvo ditching gasoline engines for electric, hybrid cars after 2019 In any event, it's dismal timing for Silicon Valley's Tesla, which is currently launching the Model 3, its first mass-market car.The tax credit represents a 21% effective discount on the Model 3's starting price of $35,000.Although the vehicle has encountered production setbacks, Tesla is still hoping to fulfill hundreds of thousands of refundable deposits made by shoppers when the tax credit was still in place.Tesla stock was down 6.8% in afternoon trading Thursday to $299.26.The decline may be largely attributable to consternation over the company's manufacturing difficulties and the whopping $619 million third-quarter loss the company posted Wednesday.Tesla declined to comment for this story.The tax credit's potential demise is also tough to stomach for General Motors, which has invested heavily in the Bolt, and Nissan, which is about to start selling the redesigned Leaf.Tax credits are an important customer benefit that can help accelerate the acceptance of electric vehicles," GM said in a statement."Because General Motors believes in an all-electric future, we will work with Congress to explore ways to maintain this incentive.A Nissan representative was not immediately available for comment.To be sure, the plan is far from final.The legislation is subject to negotiation, votes and the president's signature.The electric car credit could yet survive.Follow USA TODAY reporter Nathan Bomey on Twitter @NathanBomey.Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2A0oFec
Cosmic-ray imaging reveals mysterious 'void' in Great Pyramid of Giza:::::Skip in Skip x Embed x Share CLOSE The recently discovered hidden void is 100 feet long and sits above the pyramid's Great Gallery.Video provided by Newsy Newslook Tourists ride horses at the historical site of the Giza Pyramids in Giza, near Cairo, on March 5, 2014.(Photo: Hassan Ammar, AP) Its rare that something new is discovered in one of the worlds oldest buildings, but thats what scientists just did.A previously unknown, hidden internal "void" was recently identified in the Great Pyramid of Giza.The research was published Thursday in the peer-reviewed British journal Nature.The discovery was made using cosmic-ray based imaging, which shows how modern particle physics can reveal new information about ancient structures.The Great Pyramid, or Khufus Pyramid, was built during the reign of Pharaoh Khufu (Cheops), who reigned from 2509 to 2483 B.C.It's the only one of the original seven wonders of the ancient world still standing.Two additional nearby pyramids were built for the pharaoh's son and grandson.An artist's conception of the void (white area) inside the pyramid.(Photo: ScanPyramids mission) There is no consensus on how the monument was constructed, though many theories have been proposed over the centuries.To learn more about the internal structure, scientists imaged the pyramid using muons subatomic particles that are by-products of cosmic rays and can penetrate stone.Muons take distinct paths when moving through stone or air, making it possible to distinguish cavities from solid formations.This allows scientists to "see" inside the pyramid to areas that are not otherwise accessible."Cosmic-ray muon radiography allows us to visualize the known and potentially unknown voids in the pyramid in a non-invasive way," the authors wrote in the study.The scientists said the void was about 100 feet long and is located above the pyramid's Grand Gallery.While no one knows the role of this void, the study said, its the first major inner structure found in the Great Pyramid since the 19th century.Egypt's former antiquities minister and famed archaeologist Zahi Hawass was somewhat dismissive of the new research, saying that the area in question has been known of for years and thus does not constitute a discovery.He has long downplayed the usefulness of scans of ancient sites."The Great Pyramid is full of voids.We have to be careful how results are presented to the public," Hawass said.Regardless, the scientists in the study said it's really only the beginning of the research: "The detailed structure of the void should be further studied," the study said."Overall, this discovery shows how the methods developed in particle physics can shed light on one of the most important heritage buildings, and it calls for more interdisciplinary collaborations to help understanding the pyramid and its construction process."Contributing: The Associated Press The muon telescope was set up in front of the pyramid's north face.(Photo: ScanPyramids mission) Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2hycQVP
7 steps for crafting the perfect password:::::Skip in Skip x Embed x Share CLOSE Kim Komando tells you what to do, and what old advice to ignore, about creating passwords that will thwart hackers.The man who said use capital letters, special characters and numbers in your password is now taking back that advice.(Photo: hanieriani, Getty Images/iStockphoto) Your password can ruin your life.I know that sounds dramatic, but its true.If someone figures out the password to your email, youre in trouble.Social media?Even worse.Once hackers access your online bank account, they can wreck your finances, and you may feel the repercussions of that break-in for years.It seems not a week goes by that we dont hear about another data breach.How do you know if the hackers have your info?Find out whether your email has been hacked or stolen.Most of us have the wrong idea about passwords.We think they have to be convoluted messes, like F$%Th5l2K!&.This theory reigned for yearsthat passwords should be nonsensical and hard to remember.It started in 2003 with guidelines from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), which insisted on random combinations of numbers, letters, and symbols.The organizations manager, Bill Burr, spread this gospel for years.But in a recent interview with the Wall Street Journal, he admitted that this wasnt nearly as effective as hed thought.Thanks to a new round of research, cyber-security experts have changed their tune.Yes, you should still avoid guessable passwords like p@ssword1 or letmein.But a strong password also can be logical, fluid and easy to remember.More: Password expert says he was wrong: Numbers, capital letters and symbols are useless 1.Passwords should withstand 100 guesses This is the most important part: No matter what your password is, it should withstand 100 guesses, which means it shouldnt be tied to any public information about you or your family.Hackers often turn to your social media profiles to find information about you, and a little data goes a long way, such as your birthday and the name of your pet.Experts believe that criminals can guess the average person's password nearly 73% of the time, and they can often access other accounts by using slight variations on the same password.Facebook is all about making it easy to share your life with your friends and family.Unfortunately, there are some things you shouldn't share online.These bits of information can put you in danger of identity theft, losing your job or causing other major headaches.Here are five of the biggest offenders you should not put on your profile.More Kim Komando: How to stop ads from following you online 2.Use a phrase Instead of thinking of your password as a secret code, think of it as a passphrase.These are strings of words that are both easy to memorize but hard for anyone else to crack.Suppose you wanted to be an astronaut when you were a kid, and your favorite color is fuschia.You have never mentioned these facts online, and only your Mom knows such trivia about you.You could compose a passphrase like ilikefuschiaastronauts.Youll never forget it, and the passphrase will confound hackers for (literally) centuries.I actually recommended and told how to create a great passphrase a little over a year ago.The advice is still valid.Go here to come up with your own.3.Go long You might want to sit down for this one: The new NIST guidelines suggest allowing users to create passwords up to 64 characters in length.As if that isnt weird enough, the guidelines also allow spaces between words.While many people just try to meet the bare minimum requirement of using eight characters, you will get a much stronger password by stretching things out.You could theoretically create a complex list or sentence, which still makes perfect sense to you.You could list all your pets names from childhood, like fluffy princess rex spike booboo chewie, or all the streets on the way to your favorite restaurant, like academy main washington ohio central.Easy to remember.Hard to crack.More: If you're going to use your pet's name as a password, it better be good 4.Dont change your password until you have to Until recently, consumers were advised to change their passwords every three months.But as NISTs Paul Grassi recently told the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Expiration isnt a motivator to create a brand new password, its motivation to shift one character so you can remember the password.If youve created a strong password, then dont worry about changing it out all the time.Just stick with it unless youve been notified of a security breach that requires a password reset.More Komando: How to create passwords that are easy to remember 5.Choose something memorable Remember, each password should be unique, but they dont have to be cumbersome.The NIST calls passwords memorized secrets.You want to avoid the temptation to write down passwords, so pick a password that has enough meaning to you to stay in your mind.Im not a big fan of password managers.I commit my passwords to memory.But if you cannot do that, heres a free program that will help you store your passwords safely and easily.6.Get creative with characters It may take websites some time to catch up to the latest NIST guidelines, but you can still create a memorable password that meets current restrictions.Go back to Burrs advice on passphrases.You might choose something like ArizonaCardinalsfootballisnumber1!or Igivemyjob1000%everyday.Those meet the requirements of having at least eight characters, a special character, and upper and lowercase letters.7.Use two-factor identification While passwords help protect your information, cyber-criminals are more sophisticated than ever.If they break into your accounts, you may not recognize the damage until its too late.Months passed before the public learned about the Equifax breach, and its hard to assess how much information has been leaked, nor how it will be used.If you havent checked to see if your personal details are in the hands of cyber crooks, do it now.Thats why two-factor identification is so important.Using text-messages, emails or special apps, an account-holder will receive a notification every time a password is changed, entered on a new device, or at a new location.You will have to verify that its you attempting to gain access.How do you do this?Ill walk you through just a few steps to set it up.What questions do you have?Call my national radio show and click here to find it on your local radio

Google is partnering with AutoNation, the country's largest auto dealership chain, in its push to produce self-driving cars for wide use.AutoNation said Thursday that its dealerships will provide maintenance and repairs for Waymo's self-driving fleet of Chrysler Pacifica vehicles.Waymo is Google's automated vehicle technology wing.The agreement will include additional models of vehicles when Waymo brings them on line.Terms of the multi-year deal were not disclosed.Google started off with a fleet of 100 autonomous Pacificas and has announced plans to add 500.Waymo is negotiating with other automakers, such as Honda, about autonomous vehicle systems, the company said.More: Traffic safety: Talking car mandate from Trump administration has been set aside More: Waymo shows off the secret facility where it trains self-driving cars The vehicles likely will be driven for several hundred thousand miles, and they'll need to be maintained to accomplish that, AutoNation CEO Mike Jackson said Thursday in an interview.The dealership chain, he said, has maintained more than 40 million vehicles."As Waymo moves to other markets and also puts other brands in service, we have expertise on any vehicle they want to put into service," Jackson said.Waymo has been partnering with a number of car-centric companies like Avis, the ridesharing company Lyft, and Fiat Chrysler.Since Google first began pursuing self-driving vehicle technology in 2009, a wave of major players have joined the chase.General Motors and Ford, along with other big technology companies, including Apple and ride-hailing service Uber, are developing their own technology.Waymo is in a legal tussle with Uber, alleging that one of its former managers stole its trade secrets and took them along when he joined Uber in 2016.The trial is set to begin later this year.AutoNation Inc., based in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, runs about 360 dealerships in the U.S.Skip in Skip x Embed x Share CLOSE General Motors plans to test vehicles in fully autonomous mode in New York state in early 2018, according to New York Governor Andrew Cuomo.Fred Katayama reports.Video provided by Reuters Newslook Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2hxS8Fw

Here’s why your next TV should be an OLED—and what that means:::::If you're at all into tech fads, you've almost definitely heard of OLED TVs and their stunning picture quality.But even if you're not a TV geek, it's worth getting excited about this new TV tech.Here's what you need to know.What is an OLED TV?OLED (short for Organic Light-Emitting Diode) is a newer panel technology that differs from traditional LED/LCD TVs in a single important way.An OLED TV's pixelsthe individual points of light that make up the pictureactivate independently of one another.These pixels emit their own light and color, unlike in LED/LCD displays where a backlight shines through the pixels to create an image.For this reason, LED TVs are considered "transmissive," while OLED TVs are considered "emissive."Remember plasma TVs?They were emissive, too.That's pretty much the only difference.Credit: Reviewed.com / Michael Desjardin Why does it matter?The ability to turn individual pixels on and off means OLED TVs can offer dramatically higher contrast than traditional LED/LCD TVs.That's because when OLEDs pixels shut off, they are truly black.Credit: Reviewed.com / Jackson Ruckar Most OLED TVs are also far thinner than their LED/LCD equivalents because they don't use a backlight, but regardless deliver perceptually perfect viewing angles.Finally, no backlight means no excess luminance to pollute what's on the screen.So what's the catch?OLED's biggest problem is that only one company is manufacturing TV-sized panels: LG.This means they're only available in a limited range of sizes (55, 65, 77 inches) and tend to be pretty expensive.If you buy an OLED, you're also buying into all the latest TV tech4K, HDR, and smart features.There's no real "frills-free" OLEDs to be had.Okayhere are my favorites If you're pretty sure you want to buy into what is probably the best-looking TV you've ever seen, here are a few of the more "affordable" ones we've tested and found to be totally excellent: LG 55-inch B7$1,600 on Amazon LG 55-inch C7$1,800 on Amazon LG 65-inch B6$2,500 on Amazon

Twitter employee briefly shuts Trump account, putting controls in question:::::(Reuters) - Twitter Inc faced questions on Friday about its approach to internal security after a company employee briefly deactivated U.S. President Donald Trumps account.The 11-minute blackout of the @realDonaldTrump account late on Thursday drew widespread attention on the microblogging site.Twitter is already grappling with criticism of its handling of account suspensions, user abuse and changes to its terms of service.Twitter on Friday declined to answer questions including how many employees can suspend an account or what special protections there are for high-profile users like Trump.We are not going to be able to publicly discuss these kinds of things, a company spokesman said.Trump often uses Twitter to comment on political and military matters.Twitter users expressed concerns that employee interference or technology glitches involving his account could threaten national security.Security experts had previously speculated Twitter could have installed special protections on Trumps account, such as the ability to only access it from certain devices.We have learned that this was done by a Twitter customer-support employee who did this on the employees last day.We are conducting a full internal review, Twitter said in a tweet late on Thursday.We are continuing to investigate and are taking steps to prevent this from happening again, the company said in an earlier tweet.Reuters could not determine how many Twitter employees had the authority to delete accounts or tamper with them in other ways, such as by sending bogus Tweets.Speaking on condition of anonymity, a former Twitter employee said it was unlikely a worker with suspension privileges would also be able to hijack an account to send out messages.Different types of access, the former employee said.Im not sure anyone at Twitter can tweet from someone elses account.FILE PHOTO: The masthead of U.S. President Donald Trump's @realDonaldTrump Twitter account is seen on July 11, 2017.@realDonaldTrump/Handout/File Photo via REUTERS The company on Friday separately announced minor updates to its rules, the latest in a string of changes designed to improve user experience.Twitter shares were up 0.3 percent in morning trading.ROGUE ACCOUNT FILE PHOTO: U.S. President Donald Trump talks to the media on South Lawn of the White House in Washington before his departure to Greensboro, North Carolina, U.S., October 7, 2017.REUTERS/Yuri Gripas/File Photo Trump, who has nearly 42 million Twitter followers, responded to the temporary loss of his account by boasting about his wide reach on the service.My Twitter account was taken down for 11 minutes by a rogue employee, Trump said on Twitter early on Friday.I guess the word must finally be getting out-and having an impact.He has used Twitter to attack opponents and promote his policies, both during the 2016 presidential campaign and since taking office in January.Thursday evenings incident also raised questions about how Twitter secures the official @potus presidential account and other accounts that could potentially influence world events.Technology companies including Twitter are meanwhile under attack from U.S. lawmakers for failing to stem the spread of Russian propaganda and misinformation on their platforms.Twitter in particular has long been criticized for not doing enough to police its platform and respond to complaints of abuse.The temporary deletion of the Trump account sparked a flood of criticism from Twitter users, though many of the presidents critics also said they were happy to see the account disabled.In 2013, hackers took control of the main account for the Associated Press and tweeted that explosions at the White House had injured then-President Barack Obama, causing stocks to briefly plunge.
Apple sees strong holiday sales, smooth sailing for iPhone X:::::SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O) on Thursday reported better-than-expected earnings and offered a rosy forecast for the holiday shopping season, allaying investor concerns about production delays on the new iPhone X and demonstrating remarkable strength across its growing line of products and services.The stellar earnings report came just as the iPhone X went on sale Friday morning in Australia.Long lines were forming at Apple stores around the world, recalling the consumer frenzy that greeted early versions of the iPhone, but had faded with more recent launches.With supplies potentially tight, some Australian purchasers were already planning to sell their phones for as much as A$3,000, nearly double the A$1,579 selling price.Apple shares rose 4 percent in after-hours trading to hit an all-time high, with analysts lavishing praise on Apple CEO Tim Cook and speculating on when Apple might become the first public company worth a trillion dollars.The earnings demonstrate how Apple is able to drive growth across an ever-expanding product line that now includes five different iPhone models along with the iPad, the Mac, the Apple Watch and a suite of fast-growing services offerings.We had good success, I would say, through the different iPhones, Cook said on a call with analysts.We tried hard to have an iPhone that is as affordable as possible for people that really want an iPhone, but may have a more limited budget.Just a few weeks ago, Apple appeared to be facing a rare stumble with a delay in the iPhone X launch and rumors of production problems that could limit supply.But Apple executives on Thursday shrugged off the concerns as Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri told Reuters the company was quite happy with how manufacturing of the iPhone X was progressing.Analysts have been eager to see whether Apple can meet demand for the iPhone X during the crucial holiday quarter, with most saying it will likely take it until next year or early spring to do so.Where the demand curve and supply curve are going to intersect, we do not know.It does not have a predecessor product, Maestri told Reuters.STRONG MARGINS Apple forecast fiscal first-quarter revenue of $84 billion to $87 billion, at the high end of analysts average expectations of $84.18 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Customers wait in line for the new iPhone X, which goes on sale on November 3, outside an Apple store in New York City, U.S., November 2, 2017.REUTERS/Brendan McDermid A trillion-dollar market cap may now be in Cooks sights in light of these results and guidance around iPhone X, said Daniel Ives, an analyst at GBH Insights, referring to Apples chief executive.The Cupertino, California-based companys market capitalization of about $868 billion already makes it the worlds most valuable publicly-traded company.There are still questions around supplies of the new phone and longer-term demand.Bob ODonnell, head of Techanalysis Research, cautioned that if Apple is not able to fill demand for iPhone X over the holiday quarter, it would push buyers to wait until Apples March quarter, by which time they may have spent their money elsewhere.Slideshow (12 Images) What we dont know is, how long will this first group of (iPhone X buyers) last?ODonnell said.Apple said it sold 46.7 million iPhones in the fourth quarter ended Sept. 30, above analysts estimates of 46.4 million, according to financial data and analytics firm FactSet.However, average selling prices of $618 fell short of forecasts of $638.The companys net income rose to $10.71 billion, or $2.07 per share, in the quarter, from $9.01 billion, or $1.67 per share, a year earlier.That beat the average analyst estimate of $1.87 per share.Apple forecast a gross margin of 38 percent to 38.5 percent, higher than many analysts expected because new products often have higher costs.Maestri attributed the margin strength to Apples growing services business, which brought in $8.5 billion in revenue compared to analyst estimates of $7.5 billion.That included a favorable $640 million adjustment, though Apple officials did not elaborate.The $28.85 billion revenue from iPhone sales accounted for nearly 55 percent of total revenue, which rose 12.2 percent to $52.58 billion.Analysts on average were expecting total revenue of $50.7 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Apple also said it returned to revenue growth in China, bringing in $9.8 billion compared with $8 billion a year ago, driven by double-digit unit sale increases of the iPhone.Maestri also told Reuters the company had doubled its revenue in India during the fiscal fourth quarter, though he did not give any details.
Cryptocurrencies' market cap hits record $200 billion as bitcoin soars:::::LONDON (Reuters) - The aggregate value of all cryptocurrencies hit a record high of over $200 billion on Wednesday, according to industry website Coinmarketcap, putting their reported market value at more than that of U.S. banking giant Citigroup (C.N).A copy of bitcoin standing on PC motherboard is seen in this illustration picture, October 26, 2017.Picture taken October 26, 2017.REUTERS/Dado Ruvic The new record came as the biggest and best-known cryptocurrency, bitcoin, hit a record high of $7,500 BTC=BTSP on the Luxembourg-based Bitstamp exchange, after a more than tenfold increase in value over the past 12 months.That took its own market cap - its price multiplied by the number of coins that have been released into circulation - to a record high of more than $120 billion.The second-biggest cryptocurrency, ether - sometimes known as Ethereum after the project behind it - has a market cap of just below $30 billion, with another 1000 or so rival digital currencies making up the rest of the $200 billion.If the cryptocurrency market were a company, its valuation would put it in the top 25 firms on the S&P 500 .SPX stock index.The latest surge in bitcoin was driven by news this week that CME Group (CME.O), the worlds largest derivative exchange operator, would launch bitcoin futures in the fourth quarter of the year, as well as speculation that Amazon could be set to accept the digital currency.Many are concerned that the market represents a bubble, with the latest warning coming from the head of Credit Suisse on Thursday.

Apple firmly on course for $1 trillion valuation: analysts:::::(Reuters) - Apple Incs shares hit a record-high on Friday after the tech giant reported a blowout fourth quarter and shrugged off concerns related to the iPhone X, prompting more analysts to put a trillion-dollar valuation on the company.The Apple Inc. store is seen on the day of the new iPhone 7 smartphone launch in Los Angeles, California, U.S., September 16, 2016.REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson The stock rose as much as 3.7 percent to $174.26, briefly breaching $900 billion in market value, amid declines in the broader market.The gains added nearly $32 billion to the companys market capitalization.The Cupertino, California-based company also forecast a strong holiday quarter ahead, which will include the iPhone X that started selling on Nov. 3.We see iPhone X unlocking pent-up iPhone upgrades, especially in China, driving more than 20 percent iPhone unit growth and a revenue and earnings beat in 2018, analyst Katy Huberty on Morgan Stanley said.The glass-and-steel $999 phone appeared to have brought back the frenzy associated with iPhone launches - long lines formed outside Apple stores in Asia as fans flocked to buy the new phone.The company will make 30 million iPhone X units during the current quarter, Nomura Instinet analysts estimated, allaying production worries related to the phone.Apple said on Thursday it expects first-quarter revenue of $84 billion to $87 billion, at the high end of analysts average expectations of $84.18 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.We and many others had feared that guidance could be weaker, reflecting only 9 weeks of the flagship iPhone X and limitations on supply, Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi said.At least 13 brokerages raised their price targets on the stock, with Citigroup making the most bullish move by raising its price target by $30 to $200.Of the 37 analysts that track the stock, as per Thomson Reuters data, 31 had a buy, or higher rating.None had a sell.With the latest brokerage actions, at least nine Wall Street analysts now have target prices that puts Apples market value above $1 trillion.Drexel Hamiltons Brian White is still the most bullish among Apple analysts tracked by Thomson Reuters, raising his target price further to $235.Apples fourth-quarter results underscored the companys ability to drive growth not just on iPhones, but across its range of products, analysts said.The companys suite now includes five different iPhone models, the iPad, the Mac and the Apple Watch as well as its fast-growing services.Apple said it sold 46.7 million iPhones in the fourth quarter ended Sept. 30, above analysts estimates of 46.4 million, according to financial data and analytics firm FactSet.Mac and iPad sales too were above the estimates of most analysts.

Long lines for iPhone X help push Apple shares to record high:::::NEW YORK/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Shoppers surged into Apple Inc stores across the world on Friday to buy the new iPhone X, signaling stronger demand for the 10th anniversary version of the premium smartphone than the last two iterations.Investors and analysts took the swell of interest, alongside the companys better-than-expected sales forecast for the upcoming holiday shopping season, as signs that Apple could be the first ever company worth $1 trillion.Apples shares rose 3 percent on Friday, hitting a record high and giving the worlds most valuable publicly traded company a market capitalization of almost $890 billion.I cant wait to get to my office and plug it in, back it up and play around with it, said Jordan Shapiro, a 34-year-old recruiter from New Jersey who was one of the first to get into Apples flagship store on Manhattans Fifth Avenue, at the head of a line that stretched for a block.Jasmine Rivera, a 16-year-old from Las Vegas, said getting one of the new phones was the highlight of her New York trip with her aunt.Im so excited and cant wait to show this to my friends, she said.Im especially excited about the camera quality and facial recognition.The glass-and-stainless-steel device that Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook has billed as the biggest leap forward since the original iPhone, starts at $999 in the United States.The handset features an edge-to-edge display designed for deeper color rendition and an innovative camera that uses facial recognition to unlock and operate the phone.Cook appeared on TV greeting the first customers in line at the companys store in Palo Alto, California, about a half-hour drive from Apples headquarters in Cupertino.In nearby San Francisco, about 250 people lined up outside the Apple store in the Union Square shopping district.Im feeling good, but my socks are wet, said Ross Hendrix, 20, one of the first in line after camping out on the sidewalk despite a light rain on Thursday night.GLOBAL EXCITEMENT Similar scenes of excitement occurred earlier in the day in Asia and Europe.In Australia, around 400 people queued outside Apples main store in central Sydney to pay A$1,579 ($1,218) for the new phone.Just 30 turned up for the September release of the iPhone 8, an incremental update of the iPhone 7.A man pays to buy new iPhone Xs from those who just bought at Apple Stores, on a street in Hong Kong.REUTERS/Bobby Yip Its beautiful bro, what a feeling, Im excited, builder Bishoy Behman, 18, told Reuters after picking up two iPhone X as the first in line.He said he camped outside the store for a week before paying to improve his place in the queue overnight.In Apples Omotesando store in Tokyo, some 550 people were waiting in a line stretching to around 600 meters.Im going home, and after having a rest, Id like to have fun (with the phone), said first-in-line Yamaura, a 21-year-old college student who spent six days in the queue.In Europe, Apple stores in Amsterdam, Berlin and London saw lines of several hundred fans, while smaller, more subdued crowds were observed at stores in Frankfurt and Paris.Arbitrage traders were also in line in an attempt to take advantage of the strong demand.In Hong Kong, some buyers quickly resold iPhone X handsets for a profit, but the resale premium eased as waiting times fell and supply concerns eased.Slideshow (21 Images) Newly purchased iPhone X were reselling for HK$11,800 ($1,512) soon after sales began, but the price quickly fell to HK$10,300, a trader told Reuters.In mainland China - where Hong Kong traders often sell newly purchased goods - the anniversary models starting price is 8,388 yuan ($1,267).SUPPLY CLOSER TO DEMAND Analysts had expressed concern that supply issues might stop Apple satisfying early demand.The camera, for instance, has never before been manufactured in the volume Apple demands.But Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri told Reuters on Thursday that Apple was quite happy with how manufacturing of the iPhone X was progressing.Production is growing every week, and thats very, very important during a ramp period, he said.Demand and supply for the iPhone X appear to be coming back into balance, according to Apples online store.While last week users trying to order the iPhone X were told they faced waits up to five to six weeks, these delays are now three to four weeks.The rush of interest in the new phone came after Apple issued an upbeat sales forecast for the year-end holiday shopping season on Thursday.Wall Street welcomed that outlook, and five analysts now have stock price targets that would move Apples market value past $1 trillion.Fridays lines signaled the company was on track for a pretty good replacement cycle said Edison Investment Research analyst Richard Windsor, but he questioned whether the new model sales will be as large as prior iPhone upgrade cycles.We do not think that the iPhone X will offer a cycle nearly as big as the iPhone 6 and my concern is that this is what the market is looking for, said Windsor, who actively tracks all the major players in the global smartphone industry.
Estonia orders online ID lock-down to fix security flaw:::::TALLINN (Reuters) - Estonia plans to block access to the countrys vaunted online services for 760,000 people from midnight on Friday to fix a security flaw in some of the Baltic countrys identity smartcards that was identified earlier this year.Estonia is seen as a leader in providing government services online and has championed the issue within the European Union in recent years, and the security issue leaves it with its much-touted digital IDs in an awkward position.A nation-wide online identity system allows citizens access to most government and private company services via the web, including banking, school reports, health and pension records, medical prescriptions and voting in government elections.But Estonias online ID service ran afoul of an encryption vulnerability identified by researchers earlier this year that exposes smartcards, security tokens and other secure hardware chips made by the German company Infineon.Infineon said last month it had resolved the problem, but the fix still means cards and equipment need to be updated.Both the Estonian government and Infineon have said there are no signs the security flaw had been exploited.The Estonian online services would be blocked for affected digital IDs until they renewed certificates incorporating the fix, the Estonian government said in a statement.The functioning of an e-state is based on trust and the state cannot afford identity theft happening to the owner of an Estonian ID card, Prime Minister Juri Ratas said.Thursday and Friday saw crowds pack into Estonias police and board guard service offices to get their ID cards certificates updated while the online update service was frequently overloaded, leaving many frustrated.Britains ambassador to Estonia, Theresa Bubbear tweeted late on Thursday: #eEstonia losing its shine?Spent hours over 2 days trying to update my ID card as per govt/MFA instructions.Still trying...
Carmakers plan 400 Europe car charging stations by 2020:::::FRANKFURT (Reuters) - A group of mainly German carmakers will open ultra-fast electric vehicle charging stations this year and plans a pan-European network of 400 by 2020, hoping to narrow Teslas lead.An electric car is being charged in a Paris street, France, September 12, 2017.REUTERS/Philippe Wojazer News about the initiative, first flagged a year ago, had been long anticipated as governments push for improvements in infrastructure that would encourage drivers to switch to electric cars.IONITY, a joint venture of BMW AG, Daimler AG, Ford Motor Co and Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) with its Audi and Porsche brands, plans to open 20 stations to the public this year in Germany, Norway and Austria.They will be 120 km (75 miles) apart and run in partnership with Tank & Rast [LINDOTA.UL], Circle K and OMV.The first pan-European HPC network plays an essential role in establishing a market for electric vehicles, IONITYs CEO Michael Hajesch said on Friday.He added that the fast-charging stations would also offer digital-payment capability.IONITY is still in talks with charging station suppliers and a decision is expected soon, a spokeswoman said, declining to say how much the joint venture would invest.Installing thousands of High-Power Charging (HPC) stations across the globe will require billions of dollars in investment and offer an opportunity to manufacturers.The car consortiums new fast chargers will cost about 200,000 euros ($233,000) each, sources said previously.Companies ranging from engineering conglomerates such as Siemens to small specialists like ChargePoint are all hoping for a slice of the pie.IONITY will expand its network to 100 stations in 2018, each one enabling several drivers of different car brands to charge their vehicles at the same time.Anxiety over whether battery-powered cars have the range to reach their destination is inhibiting some drivers from switching from petrol or diesel models.But with U.S. all-electric challenger Tesla stealing a lead, established brands are teaming up to ensure that electric vehicles (EVs) can get quickly back on the road.Each charging point will have a capacity of 350 kW, and will use an existing European standard, the Combined Charging System, to reduce charging times compared to existing systems.A half-hour charge will give a Tesla driver about 270 km in extra driving range - roughly half the time it would take to get a similar boost at a 50 kW charge point that is now the industry standard.($1 = 0.8587 euros)
WhatsApp messenger hit by temporary outage; Facebook investigating:::::MUMBAI/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Facebook Incs WhatsApp messenger suffered a temporary outage in India and many other countries, according to reports from multiple users on Facebook and Twitter on Friday.FILE PHOTO: The WhatsApp messaging application is seen on a phone screen August 3, 2017.REUTERS/Thomas White/File Photo Users in countries ranging from Brazil and Russia to Vietnam and Myanmar reported on social media that WhatsApp was down in their countries.The extent of the outage and the reasons for it were not immediately known.Whatsappdown was the top trending item on Twitter in India, which is WhatsApps biggest market with about 200 million of its billion-plus users.It was also a top trending item on Twitter in Pakistan, Britain, Germany and many other countries.Users reported WhatsApp, the worlds most popular messaging service, had begun to gradually function again about 30 minutes after initial complaints of an outage appeared on social media.Users in Malaysia and Singapore also complained of WhatsApp being down in those countries.A spokeswoman for Facebook in Singapore said the company was still investigating the matter.Independent websites monitoring outages of popular social media services via online conversations and Twitter messages report regular outages for WhatsApp, often one every few weeks, but these are typically brief and confined to certain geographies.WhatsApp has faced similar widespread outages this year, including for several hours in May.WhatsApp is used by more than 1.2 billion people around the world and is a key tool for communications and commerce in many countries.The service was acquired by Facebook in 2014 for $19 billion.

WiFi-equipped school buses help students get online:::::CNN has produced this story in partnership with the GSMA #caseforchange project.To find out more about how mobile connectivity can change the world, follow #caseforchange on YouTube, Facebook and Twitter.(CNN) The digital age continues to spark creative developments in education.Wireless gadgets are now commonplace in the typical American classroom.But while technology is helping thousands of students reach new heights in their education, many others are falling behind.Dubbed "the homework gap" by researchers, students without the use of reliable internet access at home find it harder to complete and submit homework assignments, further expanding the inequality already seen in low-income communities.While some US schools provide their students with laptops or iPads, according to Pew Research Center , almost 5 million American households with school-aged children lack broadband in the home.Low-income homes with children are four times more likely to lack broadband as middle or high income families.Innovative methods With the gap widening, some school districts have taken it upon themselves to change this dynamic by introducing an innovative solution.WiFi school buses are one new approach to help students without access to fast broadband at home get connected.The school buses are equipped with routers and students use a public network to connect to the internet.This allows children who have long commutes, which can be two hours each day, to finish homework assignments on their journey.Richmond County School System in Augusta GA is one of the school districts piloting a WiFi school bus program.According to a national survey in 2012, 24.4% of Richmond County's population lived in poverty with a high school graduation rate of just 61.8%.Many households in the community did not have broadband access so the district, which has more than 30,000 students, introduced two WiFi school buses in 2016.Kaden Jacobs, Richmond County School System's director of communications, says that the WiFi buses were introduced to close the digital divide students in the district were facing."Our goal is to offer all students in Richmond County equal access to broadband that is required for students to meet academic rigor and obtain 21st-century skills," says Jacobs.The buses transport children to and from school and were parked at two community centers daily during the summer.The district is currently analyzing how the program has impacted grades.A global issue But the homework gap is not just an American problem -- schools all over the world are trying to battle the digital divide.Cell phone ownership in developing nations is increasing substantially.According to a report by Pew Research Center , cell phones are as common in Nigeria and South Africa as in the United States.A report by Ericsson Mobility suggests that by 2020 around 70% of the world's population will be using smartphones.Using this new trend to their advantage, schools around the world are implementing mobile learning programs as a tool to connect students outside of the classroom.One example is a program in Niger that used exercises on a mobile phone to improve reading and numeracy in adult education.In South Africa, a Nokia program called MoMath Project let children answer math problems via their cell phones and reportedly improved math skills by an average of 14%.Equal opportunity Keith Krueger is the CEO of Consortium for School Networking (CoSN) a nonprofit professional association for education technology leaders.He strongly believes the homework gap is a major issue that needs to be addressed all around the world."Teachers expect that students can do their homework from home, which requires Internet.While many low-income students [in the United States] have a phone, it typically is on a data plan.Imagine trying to write your senior thesis or apply for college on a smartphone using WiFi at a McDonald's," says Kreuger.Innovative solutions like the WiFi school buses are crucial in helping to end this divide, says Kreuger.Kreuger continues: "It makes bus time a new study hall to do homework.And, this is equally true for times when students are transported to sporting or other school activities."Until last year Coachella Valley Unified School District in California used WiFi school buses.The buses were then left overnight in low-income neighborhoods for students to use.Google also recently granted money to a school in South Carolina to equip their buses with WiFi access.Innovations to bridge the homework gap might even help create more equal societies.As Kreuger puts it: "This is today's civil right -- ensuring that all students have access to equal educational opportunity in a digital world."

dust, is called RCW 34 or Gum 19.The brightest areas you can see are where the gas is being heated by young stars.Eventually the gas burst outward like champagne after a bottle is uncorked.Scientists call this champagne flow.This new image of the nebula was captured by the European Space Organization's Very Large Telescope in Chile.RCW 34 is in the constellation Vela in the southern sky.The name means "sails of a ship" in Latin.Hide Caption 38 of 55 Photos: Wonders of the universe The Hubble Space Telescope captured images of Jupiter's three great moons -- Io, Callisto, and Europa -- passing by at once.Hide Caption 39 of 55 Photos: Wonders of the universe A massive galaxy cluster known as SDSS J1038+4849 looks like a smiley face in an image captured by the Hubble Telescope.The two glowing eyes are actually two distant galaxies.And what of the smile and the round face?That's a result of what astronomers call "strong gravitational lensing."That happens because the gravitational pull between the two galaxy clusters is so strong it distorts time and space around them.Hide Caption 40 of 55 Photos: Wonders of the universe Using powerful optics, astronomers have found a planet-like body, J1407b, with rings 200 times the size of Saturn's.This is an artist's depiction of the rings of planet J1407b, which are eclipsing a star.Hide Caption 41 of 55 Photos: Wonders of the universe A patch of stars appears to be missing in this image from the La Silla Observatory in Chile.But the stars are actually still there behind a cloud of gas and dust called Lynds Dark Nebula 483.The cloud is about 700 light years from Earth in the constellation Serpens (The Serpent).Hide Caption 42 of 55 Photos: Wonders of the universe This is the largest Hubble Space Telescope image ever

one of the space agency's most iconic discoveries.The giant columns of cold gas, in a small region of the Eagle Nebula, were popularized by a similar image taken by the Hubble Space Telescope in 1995.Hide Caption 44 of 55 Photos: Wonders of the universe Astronomers using the Hubble Space pieced together this picture that shows a small section of space in the southern-hemisphere constellation Fornax.Within this deep-space image are 10,000 galaxies, going back in time as far as a few hundred million years after the Big Bang.Hide Caption 45 of 55 Photos: Wonders of the universe Planetary nebula Abell 33 appears ring-like in this image, taken using the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope.The blue bubble was created when an aging star shed its outer layers and a star in the foreground happened to align with it to create a "diamond engagement ring" effect.Hide Caption 46 of 55 Photos: Wonders of the universe This long-exposure image from the Hubble Telescope is the deepest-ever picture taken of a cluster of galaxies.The cluster, called Abell 2744, contains several hundred galaxies as they looked 3.5 billion years ago; the more distant galaxies appear as they did more than 12 billion years ago, not long after the Big Bang.Hide Caption 47 of 55 Photos: Wonders of the universe NASA's NuSTAR telescope array generated the first map of radioactivity in the remnants of an exploding star, or supernova.Blue in this image of Cassiopeia A represents radioactive material.Hide Caption 48 of 55 Photos: Wonders of the universe A supernova was spotted on January 21 in Messier 82, one of the nearest big galaxies.This wide view image was taken on January 22.Hide Caption 49 of 55 Photos: Wonders of the universe The M82 supernova, seen here, has been designated SN2014J because it is the 10th supernova detected in 2014.At 11.4 million light years from Earth, it is the closest Type Ia supernova recorded since systematic studies with telescopes began in the 1930s.Hide Caption 50 of 55 Photos: Wonders of the universe Is that a giant hand waving at us?Actually, it's what's left of a star that died and exploded a long time ago.Astronomers nicknamed it the "Hand of God."NASA's Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array, or NuSTAR , took this image in high-energy X-rays, shown in blue.The image was combined with images from another space telescope, the Chandra X-ray Observatory.Hide Caption 51 of 55 Photos: Wonders of the universe The Hubble Space Telescope captured this image of the Southern Pinwheel Galaxy, one of the largest and closest galaxies of its kind.The center of the galaxy is mysterious , researchers say, because it has a double nucleus -- a supermassive black hole that may be ringed by a lopsided disc of stars, giving it the appearance of a dual core.Hide Caption 52 of 55 Photos: Wonders of the universe Hubble scientists say this is the best-ever view of the Tarantula Nebula, which is located in one of our closest galactic neighbors, the Large Magellanic Cloud.Hide Caption 53 of 55 Photos: Wonders of the universe Those spots on our sun appear small, but even a moderate-sized spot is about as big as Earth .They occur when strong

team has determined to be a piece of debris from the spacecraft, possibly shed during the landing.Hide Caption 19 of 56 Photos: Mars rover Curiosity The rover's scoop contains larger soil particles that were too big to filter through a sample-processing sieve.After a full-scoop sample had been vibrated over the sieve, this portion was returned to the scoop for inspection by the rover's mast camera.Hide Caption 20 of 56 Photos: Mars rover Curiosity Curiosity cut a wheel scuff mark into a wind-formed ripple at the "Rocknest" site on October 3, 2012.This gave researchers a better opportunity to examine the particle-size distribution of the material forming the ripple.Hide Caption 21 of 56 Photos: Mars rover Curiosity NASA's Curiosity rover found evidence for what scientists believe was an ancient, flowing stream on Mars at a few sites, including the rock outcrop pictured here.The key evidence for the ancient stream comes from the size and rounded shape of the gravel in and around the bedrock, according to the Jet Propulsion Laboratory/Caltech science team.The rounded shape leads the science team to conclude they were transported by a vigorous flow of water.The grains are too large to have been moved by wind.Hide Caption 22 of 56 Photos: Mars rover Curiosity Curiosity completed its longest drive to date on September 26, 2012.The rover moved about 160 feet east toward the area known as "Glenelg."As of that day the rover had moved about a quarter-mile from its landing site.Hide Caption 23 of 56 Photos: Mars rover Curiosity This image shows the robotic

Japan is building the world's fastest supercomputer:::::This feature is part of Vision Japan , a series about the visionaries who are changing Japan, and the places that inspire this innovation.See more here .(CNN) Japan is building the world's fastest supercomputer, which it hopes will make the country the new global hub for artificial intelligence research.The supercomputer is expected to run at a speed of 130 petaflops, meaning it is able to perform a mind-boggling 130 quadrillion calculations per second (that's 130 million billion).Once complete (the target date is April 2018), the AI Bridging Cloud Infrastructure (ABCI) will be the most powerful supercomputer in the world, surpassing the current champion, China's Sunway TaihuLight, currently operating at 93 petaflops.What makes a computer 'super'?While the ABCI will not have a mouse or screen, it's not vastly different from a personal computer -- just souped-up, a whole lot faster, and much, much bigger."The current supercomputer system is one million times faster than your personal computers," explains Satoshi Sekiguchi, a director general at Japan's National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology.Sekiguchi calculates that it would take 3,000 years for a personal computer to achieve what a supercomputer can do in just one day.In terms of size, Japan's supercomputer will be comparable to a parking lot with space for 30 to 40 cars."The supercomputer that is currently under development would take up about 1,000 square meters of floor space," says Sekiguchi.What will it be used for?The ABCI could help Japanese companies develop and improve driverless cars, robotics and medical diagnostics, explains Sekiguchi."A supercomputer is an extremely important tool for accelerating the advancement in such fields," he says.Its supersonic speed will also help Japan develop advances in artificial intelligence technologies, such as "deep learning."But supercomputers are to thank for smaller everyday inventions too."The initial design of paper diapers was actually done using a supercomputer," explains Sekiguchi."However, mothers continue to use them without knowing that fact."Photos: Supercomputers breaking barriers Sunway-TaihuLight Chinese supercomputer Sunway-TaihuLight is currently the fastest supercomputer in the world, operating at 93 petaflops.That means it's able to perform 93 quadrillion (million billion) calculations per second.China uses the supercomputer for weather forecasting, pharmaceutical research, and industrial design.Hide Caption 1 of 6

Trump's brief Twitter outage prompts cheers, concerns:::::Some cheered and others raised concerns when President Donald Trump's Twitter account, a mouthpiece for the U.S. presidency, mysteriously went dark for a few minutes this week."My Twitter account was taken down for 11 minutes by a rogue employee," Trump wrote from his restored account early Friday morning, making light of the brief Thursday evening outage that vexed many of his millions of followers."I guess the word must finally be getting out-and having an impact."Twitter on Thursday night blamed a customer support worker for deactivating Trump's account on his or her last day on the job.The San Francisco-based social media company has promised a "full internal review" and said it is taking steps to prevent it from happening again.It has declined further explanation, raising questions not only about its own safeguards but on Trump's heavy reliance on a single platform to broadcast his views.While Twitter's customer service employees have the ability to suspend or remove accounts, or delete individual tweets, over violations of service terms, they cannot post on someone else's account.What's less clear is if the company has tougher safeguards for taking action on higher-profile accounts, such as Trump's."It's not surprising that even the brief shutdown of the president's Twitter account has provoked debate," said Jameel Jaffer, executive director of Columbia University's Knight First Amendment Institute, which filed a federal lawsuit last month challenging Trump's practice of blocking Twitter users who criticize him or his policies.Twitter has been Trump's primary means of communicating with the masses since even before he launched his presidential campaign.During the campaign and in the White House, Trump has been open about resisting pleas from family and friends to set aside his mobile device and to act more presidential.Trump says the service allows him to get his message out to his supporters without the filter of the media, but it's also allowed him to circumvent his own staff.Trump's twitter missives frequently catch even senior aides off guard, such as when he ratcheted up the rhetoric on North Korea this summer.Bombarded with questions about the 140-character policy statements or political attacks, White House staffers are often in the dark themselves."The tweets speak for themselves," is a common refrain from staff unable or unwilling to explain the president's comments.Jaffer said Friday that "love it or hate it, the account has become an important source of news and information about the government" and Trump's tweets "often shed light on official decisions and policies and even when they don't, they shed light on the temperament, character, and motives of the person most responsible for them."Trump uses Instagram and Facebook sparingly, usually to amplify items he has already tweeted out.He directly controls the @realdonaldtrump account on Twitter, while aides control the other platforms.Trump has been using that account since 2009; it now counts more than 41 million followers.Twitter has struggled in recent months in how it enforces, and explains, its procedures for managing accounts that violate its policies designed to prevent hate, harassment and other abuse of the platform.That's why when Trump's account went dark Thursday, some observers assumed it was a formal rebuke.His critics celebrated."Dear Twitter employee who shut down Trump's Twitter: You made America feel better for 11 minutes," wrote U.S. Rep. Ted Lieu, a California Democrat who offered to buy the unidentified employee a Pizza Hut pizza.Other critics suggested the lull was too brief, or speculated the disgruntled employee was an antagonist from the public sphere, from special counsel Robert Mueller to the rogue stormtrooper from a recent "Star Wars" movie.Some linked the president's use of Twitter as his official mouthpiece to a real-world debate about the 25th Amendment which allows the vice president to take over if the commander in chief is "unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office."Trump supporters warned of censorship.Just days earlier, the company had shut down the personal account of a close Trump ally, Roger Stone, after a profanity-laced tirade insulting journalists.Stone responded by calling the company the "totalitarian corporate thought police.""My feed was not for the faint-hearted," Stone wrote in an online essay this week."It was pungent, pugnacious and sometimes risque.Not as over the top (as) the hordes on Twitter who have threatened to kill me, my wife, my kids and my dogs but then Twitter doesn't seem to care about banning them."AP Technology Writer Ryan Nakashima in Menlo Park, California, and AP writer Zeke Miller in Washington contributed to this report.
Trump announces semiconductor company's return to US:::::A $100 billion semiconductor company based in Singapore will legally relocate its home address to the United States, President Donald Trump announced Thursday.Broadcom Limited, which manufactures communications chips around the world, said it would relocate its legal address to Delaware once shareholders approve the move, bringing $20 billion in annual revenue back to the U.S.The move will allow Broadcom to avoid a cumbersome federal review process.The Oval Office announcement was tied to the release of congressional Republicans' tax reform proposal, which would drastically reduce corporate rates and makes it easier for companies to deduct foreign taxes.The company credits the GOP plan with making it easier to do business in the U.S. "America is once again the best place to lead a business with a global footprint," Broadcom CEO Hock Tan said.However, Broadcom's move to the U.S. will take place regardless of whether the Republican plan passes, the company said.The company didn't respond to requests to explain its claim that the move would bring $20 billion in annual revenue to the United States.Its most recently reported annual revenue was $13.2 billion worldwide.A year ago, the company entered a $5.5 billion agreement to merge with U.S. network provider Brocade Communications Systems, but that has been delayed while it's scrutinized by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States.The high-level government committee, familiarly known as CFIUS, investigates proposed acquisitions of U.S. companies by foreign buyers on national security and intellectual property grounds.By becoming a U.S.-based company, Broadcom can avoid the CFIUS process.Broadcom's corporate headquarters will remain in San Jose, California."I want to thank you very much for choosing us," said Trump, who based much of his campaign on the promise of bringing jobs back to the U.S. from overseas.The change in legal address won't create directly create new jobs or plants in the U.S., but the company says it will boost its domestic research and engineering spending.Broadcom makes semiconductor chips used for a variety of products, from cable set-top boxes to smartphones and other wireless devices.It's rooted in one of the largest-ever tech industry acquisitions, when Singapore-based Avago Technologies Ltd. bought Broadcom Corp. for $37 billion last year.The deal made Broadcom Ltd. the parent company of both Broadcom Corp. and Avago Technologies.By joining forces, the rival chipmakers hoped to make a bigger dent in the rapidly growing market for wireless devices.Nearly 20 percent of its revenue in the most recent fiscal quarter came from sales to Apple and the contractors that manufacture Apple products, such as the Foxconn Technology Group.About half of its revenue comes from China-based distributors and manufacturers, though the end products are used around the world.The Singapore Economic Development Board has awarded the company with tax breaks for having a major presence there, but the company warned in a recent regulatory filing that one of those benefits terminates in 2021, four years earlier than expected.About 39 percent of Broadcom's employees are in Asia.Broadcom has 7,500 U.S. employees across 24 states, the company said.It has manufacturing facilities in Colorado and Pennsylvania and engineering offices in California and traces its origins to bluechip American companies like Bell Laboratories, Lucent, and Hewlett-Packard."The proposed tax reform package would level the global playing field and allow us to compete worldwide from here in the United States," Tan said in a statement."Our move would domicile our $20 billion annual revenue in the United States.From our base here, each year we will invest $3 billion in research and engineering and $6 billion in manufacturing, resulting in more high-paying tech jobs."O'Brien, an AP technology writer, reported from Boston.
Scientists discover hidden chamber in Egypt's Great Pyramid:::::Scientists say they have found a hidden chamber in Egypt's Great Pyramid of Giza, in what would be the first such discovery in the structure since the 19th century and one likely to spark a new surge of interest in the pharaohs.In an article published in the journal Nature on Thursday, an international team said the 30-meter (yard) void deep within the pyramid is situated above the structure's Grand Gallery, and has a similar cross-section.The purpose of the space is unclear, and it's not yet known whether it was built with a function in mind or if it's merely a gap in the pyramid's architecture.Some experts say such empty spaces have been known for years."This is a premier," said Mehdi Tayoubi, a co-founder of the ScanPyramids project and president of the Heritage Innovation Preservation Institute."It could be composed of one or several structures... maybe it could be another Grand Gallery.It could be a chamber, it could be a lot of things."The scientists made the discovery using cosmic-ray imaging, recording the behavior of subatomic particles called muons that penetrate the rock similar to X-rays, only much deeper.Their paper was peer-reviewed before appearing in Nature, an international, interdisciplinary journal of science, and its results confirmed by other teams of scientists.Chances of the space containing treasure or burial chambers are almost nil, said Aidan Dodson, an Egyptologist at the University of Bristol, but the discovery helps shed light on building techniques."The pyramid's burial chamber and sarcophagus have already been discovered, so this new area was more likely kept empty above the Grand Gallery to reduce the weight of stone pressing down on its ceiling," he said, adding that similar designs have been found in other pyramids.Egypt's former antiquities minister and famed archaeologist Zahi Hawass, who has been testing scanning methods and heads the government's oversight panel for the new techniques, said that the area in question has been known of for years and thus does not constitute a discovery.He has long downplayed the usefulness of scans of ancient sites."The Great Pyramid is full of voids.We have to be careful how results are presented to the public," he said, adding that one problem facing the international team is that it did not have an Egyptologist as a member.He said the chamber was likely empty space builders used to construct the rooms below."In order to construct the Grand Gallery, you had to have a hollow, or a big void in order to access it you cannot build it without such a space," he said."Large voids exist between the stones and may have been left as construction gaps."The pyramid is also known as Khufu's Pyramid for its builder, a 4th Dynasty pharaoh who reigned from 2509 to 2483 B.C.Visitors to the pyramid, on the outskirts of Cairo, can walk, hunched over, up a long tunnel to reach the Grand Gallery.The space announced by the scanning team does not appear to be connected to any known internal passages.Scientists involved in the scanning called the find a "breakthrough" that highlighted the usefulness of modern particle physics in archaeology."It was hidden, I think, since the construction of the pyramid," Tayoubi added.The Great Pyramid, the last surviving wonder of the ancient world, has captivated visitors since it was built as a royal burial chamber some 4,500 years ago.Experts are still divided over how it and other pyramids were constructed, so even relatively minor discoveries generate great interest.Late last year, for example, thermal scanning identified a major anomaly in the Great Pyramid three adjacent stones at its base which registered higher temperatures than others.Speculation that King Tutankhamun's tomb contains additional antechambers stoked interest in recent years, before scans by ground-penetrating radar and other tools came up empty, raising doubts about the claim.The muon scan is accomplished by planting special plates inside and around the pyramid to collect data on the particles, which rain down from the earth's atmosphere.They pass through empty spaces but can be absorbed or deflected by harder surfaces, allowing scientists to study their trajectories and discern what is stone and what is not.Several plates were used to triangulate the void discovered in the Great Pyramid.While the technology can detect large open spaces, it cannot discern what is inside, so it's unclear if the empty space contains any objects.Tayoubi said the team plans now to work with others to come up with hypotheses about the area."The good news is that the void is there, and it's very big," he said.Follow Brian Rohan on Twitter at: www.twitter.com/brianrohan
Drones become crime-fighting tool, but perfection is elusive:::::The armed robbery suspect hiding out in a camper in rural Michigan heard state troopers closing in, so he dashed into a field and crouched among the 6-foot-tall cornstalks.What he didn't know was that police had eyes on him from above.Drones are fast becoming an essential tool for more law enforcement agencies, changing how officers carry out everyday tasks and bringing air surveillance to departments with limited budgets.The remote-controlled flying machines have been deployed to bust up a ring stealing bulldozers and backhoes from construction sites on the East Coast; to patrol beaches for sharks; and to scan neighborhoods for survivors in hurricane zones.But there are obstacles to overcome before drones can change policing like two-way radios did following World War II.The limitations aren't just with their small size and battery life; federal regulations restrict how far they can go; and police face questions about how they plan to use the surveillance technology.The number of police, sheriff, fire and emergency agencies with drones doubled in 2016, with nearly 350 departments having them as of last year, according to a study released this past spring by the Center for the Study of the Drone at Bard College in New York.Almost half were in places with fewer than 50,000 people, the study found."For a lot of small, rural departments, it is a big change," said Arthur Holland Michel, co-director of the center.Drones allow police to do things that they never did even with helicopters, from working with arson investigators to measuring skid marks at car crashes, significantly cutting the time drivers spend waiting for roads to clear.Their greatest appeal for authorities, though, is cost.A drone with an infrared camera can be had for less than $20,000, while a police helicopter can cost well over $1 million."It's very affordable for even small departments like ours to be able to do it; that was the kicker," said Darin Powers, police chief in Streetsboro, a city of 16,000 near Cleveland.What shouldn't be compared are the capabilities of a drone and a helicopter, said Sgt.Matt Rogers, who started a drone program in 2014 with the Michigan State Police.The agency sent up a drone in June during flooding in central Michigan to figure out what areas needed to be evacuated, and the capture of the wanted felon in the cornfield a year ago saved troopers from spending hours blindly searching for the suspect while not knowing whether he had a gun."It gives the investigators a great advantage that they never had before," Rogers said."I think every chief in the U.S. wants one of these things, but it does not replace a manned aircraft."Drones can't hoist someone to safety or transport officers, for example.And with a battery that allows them to fly for only 15 to 45 minutes, they aren't suited for long surveillance operations.Another pressing worry is about privacy.About a third of states require police to get a warrant before using drones in a criminal investigation.Others, including Massachusetts, are weighing whether to do the same.In Los Angeles, police in early October outlined guidelines limiting when it can fly drones in attempt to appease those who fear officers will be spying on residents.The biggest barrier, drone pilots say, is a Federal Aviation Administration rule that prohibits them from losing sight of their drones while flying.That means no chasing a suspect on the run or searching miles upon miles unless they get creative.Authorities flying a drone in eastern Virginia's York County got around the FAA rule by climbing a firetruck ladder so they could still see the machine while searching for suspects who went deep into woods near a shopping area."You've got to think outside the box with these things," said Maj. Ron Montgomery, of the sheriff's office."You're only limited by your imagination."Figuring out how to keep them in the air longer and improving safety systems that will allow drones to fly beyond the operator's view will be one of the next big steps.Jared Hogge, Lockheed Martin Corp.'s project manager for Indago, a 5-pound (2-kilogram) drone that can fit in the back of a patrol car, said many of the ideas for what's next are coming from officers flying the drones."We're at the beginning of learning how and when these systems are going to be used," he said.Associated Press writer Dake Kang in Streetsboro contributed to this report.
APNewsBreak: Gov't won't pursue talking car mandate:::::The Trump administration has quietly set aside plans to require new cars to be able to wirelessly talk to each other, auto industry officials said, jeopardizing one of the most promising technologies for preventing traffic deaths.The Obama administration proposed last December that all new cars and light trucks come equipped with technology known as vehicle-to-vehicle communications, or V2V.It would enable vehicles to transmit their location, speed, direction and other information 10 times per second.That lets cars detect, for example, when another vehicle is about to run a red light or coming around a blind turn in time to prevent a crash.The administration has decided not to pursue a final V2V mandate, said two auto industry officials who have spoken with White House and Transportation Department officials and two others whose organizations have spoken to the administration.The industry officials spoke on condition of anonymity so as not to jeopardize their relations with the administration.The White House declined to comment, but the proposal has been dropped from the White House Office of Management and Budget's list of regulations actively under consideration and instead has been relegated to its long-term agenda.Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao's office forwarded a statement from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration which said the agency is still reviewing more than 460 comments on the proposed mandate before deciding its next step and that no final decision has been made.Industry officials said decisions on the matter are being made at higher levels of the administration.Administration officials indicated their decision was based on several factors, including general wariness of imposing costly mandates on industry, even though most automakers support requiring V2V, industry officials said.President Donald Trump has made reducing government regulations, which he sees as a drain on the economy, a guiding principle of his administration.The Transportation Department estimates the technology has the potential to prevent or reduce the severity of up to 80 percent of collisions that don't involve alcohol or drugs.V2V was also expected to provide an extra layer of safety for self-driving cars since it can detect even vehicles hidden by buildings or beyond the range of the sensors and cameras of autonomous vehicles.And it was expected to ease traffic congestion since vehicles could communicate with traffic signals, turning them green to prevent needless waiting, save fuel and reduce emissions.V2V is one of the "most important tools" for reducing traffic fatalities, but the Trump administration "is locking it in the trunk if they're not going to put out the mandate," said Deborah Hersman, president of the National Safety Council, a congressionally chartered advocacy group."The only way you're going to get it adopted and deployed in a widespread manner is by having a mandate."The Obama administration shares some of the blame because it waited years to propose the mandate, she said.Traffic fatalities have surged over the past two years to 37,461 deaths in 2016, up nearly 5,000 deaths from 2014.It's the largest two-year increase since the early 1960s.Another reason administration officials are allowing the V2V proposal to languish is strong opposition from the cable and tech industries, auto industry officials said.The government set aside the 5.9 GHz spectrum band for transportation technologies in 1999.It went unused while the government and automakers spent over a decade and more than $1 billion developing and testing V2V.Spectrum is finite and in short supply.Cable and tech companies have been seeking permission to use the 5.9 GHz spectrum for additional wireless bandwidth.Automakers say they need the entire 5.9 GHz spectrum for V2V and other safety uses.The Federal Communications Commission has been conducting tests to see if the spectrum can be shared without interfering with the safety signals.The first test results are expected to be released soon.Automakers wanted the mandate partly because it would establish V2V protocols to ensure that Fords could talk to Toyotas which could talk to Volkswagens, and so on.The mandate was also intended to get the technology onto roads faster.It called for half of new vehicles to have V2V within two years after a final rule was issued, and all new vehicles within four years.The more vehicles equipped with V2V, the more collisions that could be avoided.It would still take many years before there were enough vehicles with V2V to reap the technology's full promise.That might be accelerated by after-market devices that would bring V2V to older vehicles.Automakers can put V2V in vehicles without a mandate.General Motors has put the technology in its Cadillac CTS sedans.Toyota has put V2V in vehicles in Japan and Volkswagen plans to put it in cars in Europe starting in 2019.But it will be more difficult for automakers to protect the 5.9 GHz spectrum and deployment will be far slower without a mandate, industry officials said.Some European manufacturers say they want V2V, but it might be better to wait super-fast 5G cellular technology to achieve it instead of currently available technology.But 5G is still being developed.Years of testing would be required after it's ready before it could go into cars."The longer we wait, the more people die," said Kirk Steudle, director of the Michigan Department of Transportation."We need to move forward with it."Follow Joan Lowy on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/APJoanLowy This story has been corrected to reflect that General Motors has put the V2V technology in Cadillac CTS sedans, not CT6 sedans.
Russia investigates whether 141 dead seals starved to death:::::Russian authorities were investigating whether 141 Baikal earless seals starved to death after their carcasses washed up in Siberia on the shores of the world's deepest lake, officials said Friday.The dead seals most of them pregnant females started appearing along Lake Baikal last weekend, the Irkutsk region's government said.The population of the Baikal earless seals, also known as nerpa, is estimated to be around 130,000.The lake in southeastern Russia near the Mongolian border, 2,600 miles (4,185 kilometers) east of Moscow, contains 20 percent of the world's freshwater and is home to 1,500 species of plants and animals that exist nowhere else in the world.Alexei Kalinin, a prosecutor for West Baikal who monitors the environment, told the Interfax news agency that one of the likeliest causes for the deaths could be the scarcity of food because of the growing nerpa population."The dead animals were all hungry.There was no food in their stomachs," Kalinin said.Authorities have ruled out a disease outbreak, and say lab samples haven't shown what could have killed the animals.The population of the nerpas, Baikal's only mammal, shot up after hunting them was outlawed in 2009.A number of scientists and local leaders, however, have called for allowing limited hunting to control the lake's growing seal population.
APNewsBreak: Georgia election server wiped after suit filed:::::A computer server crucial to a lawsuit against Georgia election officials was quietly wiped clean by its custodians just after the suit was filed, The Associated Press has learned.The server's data was destroyed July 7 by technicians at the Center for Elections Systems at Kennesaw State University, which runs the state's election system.The data wipe was revealed in an email sent last week from an assistant state attorney general to plaintiffs in the case that was later obtained by the AP.More emails obtained in a public records request confirmed the wipe.The lawsuit, filed July 3 by a diverse group of election reform advocates, aims to force Georgia to retire its antiquated and heavily criticized election technology.The server in question, which served as a statewide staging location for key election-related data, made national headlines in June after a security expert disclosed a gaping security hole that wasn't fixed six months after he reported it to election authorities.WIPED OUT It's not clear who ordered the server's data irretrievably erased.The Kennesaw elections center answers to Georgia's secretary of state, Brian Kemp, a Republican running for governor in 2018 and the suit's main defendant.His spokeswoman issued a statement Thursday saying his office had neither involvement nor advanced warning of the decision.It blamed "the undeniable ineptitude" at the Kennesaw State elections center.After declining comment for more than 24 hours, Kennesaw State's media office issued a statement late Thursday attributing the server wiping to "standard operating procedure."It did not respond to the AP's question on who ordered the action.Plaintiffs in the lawsuit, mostly Georgia voters, want to scrap the state's 15-year-old vote-management system particularly its 27,000 AccuVote touchscreen voting machines, hackable devices that don't use paper ballots or keep hardcopy proof of voter intent.The plaintiffs were counting on an independent security review of the Kennesaw server, which held elections staging data for counties, to demonstrate the system's unreliability.Wiping the server "forestalls any forensic investigation at all," said Richard DeMillo, a Georgia Tech computer scientist following the case."People who have nothing to hide don't behave this way."STATE SECURITY The server data could have revealed whether Georgia's most recent elections were compromised by hackers.The plaintiffs contend results of both last November's election and a special June 20 congressional runoff won by Kemp's predecessor, Karen Handel cannot be trusted.Possible Russian interference in U.S. politics, including attempts to penetrate voting systems, has been an acute national preoccupation since the Obama administration sounded the alarm more than a year ago.Kemp and his GOP allies insist Georgia's elections system is secure.But Marilyn Marks, executive director of the Coalition for Good Governance, a plaintiff, believes server data was erased precisely because the system isn't secure."I don't think you could find a voting systems expert who would think the deletion of the server data was anything less than insidious and highly suspicious," she said.NOW YOU SEE IT, NOW YOU DON'T It could still be possible to recover relevant information from the server.The FBI is known to have made an exact data image of the server in March when it investigated the security hole.The Oct. 18 email disclosing the server wipe said the state attorney general's office was "reaching out to the FBI to determine whether they still have the image" and also disclosed that two backup servers were wiped clean Aug. 9, just as the lawsuit moved to federal court.On Wednesday, the attorney general's office notified the court of its intent to subpoena the FBI seeking the image.Atlanta FBI spokesman Stephen Emmett would not say if that image still exists.Nor would he say whether agents examined it to determine whether the server's files might have been altered by unauthorized users.FAILING TO SERVICE THE SERVER A 180-page collection of Kennesaw State emails, obtained Friday by the Coalition for Good Governments via an open records search, details the destruction of the data on all three servers and a partial and ultimately ineffective effort by Kennesaw State systems engineers to fix the main server's security hole.As a result of the failed effort, sensitive data on Georgia's 6.7 million voters including Social Security numbers, party affiliation and birthdates as well as passwords used by county officials to access elections management files remained exposed for months.The problem was first discovered by Atlanta security researcher Logan Lamb while doing online research in August 2016.He informed the election center's director at the time, noting in an email "there is a strong possibility your site is already compromised."Based on his review of the emails, Lamb believes that electronic polling books could have been altered in Georgia's biggest counties to add or drop voters or to scramble their data.Malicious hackers could have altered the templates of voting machine memory cards to skew results.An attacker could even have potentially modified "ballot-building" files to corrupt the outcome, said Lamb, who works at Atlanta-based security firm Bastille Networks.THE BIGGER PICTURE Though striking, the wayward election server is seen as just part of a much larger problem.The Department of Homeland Security says 21 states had elections systems scanned or penetrated by Russia-backed hackers last year, though there's no evidence they altered voting outcomes.But computer security experts say it's possible Russians or other malicious actors have sown undetected booby traps in the highly decentralized U.S. voting landscape.In June, a leaked National Security Agency memo showed that 122 elections officials in various states were targeted with phishing emails crafted by Russian agents intent on stealing their passwords.CALL TO INVESTIGATE Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr was urged Thursday to investigate.GOP state Rep. Scot Turner: "They should go and look at who did it and why they did it and see ... whether there was criminal intent."Carr's office declined comment.Georgia U.S. Rep Hank Johnson, a Democrat, separately said the server wipe "appears to be a willful and premeditated destruction of evidence" by election officials, adding, "Georgia voters should be as outraged as I am."Sara Henderson, executive director of Common Cause Georgia, noted Kemp has repeatedly denied involvement in the university's decisions on voting machine security."Georgia is not creating a climate of voting integrity for our citizens by continuing to blame shift," Henderson said via email.Frank Bajak on Twitter: http://twitter.com/fbajak
GameStop is starting Blockbuster-like service for used game rentals:::::GameStop will offer a new subscription service for customers just in time for the holidays.Called PowerPass, it will allow subscribers to rent an unlimited amount of used games from GameStop stores over six months, Joey Mooring, GameStop's director of corporate communications, told ABC News.It will be available starting Nov. 19 and can be purchased as a gift.The cost is $60.Guests can choose from any preowned video game in our catalog, from the throwback classics to the latest hits, Mooring said.Bloomberg via Getty Images The subscription includes the choice of one free used game to keep at the end of the period.PowerPass requires customers to pick up game rentals in a physical store, which is reminiscent of how the once popular Blockbuster's movie rentals worked."If a game is not available in that store, we have a web in-store system that allows customers to select the game and then it is shipped to that store for them to pick up," Mooring explained.Bloomberg via Getty Images Subscribers must be registered members of GameStop's PowerUp Rewards program, which has a free tier of membership available.PowerPass will not be a renewable option for members, however.But that could change."Anything is possible," Mooring said.
iPhone X sells out within minutes overnight:::::If you're just waking up, you're too late: iPhone X preorders sold out within minutes overnight.Today marked the kick-off for iPhone X preorders, Apples much anticipated 10th-anniversary edition of its iPhone.Preorders opened at 12:01 a.m. Pacific Time and 3:01 a.m.ET for those Apple devotees who wanted to be some of the first to get their hands on the phone that Apple's CEO Tim Cook called the biggest leap forward since the original iPhone at its Sept. 12 launch event.While the iPhone X was gone online in minutes, the phone will be available in stores next Friday, Nov. 3.Heres what you need to know about the iPhone X: Apple has confirmed that stores will have the new phone in stock on Nov. 3 and the company is encouraging customers to arrive early."Stores will have iPhone X available for walk-in customers," Apple wrote.Stores open at 8 a.m.Quantities of the phone available are unconfirmed.Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Pricing The iPhone X is the most expensive phone on the market, starting at $999 for the 64-gigabit version.The 256 GB phone starts at $1,149.Apples iPhone upgrade program offers monthly billing options: $49.91 a month for the 64 GB and $56.16 a month for 256 GB, including AppleCare insurance.Cellphone carriers have similar offers.Apple/Polaris Key selling features Edge-to-edge OLED screen OLED display means that the screen has crisper colors, brighter hues and blacker blacks.This phone has the highest pixel density for an iPhone yet.Face ID Facial recognition technology is used to unlock the phone.Users simply have to look at the phone to unlock it.Apple says the camera sensors will adapt to your physical changes over time.True-depth camera The iPhone Xs true-depth camera allows users to take selfies with portrait mode and comes with a portrait lighting feature.Frederic J. Brown/AFP/Getty Images Tech analyst predictions [The iPhone X is] what all phones will be in the future.Im stopping short of calling it game-changing, said Patrick Moorhead, a tech industry analyst at Moors Insights Strategy.He said that the Samsung Galaxy 8 is a better phone but that from a consumer point of view, the iPhone X provides one of the best experiences, I would say the best experience.It has the highest speed LTE, but unfortunately, it doesnt support gigabit LTE that premium Android phones have.Gigabit LTE is the fastest cellphone service available.He sees one of the top-selling features of the phone as the size.It has the display size of the Plus but the pocket size of a regular iPhone, he explained.As for the design of the phone, Moorhead sees it as what all phones will be in the future.Before the phone went on sale, Moorhead had predicted that the iPhone X will sell out so fast that its not even funny and that people are hesitant to buy the iPhone 8 because of the X edition.Josh Edelson/AFP/Getty Images The iPhone X is an extremely sought-after product.Tech industry analyst Daniel Ives, the head of technology research at GBH Insights in New York, agreed, referring to the iPhone 8 as a placeholder for the iPhone X. I think presales going on Friday and this weekend could approach 40 million units, said Ives.To actually get your hands on an iPhone between now and the holiday season is going to be an impressive feat.The iPhone X is an extremely sought-after product.Unlike Moorhead, Ives sees the iPhone X as an industry game changer.From a product functionality standpoint, it is pure optic technology, Ives said.GBH Insights analysis showed that an estimated 350 million iPhone users are up for an upgrade or will be eligible within the next year, and Ives thinks that most of these users will want to spring for the X.The real success of [the iPhone X] is going to be during 2018, Ives predicted, but he questioned whether the sticker shock will be a deterrent for buyers.According to surveys by GBH Insights, fewer than 20 percent of surveyed users saw the price as a deterrent.
Russia hackers pursued Putin foes, not just US Democrats:::::It wasn't just Hillary Clinton's emails they went after.The hackers who disrupted the U.S. presidential election last year had ambitions that stretched across the globe, targeting the emails of Ukrainian officers, Russian opposition figures, U.S. defense contractors and thousands of others of interest to the Kremlin, according to a previously unpublished digital hit list obtained by The Associated Press.The list provides the most detailed forensic evidence yet of the close alignment between the hackers and the Russian government, exposing an operation that went back years and tried to break into the inboxes of 4,700 Gmail users from the pope's representative in Kiev to the punk band Pussy Riot in Moscow.The targets were spread among 116 countries."It's a wish list of who you'd want to target to further Russian interests," said Keir Giles, director of the Conflict Studies Research Center in Cambridge, England, and one of five outside experts who reviewed the AP's findings.He said the data was "a master list of individuals whom Russia would like to spy on, embarrass, discredit or silence."The AP findings draw on a database of 19,000 malicious links collected by cybersecurity firm Secureworks, dozens of rogue emails, and interviews with more than 100 hacking targets.Secureworks stumbled upon the data after a hacking group known as Fancy Bear accidentally exposed part of its phishing operation to the internet.The list revealed a direct line between the hackers and the leaks that rocked the presidential contest in its final stages, most notably the private emails of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta.The issue of who hacked the Democrats is back in the national spotlight following the revelation Monday that a Donald Trump campaign official, George Papadopoulos, was briefed early last year that the Russians had "dirt" on Clinton, including "thousands of emails."Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov called the notion that Russia interfered "unfounded."But the list examined by AP provides powerful evidence that the Kremlin did just that."This is the Kremlin and the general staff," said Andras Racz, a specialist in Russian security policy at Pazmany Peter Catholic University in Hungary, as he examined the data."I have no doubts."THE NEW EVIDENCE Secureworks' list covers the period between March 2015 and May 2016.Most of the identified targets were in the United States, Ukraine, Russia, Georgia and Syria.In the United States, which was Russia's Cold War rival, Fancy Bear tried to pry open at least 573 inboxes belonging to those in the top echelons of the country's diplomatic and security services: then-Secretary of State John Kerry, former Secretary of State Colin Powell, then-NATO Supreme Commander, U.S. Air Force Gen. Philip Breedlove, and one of his predecessors, U.S. Army Gen. Wesley Clark.The list skewed toward workers for defense contractors such as Boeing, Raytheon and Lockheed Martin or senior intelligence figures, prominent Russia watchers and especially Democrats.More than 130 party workers, campaign staffers and supporters of the party were targeted, including Podesta and other members of Clinton's inner circle.The AP also found a handful of Republican targets.Podesta, Powell, Breedlove and more than a dozen Democratic targets besides Podesta would soon find their private correspondence dumped to the web.The AP has determined that all had been targeted by Fancy Bear, most of them three to seven months before the leaks."They got two years of email," Powell recently told AP.He said that while he couldn't know for sure who was responsible, "I always suspected some Russian connection."In Ukraine, which is fighting a grinding war against Russia-backed separatists, Fancy Bear attempted to break into at least 545 accounts, including those of President Petro Poroshenko and his son Alexei, half a dozen current and former ministers such as Interior Minister Arsen Avakov and as many as two dozen current and former lawmakers.The list includes Serhiy Leshchenko, an opposition parliamentarian who helped uncover the off-the-books payments allegedly made to Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort whose indictment was unsealed Monday in Washington.In Russia, Fancy Bear focused on government opponents and dozens of journalists.Among the targets were oil tycoon-turned-Kremlin foe Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who spent a decade in prison and now lives in exile, and Pussy Riot's Maria Alekhina.Along with them were 100 more civil society figures, including anti-corruption campaigner Alexei Navalny and his lieutenants."Everything on this list fits," said Vasily Gatov, a Russian media analyst who was himself among the targets.He said Russian authorities would have been particularly interested in Navalny, one of the few opposition leaders with a national following.Many of the targets have little in common except that they would have been crossing the Kremlin's radar: an environmental activist in the remote Russian port city of Murmansk; a small political magazine in Armenia; the Vatican's representative in Kiev; an adult education organization in Kazakhstan."It's simply hard to see how any other country would be particularly interested in their activities," said Michael Kofman, an expert on Russian military affairs at the Woodrow Wilson International Center in Washington.He was also on the list."If you're not Russia," he said, "hacking these people is a colossal waste of time."WORKING 9 TO 6 MOSCOW TIME Allegations that Fancy Bear works for Russia aren't new.But raw data has been hard to come by.Researchers have been documenting the group's activities for more than a decade and many have accused it of being an extension of Russia's intelligence services.The "Fancy Bear" nickname is a none-too-subtle reference to Russia's national symbol.In the wake of the 2016 election, U.S. intelligence agencies publicly endorsed the consensus view, saying what American spooks had long alleged privately: Fancy Bear is a creature of the Kremlin.But the U.S. intelligence community provided little proof, and even media-friendly cybersecurity companies typically publish only summaries of their data.That makes the Secureworks' database a key piece of public evidence all the more remarkable because it's the result of a careless mistake.Secureworks effectively stumbled across it when a researcher began working backward from a server tied to one of Fancy Bear's signature pieces of malicious software.He found a hyperactive Bitly account that Fancy Bear (which Secureworks calls "Iron Twilight") was using to sneak thousands of malicious links past Google's spam filter.Because Fancy Bear forgot to set the account to private, Secureworks spent the next few months hovering over the group's shoulder, quietly copying down the details of the thousands of emails it was targeting.The AP obtained the data recently, boiling it down to 4,700 individual email addresses, and then connecting roughly half to account holders.The AP validated the list by running it against a sample of phishing emails obtained from people targeted and comparing it to similar rosters gathered independently by other cybersecurity companies, such as Tokyo-based Trend Micro and the Slovakian firm ESET .The Secureworks data allowed reporters to determine that more than 95 percent of the malicious links were generated during Moscow office hours between 9 a.m. and 6 p.m. Monday to Friday.The AP's findings also track with a report that first brought Fancy Bear to the attention of American voters.In 2016, a cybersecurity company known as CrowdStrike said the Democratic National Committee had been compromised by Russian hackers, including Fancy Bear.Secureworks' roster shows Fancy Bear making aggressive attempts to hack into DNC technical staffers' emails in early April 2016 exactly when CrowdStrike says the hackers broke in.And the raw data enabled the AP to speak directly to the people who were targeted, many of whom pointed the finger at the Kremlin."We have no doubts about who is behind these attacks," said Artem Torchinskiy, a project coordinator with Navalny's Anti-Corruption Fund who was targeted three times in 2015."I am sure these are hackers controlled by Russian secret services."THE MYTH OF THE 400-POUND MAN Even if only a small fraction of the 4,700 Gmail accounts targeted by Fancy Bear were hacked successfully, the data drawn from them could run into terabytes easily rivaling the biggest known leaks in journalistic history.For the hackers to have made sense of that mountain of messages in English, Ukrainian, Russian, Georgian, Arabic and many other languages they would have needed a substantial team of analysts and translators.Merely identifying and sorting the targets took six AP reporters eight weeks of work.The AP's effort offers "a little feel for how much labor went into this," said Thomas Rid, a professor of strategic studies at Johns Hopkins University's School of Advanced International Studies.In response to the AP's investigation, the DNC issued a statement saying the evidence that Russia had interfered in the election was "irrefutable."Rid said the investigation should put to rest any theories like the one then-candidate Donald Trump floated last year that the hacks could be the work of "someone sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds.""The notion that it's just a lone hacker somewhere is utterly absurd," Rid said.Donn reported from Plymouth, Massachusetts.Myers reported from

Homebuilders gloomy, asset managers relieved over tax plan:::::Proposed changes in the GOP tax plan could affect homeowners in more expensive neighborhoods and car buyers interested in electric vehicles.Investors in tech companies could see higher dividends.Future retirees and asset managers are happy about a change that didn't materialize.A look at how the GOP tax plan could impact certain industries: HOMEBUILDING The tax plan contains some unpleasant surprises for those thinking about buying a new home, particularly in high-cost areas.As a result, shares of homebuilders dropped, with luxury homebuilder Toll Brothers leading the decline.The plan would limit the mortgage interest deduction on newly purchased homes to the first $500,000 of the loan, instead of the present $1 million limit.The plan also caps the deduction for property taxes at $10,000.Svenja Gudell, CEO of housing data provided Zillow, said the changes could raise the tax bill for high-income homeowners in high-tax states, such as New York, Florida and California.Jerry Howard, CEO of the National Associated of Home Builders, said any slowdown in the housing market in those states could put other markets at risk.Toll Brothers dropped 5.2 percent, while Lennar and Hovnanian fell more than 2 percent.Other homebuilders saw smaller declines.Up until Thursday, most homebuilders have posted impressive gains so far this year.The proposed changes also hit shares of home improvement retailers.Lowe's fell 3.2 percent and Home Depot slipped $2.84, or 1.7 percent, to $162.54.ELECTRIC VEHICLES Car buyers might be less charged up about electric vehicles.The plan eliminates a $7,500 federal tax credit for buyers of electrics after the current tax year.Industry analysts and environmental groups quickly predicted a plunge in EV sales.Even with the credit, electric vehicles are less than 1 percent of U.S. auto sales, and that's likely to decline further."If you eliminate the tax credit, it's going to be a big whack to electric vehicle sales," said Gartner analyst Michael Ramsey.Eventually the cost of batteries will come down so much that EV sales will rise without tax credits, said Xavier Mosquet, a senior partner at Boston Consulting Group.He predicts that EVs will be comparable in total ownership costs to gas-powered vehicles between 2025 and 2030.Electric cars require no fuel and less maintenance than gasoline cars.And it's not for certain yet that the credit is gone.General Motors said in a statement that it will work with Congress to keep the incentive.Shares of electric car maker Tesla Inc., which on Wednesday reported its worst quarterly loss ever, plummeted 8 percent.TECH COMPANIES A provision that permits multinational corporations to repatriate foreign profits they've stockpiled overseas at a one-time 12 percent rate could be beneficial to technology companies and their shareholders.Scott Kessler, an analyst with CFRA Research, said a lot of tech companies such as Apple, Oracle, Microsoft and Cisco were hoping to bring back their overseas profits "at a far reduced rate from current 35 percent.""For a lot of these companies you are talking about tens of billions, or in the case of apple, hundreds of billions of dollars," Kessler said.If the plan goes through, and lawmakers don't put constraints on how the companies can spend the money requiring them to invest in the U.S., say, or create jobs here Kessler expects that a "substantial amount" is going to be allocated to stock buybacks, dividends and the like.ASSET MANAGERS Future retirees as well as asset managers exhaled after House Republicans decided to leave the 401(k) retirement account alone.Congress had been considering changes that investors feared would cause workers to sock away less in retirement savings each year.Such a change would mean smaller flows into the mutual funds and exchange-traded funds run by T. Rowe Price, BlackRock and other asset managers, reducing the fees they could earn.Currently, workers under age 50 can contribute up to $18,000 in a 401(k) account annually on a tax-deferred basis.Older workers can delay taxes on even more, with a pretax contribution limit of $24,000.Congress had reportedly been considering curtailing the annual pretax limit to as low as $2,400.The average worker funneled $5,850 of their paychecks into a 401(k) over the 12 months through June, according to Fidelity.At plans for which Vanguard keeps records, 10 percent of participants contributed the maximum last year.After House Republicans said they wouldn't touch 401(k) accounts, stocks of asset managers climbed.T. Rowe Price gained 1.7 percent, and Franklin Resources climbed 1.2 percent, for example, while BlackRock rose 1 percent.

Inside story: How Russians hacked the Democrats' emails:::::Nineteen thousand lines of raw data associated with the theft of Hillary Clinton campaign emails shows how the hackers dodged strict security measures to pull it off.Minute-by-minute logs gathered by cybersecurity company Secureworks and recently shared with The Associated Press tell the tale.It took the hackers just over a week of work to zero in on and penetrate the personal Gmail account of campaign chairman John Podesta.One outside expert who reviewed the data said it showed how even the well-defended Clinton campaign fell prey to phishing, a basic cyberespionage technique which uses bogus emails to harvest passwords
Nations move ahead on curbing climate change, despite Trump:::::Diplomats from around the world are converging in Germany next week to thrash out how to implement the Paris climate agreement, despite uncertainty over the role the United States will play in those efforts.While U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened to pull out of the accord fighting global warming, other countries have pledged to press on at the Nov. 6-17 meeting in the western German city of Bonn.Negotiators will try to agree on ways to measure each country's greenhouse gas emissions and make sure everyone is playing by the same rules.Experts say a key issue will be the transparency of nations' emissions reports.Environmentalists, meanwhile, are planning to protest host Germany's continued use of coal-fired power plants.
AI image recognition fooled by single pixel change:::::Image copyright Anish Athalye Image caption This turtle can sometimes look like a rifle to some image recognition systems Computers can be fooled into thinking a picture of a taxi is a dog just by changing one pixel, suggests research.The limitations emerged from Japanese work on ways to fool widely used AI-based image recognition systems.Many other scientists are now creating "adversarial" example images to expose the fragility of certain types of recognition software.There is no quick and easy way to fix image recognition systems to stop them being fooled in this way, warn experts.Bomber or bulldog?In their research, Su Jiawei and colleagues at Kyushu University made tiny changes to lots of pictures that were then analysed by widely used AI-based image recognition systems.All the systems they tested were based around a type of AI known as deep neural networks.Typically these systems learn by being trained with lots of different examples to give them a sense of how objects, like dogs and taxis, differ.The researchers found that changing one pixel in about 74% of the test images made the neural nets wrongly label what they saw.Some errors were near misses, such as a cat being mistaken for a dog, but others, including labelling a stealth bomber a dog, were far wider of the mark.The Japanese researchers developed a variety of pixel-based attacks that caught out all the state-of-the-art image recognition systems they tested."As far as we know, there is no data-set or network that is much more robust than others," said Mr Jiawei, from Kyushu, who led the research.Image copyright Science Photo Library Image caption Neural networks work by making links between massive numbers of nodes Deep issues Many other research groups around the world were now developing "adversarial examples" that expose the weaknesses of these systems, said Anish Athalye from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) who is also looking into the problem.One example made by Mr Athalye and his colleagues is a 3D printed turtle that one image classification system insists on labelling a rifle."More and more real-world systems are starting to incorporate neural networks, and it's a big concern that these systems may be possible to subvert or attack using adversarial examples," he told the BBC.While there had been no examples of malicious attacks in real life, he said, the fact that these supposedly smart systems can be fooled so easily was worrying.Web giants including Facebook, Amazon and Google are all known to be investigating ways to resist adversarial exploitation."It's not some weird 'corner case' either," he said."We've shown in our work that you can have a single object that consistently fools a network over viewpoints, even in the physical world.Image caption Image recognition systems have been used to classify scenes of natural beauty "The machine learning community doesn't fully understand what's going on with adversarial examples or why they exist," he added.Mr Jiawei speculated that adversarial examples exploit a problem with the way neural networks form as they learn.A learning system based on a neural network typically involves making connections between huge numbers of nodes - like nerve cells in a brain.Analysis involves the network making lots of decisions about what it sees.Each decision should lead the network closer to the right answer.However, he said, adversarial images sat on "boundaries" between these decisions which meant it did not take much to force the network to make the wrong choice."Adversaries can make them go to the other side of a boundary by adding small perturbation and eventually be misclassified," he said.Fixing deep neural networks so they were no longer vulnerable to these issues could be tricky, said Mr Athalye."This is an open problem," he said."There have been many proposed techniques, and almost all of them are broken."One promising approach was to use the adversarial examples during training, said Mr Athalye, so the networks are taught to recognise them.But, he said, even this does not solve all the issues exposed by this research."There is certainly something strange and interesting going on here, we just don't know exactly what it is yet," he said.
Security flaw forces Estonia ID 'lockdown':::::Image copyright Getty Images Estonia is to block thousands of citizens from accessing online government services from Saturday while it works to fix a security flaw.A problem with the country's national identity cards was identified earlier this year, affecting 760,000 people.The flaw could let attackers decrypt private data or impersonate citizens.Those who have not had their cards updated with new security certificates will no longer be able to use them to access some services from midnight.Estonia's digital ID system lets citizens access government and some private services such as medical records, voting and banking.But security researchers found the encryption used in the ID cards was easily cracked which could, if exploited, let attackers impersonate people."As far as we currently know, there has been no instances of e-identity theft, but the threat assessment of the Police and Border Guard Board and the Information System Authority indicates that this threat has become real," said the country's Prime Minister Juri Ratas.From midnight, only cards that have been updated will continue to work online.Some citizens had complained that updating their ID card had taken a long time, with the online service often overloaded."Spent hours over two days trying to update my ID card as per govt/MFA instructions.Still trying..." said Theresa Bubbear, Britain's ambassador to Estonia, on Thursday.This weekend, only "people who use their digital ID cards to provide vital services", such as medical professionals, will be able to update their digital ID online.From Monday, the system will be opened back up to everybody.All cards must be updated by March 2018."The functioning of an e-state is based on trust and the state cannot afford identity theft happening to the owner of an Estonian ID card," said Mr Ratas.
Australia cockatoos chew billion-dollar broadband:::::Image caption Cockatoos usually go for fruit, wood or tree barks - not cables Australia's multimillion dollar broadband network is under attack - from cockatoos.The National Broadband Network (NBN) company said it has spent tens of thousands of dollars so far fixing cables chewed by the birds.Australian broadband is already criticised for being slow.According to a recent report it ranks 50th in the world for internet speed.NBN estimates the bill will rise sharply as more damage is uncovered.In an attempt to improve Australia's internet speed - currently lagging behind many developed countries at 11.1 megabits per second - a national telecommunications infrastructure project has been instigated and is due for completion in 2021.But engineers returning to sites have found spare cables chewed and frayed.The culprits are cockatoos, a type of parrot which normally eats fruit, nuts, wood and bark.NBN has had to replace power and fibre cables at a cost of tens of thousands of dollars each time.So far, they say, they have spent A$80,000 ($61,500, 47,000).Eating cables "would have to be an acquired taste," animal behaviourist Gisela Kaplan told Reuters."It's not their usual style."She suggested the colour or the position of the cables could have attracted the birds.Image copyright NBN Image caption Cables have been damaged to the point of not being reparable "They are constantly sharpening their beaks and as a result will attack and tear apart anything they come across."Unfortunately, they've developed a liking to our cables."These birds are unstoppable when in a swarm," co-project manager Chedryian Bresland said in an article on the company's website on Friday."I guess that's Australia for you; if the spiders and snakes don't get you, the cockies will."The company says it is currently installing protective casing which costs just A$14 each, that will protect the wires from birds in future and save their three billion dollar network.
The gamers hoping to win the Overwatch World Cup:::::ChrisTfer.Smex.Kruise.MikeyA.Realzx.Boombox.Remember the names because these are the six gamers hoping to win the 2017 Overwatch World Cup for Team UK this weekend."I think we can definitely make it to the finals," says coach Elliot Hayes."Sweden first, should be a tough game but they're beatable."They go into the video game tournament in California with a confident swagger, having won all 15 of their group stage matches."I don't think people thought we'd do good at the qualifying," says Mikey B, who's hero is called Tracer."We showed that we are actually a good team."Overwatch is one of the most popular video games in the world.Released in 2016, the game has more than 35 millon players.The World Cup is serious business.Team UK has spent several hours a day practising.Coach Elliot reviews the footage and coordinates team strategies."I'm helping individually with the players," he says."If I think there's something better they could be doing, then I'll suggest it."Similar to a football coach, I'm basically just trying to help the players improve."And improve they have.They go into the tournament as some people's dark horse."The UK have a really good line-up this year," says YouTuber Hammeh."Some of the players have been playing high level Overwatch for a couple of years."But whoever gets to the final, they'll likely have to face the feared South Korea team who won last year's title."Everyone has their eyes on South Korea and that is the main target," says Mikey."We're not overlooking Sweden or Canada but we're confident we can beat them."Developed by Activision Blizzard, Overwatch is a team-based first person shooter.Each side has six players fighting to complete objectives and defeat the opposition.There are 25 different heroes, all with their own back story and unique style of play.Its new e-sport league will start in January with teams based in different major cities.Some have estimated that it could eventually become more profitable than the Premier League."The biggest reason why it's become so popular is because it's really easy to just jump in, have fun with your friends and understand," says former professional competitor and streamer QueenE.But for now it's the World Cup that Overwatch fans and players alike are concentrating on."I'm really proud to represent the UK.As soon as they announced the World Cup, I knew I really wanted to be there," says Mikey."We're gonna take it very seriously.We really want to win this thing.Not just for us but for the UK."
Apple shares hit record as iPhone X launches:::::Image copyright Getty Images Apple shares have risen to a record high as the tech giant's iPhone X hit shelves around the world.The launch coincided with strong results for Apple, with sales increasing by 12% to $52.6bn (40bn) for the three months to September.The tenth anniversary iPhone, which retails for 999, is Apple's most expensive handset yet.Analysts said Apple was now closer to becoming the first trillion dollar company, as shares rose 2%.The California-based firm, which also sells computers, iPads and makes revenue from apps, is now valued at nearly $900bn (690bn).With iPhone 8 and X handsets now on sale, Mr Cook predicted Apple's "biggest quarter ever" in the three months to the end of the year.Shoppers queued up at Apple stores in dozens of countries, as the high-end iPhone X launched on Friday.The iPhone X abandons the signature "home" button and can be unlocked with face-scanning technology, among other new features."A trillion-dollar market cap may now be in Cook's sights in light of these results and guidance around iPhone X," said Daniel Ives, an analyst at GBH Insights.Image copyright AFP Image caption Apple fans queued up overnight to buy the new iPhone X on Friday Mr Cook said the company was "firing on all cylinders", thanks to a sales rebound in China, record purchases through the App Store and robust demand for its latest iPhone models.It sold more than 46.6 million phones in the July to September period, up 3% year-on-year.That produced $28.8bn, or more than half of its revenue.Other products, including the Mac, iPad and Apple Watch, also did well, growing in the double digits.The firm got another boost from its services division, which includes the App store, Apple Pay and its music subscriptions service.That unit made $8.5bn in the quarter, up 34% year-on-year, thanks in part to a one-time adjustment.Though its costs increased, Apple said profits were $10.7bn in the quarter, increasing 18%.Augmented reality future?Apple said it expects to make between $84bn and $87bn in revenue in the upcoming quarter - a record for the company.Mr Cook said the iPhone X positioned Apple ahead of the curve when it comes to new augmented reality or AR technologies.He said the technologies were poised to "change everything".For example, he said, shoppers will be able to see how furniture looks in their living rooms before making a purchase."I view AR as profound, not today... but what it will be, what it can be," he said."I think it's profound and I think Apple is in a really unique position to lead in this area."

Why Call of Duty WW2 bosses won't 'shy away' from history:::::Bosses of the new Call of Duty game say they "touch on some really dark subject matter" in the new release.The makers say creating a title based on a conflict that claimed about 60 million lives has been a challenge.It's been 10 years since the Call of Duty franchise based a game during World War Two."In no way do you want to glorify violence, but at the same time you can't ignore it," says Sledgehammer Games co-founder Michael Condrey."We spent a lot of time working on the right balance.""When you talk about Nazi Germany and the atrocities committed by Hitler's regime, how do you honour the cause?"How do you respect the loss of life that happened?"The answer, the team decided, was detailed research and a decision not to shy away from what was happening.To do that historian Marty Morgan, who's worked on Band of Brothers, was asked to help advise the team.Newsbeat played a preview of the game at the E3 gaming convention over the summer."It would be insincere not to touch on what was really happening," Michael explains."From the politics at the time, segregation among the allies, the role of women, to the Holocaust."By turning away from them we would not have brought the right level of awareness or be able to honour what was really happening."We saw a chance to tell a story that hadn't been told in video games in almost a decade.It's the most profound and personal subject matter we've ever touched on."It's particularly personal for Glen Schofield, another co-founder of Sledgehammer games, whose grandfather fought in WW2."He had a Purple Heart and Bronze Star," he tells Newsbeat."My father would tell his stories, and my dad died as we were making the game - so we named the main character after him."So for us getting the details right is important.We want people to walk away entertained and learn something at the same time."That's something Michael agrees with."This is more important now than ever," he believes."Having this platform, which is entertainment but also has a chance to tell this story to millions and millions of people, is very rewarding."Find us on Instagram at BBCNewsbeat and follow us on Snapchat, search for bbc_newsbeat
Verso Group data hoarder fined by UK watchdog:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The ICO said that Verso had helped fuel the nuisance call industry A company that specialises in asking the public to take part in "surveys" in which the answers are then used to target respondents with unsolicited marketing calls has been fined.An investigation found Verso Group had not been clear about what it was doing.The Hertfordshire-based company came to regulators' attention after it was involved in one campaign that resulted in 46 million "nuisance calls" about payment protection insurance (PPI).It has been ordered to pay 80,000.The Information Commissioner's Office said it was the first such penalty following a wider investigation into the so-called data broking industry."This type of unlawful data directly fuels the nuisance call and spam text industry and creates misery for millions of UK citizens," said the ICO's deputy commissioner, James Dipple-Johnstone."Businesses need to understand they don't own personal data - people do."Although the ICO has the power to issue fines of up to 500,000, the sum is still likely to be significant to Verso.According to accounts filed in May, the Hertfordshire-based company's net assets totalled just 12,386.A spokesman for Verso declined to comment.Personal details Verso has been in business since 2011 and describes itself as the "largest lead-generation business in the UK by some distance".According to its website, it uses call centres in India, the Philippines and North America to carry out surveys with the public, with the stated aim of helping consumers cut their utility bills.These are branded as being carried out by the UK Savers Club and I Love My Offers among other names.Verso says it carries out more than 115,000 such surveys each month.The business then offers other companies the ability to target consumers via email, phone, postal mail and text, based on the lifestyle, financial and demographic information gathered from respondents.In addition to PPI insurance, Verso says its clients have used the information to sell loans, legal advice about accidents, extended warranties and beauty products.Two of the companies Verso has sold data to - Pro Dial and Emacs - have previously been fined by the ICO over the way they had conducted their cold-call businesses.A follow-up investigation into Verso concluded it was not providing survey respondents with specific enough information about to whom it planned to pass their data, and thus had failed to obtain the necessary consent to sell it on.Moreover, the ICO said it had found Verso to be "unhelpful and obstructive" when it had tried to look into the matter."Verso's contraventions were systemic - they were not isolated, one-off or occasional errors," the report said, "[and] were of a kind likely to cause substantial damage or substantial distress."The watchdog has ordered Verso to pay the fine by mid-November, although it could also try to appeal against the ruling.Citizens' rights over their personal information are set to be strengthened next year under the UK's Data Protection Bill.The law - which implements the EU's General Data Protection Regulation - makes it possible for a person to oblige a company to delete information held about them.It also raises the cap on the size of penalties the ICO can demand.
Art galleries targeted by cyber-thieves:::::Image copyright Getty Images Cyber-criminals appear to be targeting art galleries and dealers with an email scam that has already fooled some organisations.The attackers broke into art dealer email accounts and sent buyers duplicated invoices with the bank account details changed.Several galleries in London and the US that had been affected were identified by the Art Newspaper.Art dealer groups have warned people to be vigilant.The scammers monitored outgoing messages from art gallery email accounts, then intercepted invoices and changed them.The Rosenfeld Porcini gallery in London was one of the organisations that fell victim to the scam after agreeing the sale of an artwork."Around seven or eight hours after we had sent our invoice, the buyers got another email saying that the invoice we had sent out was in the wrong currency and that they should make payment to a different account," Mr Rosenfeld told the Art Newspaper.The gallery is in discussions with the bank to try to recover the money.Two-step verification Another gallery told the newspaper that some dealers had been scammed out of "hundreds of thousands of pounds".The Simon Lee gallery said it now sends cyber-fraud warnings with its invoices and speaks to clients on the telephone to confirm every transaction.Enabling two-factor authentication - also known as two-step verification - on email accounts can also make it harder for criminals to break in.The Society of London Art Dealers has previously warned its members about the dangers of email fraud."We are indeed very concerned about this problem," the Director General Christopher Battiscombe said."As all of us are compelled to do more and more of our business online, it seems to me inevitable that criminals will focus increasingly in this area and we all need to think about the risks involved and whether we are doing enough to protect ourselves against them."The group said it had distributed a cyber-security presentation to its members.
SEC warns famous crypto-currency backers:::::Image copyright Ethan Miller Image caption Public figures such as Floyd Mayweather have backed new crypto-coin projects Celebrities, sports figures and social media stars have been warned by US regulators about endorsing crypto-currencies.Paris Hilton, boxer Floyd Mayweather and others have all publicly backed digital currency funding drives.The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said the endorsements could break laws on selling securities.Those promoting crypto-currencies must say if they are being paid for the endorsement, it said.Cash caution In its official warning, the SEC pointed to the growing numbers of public figures who have talked about the funding drives, known as Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs), that crypto-currencies run to raise cash.About 270 separate crypto-cash start-ups have sought funds via ICOs in 2017, said the New York Times.In total, the ICOs have raised more than $3bn (2.27bn), it said.The SEC said any virtual coins or tokens bought by investors through an ICO were subject to the same laws governing the sale of stocks and shares sold via mainstream stock markets.These laws require anyone backing a security to disclose their relationship with the company offering the investment opportunity."A failure to disclose this information is a violation of the anti-touting provisions of the federal securities laws," it said, adding that keeping quiet about any financial arrangement could be considered fraudulent.It said it was keeping an eye on people who promote the crypto-currencies to ensure laws were not broken.In a separate but related bulletin, the SEC cautioned against following the investment advice of any public figure."It is never a good idea to make an investment decision just because someone famous says a product or service is a good investment," it said.It encouraged investors to do their own research into potential money-making schemes and not rely on paid endorsements, it said.Regulators in Switzerland, Britain and Malaysia have also issued warnings about the risks associated with ICOs.Financial watchdogs in China and South Korea have gone further and banned them altogether.
Freeview blames air pressure for TV disruption:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Freeview says viewers will have to wait until the high pressure passes Freeview has said that high air pressure is the cause of disruption being experienced by some of its users in England and Wales.The service provides access to digital TV channels through aerials, making it possible to watch programmes without a satellite or cable subscription.The Downdetector website indicates the issue began on Tuesday evening.Some viewers have complained they missed The Great British Bake Off final as a consequence.Freeview said it was unable to remedy the problem until weather conditions changed."We recommend that you do not retune your equipment, as reception will return to normal once the weather changes," the platform posted on its website."TV and radio signals can be affected by atmospheric conditions, including high air pressure (which brings fine weather), heavy rain or snow."A spokesman for the service told the BBC that the situation was "uncommon but unpredictable"."It's impossible for us to say [how many people have been affected] but it's clear the disruption has been widespread across England and Wales," he added."The good news is that during the course of the day the issue has lessened as the weather front moves through."Weather forecasts suggest the problem will continue for some into the evening, but a weak weather front is set to move in from the north on Thursday morning that should be more favourable for transmissions.Read more about weather-related interference
Tesla delays Model 3 production in its worst quarter:::::Image copyright Tesla Image caption Production targets for Tesla's Model 3 car have been set back by months Electric carmaker Tesla pushed back targets for its new Model 3 car, admitting it's months behind schedule.Tesla said it would now produce 5,000 of the cars each week by early 2018, instead of December.The new target emerged as Tesla posted its biggest quarterly loss ever, sending its shares down more than 5% in after-hours trading.Tesla made net losses of $619m (468m) in the three months to 30 September, nearly double the previous quarter.A year earlier, the firm made a profit of $21.9m.The losses were bigger than usual because Tesla has been focused on ramping up production of its Model 3 sedan.Image copyright Tesla Image caption Tesla said it won't reach its production target of 5,000 Model 3 cars per week until 2018 The carmaker is hoping to attract mass market interest in the vehicle which is priced at $35,000, about half the cost of its Model S car.Tesla said it had produced just 260 of the Model 3 cars in the third quarter, less than a fifth of the 1,500 vehicles it had planned to build.In a statement the company said it continued "to make significant progress each week in fixing Model 3 bottlenecks"."The nature of manufacturing challenges during a ramp such as this makes it difficult to predict exactly how long it will take for all bottlenecks to be cleared or when new ones will appear", it said.Gigafactory delays Tesla said the main constraint was that progress had slowed at its Gigafactory in Nevada where its battery modules are assembled, and part of the production process has needed to be redesigned.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Tesla boss Elon Musk said he was "really depressed" about the slow progress "I was really depressed about three or four weeks ago," chief executive Elon Musk said, adding that he is now optimistic because it is clear what changes need to be made.But there could be further problems ahead.While quarterly revenues rose about 30% from a year ago to nearly $3bn, Tesla continues to burn through cash.The firm said it expected capital expenditures of $1bn in the fourth quarter, bringing its total investments for the second half of the year to $2bn.And it could face heavy new demands for cash given the delays with the Model 3 and plans for new vehicles.
Bin Laden raid: Son Hamza's wedding video in CIA file release:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Only childhood videos of Hamza bin Laden had been seen before this wedding footage Osama Bin Laden's personal diary, video of his son Hamza's wedding and documentaries about himself were among files found on the al-Qaeda leader's computer, the CIA has revealed.Nearly half a million of the files have been released, the fourth such tranche.Bin Laden's computer was taken during the 2011 US raid in the Pakistani town of Abbottabad in which he died.Some contents are being withheld over security or because they are corrupted or pornographic, the CIA said.CIA director Mike Pompeo said the release included 18,000 documents, 79,000 audio files and images and more than 10,000 videos which shed light on the "plans and workings of this terrorist organisation".What do we learn about Bin Laden's son Hamza?The videos include a clip from the wedding of his son Hamza - thought to be his favourite son.Hamza has been mooted as a future al-Qaeda leader.Analysis of objects shown in the video suggest it was filmed in Iran.Previously only childhood videos of Hamza had been publicly seen.Bin Laden himself is not seen in the video but one of the wedding attendees says that the "father of the groom, the prince of the mujahideen" is joyous at his son's marriage and his joy will "spread to all the mujahideen", AP said.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Osama Bin Laden was killed during a raid by US special forces Other senior al-Qaeda figures can also be seen in the footage, according to analysts from the Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD) who have been studying the newly released files.The militants include Mohammed Islambouli, the brother of the man who killed Egyptian leader Anwar Sadat in 1981, the FDD says.In recent years al-Qaeda has released audio messages from Hamza Bin Laden threatening the US, calling for the Saudi government to be overthrown and encouraging jihadist action in Syria.An image of him as a boy was superimposed onto a picture of the New York World Trade Center on the recent anniversary of the 9/11 attacks.What was in Bin Laden's video collection?The al-Qaeda leader had a series of animated films on his hard drive including Antz, Cars, Chicken Little and The Three Musketeers.There were also several YouTube videos, including a viral clip from the UK called "Charlie bit my finger" and videos about crocheting, including one entitled "How to crochet a flower".The role-playing computer game Final Fantasy VII was also on the computer.Bin Laden also had copies of three documentaries about him, including one called Where in the World is Osama bin Laden, as well as National Geographic documentaries including Kung Fu Killers, Inside the Green Berets and World's Worst Venom, AP reported.The al-Qaeda leader lived in the walled compound with several members of his family.Three other men - one of Bin Laden's sons and two couriers - and a woman were also killed in the raid.What do the other documents show?The 228 pages of Bin Laden's handwritten notes cover an array of topics, including the 2011 Arab uprisings, which Bin Laden did not see coming, the FDD says.The documents also show that Bin Laden was still in charge of al-Qaeda up until his death and was in regular communication with subordinates around the world.He spent time trying to understand US strategy in Afghanistan and Iraq and had parts of the investigative journalist Bob Woodward's book Obama's Wars translated for him.Another document written by a senior militant examines al-Qaeda's relationship with Iran, according to the FDD analysts, saying that despite disagreements their "interests intersect", particularly because they are both "enemies of America".Last year the US state department said Iran had since at least 2009 enabled al-Qaeda to move funds and fighters through the country to South Asia and Syria.The CIA said the released documents also gave an insight into ideological differences between Bin Laden's al-Qaeda and the more recently formed so-called Islamic State (IS) group, as well as disagreements within al-Qaeda itself over tactics.Previous releases of Bin Laden documents:
Bitcoin tops £5,000 in value:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption For the first time ever, Bitcoin has hit 5,000 in value The price of Bitcoin has surpassed 5,000 per coin - a new record.While it is a historic moment of sorts, Bitcoin is usually compared to the dollar.The virtual currency peaked at $6,649.33 (5,015) at about 16:34 GMT on Wednesday, according to Bloomberg.The total value of Bitcoin in circulation is currently $110bn (83bn) and the cryptocurrency has risen more than seven-fold against the dollar over the past year.The reason for the latest jump in value was in part driven by an announcement by US-based derivatives marketplace operator CME Group about a plan to launch a Bitcoin futures product before the end of the year.Bitcoin was launched in January 2009.Its value was lower than $100 in June 2013, and below $1,000 as recently as January.But in August, the virtual currency soared to $3,451 after a spin-off - Bitcoin Cash - failed to prove as disruptive as had been feared.And in September, Bitcoin crossed the $5,000 threshold for the first time."It's been a very innovative year - there have been a lot of new technology platforms for cryptocurrencies, which have lifted Bitcoin," Garrick Hileman a research fellow at University of Cambridge told the BBC."It wouldn't surprise me if the price were to go even higher."Coinbase - a business that lets the public trade and store digital currencies - reports that it is now signing up between 35,000 to 50,000 new users per day.Mr Hileman said that many people had recently been attracted to invest in Bitcoin because when a "fork" happened in August, investors received an equivalent amount of new Bitcoin Cash coins for free.Another "fork", SegWit2x, is due to happen on 18 November."Rising geopolitical tensions on the Korean Peninsula are also driving interest in Bitcoin in the surrounding countries, because people are wary of investing in the yen or the dollar," Mr Hileman added.However, he continued, government regulators may crack down on cryptocurrencies, which could drive prices back down.
Facebook ad revenue tops $10bn:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Chief executive Mark Zuckerberg at Harvard in 2017 Facebook profits soared in the third quarter as it brought in more than $10bn from advertising.The firm said profits were $4.7bn (3.5bn) in the three months to the end of September, up 80% year-on-year.Chief executive Mark Zuckerberg told investors the firm's investments in security would "impact" profitability.US lawmakers are examining the possible use of the platform for Russian propaganda activities during the 2016 US presidential election."We're serious about preventing abuse on our platforms," Mr Zuckerberg said."Protecting our community is more important than maximising our profits."Washington hearings Mr Zuckerberg last year said the idea that fake news on Facebook influenced the election was "pretty crazy".On Wednesday, the firm said almost 150 million people may have seen Russian propaganda efforts.Facebook shared the figure during two days of tense questioning in Washington.Lawmakers, who are eyeing increased regulation of internet companies, pressed for increased disclosure around political ads, as well as information about how the firm polices false content.Mr Zuckerberg did not attend the hearing, but he discussed the matter on a conference call with financial analysts."What [Russia] did is wrong and we are not going to stand for it," he said."People do not want false news or hate speech or bullying... To the extent that we can eradicate that from the platform, we will create a better product."The firm's general counsel told lawmakers the company was focused on protecting the "authenticity" of activity.But he conceded that it would be a tough task.Facebook had 2.07bn monthly active users at the end of September, up 16% year-on-year.Duplicate accounts represent about 10% of those - higher than previous estimates, executives said.It also had more than six million active advertisers, chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg said on a call with investors.Looking forward Those advertisers, many of them small and medium-sized businesses, helped lift total Facebook revenue 47% year-on-year to $10.3bn.That included $10.1bn from ads.The firm said it expected ad prices to increase, driving future growth.But it warned that the pace of expansion had been slowing.The firm also said it expected expenses to increase between 45% and 60% in 2018.Facebook said it was investing in security initiatives, new technology and video.In the Washington hearings, Facebook said 10,000 people were working on the platform's safety and security and it expected that number to double by the end of 2018.Many of those people work for "partners", the firm told analysts.Facebook employed about 23,165 people at the end of September.The firm said it was also tightening it standards for ads, including those focused on charged political issues."We believe that ads are important to free expression... but we will also do our part to elevate the quality of that discourse," Ms Sandberg said, Shares in the firm fell about 1.5% in after-hours trade.

Sony revives Aibo robot dog toy:::::Image copyright Sony Image caption Sony has resurrected the Aibo robot dog and given it new tricks Sony says it is to bring back Aibo, its famous robot pet dog.The new Aibo is the tech giant's first entertainment robot in 12 years, and for now, it will only be sold in Japan.The machine learns from its owners and environment, as well as tapping into collective data stored in the cloud by other robot units.The return of Aibo suggests that Sony has finally got its innovative spirit back, say experts, after several difficult years.The revamped device is designed to move and act more like a real dog, and over time to develop its own distinct personality.The robot incorporates fish-eye cameras, location and mapping software, wi-fi connectivity and "artificial intelligence" to help it understand and adapt to its owners.Aibo will go on sale in January for 198,000 yen ($1,730, 1,300).Users will also need to pay a monthly subscription and use an app-based store to purchase and install additional abilities.Turnaround In 2006, veteran Sony engineer Toshitada Doi threw a mock funeral for Aibo, after the firm axed his pet project for being superfluous, according to the Wall Street Journal.At the time, Mr Doi said that Aibo was a symbol that Sony's "risk-taking spirit was now dead".This was under the tenure of Welsh-born businessman Sir Howard Stringer - Sony's first foreign chief executive - who tried to turn around the electronics business by cutting thousands of jobs and ending unprofitable projects.Image copyright Ben Wood Image caption Prototypes of the Aibo robot dog at the Sony Archive museum in Shinagawa, Tokyo However, Sony continued to lose money until Sir Howard retired in 2013 and handed the controls over to successor Kazuo Hirai.Following Mr Hirai's extensive restructuring programme, the electronics giant finally seems to be back on form.On Wednesday, Sony shares soared to a nine-year high after the firm forecast record annual profits."What Sony is doing is using Aibo to demonstrate its artificial intelligence credentials," commented Nick Maynard, a research analyst at Juniper Research."It's not impossible for it to become a popular device, but I don't think it will be in every household."This product is a statement of intent - it's Sony announcing its return as a creative force."Sony said in May 2016 that it was keen to build up its artificial intelligence business and it has invested in the AI start-up Cogitai.Image copyright Sony Image caption Sony is moving towards augmented reality and projections The firm is also leaning towards innovations such as augmented reality and projections."What's fascinating is that Sony certainly seems to have its innovation mojo back, whether it's the Xperia Touch Android-based projector for smart homes, the e-ink watch or the 3D Creator augmented-reality technology that lets you scan someone's head and make an avatar of them," Ben Wood, a chief analyst at CCS Insight told the BBC."Because Sony's fortunes as a corporation have improved, it's given it the confidence to bet on riskier technologies."Not all of these products are going to succeed, but to keep your innovation edge, that's exactly what you need to be doing."
Simon's Cat game app showed adult bite advert:::::Image copyright Strawdog Publishing Image caption The Simon's Cat game requires players to connect matching coloured treats The UK's advertising watchdog has intervened after an adult advert was shown within a video game app popular with children.The pop-up ad featured a "temporary tattoo" that looked like a deep bite mark, placed on a woman's shoulder.The imagery appeared in the match-puzzle title Simon's Cat Crunch Time in July.Wish.com, the retailer responsible for creating the ad, failed to respond to the complaint.The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) said it was concerned by the San Francisco-based company's lack of response and ordered the business to ensure its adverts were properly targeted in the future.Although the body does not have the power to impose fines itself, it can refer repeat offenders to Trading Standards, which can take further action.The game's publisher has also banned Wish.com from serving ads to its products in the future.'Red and bloody' The Simon's Cat game has a Pegi 3 rating - meaning it has been judged to be suitable for anyone above the age of three - and has been installed more than one million times on Android and iOS devices.As with many titles, adverts are automatically placed within the software by algorithms, which are supposed to screen out adult content.Image copyright Wish Image caption This Wish.com ad was spotted within the game app on 24 July The publisher, Strawdog Studios, told the ASA that it also had the power to remove ads manually.But it added that it relied on customer reports to flag unsuitable content, and had not been alerted to the tattoo image before the watchdog had become involved."We considered the app was likely to have strong appeal to children and therefore children were likely to have seen the ad," said the ASA in its ruling."We noted that it was not clear from the ad that the product shown was a fake tattoo and we considered that the image... which was red and bloody, might cause distress."The authority added that Wish.com was obliged to ensure the ad was not promoted again in an untargeted manner.The company - which describes itself as the world's sixth biggest e-commerce business - sent an automated response to the BBC when asked for comment but has yet to address the problem."The ASA has a growing problem with non-UK online businesses, who will sometimes take the view that a self-regulatory body can be ignored," said Andy Milmore, a partner at the law firm Harbottle & Lewis."This is especially so where the complaints relate to 'inappropriate' marketing, where the ultimate backstop of enforcement action under criminal statute is unlikely to apply."
Hilton Hotels fined for credit card data breaches:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Hilton owns, manages or franchises 4,900 properties across the world The company behind Hilton Hotels is paying a $700,000 (525,000) fine after being accused of mishandling two separate credit card data breaches.The attacks were in 2014 and 2015.More than 363,000 accounts were put at risk, although it remains unclear whether the perpetrators managed to extract any details.US government investigators said the firm had taken too long to warn customers and had lacked adequate security measures.The penalty will be divided between the states of New York and Vermont.Their attorneys general agreed the settlement with the company, which operates properties under the Waldorf Astoria, Conrad Hotels and DoubleTree brands in addition to Hilton.Malware alerts The first of the two cases was discovered in February 2015, when Hilton learned that one of its UK-based systems was communicating with a suspicious computer outside its network.Checks revealed that credit-card targeting malware had infected its cash register computers, potentially exposing customers' card details between 18 November and 5 December 2014.In the second incident, an intrusion detection system alerted Hilton to another problem in July 2015.A subsequent probe revealed that payment card data had again been targeted by malware since April of the same year.Hilton only notified the public about the breaches in November 2015, which was more than nine months after the first discovery and more than three months after the second.By this point, there had already been media reports that several banks suspected card details had been stolen from payment systems used in Hilton gift shops and restaurants.Although the Virginia-headquartered firm still maintains it found no proof that any data had been stolen in either case, the attorney generals noted that the intruders had used anti-forensic tools that had made it impossible to determine exactly what had been done.As part of the settlement, Hilton has promised to disclose future breaches more quickly and to perform regular security tests, among other enhanced safety efforts."Hilton is strongly committed to protecting our customers' payment card information and maintaining the integrity of our systems," the company said in a statement.
Google investigates mysterious vanishing files:::::Image copyright Google Image caption Google Docs appears to be locking users out of files by flagging documents as violating its terms of services Numerous Google Docs users have reported being mysteriously locked out of certain files in their accounts.The error had caused files to be flagged as violating Google's terms of service.Users had received a message saying: "This item has been flagged as inappropriate and can no longer be shared."Google told the BBC that a code update had caused the error, but that the problem had now been resolved.Users had taken to Twitter to complain about the issue, saying that while they were working on documents the screen suddenly froze, and then a message came up telling them they could no longer access a file.Some people have also reported that another error prevented them from sending Google appeal requests to unlock their files.Other strange behaviour has been noticed on the service - one user, Iain Mackenzie, said the words "game is over" had flashed up in a Google Docs document he had been editing and then disappeared.Mr Mackenzie said that no other user had been in the file at the time, and that the Google Docs revisions log showed only he had been editing the document for the past few hours."This morning, we made a code push that incorrectly flagged a small percentage of Google Docs as abusive, which caused those documents to be automatically blocked," a Google spokeswoman told the BBC."A fix is in place and all users should have full access to their docs.Protecting users from viruses, malware, and other abusive content is central to user safety."We apologise for the disruption and will put processes in place to prevent this from happening again."
Hunt challenges social media giants on cyber-bullying:::::Image copyright Getty Images Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt is meeting social media giants, including Facebook and Twitter, to challenge them on cyber-bullying.In tweets ahead of the discussions, he says some responsibility for rising rates of youth self-harm lies with social platforms.He says the industry must be "part of the solution" regarding young people's mental health.Social media companies have said they do prioritise user safety.Mr Hunt will be meeting representatives from the biggest providers of social media, including Facebook, Twitter, Google and Microsoft.Mr Hunt said: "Social media has become a fundamental part of our children's lives and while the internet provides amazing opportunities we cannot ignore the negative effect disturbing images and bullying are having on their mental health."Now is the time to turn the tide on this abuse.I will be working closely with the top social media companies to ensure they can become the solution and not the problem."Skip Twitter post by @Jeremy_Hunt We should not'accept' cyber bullying as inevitable but STOP it - my message to social media giants when I meet them for roundtable tomorrow.Jeremy Hunt (@Jeremy_Hunt) October 31, 2017 Report Mr Hunt will ask the social media companies: If they can share statistics on how often cyber-bullying happens on their platforms, and what form it takes.If they have information on the number of underage users, and what can be done to prevent them accessing services.Whether it is possible to identify unhealthy online behaviour among teenagers.And take action to try to provide advice and support.A Facebook spokesperson said: "We want to make sure that everyone, including anyone affected by a mental health issue, has a good experience on Facebook and Instagram."We look forward to working with ministers and others to make sure we do everything we can to protect people's wellbeing."We have already introduced online tools such as Instagram's automated offensive comment filter and last month launched a new partnership between Facebook, Childnet International and The Diana Award, which is offering every UK secondary school the chance to have a young digital safety ambassador who can support their peers' safety and well-being."Instagram, which is owned by Facebook, has previously been rated as the worst social media platform when it comes to impact on young people's mental health, in a poll of people aged 14-24.Instagram responded by saying it provided tools and information on how to cope with bullying and warned users before they viewed certain content.'Take responsibility' Dr Marc Bush, chief policy adviser at charity YoungMinds, said social media companies had an important role to play in tackling online bullying, but education was also crucial."This means ensuring that young people learn about the positives and negatives of social media from a young age and that they know what to do if they're being harassed or come across upsetting content."It also means encouraging young people to take responsibility for their own behaviour and to understand what the impact might be on other people of what they post."

'I didn't realise it was going to be part of my entrapment':::::Image caption Beth Ashley and Euleen Hope both experienced technological abuse by former partners Women's charity Refuge is warning about the rise of "tech abuse" - the use of technology to spy on or harass a partner.Many victims of domestic violence report being either being harassed via online messages or having their activity monitored via their phones.However, many do not report it to the police, the charity said.Euleen Hope was a technophobe who escaped the control of her tech-savvy abusive ex-partner after 10 years.He set up her email and social media accounts for her, which meant he had full access to them.He also replaced her flip-phone with an iPhone which he then set up to be mirrored on to the pair's iPad so he could monitor her calls and messages, and activated the phone's location-tracker saying it would help her to get the bus."You wouldn't think he was doing anything bad, he showed you what he was doing," she said."I didn't realise it was going to be part of my entrapment."When she noticed things such as the iPad ringing when her phone rang, her ex told her he was just testing a new app.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Euleen Hope's ex-partner set up cameras in the couple's house He also installed cameras around the house under the guise of security."My twin sister came round one day to visit.Normally if my friends or family came over he would sit in the room with us," she recalled."This time he said he would leave us to catch up and said he would use his computer in the kitchen upstairs."I moved behind the camera and told my sister to keep talking, I went up the stairs and saw him listening to what he thought was our conversation."Ms Hope's former partner was also physically and emotionally abusive and eventually served a prison sentence for assault and GBH.Refuge is teaming up with Google to train its staff to better support victims who contact it as part of a new programme."Domestic violence is the biggest issue which impacts on the police," said Dame Vera Baird, police and crime commissioner for Northumbria, speaking at the project launch."Every 30 seconds there is a domestic violence call.Two years ago, it was every minute."Northumbria's police force gets 32,000 calls a year and that's maybe a fifth or a quarter of what is actually going on."Image copyright Google Image caption Dame Vera said the Northumbria Police force receives 32,000 domestic violence calls per year A 2016 survey by Comic Relief found that four out of five women who experienced abuse said their partner monitored their activity.Twenty-year-old blogger Beth Ashley said a former boyfriend had no interest in tech until she tried to end their relationship because he was controlling and sexually abusive."When I got with him he didn't even have a phone," she said."I thought he was a massive technophobe until we broke up.Suddenly he started all these social media accounts and used them as a harassment tool."Image copyright Google Image caption Beth Ashley said her work as a blogger meant she could not delete her online presence to hide from her ex-boyfriend She says he also sent her a suicide note via Facebook Messenger along with graphic images of self-harm, which she later discovered he had found online."I went round the next day and he was just sitting there on his Xbox," she said.She says he would regularly turn up where she worked and she would end her shift to find 50 messages from him on her phone.Ms Ashley was very active on social media because of her work as a blogger and online writer."There were times when I wanted to delete the blog, the magazines," she said."I have these random moments of wanting to be invisible.Considering my job, that would be awful."Ms Ashley says that she had to block old friends on social media in case one of them accidentally gave him information about her activities.After reporting him to the police, the online harassment stopped, she said."But the paranoia stayed for a long time," she added.Sandra Horley, chief executive of Refuge, said the charity had seen a case where a man had hacked the CCTV at the pub where his wife worked so he could monitor her, and another who put a tracker on his partner's car, moved it and then accused her of losing it."She thought she was losing her mind," she said."Technological abuse is part of a broader pattern of domestic violence."This project was born out of our clients' experiences of technology-related abuse, and we will continue to make sure their needs and experiences shape our work in the years ahead."
Malaysian data breach sees 46 million phone numbers leaked:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Malaysia's communication watchdog is investigating a huge data breach affecting 46 million mobile subscribers A massive data breach has seen the customer data of more than 46 million mobile subscribers in Malaysia leaked on to the dark web.The leaked information includes mobile numbers, unique phone serial numbers, as well as home addresses.Personal information from multiple Malaysian public sector and commercial websites was also stolen.The Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC) is now investigating.The data breach was first discovered by Malaysian technology news website Lowyat.net.The website was informed that someone was trying to sell huge databases of personal details for an undisclosed amount of Bitcoin on its forums.Stolen data The individual was trying to sell a huge amount of private customer information from at least 12 Malaysian mobile operators: Maxis DiGi Altel Celcom Enabling Asia Friendimobile MerchantTradeAsia PLDT RedTone TuneTalk Umobile XOX A huge amount of personal data was also stolen from Jobstreet.com and the: Malaysian Medical Council Malaysian Medical Association Academy of Medicine Malaysia Malaysian Housing Loan Applications Malaysian Dental Association National Specialist Register of Malaysia Lowyat.net says it reported the incident to Malaysia's communications watchdog on 18 October, and that the MCMC initially made the website take its story down.However, the MCMC confirmed the data breach a day later in a press statement released on Facebook, and then on Monday confirmed that 46.2 million mobile subscribers were affected by the data breach.Entire country affected It is believed that the entire country - Malaysia has a population of 32 million - might have been affected by the breach, as well as foreigners who were on temporary pre-paid mobile phone numbers.Under Malaysian law, service providers are required to keep customers' personal data secure, so there will probably be legal repercussions.Dr Mazlan Ismail, the chief operating officer of the MCMC, told the Malay Mail Online that it had met with all of the country's telecommunications companies to work out how the data breach had occurred."This is to ensure that they understand what is happening now, especially when the police, through the Commercial Crime Investigation Department, visit them to investigate," said Dr Ismail."Communications services cannot escape the security aspects, [service providers] must work together, and safety features are important to gain the trust of consumers."
Game studio CCP scales back virtual reality development:::::Image copyright CCP Games Image caption CCP also made the Sparc ball-tossing game for the PlayStation VR headset Developer CCP Games has significantly cut the time and money it is investing in virtual-reality based games.The Iceland-based studio is best known for sci-fi title Eve Online but has also created several VR-centred games.Spaceship dog-fighting simulator Eve Valkyrie helped launch the Oculus Rift headset and CCP also made the Sparc VR ball-tossing game for the PlayStation.CCP boss Hilmar Petursson said the company would re-invest in VR when market conditions improved.The move was a "blow to the viability of VR as a major gaming platform", said Adam Smith on the Rock, Paper Shotgun gaming news website, adding that Valkyrie was one of the few games that tempted him to try VR.The changes come just over a month after CCP overhauled Valkyrie in a bid to get more people playing it.Niche market CCP has cut its investment in VR as part of a broader restructuring effort.The structural changes mean more focus on PC and mobile games, it said in a statement.It is closing its Atlanta, US, office and selling off the development studio it maintains in Newcastle.The VR development work done at both locations will move to London.About 30 jobs are being lost during the restructure, it added, saying that it had given staff "severance packages" and would help them find other work.A potential buyer had been found for the Newcastle office, said CCP, adding that negotiations over the sale were continuing.The changes would have no immediate impact on Eve Valkyrie, said CCP, and a planned winter update for the game would be available as expected.Similarly, it said, Sparc development would continue in London.Image copyright GLENN CHAPMAN Image caption Eve Valkyrie was one of the key demo games for the Oculus headset "Today we have made tough, but important, changes to CCP in response to how we see the gaming market evolving in the coming years," said Mr Petursson."We have been front and centre in the second wave of VR and our belief in the long-term transformative power of the technology remains strong," he said, adding that it would not make "material VR investments" until the market grew substantially.CCP would now concentrate more on Eve Online and the new games emerging from that title, he said.Games analyst Piers Harding-Rolls from IHS Markit, said CCP took a "calculated risk" with its early VR investment, hoping that the expertise it built up would pay off as VR games became more popular."Unfortunately, adoption of high-end headsets - through which most VR games are being bought - has been a mixed bag since launch," he said.IHS Markit estimates that about 2.4 million PC headsets will have been sold by the end of 2017, said Mr Harding-Rolls."Although millions of users is a respectable number to target, when compared to other platforms, most games publishers would consider that level of adoption small and niche," he added.This explained why CCP had switched to concentrate on the PC and mobile markets which have hundreds of millions of potential players, he said.
Drone delivers food to Japan town hit by nuclear disaster:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The town of Odaka in Fukushima was devastated by a 2011 earthquake and tsunami Drones are delivering food to residents of a Japanese town devastated by the Fukushima nuclear disaster where access to shops is limited.Residents were allowed to return to the Minamisoma area last year but obtaining supplies can be difficult.Operators of the drone food delivery service said it was the first of its kind in Japan.A 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Fukushima triggered the worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl.Convenience store chain Lawson has worked with e-commerce firm Rakuten and this week launched a drone service in the Odaka district of the city of Minamisoma, which has a large population of older people.The district is roughly within a 20km radius of the Fukushima Daiichi Power Station, the site of the nuclear disaster triggered by an earthquake and tsunami six years ago.People were forced to leave their homes because of radiation concerns.The Japanese government lifted an evacuation order for Minamisoma in October 2016 and allowed residents move back to the area following decontamination efforts."The town is starting to regain its former liveliness as its residents continue to return home," Lawson spokesperson Ken Mochimaru told the BBC."However, improving the shopping environment for daily necessities, food, and other products represents a high-priority challenge," he said.The drone service is designed to help.Shoppers can order hot food like fried chicken and household items, which are sent from a nearby Lawson store to a mobile food van that operates at a community centre in the area.The companies are trialling the service for the next six months.Image copyright Lawson Image caption Operators said the drone food delivery service was the first of its kind in Japan The drone can carry up to 2kg of goods.As well as its shops, Lawson operates mobile vans across Japan, particularly in rural and mountainous regions where access is difficult, as well as serving ageing populations in urban areas.More than a quarter of Japan's population is aged over 65, and set to increase over the next two decades, as the total number of people in the country shrinks.
Big net firms invest in trans-Pacific cable project:::::Image copyright Science Photo Library Image caption It can take years to lay the lengthy cables that connect up the continents Facebook and Amazon are putting cash into a project to lay a new submarine cable that will link Asia and the US.Once completed in 2020, the Jupiter cable will stretch for more than 14,000km and will be able to carry more than 60 terabits of data a second.The two firms have joined Jupiter as part of plans to build their own global networks and cut data transport costs.The cable is one of many in which the net's biggest firms, including Google and Microsoft, have recently invested.Network edges "There's a bit of a boom in terms of the internet content providers taking a leading role in the development of new submarine cable systems," said Alan Mauldin, research director at analyst firm Telegeography.The big net firms were involved in about 16 separate cabling ventures, he said, and used the capacity to handle the massive amounts of data their users generate.Some projects have already been completed but most are due to start carrying data sometime in the next few years.The net firms were most interested in joining projects that lay cables across the Pacific, the Atlantic and Asia, he said.They have acquired capacity on many other cables around the world as well."They started years ago building their own networks because the scale that they need is bigger than a carrier can provide," he added."Having a global backbone network is a big cost for them."By running their own networks, big net firms gain control over the system, keep costs low and get some redundancy in case of problems, he said."Cables do break sometimes so you need multiple paths and alternatives," he said.Net giants are involved in lots of cable-laying projects Google - Unity, SJC, Faster, Monet, Tannat, Junior, PLCN, Indigo-West, Indigo-Central Facebook - AEConnect, APG, Marea, PLCN, Jupiter Microsoft - Hibernia Express, AEConnect, New Cross Pacific, Marea Amazon - Hawaiki, Jupiter Traditional telecoms firms were also investing in the cable-laying projects to help boost their own trans-ocean bandwidth, he said.Although the big net firms have colossal data needs, they could not use all the bandwidth available on the submarine cables.Mr Mauldin said the data needs of search firms, social networks and cloud providers were growing rapidly while some others, such as Netflix, did not have to splash out on large networks to handle their traffic.Netflix avoided high bandwidth costs by pushing all its content out to the edges of the network where it is stored ready for use.This worked, he said, because an episode of a TV show or a film would not change much once it was made and shipped out to media servers.By contrast, he said, the dynamic content seen on Facebook had to be updated constantly feeding a demand for more bandwidth.
YouTuber Calum McSwiggan slams 'money-grabbing' Hello World Live event organisers:::::YouTuber Calum McSwiggan has slammed the organisers of the Hello World Live vlogger convention - after it was called a rip-off and "completely flat and dull" by some ticket-holders.The two-day event was billed as a "live event like nothing on Earth".But Calum McSwiggan blames event organisers, who he says "just had pound signs in their eyes"."The YouTube community has a really bad reputation sometimes and it's because of events like Hello World."The organisers have apologised after receiving complaints from fans."It's a really big deal for [fans] to meet their favourite YouTube stars and take photos with them," says Calum, who didn't attend the event at the Genting Arena in Birmingham."That's what they were promised and they just weren't given that and it's heartbreaking."The sad thing is, I'm guessing the YouTubers who attended weren't actually paid very much themselves - it's the people who put on the event who are lining their pockets."He also says that the event only adds to "this idea that YouTubers are just out there to grab people's money".Hello World posted an apology on its Facebook page.and has said that it will issue refunds on a case-by-case basis.Peter is one of the parents who has asked for a refund after he bought tickets for his daughter's 13th birthday."It was just completely flat and dull, and void of any atmosphere," he tells Newsbeat."There were arcade games that didn't work, there was no street carnival, there were no street rides, there was no aftershow party as advertised."It was just so poor for the price, it was unbelievable."Tickets for the event - which took place on Saturday and Sunday - were on sale for between 27.50 and 99, plus a booking fee.Jason Perrie, the creative director of the event, says he was "incredibly sorry to hear that anyone didn't have a great experience" and claims the majority of people did."We didn't promise anybody that you'd be meeting and greeting people," he tells Newsbeat."It was a different style of entertaining people - where people had to find their own way of finding their entertainment rather than be guided."While he says that many of the YouTubers "just got train fares and hotel rooms" paid for, he also says that the event also won't make money "in the first few years".He wants disappointed ticket holders to come back next year."We'll spoil them and look after them and really make it up to them."But not everyone had a bad experience.Collette McLean, 30, travelled from Leicester with her younger sister."Teenagers expect to get involved in everything and meet everyone but it's not realistic at such a large event.You make your own experience," she says."When YouTubers did come out they where mobbed and the younger audience ruined it for themselves."Collette paid for the VIP tour, and said: "Jim Chapman was our tour guide and he was brilliant - we also met Joe Sugg and he was amazing."Find us on Instagram at BBCNewsbeat and follow us on Snapchat, search for bbc_newsbeat
North Korea calls UK WannaCry accusations 'wicked':::::Image copyright WEBROOT Image caption WannaCry spread to more than 150 countries in a worldwide attack North Korea has hit back at the UK government for accusing it of being behind a massive ransomware attack that badly affected the National Health Service (NHS).A UK government minister last week told the BBC he was "as sure as possible" North Korea was behind the attack.But a North Korean spokesman called the accusations "groundless speculation".More than a third of NHS trusts in England were disrupted by the WannaCry ransomware in May.At least 19,000 appointments were cancelled and computers in over 600 doctor's surgeries infected.WannaCry was the biggest cyber-attack to have hit the NHS to date and also spread to more than 150 countries.A spokesman for the North's Korea-Europe Association called the UK's accusation "a wicked attempt" to tighten international sanctions on the country."This is an act beyond the limit of our tolerance and it makes us question the real purpose behind the UK's move," he said in comments carried on the Korean Central News Agency on Monday.The South Korean government believes the North has a unit of 6,800 trained cyber-warfare specialists.Pyongyang's cyber military was thought to be behind an online attack on Sony Pictures and a hack last year in which blueprints of a South Korean warship company were stolen.

Samsung Electronics unveils new leadership line-up:::::Image copyright Getty Images Samsung Electronics has named its new leadership team following the resignation of CEO Kwon Oh-hyun.Three executives have been promoted to joint chief executives of the firm as part of the management overhaul.The shake-up came hours after the firm reported quarterly profits had nearly tripled from a year ago.Net profit rose to 11.2 trillion won ($10bn; 7.6bn) during July to September, driven by strong memory chip and smartphone sales.New leadership The new appointees are all in their 50s and include Kim Ki-nam, Koh Dong-jin and Kim Hyun-suk.They will take up their positions immediately as the heads of Samsung Electronics' three main businesses - Device Solutions, IT and Mobile Communications and Consumer Electronics."The next generation of leaders are well suited to accelerate the pace of innovation and address the demands of the connected world," the firm said in a statement.The South Korean tech giant also confirmed that its chief financial officer Lee Sang-hoon had been recommended as the new chairman of the board, and that long-time co-CEOs J.K. Shin and Yoon Boo-keun would step down.It is the first time the chairman role has not been given to one of the firm's three chief executives.The firm is striving to regain the confidence of the government and financial markets in the aftermath of the corruption scandal in which the Samsung Group's heir apparent Lee Jae-yong was jailed for bribery and corruption.Image copyright EPA Image caption Samsung's heir apparent, Lee Jae-yong has appealed against his five year jail term for bribery and corruption Unprecedented crisis The leadership shake-up began about a fortnight ago when Mr Kwon became the first of the firm's three chief executives to resign, citing an "unprecedented crisis".At the time, he said the company's current profitability was "merely a fruit of decisions and investment made in the past".His resignation came days after Mr Lee began an appeal against his conviction and five year jail sentence, stemming from payments to the secret confidante of South Korea's ousted president Park Geun-Hye.Samsung Electronics is regarded as the jewel in the crown of the Samsung conglomerate, which is made up of 60 interlinked companies.Record result Samsung Electronics described its latest quarterly result as a "robust performance" overall.The world's biggest memory chip and smartphone maker expects strong demand for its products to continue, putting it on track for a record annual profit.It will also pay around $26bn in dividends to shareholders over the next three years.While memory chips were the main driver of Samsung's earnings, its mobile phone business was given a boost by its new Note 8 smartphone which received the firm's highest number of pre-orders.It marks a significant turnaround for the firm which was hit badly by the global recall of its flagship Note 7 smartphone in 2016, following the fiasco with its overheating and exploding batteries.
Fixed-odds maximum bet 'could drop to £2':::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption 'I was completely caught up in gambling' The maximum stake for fixed-odds betting terminals could drop to as little as 2 under a government review.Currently, people can bet up to 100 every 20 seconds on electronic casino games, but ministers are considering a new limit somewhere between 2 and 50.The consultation aims to reduce the risk of people suffering large losses and to tighten up advertising rules.The Association of British Bookmakers said the onus was on the gambling industry to help cut problem gambling.According to a government consultation, cutting the stake to 2 would cost the industry over the next 10 years.But problem gamblers say it is time for action to be taken - including, but not only, lessening the amount they can lose in one hit.Gambling vlogger Andrew Margett told BBC Radio 5live how the machines, also known as FOBTs, proved addictive: "I was just in a trance, in a complete bubble, playing it.Hitting the button, hitting the button, hitting the button."Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The BBC's Nick Eardley explains how the machines work As part of the government review: The Gambling Commission - the industry's regulator - will consult on changes to protect online players.Broadcasters, advertisers, industry and support groups will draw up an advertising campaign to promote responsible gambling, with an annual budget of up to 7m.New advertising guidelines will be drafted to protect problem gamblers, children and young people.Access by under-18s to gambling content and channels on social media will be restricted.Gambling companies are being told to step up funding for research, education and treatment.If they don't, operators may face a levy.Culture minister Tracey Crouch said current laws on gaming machines - which critics have called the "crack cocaine of gambling" - were "inappropriate"."It is vital that we strike the right balance between socially responsible growth and protecting the most vulnerable, including children, from gambling-related harm," she said."We have seen online gambling grow rapidly and we need to protect players in this space, while also making sure those experiencing harm relating to gambling receive the help they need," she said.But in an urgent question session in the Commons, shadow culture secretary Tom Watson said the government was kicking the issue into "the long grass" and added that action, rather than a consultation, was needed.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption 'Bookies have won' over fixed-odds machines "There's an old maxim that the bookies always win, and they've won again today," he said.Mr Watson, who is also Labour's deputy leader, claimed that 450,000 children are gambling on a weekly basis.Labour wants a new gambling bill to look at the explosion of digital and online products - to stop children gambling on phones and to protect vulnerable people.Carolyn Harris MP, who chairs an all-party parliamentary group on the issues involved, said there was overwhelming evidence people's lives were being destroyed by the machines."When you see the statistics that 31% per cent of people who use these machines are earning less than 10,000... Where do they get the money?Because they are not earning it," she told the Victoria Derbyshire programme.The government began to look again at gambling in October 2016, when it made a "call for evidence" on the number and location of gaming machines and the measures in place to protect players.Fixed-odds terminals were introduced in casinos and betting shops from 1999, and offer computerised games including roulette and blackjack at the touch of a button.The government is consulting on 11 different types of gaming machine, with stakes ranging from 30p to 5.Each machine accepts bets up to a pre-set maximum and pays out according to fixed odds on the simulated outcomes of games.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Inside the brain of a gambling addict 'Reducing FOBT odds is a matter of principle', by Amol Rajan, media editor Like every other industry, gambling has been radically transformed by technology.The advent of smartphones has made gambling much easier, more convenient, and constantly present than it was before.For centuries, gambling was for the most part an activity or habit that you had to move towards.Now, thanks to the internet, the gambling comes to you.It is dangerous to reduce the debate of FOBTs to one about economics: how much is raised in tax revenue; potential job losses; the impact on our high streets and so on.It is rather also a question of principle.In a free or liberal society, is it reasonable to let fully informed adults of sound mind make their own decisions about how to spend - and yes, waste - their money?Perhaps it is; but it becomes intolerable when this freedom harms others.It seems that public opinion has moved to the view that negative social consequences and harm have flowed from the gambling industry's tendency to cluster in areas of deprivation and high unemployment.Malcolm George, of the Association of British Bookmakers, said the government shared its wish to identify problem gamblers and get them help.But restricting terminals in betting shops would redirect problem gamblers to other avenues where there were fewer controls on the amount of gambling, he said."Just as alcohol policy in this country is not solely determined by alcoholics" he added, there needs to be an environment for the "vast majority who gamble responsibly".The British Amusement Catering Trade Association's John White said the government needed to "strike the right balance", but stakes should be "quite substantially" reduced, he said.Asked about job loss fears, he said half of high street adult gaming centres had disappearing since FOBTs were introduced.Tax law changes in 2001 led to a vast increase in the number of terminals.By 2005, about 20,000 terminals were in use and more than 34,000 are now found across the UK, according to the Gambling Commission.

Free ATMs could be cut back in cash machine shake-up:::::Plans to shake-up the UK's ATM network may lead to a "vast reduction" in the number of free-access cash machines.Link, the UK's largest ATM network with 70,000 machines, is proposing to overhaul the operation.Under the change, Link would reduce the amount it charges card issuers to allow customers to use the machines.But the move will leave "ATM deserts" where communities have no access to cash, warned the ATM Industry Association.On Wednesday, Link published a range of proposals, including a cut in the fees it charges card companies from around 25p to 20p per withdrawal.It said the changes - which would come into effect next April - would help protect the network, which currently includes 55,000 free-to-use machines.Link said it was committed to maintaining an extensive network of free-to-use machines But the ATM Industry Association criticised the plans.The trade body warned that unprofitable machines would be shut down, leaving "ATM deserts" where communities have no access to cash and other financial services."A unwarranted shake-up of Link will hit the most hard-up the heaviest - particularly the millions of people who rely on cash for day-to-day budgeting," said Ron Delnevo, of the association.But Link chief executive John Howells said: "Free access to cash is vital for UK consumers and Link intends to maintain this for many years to come."He said Link's financial inclusion programme will help maintain "extensive free access to cash for all in the UK".
Google 'drops everything' to fix burger emoji:::::Google CEO Sundar Pichai has tasked employees returning to work on Monday morning with one key objective: fix the burger emoji.The tech giant's big cheese (sorry) stepped in after a tweet from author Thomas Baekdal highlighted inconsistencies in different tech companies' burger construction.Amid the cheesy puns (sorrier) and breathless bewilderment, it was the meaty issue (sorry - not sorry) of cheese placement which sparked the most fervent debate.Posting a picture from emojipedia, Mr Baekdal said it was: "time to have a discussion about how Google's burger emoji is placing the cheese underneath the burger, while Apple puts it on top".In the image, Google is the only company which places its cheese underneath the meat.Mr Baekdal clearly has his finger on the social zeitgeist, as the discussion he wanted took off online.His initial tweet has attracted 17,500 retweets, more than 36,000 likes and hundreds of comments.You may also like: People really care about burgers, and some were unimpressed with the effort made by both companies.The debate came to the attention of Google's CEO Sundar Pichai on Sunday."Will drop everything else we are doing and address on Monday if folks can agree on the correct way to do this," he tweeted.His pledge to act quickly and decisively was the signal fans of burger puns had been waiting for as a torrent of witticisms was unleashed."If Sundar says he'll do it, then consider it bun," one noted on Twitter."These burger puns are going to ketchup with you in a bad way," another responded.It is unclear what, if anything, Google actually plan to do about their controversial cheese-bottomed burger, but perhaps if they can resolve their burger issues by the end of the day then beer might be their next priority.

Spreading the word: How to promote your online business:::::Image copyright Gemma Day Image caption Nosh Detox founder Geeta Sidhu-Robb used bloggers to help promote her brand Online businesses now have a wealth of digital tools and techniques at their disposal to help them get noticed in the global marketplace.Geeta Sidhu-Robb, founder of juice and health food delivery service, Nosh Detox, was using social media to promote her business long before it became fashionable to do so.Ten years ago, in fact.On a tight budget and needing to convince a sceptical public, she tapped in to the power and reach of bloggers to promote her diet and wellbeing products."Juice fasts didn't really exist in the UK at the time," recalls the former corporate lawyer and single mum of three."In fact some people actually thought a detox could kill you.""We couldn't afford PR [public relations] agencies or expensive advertising campaigns, so we'd talk to pretty much anyone with an online presence and persuade them to take photos, film us on YouTube and write about us," she says.The bloggers would include a link to her website on their pages - occasionally in return for some Nosh Detox freebies Ms Sidhu-Robb admits.This helped push the business to the top of organic - not paid-for - search rankings.A 2m turnover and Hollywood A-list clientele followed, along with significant followings in Russia and Australia.It shows how, on social media, a little can go a very long way when it comes brand promotion.Image copyright EyeFitU Image caption Isabelle Ohnemus is a big believer in finding the right social media "influencer" for your brand Now social media marketing is a business in its own right.Convenient and low cost, with a potentially vast audience reach, the platforms have overtaken all other media for small businesses, says research firm BIA Kelsey.Former investment banker Isabelle Ohnemus has extensively used "influencers" to promote her Zurich-based fashion company EyeFitU, which is an online platform aimed at remedying some of the sizing inconsistencies across fashion brands.Usually young, fashion-conscious females with a prominent online presence act as "brand ambassadors" for EyeFitU, promoting the company to their followers on Instagram, Snapchat or Facebook.Big brands will sometimes pay in excess of $30,000 (23,000) to such influencers for a single post, but smaller companies with more modest budgets can still get in on the action."There is a trend for going with smaller-scale bloggers rather than those with million-plus followers," says Ms Ohnemus,."Having those kinds of numbers doesn't necessarily mean a higher number of conversions."In other words, it's the quality of the following not the size that matters.People who trust an influencer's opinion are more likely to buy the brand's goods, she says.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Reality TV star Marnie Simpson fell foul of the Advertising Standards Authority Of course, there are rules governing this sort of social media influencer marketing, so you have to be careful.Geordie Shore TV star Marnie Simpson recently got into trouble for uploading images of products from two firms she had business relationships with, without identifying them as adverts A spokeswoman for the UK's Advertising Standards Authority tells the BBC: "Our current codes state that if an advertiser gives payment to a social media influencer - this can be in the form of a monetary payment or a freebie - and there is control over the contents of the ad, the social media post would be considered an ad; thus the influencer must clearly indicate somewhere on the post that this is an advertisement."Know your customer One of the main advantages of an online business compared to a traditional bricks-and-mortar shop is the amount of data you can gather about your customers.You can find out which search words people use to find your business, for example, which images they respond to the most, and which website content they share on other platforms.This all helps to refine and target your marketing efforts.Free monitoring tools, like BuzzSumo and Metrixapp, not to mention Google Analytics, are all powerful helpers for the small business.Image copyright Gourmet Meat Club Image caption Gourmet Meat Club found that images of cooked food were more popular than raw ingredients Vikas Shah, visiting professor of entrepreneurship at the MIT Sloan School of Management, says: "You can easily start by using many free SEO [search engine optimisation] tools on platforms like Google and Twitter, and because this activity is very much results driven, you will see a fairly robust relationship between spend and return on investment."Gourmet Meat Club, an online provider of free range British meat, is one of the 54% of websites globally using Google Analytics to delve into customer quirks.Recent insights reveal that Android mobile users visit more web pages than those on an Apple phone, and images of cooked food generate more views in a digital ad campaign than images of raw ingredients.Furthermore, the technology tracks the most popular food searches online, giving Gourmet Meat Club the opportunity to create content based on the very latest trends.More Technology of Business Image copyright Getty Images "It's crucial to act fast," says Stuart Cordingley, the firm's managing director, "jumping onto popular searches as soon as they emerge to get ahead of the competition and be present where the public is discussing its new favourite food topics."This is the best way for the brand to get "ample exposure", he says.Data is now "central to the marketing mix".This up-to-the-minute content is sent to journalists and shared on the firm's own Facebook and Twitter pages.Social media marketing expert Andy Barr says it is an example of how online businesses are increasingly morphing into social media communities, creating content that positions them as authorities on particular topics.But he also advises supplementing this approach with social media advertising."As a general rule of thumb, it's worth spending between 7-12% of your total monthly revenue or income on social media promotion for the best results," he says.
Explainer: What is Russia's new VPN law all about?:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption EXPLAINED: What is a VPN service?A Russian law regulating the use of technologies enabling users to search the internet anonymously came into force on 1 November.Many are worried the law will make it harder for Russians to bypass internet censorship.Signed by President Vladimir Putin in July, the law imposes restrictions on proxy avoidance tools.These tools include virtual private networks (VPNs) and anonymous proxy servers (anonymisers).VPN providers will be obliged to closely cooperate with Russian media watchdog Roskomnadzor and comply with its requests.What's a VPN?A VPN is a private network created over a public network.Despite popular belief, VPNs cannot make online connections completely anonymous, because some VPN providers can keep users' logs.However, they can still increase a user's privacy and security by hiding their IP address.In a corporate work setting, VPNs allow employees to securely access an intranet from outside the office.Both VPNs and anonymisers allow a user to appear as if they were connecting to the internet from another location.What exactly is banned?Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Under the new law, VPNs can be used only to access websites not banned by Russia Despite widespread speculation, the law does not directly ban the operation of VPNs and anonymisers.However, it does restrict access to banned websites with the help of these tools.VPN providers will get access to Roskomnadzor's blacklist of banned websites and will be entitled to provide the use of their servers "within the legal framework", the banki.ru banking portal reports.Leonid Levin, the head of the Russian State Duma's information policy committee, has previously said the law is meant to block access only to "unlawful content" and is not intended to impose restrictions on law-abiding citizens, according to business daily RBC.Will it work?Roskomnadzor has been developing measures to identify suspect websites, as well as ways to block them.However, in practice this is very difficult, and it may have unwanted consequences.For instance, the watchdog has a single register of banned domain names.In June, one of Google.ru's web pages contained a redirect to a blocked online gambling domain, so due to the ban, the search engine was blocked for several hours.Image copyright Tor Project Image caption The Tor Project is free software and an accompanying network that lets people visit websites anonymously According to IT experts, the law provides exemption for corporate VPNs.However, it remains unclear how exactly Roskomnadzor will distinguish between corporate and public VPNs.At present, it is impossible to differentiate them, says Leonid Yevdokimov, an expert at the Tor Project - a US-based team that creates software to let people visit websites anonymously and access otherwise hidden parts of the net.What will happen?Some Russian social-media users have been agonising over whether the watchdog will now be able to restrict internet access from home if they search for a banned website.IT experts are unanimous that it will not.It is up to search engine operators such as Google and Yandex to "shield" users from such banned websites, and if they fail to do so, they can be held responsible, banki.ru says.Most lay internet users would not notice any changes once the law came into force, the communications director at media holding Rambler&Co, Matvei Alexeyev, told the BBC.He sees it as a step towards greater transparency of VPN servers.
The all-female groups discussing harassment:::::Image copyright Getty Images A series of allegations against prominent men has begun to surface on social media - in all-female groups on WhatsApp, shared Google Docs, and Facebook pages - in the wake of allegations of sexual assault and rape against Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein.Leaks about British politicians have reached political reporters, but there are further allegations about sexual harassment being circulated online, and they go well beyond politics into the worlds of media, fashion and film.The BBC has seen a list thought to have been compiled by staff and researchers at Westminster, detailing a range of mostly unproven allegations about 40 Conservative MPs and ministers.In other industries, a number of all-female WhatsApp groups have been created, in some cases to warn women about potential harassment.One with the title "Pervy Men of Journalism" includes dozens of mainly UK-based female journalists.You might also be interested in: In addition, Buzzfeed reported on a Google Docs spreadsheet which is now circulating widely.It contains the names of around 70 male journalists - mostly based in the United States - who are accused of a large variety of potential sexual offences or inappropriate behaviours.The groups and documents, along with Facebook pages devoted to exposing sexual harassment allegations, have resulted in several cases of men losing jobs or freelance gigs.WhatsApp groups have been formed by female journalists at a number of companies, including the BBC.Of course, many of these groups are simply digital versions of office chat, and pre-date the Harvey Weinstein allegations.Weinstein has denied all allegations of non-consensual sex made against him.The key difference between offline conversations is the viral nature of some of the documents and chats and their persistence online.For instance, the original spreadsheet about US journalists was deleted, but before very long another version appeared and was widely shared.Some of the groups have been created specifically to talk about harassment, and in addition to politics and media, BBC Trending has learned of similar groups made up of women working in the film and fashion industries.Clearly many more will have sprung up in a variety of companies and fields since the Twitter hashtag campaign #metoo.American model Cameron Russell published messages she received about harassment on her Instagram page with the hashtag #MyJobShouldNotIncludeAbuse.Many of the writers who sent their stories said it was often photographers, bookers, agents and clients who were involved in harassment of models.Cameron Russell says stories like the ones being shared with her are not new.In a post she wrote, "This was not an expose because nothing in these stories should be a revelation for those working in our industry.Instead it was the beginning of a power shift."The phenomenon also isn't limited to the US and the UK.In India, female law student Raya Sarkar posted a list on Facebook of alleged sexual predators in academia.She encouraged other women to come forward anonymously and add to the list, and said the evidence for the allegations came in the form of emails, screenshots, WhatsApp messages and phone recordings.Sarkar says as a result of publishing the list she has been subjected to rape threats and death threats.Writing on her Facebook page she says: "The list will stay for students to be wary."Do you have a story for BBC Trending?Email us.More from Trending: Can a Facebook friend request be 'harassment'?Image copyright Getty Images A filmmaker touched off a debate in Pakistan revolving around one question - can a Facebook friend request ever be considered harassment?...READ MORE You can follow BBC Trending on Twitter @BBCtrending, and find us on Facebook.All our stories are at bbc.com/trending.
Can a Facebook friend request be 'harassment'?:::::Image copyright Getty Images A filmmaker touched off a debate in Pakistan revolving around one question - can a Facebook friend request ever be considered harassment?It began with a visit to the hospital by the sister of Oscar-award winning Pakistani filmmaker Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy.After the treatment, the sister received a friend request from her doctor.That prompted an angry Twitter outburst by the filmmaker - and a social media storm about the definition of harassment: Image copyright Sharmeen Obaid / Twitter Image copyright Sharmeen Obaid / Twitter Image copyright Sharmeen Obaid / Twitter Obaid-Chinoy's description of the Facebook request as "harassment" triggered an angry response from many Pakistanis claiming she had overreacted.Others supported her, claiming the often abusive reaction she received revealed the misogyny of her critics.One of Obaid-Chinoy's most vocal detractors was journalist Ali Moeen Nawazish, who wrote on his own Facebook page that comparing a social media request to harassment was "ridiculous."He added "Whats next, asking for a pen is harassment Looking at someone for three seconds will be harassment???"In his post, he also said that the claim "is actually taking away from real victims of harassment."You might also be interested in: The journalist concluded by criticising Obaid-Chinoy for "Pakistan shaming."Nawazish later claimed that the doctor had been fired as a result of the tweets, however reports indicate that he has been suspended from Aga Khan University Hospital in Karachi while an internal investigation takes place.Obaid-Chinoy, who won acclaim for her documentaries on "honour killings" and acid attack victims, has faced similar accusations in the past.She's been accused of being a "traitor" to Pakistan in relation to her work which exposes violent and misogynistic cultural traditions prevalent in certain parts of Pakistani society.Her tweet storm renewed those criticisms and she was repeatedly accused of having harmed the country's international image.Some suggested she exemplified the phrase "wrong women in the wrong family" and called her an elitist.She, however, subsequently clarified she was referring to the fact that "women in my family are strong" and had not meant to "suggest a sense of privilege or power."But that didn't stop many Pakistanis on Twitter from attacking the filmmaker.Some posted photographs of her with other men - apparently suggesting these images made her a hypocrite for complaining about alleged harassment.Facebook pages were created encouraging people to send Obaid-Chinoy friend requests.Image copyright Saith Abdullah / Twitter Many others, including both men and women, questioned whether a friend request amounted to harassment.Image copyright Hamza Ali Abbasi / Twitter But Obaid-Chinoy did find some support in newspaper columns and on social media.Her defenders included Pakistani writer Bina Shah, who told the BBC she wasn't surprised by "the kind of abuse and vitriol" directed at the filmmaker."Any time you try to fight against (the patriarchy) you get an immediate backlash," Shah said.In a subsequent statement Obaid-Chinoy wrote that "The conversation has unfortunately steered far from the safety of women, unchecked unethical practises & harassment."She revealed that the doctor in question had conducted a "very private examination" of her sister before going online and "leaving comments on photographs & trying to add her as a Facebook friend."She clarified she regularly receives "unsolicited friendship requests from strangers" but that she considered this episode a "serious breach of patient-doctor privilege."The Pakistan Medical and Dental Council referred the BBC to their ethical guidelines, which don't specifically mention social media but do state that a "professional position must never be used to pursue a relationship of an emotional or sexual nature with a patient, the patient's spouse, or a near relative of a patient."The doctor at the centre of the controversy has not been named publicly.He has, however, reportedly received a job offer from another hospital in Karachi.Image copyright Hashmanis Hospital / Facebook Blog by Secunder Kermani More from Trending: 'Lack of compromise' brought Civil War Image copyright Drew Angerer/Getty Images President Trump's chief of staff, General John Kelly, claims an inability to compromise caused the American Civil War.The social media reaction came quick...READ MORE You can follow BBC Trending on Twitter @BBCtrending, and find us on Facebook.All our stories are at bbc.com/trending.
Somalia's 'touch and feel' e-commerce hit:::::Image copyright Innovate Ventures Image caption Muraadso co-founders Abdiqani Ibrahim, Hamse Musa and Saed Mohamed When Saed Mohamed, a young entrepreneur from Somalia, pitched his online shopping business Muraadso as part of an East African start-up competition in 2015, he was prepared for rejection.And rejection is what he got.Abdigani Diriye, head of the Somalia-based accelerator, Innovate Ventures, which oversaw the competition, was not impressed."We had a few applications from e-commerce start-ups and they just weren't really doing it for me," he told the BBC.But Mr Mohamed and his team were not about to give up."We have had a lot of rejections and we have learned to be persistent.We wouldn't take no for an answer," he says.They did eventually get on the programme and ended up winning it."The irony is they went on to become the most successful start-up we took on," joked Mr Diriye.But the business they were pitching - a online store selling mainly electronics - "failed miserably" at first, admits Mr Mohamed.Image copyright Muraadso Image caption Users can see goods before they buy by visiting one of Muraadso's three offline stores It seemed Somalia wasn't ready yet for online only.Perhaps this isn't surprising given that less than a third of its 14 million people are able to access the internet and few have bank accounts.It's an uphill struggle to get any online business off the ground.So he looked to how Western retailers were combining offline and online sales to revive the flagging brand."The hybrid model is the thing right now.Amazon has opened a physical store and Walmart and other traditional retailers are acquiring e-commerce sites," he told the BBC.Muraadso did the same and "sales sky-rocketed," he said.Opening bricks and mortar stores in three different cities meant that potential buyers could go and touch the goods first before committing to buying them.The site offers traditional home deliveries and flexible ways to pay, including cash on delivery.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Amazon opened a physical bookstore in Seattle in November, 2015 Many purchase are made via mobile money transfer service, Zaad, which operates in a similar way to Kenya's famous M-Pesa platform.Zaad has an 80% market share in Somalia, charging no fees to send or withdraw money, but making its money instead from offering extra services and mobile airtime."The hybrid model wasn't a concept that I was familiar with, but Muraadso started implementing it late last year and they have been growing ever since, going from a three-man team to employing dozens and looking to raise another round of funding," says Mr Diriye.E-commerce in Somalia is nascent, and across Africa generally, online shopping remains niche, says Matthew Reed, a consultant at research firm Ovum."Many people are still living on desperately low incomes, so e-commerce is really just for the middle classes.And there are other big challenges for e-commerce firms, not just in Somalia," he says.Image copyright AFP/Getty Images Image caption Terrorism, drought and famine have hampered Somalia's technological progress Chief among them is lack of infrastructure - both decent roads that enable quick and efficient deliveries, and the telecoms infrastructure that allows people to access the platforms in the first place.But things are changing.Millions in Africa have bypassed traditional telephone landlines and leapt straight to mobile - the oft-quoted "leapfrog" effect.According to mobile body the GSMA, there will be 725 million unique mobile subscribers on the continent by 2020.And Somalia is benefiting from this improved connectivity.In 2013, fibre optic firm Liquid Telecom connected the East African country to its network of cables, which now spreads 50,000km (31,000 miles) across 11 other African countries."There is increasing connectivity, mobile is increasingly widely available, and more of that is data-enabled with the increase of 3G and 4G networks," says Mr Reed.More Technology of Business Image copyright Getty Images "Devices are also becoming more affordable."Changing social and cultural patterns of behaviour, an increasingly youthful population, and urbanisation, mean the stage is set for e-commerce to thrive, he believes.According to Mr Mohamed, Facebook is "huge" in Somalia among younger people, so Muraadso is aggressively exploiting the platform to market its products, gaining 25,000 likes along the way.It aims to have 100,000 by the end of the year.Perhaps unsurprisingly, South Africa has the most mature e-commerce market in Africa, with others such as Kenya and Nigeria gaining user quickly.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Jumia delivers goods via scooter and offers a variety of payment options Online retailer Jumia is in all three countries and, while it offers a very similar set of services to global market leader Amazon, there is one crucial difference."They realised that they couldn't just copy-and-paste the approach and methodology of Amazon because of factors such as infrastructure, access to couriers and cultural preferences," explains Dr Diriye.So Jumia pioneered the idea of letting customers see the goods before they paid for them.Safari.com, Kenya's leading communications firm, recently announced that it would be launching its own online shopping offering by the end of the year and it plans to expand that service beyond Kenya.Muraadso is still small - its turnover is at around $40,000 (30,000) a month - but already it has a rival - Samionline - and Dr Diriye predicts more will follow."Every day another one pops up in Somalia as the digital wave starts to flow," he says."People are getting online, becoming more tech-savvy and the cost of owning a smartphone is falling."The benefits to the people of Somalia go beyond access to better quality goods and more choice, he adds."It also saves them time as they don't have to travel to town, and it saves them money because they don't have to pay for a bus."People are more productive with their time, and when you multiply that to a whole city or country, the impact can be very significant."
What a Facebook experiment did to news in Cambodia:::::Image caption Catherine Harry says the new design couldn't have come at a worse time for Cambodia Until recently, video blogger Catherine Harry was a Facebook success story in Cambodia.Her page, A Dose of Cath, featured a series of outspoken first person videos on taboo topics like virginity and menstruation that never got airtime on TV.Then, on 19 October, Facebook tweaked its News Feed in Cambodia and five other small countries.Instead of seeing posts from Facebook pages in their general News Feed, users in the test had to go to a new section called Explore Feed to see the content.And so when Ms Harry posted a new video on Facebook on Saturday, just 2,000 of her fans saw it in the first hour, compared to about 12,000 who normally watched."Suddenly I realised, wow, they actually hold so much power," she said.Facebook "can crush us just like that if they want to".Ms Harry, who quit her job to focus on vlogging, isn't just worried about her livelihood.Cambodia is in the throes of its most severe government crackdown in years ahead of a national election next July that could test the durability of Prime Minister Hun Sen, one of the longest-serving heads of government in the world.The crackdown has already claimed two NGOs, more than a dozen radio stations, and the local offices of two independent media outlets, Radio Free Asia and The Cambodia Daily.Hun Sen's main opposition, the Cambodian National Rescue Party (CNRP), could be dissolved entirely at a Supreme Court hearing on 16 November."Out of all the countries in the world, why Cambodia?"Ms Harry asks of Facebook's experiment."This couldn't have come at a worse time."Facebook surpassed TV as Cambodians' most popular source of news last year, according to a survey from the Asia Foundation, with roughly half of respondents saying they used the social media network.The platform helped power the CNRP's gains against the governing Cambodian People's Party (CPP) in the 2013 national elections and has been one of the only places for dissent in a country ranked 132nd out of 180 countries in Reporters Without Borders' 2017 World Press Freedom Index.With most mainstream traditional media aligned with the CPP, Facebook's test could mean that locals only get a skewed version of the day's news, said Von Vorn, a 30-year-old tuk-tuk driver."It's like a frog in a pond," he said."If the frog is in the pond, it won't know anything about the world - just the pond."Image copyright AFP Image caption The Cambodia Daily newspaper was shut in September amid a tax dispute with the government Facebook's popularity has not been lost on Hun Sen, who has amassed almost nine million followers with a mix of seaside selfies, state news and singing contests, and whose page was ranked by global public relations firm Burson-Marsteller as the eighth most popular of any world leader.Hun Sen's longtime rival, Sam Rainsy, the exiled former president of the CNRP who runs a popular page of his own, said his traffic had dipped 20% since the start of the Facebook test.Unlike the prime minister, whom he accused of buying Facebook supporters from foreign "click farms", Mr Rainsy said he could not pay to sponsor his posts to put them in front of more users in their usual News Feeds."Facebook's latest initiative would possibly give an even stronger competitive edge to authoritarian and corrupt politicians," he said.Facebook did not respond to requests for comment.But in a blog post last week, Adam Mosseri, the platform's head of News Feed, said the changes were made "to understand if people prefer to have separate places for personal and public content".The platform had no plans to expand the test globally, he said.Cambodian publishers of all stripes said they were frustrated by the unannounced changes.Leang Phannara, web editor for Post Khmer, the Khmer-language version of independent English daily the Phnom Penh Post, said Khmer Facebook posts were reaching 45% fewer people, while web traffic was down 35%.The only way to recapture that audience was to pay to sponsor posts, he said."It's a pay-to-play scenario," Mr Phannara said.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Sam Rainsy (left) and Hun Sen (right) made a political deal in 2014, but it didn't last Lim Cheavutha, CEO of the stridently pro-government online outlet Fresh News, was upset by changes he said had eaten into his traffic, though he did not have numbers to hand."I absolutely do not support this new [Facebook] policy," he said."It affects not only my company, but also all other media."Local non-governmental organisations (NGOs) are also worried about the effect of the move on their marketing efforts, according to Jaime Gill, a local communications consultant."Small NGOs have been able to compete by telling really powerful stories about their results," he said."This experiment has banished those posts to a new feed which I suspect few will use."'Fake news rampant' On the streets of Phnom Penh, no one approached by reporters had noticed the change.Sugarcane juice vendor Phorn Phel said he used Facebook to check in on developments across the country and would continue to do so by searching for his usual news sites, which he preferred over state-aligned media."We don't want to watch local TV much because there's nothing interesting," he said."That's why I need to find something on social media instead."Shop owner Sron Chathou said she spent nearly of all her free time on Facebook but hadn't noticed the experiment.She liked the immediacy of the platform, where her favourite pages would broadcast news like traffic accidents or flooding as they happened."We can bring our phone everywhere in our pocket," she said."No need to wait and see it on TV."Political analyst Ou Virak said Cambodians' trust in Facebook was misplaced given the rampant amount of fake news and conspiracy theories, often translated from English sources."They don't distinguish the source or credibility of information," he said, estimating that seven out of 10 stories that he encountered on his News Feed were false or exaggerated.Facebook's test, then, was less important than building media literacy."I don't see many Cambodians getting real or credible news anyway," he said.Ben Paviour is a freelance journalist based in Phnom Penh.Additional reporting by Ben Sokhean.
The flying drones that can scan packages night and day:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Pinc's flying drone scans warehouse packages Flying drones and robots now patrol distribution warehouses - they've become workhorses of the e-commerce era online that retailers can't do without.It is driving down costs but it is also putting people out of work: what price progress?It could be a scene from Blade Runner 2049; the flying drone hovers in the warehouse aisle, its spinning rotors filling the cavernous space with a buzzing whine.It edges close to the packages stacked on the shelf and scans them using onboard optical sensors, before whizzing off to its next assignment.But this is no sci-fi film, it's a warehouse in the US - one of around 250,000 throughout the country, many gargantuan in size: retail giant Walmart's smallest warehouse, for example, is larger than 17 football fields put together.And these automated drones are now doing the jobs humans - on foot, or operating fork-lift trucks and mechanical lifts - used to do: and they're doing them more cheaply and more accurately."Every year companies lose billions of dollars due to misplaced items and faulty inventory records in their warehouses," says Fadel Adib, an assistant professor of media, arts and sciences at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.Image copyright Hardis Group Image caption Hardis Group's EyeSee drone can fly autonomously "Today's inventory management requires workers to scan items manually, which is a very time consuming and error-prone process.It's impossible to keep track of all items in the warehouse."Two drones can do the work of 100 humans over the same time period, according to supply chain specialist, Argon Consulting.This means they can do several tours of a warehouse - even at night - compare results, identify discrepancies, and build up a much more accurate picture much more quickly.Drone makers claim scanning accuracy of close to 100%.Matt Yearling, chief executive of Pinc, one of the firms offering such aerial robots, says they can save warehousing and logistics companies millions of dollars."Nobody has 100% accuracy - including Walmart and Amazon," he says."For a warehouse that is 95% accurate, it means that 5% is ambiguous.So if the warehouse is storing $100m [75m] worth of inventory, then $5m is uncertain."Typically the retailer will have more than one warehouse.So, if you multiply the problem across the warehouse network you are talking big dollars."Pinc's drones use hydrogen fuel cells, enabling them to fly for up to two hours - four times as long as some battery-powered drones.More Technology of Business Image copyright Getty Images French firm Hardis Group has also launched an inventory-scanning drone - EyeSee - and emphasises how autonomous it is."Flight orders and flight plan execution are ensured by our Android application," says Stephane Cadenet, manager of the firm's drone programme."Our solution is simple to use: no installation, no infrastructure adaptation and no driver.The only thing to do is unpack the drone.The calculation of the flight plan is automatic."Other companies, such as Infinium Robotics, have also developed drone scanning systems.Of course, retailers have been using robots and automated systems in warehouses for some years.In 2012, fashion brand Net-A-Porter said its robot pickers were already 500% faster than humans, while online retailer Amazon's Kiva robots have almost become famous.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Instead of humans walking miles to pick goods, these robots take the shelves to the pickers "Innovators are working to make drones and robots an integral part of warehousing, inventory, and logistics," says JP Gownder, a principal analyst at research firm Forrester."Over the next 10 years, these technologies look set to revolutionise these spaces."But all this cost saving and efficiency comes at the expense of jobs for humans.The $2.3tn e-commerce industry is huge and growing, but almost 75% of e-commerce companies employ no more than four people.So it is no coincidence that in the US some 89,000 shop workers were laid off between October and April this year, while employment in New York City clothing stores has declined for three consecutive years.Forrester estimates that automation technologies, including artificial intelligence, will replace 17% of US jobs by 2027.And growth in new types of employment will not be enough to compensate."Automation does create opportunities for new jobs - equivalent to 10% of today's jobs," says Mr Gownder."But that still leads to a net 7% loss of jobs due to automation, which has to be made up by macro-economic growth, non-automation related jobs, and monetary policy."Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The Ocado warehouse run by robots Ryan Bax, industry analyst for mobility at research consultancy Frost & Sullivan, concedes that the use of drones and robotics in warehousing will lead to job losses, but believes growth elsewhere will compensate for this."As automation reduces the demand for lesser qualified jobs, the need for specialised skills within the logistics sector will grow," he maintains.And he thinks automation tech may even become mandatory once it has been shown to reduce accidents in the workplace."The use of automated technologies will permit warehouses to operate 24-hour days and improve stock management accuracy, but beyond this they will provide significant benefits to safety within the workplace."This will be small comfort for the thousands of warehouse workers displaced by drones and robots, but it is the inevitable consequence of our desire for online convenience, cheaper prices and faster deliveries.
How Facebook saved a dying mill town:::::Image copyright Alan Brandt A mill town with high unemployment has seen its fortunes changed by Facebook's need for data servers.But will the town have to radically change to save itself?The people of Prineville live deep in a valley surrounded by dense forests.In the 1800s, it was the first place in central Oregon where white settlers drove out Native Americans to start a city.Steve Forrester's grandparents got here in 1902.When he was growing up in the 1970s, Prineville felt idyllic."It was a magical, magical place to grow up," he remembers."My dad worked in the sawmill industry as an electrician; my mom didn't work.We all learned to hunt and shoot a gun."We all learned how to drive in the forest before we were 16.In the spring, we could snow-ski in the morning and water-ski in the afternoon."And everybody had a job, and everyone did well."Prineville was the largest producer of ponderosa pine in the world.But when the federal government restricted logging and increased protections for animals like the spotted owl, the city's milling industry was decimated.As an adult, Forrester took a job with one of the few remaining mills, because he wanted to live in Prineville.Eric Klann was driven by the same devotion.He's the seventh generation of his family to live here.Out of college, he also took a job in Prineville that he knew wouldn't last."There was always a little voice in the back of my head saying, 'What are you doing - you want to be here, but you're in a dying industry,'" he says.A few years later, the US housing bubble burst and demand declined for parts made by the last mills.Lots of people lost jobs and left.It felt like Prineville couldn't catch a break.Image copyright Alan Brandt Image caption One of Prineville's new kind of "factory" - a data server farm Both Forrester and Klann felt lucky to land jobs at the city - Forrester as city manager, Klann as city engineer.Their chance to save Prineville arrived in 2009 in the form of a mysterious email from a company called Vitesse."For the longest time, we had no idea what Vitesse meant," he says.All Klann knew is that Prineville's natural resources made it perfect for a new industry - the information industry, created to save the massive amounts of information people post on the web.Vitesse wanted to build a big warehouse and fill it with rows and rows of servers - servers that tend to get hot.Central Oregon's cold nights could cool them naturally.Klann remembers the first in-person meeting with Vitesse, and how it felt like Prineville's last chance."Right before I walked into our conference room to meet with their nine lawyers, I got an email and our unemployment rate had peaked at 23%," Klann says."I got that email and I walked into that room, and I kept thinking, 'I better not screw this up.'"Klann and Forrester decided to outperform the other cities Vitesse was considering.They showed the company their small town could move at big-city speed, by responding to Vitesse's questions day and night."What we heard back is that other cities weren't doing that," Forrester says.Their strategy worked, and in 2010, Prineville finally learned who Vitesse actually was."They had the big finger with a thumb-up Facebook sign, and we all pressed the button and it lit up, et cetera," Mayor Betty Roppe says, recounting the new data centre's groundbreaking."That was the big announcement - it was Facebook."It was Facebook's first data centre of its own.Mark Zuckerberg was there, and Roppe had planned to give him a cowboy hat to show the city's pride in its cowboy culture."Cowboy hats are not cheap.They said, 'Do not get Mark Zuckerberg a cowboy hat.He does not want a cowboy hat.'OK.So, I got him a hoodie.He wears hoodies all the time," she says.When she presented the gift, Roppe gave Facebook's founder a kiss on the cheek."He just blushed like he wanted to have the floor open up and swallow him."Image copyright Rupa Shenoy Image caption Mayor Betty Roppe oversaw Prineville's transformation after data centres were built in the city Seven years later, Facebook has two more data centres in Prineville and six others across the world.Apple's moved into Prineville, too - it's built three data centres here.All of them sit high above Prineville's valley, in huge, long, flat buildings painted pale blue and grey so they blend in with the sky.About 500 employees work in the centres, most of them from Prineville.Security's tight, so few other people ever see inside.Despite their low profile, the data centres have had a profound impact.Roppe says the mills taught Prineville a lesson - not to rely on just one industry.So they're putting in things that appeal to lots of employers - like good roads, walking and biking paths, modern wastewater treatment, a new hospital and a state college outpost.But now that the city's successful, officials have a lot more to think about.Like, how do you slow success down?"We can keep the small-town feel.I'm sure of it," Roppe says."We don't want to be a big city."The cost of housing is up, so city officials know they have to build more affordable housing.And Mayor Roppe's own granddaughter, with a college degree, can't find a living wage job.So, they have to keep bringing in new employers.All city manager Forrester can do is calibrate the development carefully.He worries about Prineville changing too much, too."We are small-town people.We live the Western lifestyle," Forrester says."The quiet and peace of central Oregon is a beautiful, beautiful thing, and to be able to make a living here is tremendous."But Forrester says he's seen that central Oregon towns that don't adapt will die.And he knows they have to risk changing Prineville in order to save it.The World is a co-production of the BBC World Service, PRI and WGBH.This piece is part of the series 50 States: America's place in a shrinking world.
How Australia's A$49bn internet network came to be ridiculed:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The rollout of Australia's National Broadband Network has been heavily criticised In 1872, rugged, frontier Australia was lauded for overcoming the tyranny of distance to connect itself to the world via the "bush telegraph", a two-year project stringing 3,200km (2,000 miles) of wire through the outback that became part of the nation's folklore.By contrast today, while striving to be seen as an "innovation nation", Australia stands condemned, even ridiculed, for its latest drive for connectivity: a modern, fast internet network.Three letters - NBN - have come to strike dread into the minds of consumers, with the National Broadband Network symbolising for many a template in how not to do things.Given Australia's large size and sparse population density of three people per square kilometre, the NBN is the country's largest ever infrastructure project.The total budget sits at A$49bn (29bn; $38bn).Of that budget, around 35% must be spent connecting the final 10% of users, including wiring to remote areas, erecting many of the required 2,600 wireless towers and, most expensively, putting two satellites in the sky.This week, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull called the NBN a mistake and a "calamitous train wreck" by a previous Labor government.Former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd hit back by saying the project's issues "lie all on your head" - meaning the current conservative government.The escalating blame game, the NBN's slow roll-out, and a switch to inferior technology midstream have combined with other factors to leave Australians frequently asking the question: Why is our internet so slow?In 2013, Australia ranked 30th for average internet speeds.The NBN was meant to improve that, but the most recent standings ranked Australia 50th.The State of the Internet survey by US internet firm Akamai put Australia - with an average of 11.1 Mbps (megabits per second) - behind countries including Kenya, Hungary and Russia.And while it promotes itself as part of go-ahead Asia, Australia sits only eighth in the region, behind neighbours such as Thailand (21st overall) and New Zealand (27th).Some comparisons are misleading.Only 1.75% of Kenyan homes have fixed-line internet, compared with 90% in Australia.For many, particularly inner-city Australians on the best NBN technology, fixed-line speeds are adequate, particularly if you pay more.But there's no escaping Australia has been overtaken by many countries on the internet table.What's worse is that with many of those connected to the NBN reporting no improvement over old ADSL connections, of the homes equipped to take the new service, only 40% have chosen to do so.In business, and international competitiveness, the fears are perhaps more serious.NBN by the numbers A$49bn The current estimated cost of building the network 2007 The year the project was announced 2020 When the rollout is expected to be completed A$91,196 The cost of connecting one remote property 159% The rise in complaints since last financial year Getty Images "Going lower in ranking is alarming, and just not acceptable," says University of Sydney academic Dr Tooran Alizadeh, who has researched the NBN extensively and, like others, worries Australia's best minds will be lost to countries with better technology."Australia wants to be in the first 10 or so economies in the world.Obviously if you want to do that your internet access cannot be ranked 50th."The history In 2007, Mr Rudd announced 98% of Australian homes would be on the NBN by 2020.It was a breathtakingly ambitious idea.It was also, according to critics, backed by inadequate research into logistics and costs, initially put at A$15bn.The natural starting point was Australia's oldest telecom company, Telstra.Elsewhere, countries like New Zealand simply used the infrastructure already laid by their major telecom company to install fast internet cabling.But Telstra, halfway privatised at the time, clashed with regulators over how it might onsell broadband access to its competitors, and so pulled out of the running to build the network.Eventually, the government announced it would simply start a whole new semi-autonomous company from scratch.Called the NBN, it would set up the infrastructure to connect Australians with state-of-the-art fibre optic cables to their homes, selling bandwidth wholesale to retailers.Progress was slow, sporadic, and expensive.With Australia's preference for underground wiring, often concrete driveways would have to be dug up and relaid.Costs thus blew out for connecting houses from an envisaged average of A$4,400 to, in some cases, more than A$20,000, an NBN spokesman says.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption A rocket carrying the NBN's first satellite is launched into space from French Guiana in 2015 Complaints soon arose over why some regions were connected before others, with schools and hospitals, for example, getting very unequal standards of internet quality.Accusations of government pork-barrelling, however, were wide of the mark."The government just wanted progress, so it became a matter of which places were easiest and quickest to connect," one source with intimate knowledge of the subject told the BBC."Often this came down to issues like basic geology - where was the rock easiest to drill through?"After the conservative government attained power in 2013, the NBN struck more upheaval, with copper wire ordered for the final stretches of connection, surrounding neighbourhood broadband nodes.This presents a slower connection to the twice-as-expensive fibre optics.It also means residents, say 400 metres from the node, will have slower internet than a neighbour a few doors away.Critics also charge it's a false saving, since copper wire needs replacing far earlier than fibre optics.Complaints and competition Then came the NBN's high pricing to retailers, who buy limited supply to pass on to consumers, which leaves so many Australians staring in frustration while buffering or, worse still, service drop-outs occurring each peak hour."NBN has worked hard to bring the cost of bandwidth down but we cannot fill the pipes ourselves - it is up to the retailers to make sure that they are buying enough capacity to deliver a good quality of service," an NBN spokesman told the BBC.Yet another complication is the number of retailers - 180 - making it hard for the NBN to police quality control for end users."We've had huge problems getting our house connected to the footpath node," says Matt Grant, a factory manager in suburban St Clair, just 39km from central Sydney."But when I complained to the retailer, they told me to talk to the NBN.When I talked to the NBN, they sent me back to the retailer."Image copyright Getty Images He was eventually connected, but said "it's no better than we had with ADSL, especially in peak times".Last week, Australia's Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman revealed there had been a 159% increase in NBN-related complaints in the last financial year.NBN chief executive Bill Morrow told the Australian Broadcasting Corp this week that it "turns [his] stomach" that some customers were being left behind, but he placed blame on retailers, and said the government would ultimately decide when to replace copper connections.He also noted increasing competition from mobile broadband technology."Look, it is a competitive environment, but I just want to repeat we are doing everything we can to ensure the NBN delivers a great service," he said.The network says it's still on target to have 98% of homes connected by 2020, but Australia's internet malaise will still take some solving.There's hope of improvement, but not until base prices can come down as the NBN gradually recoups its massive expenditure.And despite the political finger-pointing, Mr Turnbull's government insists the network will be "fit for purpose"."Australia needs a 21st Century broadband network and this is not being delivered," said Laurie Patton, executive director of consumer advocacy group Internet Australia."The way we're heading now, whoever is in office in 2020 will have to deal with our biggest ever national infrastructure debacle."
