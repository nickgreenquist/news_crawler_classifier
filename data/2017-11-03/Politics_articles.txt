Democratic group pulls ad targeting Virginia governor hopeful Ed Gillespie's supporters:::::A television ad depicting supporters of Virginia gubernatorial hopeful Ed Gillespie as Confederates who attack children of color has been pulled in the wake of the terror attack in New York City.The Democratic group Latino Victory Fund removed the controversial ad, which showed a pickup truck driver chasing down children of color on Tuesday, Oct. 31.We knew our ad would ruffle feathers.We held a mirror up to the Republican Party, and they dont like what they see.We have decided to pull our ad at this time, said Cristobal J. Alex, president of the LVF, in a statement on Twitter Tuesday evening.Given recent events, we will be placing other powerful ads into rotation that highlight the reasons we need to elect progressive leaders in Virginia.The statement was released just hours after investigators said the suspected driver, identified as 29-year-old Sayfullo Saipov, plowed a rented pickup truck into a crowd in Lower Manhattan.The incident, being treated as a terror attack, left at least eight dead and at least 11 others injured.The ad was released on Monday and was expected to run through Election Day.Gillespie denounced the ad Tuesday morning in an interview with Fox & Friends.This attack is not just an attack on my supporters, its an attack on all Virginians.The fact is, whether you disagree with people or not, in Virginia, we respect civil discourse and this is a new low in politics here.Its a sad day, Gillespie said.In a statement to Fox News, Gillespies campaign manager called the ad a desperate smear campaign.
Government says teen's lawyers misled them in abortion case:::::WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration on Friday accused lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union of misleading the administration in the case of a pregnant immigrant teen who sought and obtained an abortion following a lawsuit.Justice Department lawyers said the teen's abortion was moved up without their knowledge and before they could ask the Supreme Court to review the case.The department said in a statement Friday that "discipline" may be appropriate against the teen's attorneys.The administration is now asking the Supreme Court to vacate a lower court ruling in the teen's favor.The 17-year-old had an abortion Oct. 25 after the full U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled in her favor.The Justice Department says its attorneys were told that the procedure would occur Oct. 26.The teen was in government custody after illegally entering the U.S. in September.She was taken to a government facility for unaccompanied minors in South Texas where she learned she was pregnant.She obtained a state court order on Sept. 25 permitting an abortion.But federal officials refused to transport her or temporarily release her so that others could take her for the procedure.The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees facilities for unaccompanied minors who enter the United States illegally, argued it had established a policy of "refusing to facilitate" abortions for people in its care.The American Civil Liberties Union sued the government on the teen's behalf.
White House lockdown lifted:::::WASHINGTON -- A lockdown at the White House has been lifted and one person is in custody Friday morning after reports of "suspicious activity" along the North fence line of the 18-acre complex.The U.S. Secret Service tweeted: "Subject is in custody."Pennsylvania Ave. and Lafayette Park are also closed to pedestrians near the White House.Reporters and staffers were instructed not to leave the White House while the investigation is ongoing, but are now being allowed to exit.The incident came just minutes after President Donald Trump departed the White House on Marine One to begin his trip to Asia.A Secret Service spokesperson is not immediately responding to a request for additional information.
Children's health funds near House OK, but obstacles remain:::::WASHINGTON-- Legislation providing five more years of financing for an expired children's health program moved near House passage on Friday.But a partisan battle over paying for the extension seems certain to delay the bill in the Senate and has each party accusing the other of jeopardizing a program that serves more than 8 million low-income children.Fresh federal money for the health insurance program stopped on Oct. 1.States are continuing to use unspent funds, but Arizona, California, Minnesota, Ohio, Oregon and the District of Columbia are expected to deplete that money by late December or early January.Republicans want to pay for the extension in part by cutting a public health program created under President Barack Obama's health care law and raising Medicare premiums on upper-income recipients.They say it makes sense to trim some health programs to beef up others and said wealthy Medicare recipients could easily afford higher premiums.Democrats oppose both.They say cutting the public health program would reduce money for providing vaccines and opioid abuse efforts, and charging top earners more for Medicare would prompt many of them to drop their coverage.They say that would undermine Medicare finances and erode political support for it."Delay, delay, delay," said House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Greg Walden, R-Ore., chief author of the bill, about Democrats' opposition."And vote against kids, vote against their hospitals and vote against their doctors."Rep. Frank Pallone of New Jersey, the committee's top Democrat, said Republicans were using the children's health bill to try damaging Obama's health care overhaul and were ensuring a stalemate by sending the measure to the Senate.Senators have agreed on a bill extending the program's money for five more years but remain divided over how to pay for it."It will go to the Senate, and it will sit there," Pallone said."This bill is going nowhere.They know it."An eventual deal on extended financing for the children's health care program is expected to be part of in a huge year-end spending bill aimed at preventing a federal shutdown.That measure seems likely to become home for a host of compromises.
Trump embarks on 13-day foreign trip to Asia:::::President Trump embarked on a 13-day trip Friday, with the first stop in Hawaii, ahead of his visit to five major Asian countries in his longest overseas trip to date amid the escalating North Korea threat.The president and first lady departed the White House Friday morning, stopping to chat with reporters on their way to Air Force One.We are about to begin a long trip, Trump said, noting that the White House had extended the trip, and added an extra day in the Philippines.We have a big conference, a second conference.And I think were

said.But I think were going to have a very successful trip.There is a lot of good will.According to administration officials, the presidents trip will be the longest trip to Asia by a president since 1991, when President George H.W.Bush was in office.The president's trip comes amid the first charges in special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian meddling and potential collusion with Trump campaign associates during the 2016 presidential election.Trump said again Friday before boarding Air Force One that there was "no collusion."Minutes after take-off, the president tweeted details of his trip."Just took off for ceremony @ Pearl Harbor.Will then be heading to Japan, SKorea, China, Vietnam & the Philippines.Will never let you down!"Trump said.The presidents first stop, before heading overseas, is in Hawaii, where he will meet with U.S. Pacific Command, and visit Pearl Harbor and the Pearl Harbor memorial.By Sunday, the president will be in Japan, where he is slated to meet with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe for meetings.As they did at Mar-A-Lago, Trump and Abe will play a round of golf at a country club in Japanthis time, joined by the worlds No.4 golfer, Hideki Matsuyama.Trumps visit in Japan, according to the White House, will include meetings with service members and bilateral meetings.The president is also expected to meet with families of Japanese citizens abducted by Kim Jong Uns rogue regime.Trump and Abe spoke earlier this week, and affirmed the important of promoting a free and open Indo-Pacific region, and maintaining close coordination between the United States and Japan, and with the international community to maximize pressure on North Korea.The presidents next stop will be South Korea, where he will have a bilateral meeting with South Korean President Moon Jae-in.Trump will meet with service members, and also is slated for a speech at the National Assembly in Seoul.A senior administration official told reporters during a White House background briefing this week that there was not enough time in the presidents schedule to accommodate a trip to the Demilitarized Zone, which has separated North Korea and South Korea for 64 years.Instead of the DMZ, Trump will visit military base Camp Humphreys, which is set 40 miles south of Seoul, to highlight the U.S.-South Korean partnership.The presidents trip to South Korea comes amid escalating tensions and rhetoric between the U.S. and North Korea.Trump said in his United Nations speech in September that he would totally destroy the rogue nation, if necessary.He also has continually dubbed North Korean leader Kim Jong Un as little Rocket Man.Trumps next stop is China, an important visit that will draw much attention amid the presidents expected requests for Chinese President Xi Jinping.Trump is expected to ask Xi, whom he hosted at Mar-A-Lago earlier this year, to impose limits on oil exports and coal imports with North Korea, as well as broader limits on financial transactions with the regime, Reuters reported.China is responsible for more than 90 percent of all trade with North Korea.Melania and I look forward to being with President Xi & Madame Peng Liyuan in China in two weeks for what will hopefully be a historic trip!Trump tweeted last month.Trumps next stop is Vietnam, where he will take part in Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)

with President Rodrigo Duterte, who has been accused of human rights abuses, including killing suspected drug dealers.The White House has said that Trump could raise concerns with the program, though Duterte and Trump shared a warm rapport during a phone conversation.While in the Philippines, the president will also attend the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) 50th anniversary dinner.ASEAN consists of ten members: Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.Trump will celebrate the 40th anniversary of U.S.-ASEAN relations at the U.S.-ASEAN Summit and participate in bilateral meetings with Duterte and other leaders.The presidents trip will focus on three goals, National Security Adviser H.R.McMaster told reporters at the White House press briefing Thursday.First, strengthening international resolve to denuclearize North Korea.Second, promote a free and open Indo-Pacific region.Third, advance American prosperity through fair and reciprocal trade and economic practices.McMaster added that the president would reiterate the plain fact that North Korea is a threat to the entire world, also promising that Trump would continue to call on all responsible nations to isolate the North Korean regime economically and politically.Fox News' Serafin Gomez and The Associated Press contributed to this

Senate Dems demand Sessions clarify testimony on Russia:::::Senate Democrats want Attorney General Jeff Sessions to testify before Congress about why he failed to disclose a March 2016 meeting with then-candidate Donald Trump and members of his campaign team in which an adviser allegedly offered to set up a meeting between the president and Vladimir Putin.Sessions' attendance at the meeting was revealed in court documents released Monday by special prosecutor Robert Mueller.The documents seem to show George Papadopoulos was the adviser who offered to set up the meeting.Papadopoulos pleaded guilty this week to lying to federal investigators.Sessions has been quiet on his involvement at the session, despite being asked about it multiple times during several appearances on Capitol Hill.A source familiar with the meeting told Fox News that it seems clear that the people who remember the conversation believed that Papadopoulos was proposing a prospective idea of using his Russian contacts to try to set up a meeting between Trump and Putin, which was immediately rejected by then-Senator Sessions.The source added, At the time, of course, Papadopoulos was some 29-year old that nobody had ever heard of and who struck people in the room as someone who didnt have a lot of credibility.As far as Sessions seemed to be concerned, when he shut down this idea of Papadopoulos engaging with Russia, that was the end of it and he moved the meeting along to other issues."The same documents that disclosed the meeting show Papadopoulos has pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his contact with Russians during the 2016 campaign.Sessions has been dogged over his testimony before Congress about interactions with Russians during the 2016 presidential campaign.During his confirmation hearing in January, Sessions told Sen. Al Franken, D-Minn., that he had no communications with Russian officials during the campaign.It was subsequently revealed that he had conversations with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak.Under pressure, Sessions later recused himself from the Department of Justice investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.Last month he reiterated he did not know of any Trump campaign official having contact with Russian officials a claim Senate Democrats are pushing back on.He needs to clarify his testimony before our committee, Judiciary Committee member Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., told The Chicago Tribune.There were questions that elicited exactly the kind of information that the Papadopoulos plea agreement made.
North Korea's nuclear weapons program has grown with each Kim regime:::::On Friday, North Korea's state media denounced a recent U.S. bombing exercise over the Korean Peninsula as a "surprise nuclear strike drill."The country's state media also said that the "gangster-like U.S. imperialists" are seeking to ignite a nuclear war.B-1B bombers based in Guam were escorted by two South Korean F-16 fighter jets during the drills Thursday at a field near the South's eastern coast.The drills simulated attacks on land targets, but didn't involve live weapons, a South Korean military official said.North Korea's response to the exercises comes after U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis recently warned that the threat of nuclear missile attack by North Korea is accelerating."North Korea has accelerated the threat that it poses to its neighbors and the world through its illegal and unnecessary missile and nuclear weapons programs," he said in October, adding that U.S.-South Korean military and diplomatic collaboration thus has taken on "a new urgency.""I cannot imagine a condition under which the United States would accept North Korea as a nuclear power," Mattis said.Mattis made his remarks in Seoul alongside South Korean Defense Minister Song Young-moo.He pledged that the U.S. would repel any strike, adding that North Korea is overmatched by the firepower and cohesiveness of the decades-old U.S.-South Korean alliance.However, he also said that diplomacy is still the preferred way to deal with the North.Prior to Mattis' comments, Japanese Defense Minister Itsunori Onodera said North Koreas threat of nuclear war is now at an unprecedented level.North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump have engaged in a war of words that has only escalated over the past few months.Trump has nicknamed Kim Rocket Man; the North Korean leader has called Trump deranged.The U.S. and its allies are on alert since North Korea tested intercontinental missiles in the Pacific near Japan and Guam, a highly strategic U.S. territory.Pyongyang conducted its longest-ever ballistic missile test flight last month.And North Korea has previously warned other countries that participating in military actions with the U.S. could result in retaliation, especially as a nuclear war may break any moment.Unless the hostile policy and the nuclear threat of the U.S. is thoroughly eradicated, we will never put our nuclear weapons and ballistic rockets on the negotiation table under any circumstance, North Korea ambassador Kim In Ryong reportedly told a United Nations disarmament committee.Since Kim took over North Korea in 2011, it has rapidly expanded and tested its missile arsenal with weapons capable of striking the U.S. mainland.His end goal, he has reportedly said, is to "establish the equilibrium of real force with the U.S. and make the U.S. rulers dare not talk about military options for the North.Read on for a brief look at how North Koreas nuclear weapons program has grown throughout the regimes in the past century.Kim Il Sung, leader from 1948-1994 Kim Il Sung can be credited with founding North Korea and propelling the nations nuclear program forward but he did not live to see his country conduct its first nuclear test.It was under the first Kim that North Korea began to build up its nuclear reactors.And it was under his leadership that the nation began the Korean War surely a catalyst that led the leader to believe his nation needed nuclear weapons, Dr. Sung-Yoon Lee, the Kim Koo-Korea Foundation Professor of Korean Studies at the Fletcher School at Tufts University, told Fox News in an interview.TRUMPS COMMENTS ON NORTH KOREA, FROM FIRE AND FURY TO BLAMING CHINA The seeds of nuclear aspirations were sown in the Korean War, Lee said.The Korean War pitted North Korea and its ally China two nations that did not have nuclear capabilities at the time against a nuclear-armed U.S., making it clear to the first Kim that nuclear weapons are very powerful, a powerful deterrent, Lee said.Kim Jong Il, leader from 1994-2011 When the second leader of the Kim dynasty died in 2011, Kim Jong Il was remembered as the dictator who turned North Korea into a nuclear state, in his New York Times obituary.And its Kim Jong Il that really gets the credit of taking the country down the nuclear path," Lee said.In the beginning of his reign he was North Koreas supreme leader from 1994 to 2011 North Korea denied that it had a nuclear weapons program.JAPAN WARNS NORTH KOREA NUCLEAR THREAT AT UNPRECEDENTED, CRITICAL LEVEL However, in 2003, Pyongyang announced that North Korea was withdrawing from the 1968 Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, which barred the nation from making nuclear weapons.By 2005, North Korea confirmed that it had its own nuclear weapons.It tested its first nuclear device in 2006.Kim Jong Un, leader from 2011-present Kim Jong Un is credited with accelerating North Koreas push for nuclear weapons, and under the Obama administration, many of the worlds attitudes toward the East Asian nations nuclear capabilities became less blas than in the past, Lee said.And Kim Jong Un recently crossed a major threshold for his country this summer the ability to credibly threaten the U.S. with an intercontinental ballistic missile.NORTH KOREA CELEBRATES NUCLEAR TESTS North Korea last month successfully tested its longest-ever flight of a ballistic missile.The intermediate-range weapon traveled 3,700 miles and passed over Japan before it landed in the Pacific.Earlier this month, the country also tested its most powerful nuclear test to date.Defense Secretary Jim Mattis condemned the test and said it caused millions of Japanese to duck and cover.Mattis also said the U.S. and Japan are ready for potential future missile threats.After the missile test, Kim Jong Un said North Korea is nearing equilibrium with the U.S. in terms of its military force.The increasingly frequent and aggressive tests have added to outside fears that North Korea is closer than ever to building a military arsenal that could viably target the mainland of the U.S. or its allies in Asia.Trump called Kim Jong Un Rocket Man in his speech to the U.N. last month and said the dictator is on a suicide mission for himself and for his regime.The United States has great strength and patience, Trump said.But if it is forced to defend itself or its allies, we will have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea.Fox News' Madeline Farber and The Associated Press contributed to this report.
Ivanka's girl squad: All-female security team guards first daughter as Ivanka-mania takes over Japan:::::Taylor Swift has her girl squad and now it appears so does Ivanka Trump.Well, at least in Japan.When the first daughter arrived in Japan on Thursday, she was greeted by dozens of black suit-wearing female bodyguards from Tokyos Metropolitan Police Department.The all-female security team was deployed to protect Trump from the thousands of adoring fans she has in the Asian nation, but it seemed their usual body armor and riot gear was not fitting attire to guard Ivanka.We opted for a more cultivated look to suit the occasion," an officer in charge of the security plan told Japans Asahi Shimbun.Ivanka has become something of a fashion and feminist icon in Japan since her fathers election to the presidency last November.In Japan, the eldest Trump daughter is seen as an aspirational figure for women whose careers get sidelined after having children.Enjoying my first visit to Japan with a traditional Kaiseki meal in Tokyo.Thank you to our hosts for their warm hospitality A post shared by Ivanka Trump (@ivankatrump) on Nov 2, 2017 at 5:50am PDT Women have to work more than twice as much to compete against men, but she has led her fathers business successfully while raising kids, one women told The Japan Times in January.With all the attention being lavished on Ivanka at least four television stations in Japan live-broadcast her arrival at Tokyos airport the security team is there for more than just looks.During a training drill for the media earlier this week, the security team quickly pounced on a woman who broke free from a crowd near the Imperial Palace Gardens in central Tokyo in a mock attempt to bring a present to a certain VIP.Ivanka is in Japan to speak at the World Assembly for Women conference in Tokyo in advance of her father's arrival Sunday.An unforgettable last night in Tokyo!Thank you Prime Minister Abe for the warm hospitality and the belated birthday wishes A post shared by Ivanka Trump (@ivankatrump) on Nov 3, 2017 at 6:15am PDT Speaking Friday, Ivanka addressed her trademark issues of female entrepreneurship and womens economic advancement, while also praising Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abes Womenomics agenda that aims to get more women in the workplace.The U.S. president's daughter also addressed the issue of sexual harassment of women in Hollywood and other industries in the United States."All too often, our workplace culture fails to treat women with appropriate respect," she said."This takes many forms, including harassment, which can never be tolerated.While the policies of President Trump who left Friday on his own trip to Asia have made Ivankas fashion line one of the most negatively perceived brands in the U.S. (a recent YouGov survey ranked it one of the bottom 10 brands in the U.S. by consumer perception out of 1,600 companies), there is a much different perception of her in Japan, China and other Asian nations.Sales of her fashion line have skyrocketed in Japan and China over the last year and dozens of Chinese businesses have filed for trademarks to use Ivankas name to sell everything from wallpaper to alcohol."Many people think shes like a princess," Lully Miura, a political scientist at the University of Tokyo, told the Washington Post."Shes well educated, beautiful, sophisticated and rich.And its very surprising to Japanese women that she can also talk about things that are important to society."
Trump vs. Clinton: The feud continues even after the election:::::Its been 345 days since the presidential election, but even still, President Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton havent stopped their bickering.Once friends Clinton was even a guest at Trumps third wedding in 2005 the two New Yorkers havent left their squabbling behind in what was a volatile campaign season.Heres a look at the jabs Clinton and Trump have taken at one another since Nov. 8, 2016.Nov. 27, 2016: 19 days since the election Trump claimed that Clinton won the popular vote by nearly 3 million people because millions of people voted illegally.In addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide, I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally, Trump, then the president-elect, tweeted.Dec. 21, 2016: 43 days since the election Trump took to Twitter in the morning to deride Clinton for focusing on the wrong states during her campaign.Campaigning to win the Electoral College is much more difficult & sophisticated than the popular vote, Trump said on Twitter.Hillary focused on the wrong states!Dec. 23, 2016: 45 days since the election By this point, Trump has mentioned Clinton in his tweets quite often but he usually mocked the media and celebrities who he said tried to help the Democratic candidate.Yet, on Dec. 23, Trump quoted Russian President Vladimir Putin to express his opinion on his former opponent.Vladimir Putin said today about Hillary and Dems: In my opinion, it is humiliating.One must be able to lose with dignity.So true!Trump tweeted.Clinton, along with other Trump critics, have alleged that the president and his campaign colluded with the Russians to win the election.Trump later tweeted in February that the Russian connection non-sense is just an attempt to cover-up the many mistakes made in Hillary Clintons losing campaign.March 29, 2017: 141 days since the election In one of her first public speeches since she lost the election, Clinton excoriated the Trump administration without actually using Trumps name.She also blasted the current administration and Congress for not including enough women.Of Trumps policies, Clinton encouraged

Trump is seemingly still competing with Clinton for the popular vote.New polls out today are very good considering that much of the media is FAKE and almost always negative, Trump tweeted.Would still beat Hillary in popular vote.Trump then cited an ABC News/Washington Post poll that he said showed almost all stand by their vote for Trump.May 2, 2017: 175 days since the election Clinton took a jab at Trump during a television interview as he has continuously focused on his loss of the popular vote in the election.He should worry less about the election and me winning the popular vote and more about other things, the former secretary of state said.Remember, I did win more than 3 million votes than my opponent, Clinton added.She also said that shes now a private citizen and part of the resistance.May 3, 2017: 176 days since the election Focusing on national security threats from North Korea, Clinton criticized Trump for his penchant for tweeting."If [Trump] wants to tweet about me I'm happy to be the diversion because we've got lots of other things to worry about.And he should worry less about the election, and my winning the popular vote, than doing some other things that would be important to the country," Clinton said at an event in New York City.May 24, 2017: 197 days since the election Clinton harshly condemned Trumps proposed budget plan after she was honored by the Childrens Health Fund, a nonprofit in New York City.Clinton said Republican lawmakers are mounting an onslaught against the needs of children and people with disabilities, women and seniors.The budget shows an unimaginable level of cruelty and lack of imagination and disdain for the struggles of millions of Americans, including millions of children, she said.None of us can remain silent in the face of these attacks."It hurts the well-being of children," Clinton continued."It's time to send a resounding message that we will not stand for this attack on the most vulnerable among us."May 26, 2017: 199 days since the election Clinton didnt miss an opportunity to criticize the president while she delivered the commencement address at Wellesley College in Massachusetts.When people in power invent their own facts and attack those who question them, it can mark the beginning of the end of a free society, Clinton said.That is not hyperbole; it is what authoritarian regimes throughout history have done They attempt to control reality.Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel responded to Clintons address by stating her remarks were a stark reminder why [she] lost in 2016.May 31, 2017: 204 days since the election After Clinton placed the blame of her presidential loss on a variety of reasons misogyny, Facebook and the Democratic National Committee, to name a few

houses shouldnt throw covfefe, she said.This time, Trumps son also got in on the Twitter war.What house is he in again???Thats what I thought.Youre trying too hard, Donald Trump Jr. tweeted Wednesday night.The presidents tweet received more than 23,000 retweets; Clintons received more than 236,000.July 10: 244 days since the election As Trump came under fire for allowing his daughter, Ivanka, to sit in his place during a meeting at the G-20 summit, the president attempted to turn the tables on Clintons own daughter.In a tweet Monday morning, Trump alleged that if Clinton would have let daughter Chelsea Clinton sit in for her, the media would have heralded the decision.If Chelsea Clinton were asked to hold the seat for her mother, as her mother gave our country away, the Fake News would say CHELSEA FOR PRES!Trump tweeted.Chelsea Clinton got in on the feud and responded on social media.Good morning Mr. President.It would never have occurred to my mother or my father to ask me.Were you giving our country away?Hoping not, she tweeted.July 12: 247 days since the election Trump took to Twitter to rail on the alleged double standards for Democrats.Why arent the same standards placed on the Democrats, Trump tweeted.Look what Hillary Clinton may have gotten away with.Disgraceful!July 16: 250 days since the election As Trumps son is criticized for meeting with a Russian lawyer who was supposed to have damaging information about Clinton during the presidential campaign, Trump defended his son on social media while still criticizing his former opponent.Hillary Clinton can illegally get the questions to the Debate & delete 33,000 emails but my son Don is being scorned by the Fake News Media?Trump tweeted.Former CNN commentator and interim Democratic National Committee chairwoman Donna Brazile admitted in March 2017 to sharing debate questions with the Clinton campaign ahead of the primary town hall event.July 22: 256 days since the election Trump asked on Twitter why a special counsel or the attorney general isnt investigating more alleged crimes committed by former F.B.I.Director James Comey and Clinton.In his tweet, Trump referenced the emails deleted from Clintons private server she used during her tenure as secretary of state.In an additional tweet, Trump again compared his sons publishing of emails pertaining to a meeting with a Russian lawyer to Clintons own handling of her email server.July 24: 258 days since the election Trump addressed approximately 40,000 people in West Virginia for the annual Boy Scout Jamboree and couldnt resist taking a few jabs at Clinton.He told the crowd that the reason he won Michigan was because he worked hard there unlike Clinton.You know, my opponent didnt work hard there because she was told she was going to win Michigan, Trump said.Trump also repeated his questions about the investigation into possible collusion between the Russian government and his campaign during the presidential election continues.So why arent the Committees and investigators, and of course our beleaguered [Attorney General Jeff Sessions], looking into Crooked Hillarys [sic] crimes & Russia relations?Trump tweeted.July 25: 259 days since the election Trump called into question the ability of his attorney general and the current F.B.I.chief to investigate Clinton.The president said Sessions has taken a very weak position on her alleged crimes this time linking her to the Democratic National Committees server as well.As for acting F.B.I.director Andrew McCabe, Trump said that his wife, who ran for a Virginia state senate seat last year, received $700,000 in campaign donations from Clinton.However, McCabes wife actually received $467,500 from a political action committee controlled by Gov.Terry McAuliffe, D-Va., a longtime Clinton ally.Dr. Jill McCabe received an additional $292,500 from another Democratic PAC.Sept. 13: 309 days since the election As Clinton begins her book tour across the country, promoting her memoir of the 2016 election called What Happened, Trump dusted off his favorite campaign nickname for her.Crooked Hillary Clinton blames everybody (and every thing [sic]) but herself for her election loss.She lost the debates and lost her direction!Trump tweeted late Wednesday night.The deplorables came back to haunt Hillary.They expressed their feelings loud and clear, he continued in another tweet.She spent big money but, in the end, had no game!While Clinton apologized for calling Trump supporters deplorable at the time, she defended her use of the word earlier this month in an interview with CBS News.I thought Trump was behaving in a deplorable manner.I thought a lot of his appeals to voters were deplorable.I thought his behavior, as we saw on the Access Hollywood tape was deplorable.And there were a large number of people who didnt care.It did not matter to them, Clinton said.As the Daily Caller noted, the deplorable comment came almost a full month before the Access Hollywood tape was released.Sept. 21: 317 days since the election When Trump met with South Korean President Moon Jae-in, the Asian leader used a word that Trump liked to hear deplorable.Using a translator, Moon said North Koreas actions were deplorable.I am very happy that you used the word 'deplorable,' Trump said.I was very interested in that word.Its been a very lucky word for me and many millions of people, he continued.In Clintons new memoir about the presidential election, she blamed her use of the word deplorables to describe Trumps supporters, in part, for her loss.Oct. 13: 339 days since the election While discussing the multiple sexual assault and harassment allegations against movie mogul Harvey Weinstein, Clinton said there is someone admitting to being a sexual assaulter in the Oval Office.Clinton was most likely referring to the infamous Access Hollywood tape from 2005 that caught Trump bragging that he could do anything to a woman because of his status.He also said he could grab them by the p----.Trump later apologized for his comments and chalked them up to locker room talk.The really sad part of the campaign was how this horrific tape, what he said about women in the past, what he said about women during the campaign, was discounted by a lot of voters, Clinton told BBC.Oct. 16: 342 days since the election Trump said he would like to see "Crooked Hillary Clinton" challenge him in 2020."I was recently asked if Crooked Hillary Clinton is going to run in 2020," Trump tweeted."My answer was: 'I hope so!'"Trump later reiterated his desire for Clinton to run during a press briefing in the Rose Garden.He also criticized her for sticking up for professional athletes who have chosen to kneel during the national anthem in a sign of protest.Oct. 18: 344 days since the election In response to the revelation that Comey drafted a statement about the Clinton email investigation months before the probe was completed or he even interviewed her, Trump blasted both the former F.B.I.director and Clinton on Twitter.As it turned out, James Comey lied and leaked and totally protected Hillary Clinton.He was the best thing that ever happened to her, Trump said in one tweet.He also implied that the letter Comey wrote exonerating Crooked Hillary Clinton prior to the investigations completion was obviously a fix.Oct. 19: 345 days since the election Trump used news about a controversial 2010 uranium deal made under the Obama administration to blast the media using Clinton to do so.Uranium deal to Russia, with Clinton help and

Lawmakers look for quick exit in jam-packed week:::::Wanna get away?No.This isnt a Southwest Airlines advertisement where a man mistakenly climbs into an Uber which turns out to be the getaway car for a pair of bank robbers.Its Capitol Hill.And apparently, a lot of people would love to unearth a hidden off-ramp away from the building with the big white dome perched on top.Senate Republicans scheduled a Monday afternoon press conference about the religious views of President Trumps judicial nominees.This was on the books long before the indictments of former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort and his business partner Rick Gates.Nine GOP senators piled into the Lyndon Baines Johnson Room at the Capitol Monday afternoon to stand behind a lectern and in front of a row of flags.A few reporters came to ask about the nomination of Amy Coney Barrett for the federal bench and her Catholic faith.But most scribes wanted to hear what senators made of the criminal charges.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R- KY, launched the press conference.But after yielding to his colleagues for their remarks, the Kentucky Republican beat an exit to the doorway.Senate Judiciary Committee Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, began plotting an escape route early as well.A set of tall, mahogany double doors loomed directly behind the senators, though blocked by an array of four American flags.As other senators spoke, Grassley methodically reached behind the banners.He tinkered with the doorknobs to determine if they were unlocked.They were.But Grassley didnt try to exit then.The Iowa Republican patiently stood beside Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, and dutifully listened to the remarks of his colleagues.They continued.Grassley discreetly checked the doors two more times.Anybody have any questions for Sen. Grassley or anybody else up here on this topic?inquired Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn, R-Texas.I have a question about a different Catholic named Paul Manafort, said a reporter in the back, dispatching the room into howls of laughter.Thats why I said this topic, responded Cornyn.Another reporter asked a question on faith and public service.Then CBSs Nancy Cordes posed her interrogative.Former campaign manager Paul Manafort was indicted today, began Cordes.Cornyn interrupted.And thats not really not our job.Thats not our wheelhouse, said Cornyn.A portable, Tungsten TV camera light with a crew in the back then accidentally dimmed.Its unknown if Grassley saw the cover of darkness as an advantage to execute his great escape.But Grassley made his move as soon as Cordes said Manafort.Grassley swung open the back door, jostling three of the flags.Two of the flags nearly tipped over on Cornyn.The TV light came back up as the press corps shouted a cacophony of questions at Grassley.The door slammed behind the senator.If you would all hold on just a second, implored Cornyn, trying to restore order.Grassleys departure meant it was up to Cornyn to field questions from a ravenous press corps.Speaking of someone who wanted to get away.Will the indictments interfere with tax reform?The short answer is no, fumed Cornyn.When the press conference broke, a scrum of reporters bee-lined for Hatch.The Senates President Pro Tempore left the room via Grassleys egress but lacking the same stealth.Hatch may hold seniority over Grassley in the Senate.But Grassleys Houdini skills upstage those belonging to Hatch.The reporters wanted to know what the Senates most-senior Republican thought about Manafort.Im having a rough time seeing why in the world he indicted, said Hatch about Manafort.I think its an overreach.Not 30 minutes later, Hatchs office blasted around a statement which flew in the face of what the Utah Republican said in the hall.These are serious charges and I believe that its in the best interest for all parties to allow (Special Counsel) Bob Mueller to conduct a full and vigorous investigation, read Hatchs statement.The Special Counsel needs the time and support necessary to get to the bottom of things.Perhaps Hatch wished he had ducked out prematurely, too.It was reporters who wanted to escape the Capitol on Tuesday night.Word came around 7 pm that House Republicans were postponing their ballyhooed Wednesday rollout of the tax reform bill.GOP members of the House Ways and Means Committee huddled in a Capitol enclave belonging to Committee Chairman Kevin Brady, R- Texas, for more than two hours.What would Brady say?Why the holdup?What went wrong?Naturally, Brady probably wanted to skedaddle too.His beloved Houston Astros were about to face the Los Angeles Dodgers in game six of the World Series.During an earlier session with the press, Brady assured reporters the bill was on target for a Wednesday release.He also prognosticated the Astros would capture their first World Series title later that night.As it turns out, Brady was wrong on both counts by a day.The Ways and Means Committee rolled out the legislation Thursday instead of Wednesday.And the Astros finally defeated the Dodgers in a decisive game seven Wednesday instead of Tuesday.But confusion reigned Tuesday night.Rep. Sam Johnson, R-Texas, emerged as the first Ways and Means member out of the room.Who are all of these people?Johnson asked an aide about the cadre of reporters camping outside the Ways and Means office.Still, Johnson didnt reply to any questions as he boarded his motorized scooter and zipped away down the Capitol corridor.Reps. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., George Holding, R-N.C., and Kenny Marchant, R-Texas, were next.They too fled as reporters peppered them with questions about the status of the bill.Talk to the chairman, hollered one, over their shoulder.When Brady finally emerged a little after nine, he indicated that the bill was on schedule.But 45 minutes later, Bradys office announced they shelved the plan for a day.While the House wrestled with tax reform, Mitch McConnell was still trying to confirm judges this week.Around the time of Mondays press conference, there was concern the Senate may be in session around the clock and into Friday, whittling through a slate of circuit court nominations.In recent years, senators loathe late-night or Friday sessions.Some whispered that dilatory tactics could delay the confirmations until next week.But then again, this was Capitol Hill and everyone wanted to get away.By mid-afternoon Thursday, the Senate completed the slate of circuit court nominees with a final confirmation vote.Not surprisingly, senators sprinted for the exits.
Trump's Fed pick Powell will continue Yellen's path 'unless he's crazy,' says ex-Fed vice chair:::::Jerome Powell, if confirmed by the Senate to be the next Federal Reserve chairman, will likely follow the path his predecessor has set, former Fed Vice Chairman Alan Blinder said Friday."Janet Yellen already and before she leaves has set the course both for interest rates and for the diminution of the size of the balance sheet," said Blinder, now an economist at Princeton."Jay Powell, unless he's crazy, and he's not, is just going to continue going down that path," Blinder added in an interview on CNBC's "Squawk on the Street."President Donald Trump on Thursday nominated Powell, a Fed governor and a former investment banker, to lead the central bank after Yellen's term expires in February.Powell has worked alongside Yellen for the past five years, backing her direction on monetary policy.When asked whether Powell would have a tougher or easier job than Yellen, Blinder said in the near term it is "going to be exactly the same.It's business as usual.""The economy seems to be on a pretty steady track," Blinder said."Not what the 'Trumpies' would like it to be, but a good pace of growth, including the pace of job growth and no signs of an acceleration of inflation."He spoke after the Labor Department said Friday that the economy added 261,000 jobs in October, a pickup from September, and the unemployment rate dropped to 4.1 percent.Also on "Squawk on the Street" was Jan Hatzius, chief economist at Goldman Sachs, who said he expects the new Fed won't be "dramatically different," even if Trump makes additional appointments."I wouldn't expect a major change," Hatzius said."I think Jay Powell as chairman is not going to be dramatically different.""This is a large committee.Decisions are made on a committee basis," he added.
Profit outlook for defense contractors may improve in next few months, analyst says:::::Earnings guidance for defense contractors could go higher if the Senate's $700 billion defense policy bill prevails, according to an industry analyst.A House-Senate conference committee is still working out differences over the fiscal 2018 National Defense Authorization Act, and it appears it may be close to finalizing a deal.Besides authorizing spending for everything from the F-35 fighter to warships, issues include the House bill to create a new so-called Space Corps.Sen. John McCain, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee and one of the conferees, told reporters last week before the meeting he was "confident" they could complete talks within a "few days.""Congress is very supportive of increasing defense spending, especially among Republicans, and increasing force structure [or troop strength]," said Roman Schweizer, a Washington-based defense analyst at Cowen."But on the other hand, there's some real immediate concerns about operations and maintenance, repairing existing systems, and also refilling munitions inventories that have been expended over the last several years."In September, the Senate passed a roughly $700 billion authorization, which includes a base budget of $640 billion for national defense programs and $60 billion for the so-called Overseas Contingency Operations war funding.The House passed a companion bill in July, authorizing $621.5 billion in defense spending plus nearly $75 billion for the overseas contingency fund.The two bills authorize more money for national defense than President Donald Trump's budget request."There seems to be a general recognition here that readiness is suffering, that we have a number of programs suffering, we have a lot of obsolete equipment, etc.," said Richard Safran, a defense industry analyst at Buckingham Research in New York."There's just tacit recognition in the House and Senate that action needs to be taken sooner rather than later."Safran said one of the things that came out of the third-quarter results for defense contractors was "a fairly soft" guidance for next year's financial results.He said a key reason for that was the outlook for many defense companies like Lockheed Martin was based on the president's defense budget request.The analyst said earnings outlook for defense companies may trend upward, assuming the conference committee authorizes a defense budget closer to the Senate version with much higher defense spending than the White House sought."There's upside to defense company guides for 2018," Safran said."If that's the case, you could start to see upward revisions starting in January."Yet both versions of the defense bill are higher than the sequestration cap of $549 billion in defense spending authority set into place by the 2011 Budget Control Act.To amend those limits, it will take at least 60 votes in the GOP-controlled Senate, or support from every Republican and eight Democratic senators."In order to get that level of increased spending, you're to need a bipartisan deal and that has really still yet to take shape," said Schweizer.Meantime, the Senate's version authorizes more spending on total aircraft for the Navy and Air Force than the House's bill, and both versions are above the White House's request.The House version also increases the size of the Army by authorizing an additional 10,000 troops plus thousands more to the Army National Guard and Army Reserve.One of the aircraft beneficiaries could be the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program.The Senate authorizes $10.76 billion for procuring 94 of the stealth fighters, or about $3.1 billion and 24 aircraft more than the administration's request.The fleet has around 250 F-35 stealth fighter aircraft, and the Pentagon has plans to ultimately have around 2,400.Lockheed Martin is the prime contractor, and Northrop Grumman is the top subcontractor.The Senate version also has more F/A-18 Super Hornets and P-8A Poseidon aircraft than what was requested by the administration.Both are manufactured by Boeing.As for the Navy, the Senate authorizes more money to shipbuilding than the House bill and is above the White House's request.The Senate bill would fund 13 ships for $25 billion.The Space Corps is not in the Senate bill, and the Air Force opposes the idea.The Senate's version goes in a different direction on space, creating a new chief information warfare officer that falls under the secretary of Defense and gives that person responsibility for space and cyber."My bet would be they come up with a compromise somewhere in between and is different than those two ideas," said Todd Harrison, director of defense budget analysis at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank.Besides creating a sixth military branch, the head of the Space Corps would become a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.The White House rejected the Space Corps plan this summer, calling it "premature at this time" and pointing out there's an assessment underway to study possible military space organization changes while also looking at budget implications.The lawmaker behind the Space Corps effort is Alabama Republican Rep. Mike Rogers, chairman of the House Armed Services Strategic Forces Subcommittee.In a June hearing, Rogers said the Russians and Chinese have already reorganized their own space operations, adding "the Chinese literally have a space force today."
Trump tweets on account deactivation: 'The word must finally be getting outand having an impact':::::President Donald Trump tweeted early Friday on the 11-minute deactivation of his account by a Twitter customer service worker on the employee's last day at work."I guess the word must finally be getting out-and having an impact," the president tweeted.Twitter said Thursday night that Trump's personal account had been deactivated.
Putin and Trump may meet next week at APEC summit, Kremlin says:::::Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. President Donald Trump may meet next week at an APEC summit in Vietnam, the Kremlin said on Friday, saying talks were underway about setting up such an encounter.Putin and Trump first met at a G-20 summit in Hamburg in July when they discussed allegations of Russian meddling in the U.S. presidential election, but agreed to focus on better ties rather than litigating the past.Relations between Moscow and Washington have soured further since, however.Trump in August grudgingly signed off on new sanctions against Russia, a move Moscow said ended hopes for better ties.Putin, dismayed by the sanctions, ordered Washington to more than halve its embassy and consular staff in Russia.But when asked if Putin and Trump might meet at an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit taking place next week in Vietnam, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Moscow did not rule out such a meeting."It (the meeting) is indeed being discussed," Peskov told reporters on a conference call."It's hard to overestimate the importance and significance for all international matters of any contact between the presidents of Russia and the United States," said Peskov.The APEC summit is taking place in the Vietnamese city of Danang from Nov. 8-10.
US bomber drills aggravate North Korea ahead of Trump's Asia visit:::::Two U.S. strategic bombers conducted drills over South Korea on Thursday, the U.S. Air Force said, raising tensions with North Korea just days before President Donald Trump visits the region seeking to shut down Pyongyang's nuclear programme.News of the drills was first reported by North Korean state news agency KCNA on Friday, which said the exercises involving South Korean and Japanese fighter jets were a "surprise nuclear strike drill"."The reality clearly shows that the gangster-like U.S. imperialists are the very one who is aggravating the situation of the Korean peninsula and seeking to ignite a nuclear war," KCNA said.Trump arrives in Asia on Sunday, beginning his first trip to the region as president in Japan before heading to South Korea and China, then Vietnam and the Philippines.A series of missile tests by North Korea and its sixth and largest nuclear test have fueled the most critical international challenge of Trump's presidency.The goal of Trump's visit will be to increase international support for efforts to deprive North Korea of resources as leverage to coerce it to give up nuclear weapons, U.S. officials said."The president recognizes that we're running out of time (to deal with North Korea) and will ask all nations to do more," White House national security adviser H.R.McMaster told reporters at a briefing in Washington.McMaster said Trump, who has approved a variety of sanctions against North Korea while pressing China to do more, is at the beginning of his drive for Pyongyang to give up nuclear weapons.Trump has warned he would "totally destroy" North Korea if it threatened the United States."I think we have to be a little patient here for at least a few months to see what more we and others can do, including China," said McMaster."I don't think we need to reassess our strategy now.I think we have to give it a couple of months, a few months, and then see what adjustments we might need to make."China's influential state-run tabloid the Global Times said in an editorial on Friday that pressing China will not help solve the Korean peninsula nuclear crisis."The complexity of the nuclear crisis means that all sides may have to make some concessions to reach a peaceful solution.China is playing the most difficult role in the process and is the real hope of peacefully addressing the crisis.Neither side should press China in an extreme way," it said.
China: We're the world's 'new role model,' and Trump needs to prove he can be 'constructive':::::China is calling for constructive dialogue and negotiations ahead of the President Donald Trump's visit to Beijing next week as the world's second-largest economy balances practical diplomacy with its own growing assertiveness.Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying demonstrated that balancing act when she addressed a question about the trade relationship with the U.S. on Thursday."With deepening and fast growing economic and trade cooperation, it is inevitable that certain differences and frictions may arise between China and the U.S.But we should be aware that this doesn't make [up] the mainstream of China-U.S. economic and trade relations," said Hua."We indeed hope that the U.S. will work with China for [shared goals, and] properly handle the relevant differences through dialogue and negotiation in a constructive way so as to ensure the steady and healthy development of China-U.S. economic and trade relations," Hua added, according to an official transcript.After all, as the world's largest economies, the U.S. and China are "highly dependent" on each other, so "it's safe to say that we will swim or sink together," Hua said.The official views were echoed by the state press which are painting a hopeful and positive picture of Trump's first presidential visit to Asia, where he will be meeting Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing next week.Leading English paper China Daily on Friday said Trump needs to reassure his hosts that the U.S. will make a "constructive contribution to regional issues.""Much of the speculation ahead of Trump's visit to Asia, which began on Friday, stems from the conflicting messages that have previously been given by his administration," the editorial said."A clear, consistent and positive message showing a willingness to cooperate and contribute constructively to resolving regional issues would go a long way toward making his trip a success."
Twitter employee deactivated Trump's account for 11 minutes:::::The company sent out a tweet from its Twitter Government team saying that Trump's account has been restored."We are continuing to investigate and are taking steps to prevent this from happening again," the tweet said.
Trump appears set to win points for his Asia tour  but experts warn he's making one mistake:::::Under former president Barack Obama, the East Asia Summit became a pillar in Washington's Asia relations.In 2011, the U.S. acquired membership under Obama's strategy of pivoting American foreign policy focus toward the Asia-Pacific region.Since then, the president attended every year except for 2013 when a U.S. government shutdown occurred.Trump's Asia tour is the longest trip to the continent by a sitting U.S. president this millennium but missing the East Asia Summit is still a big deal for local leaders, experts say."The U.S. decision to join EAS was a milestone in U.S. engagement in Asia and a tradition that should be followed," said Thomas Hubbard, a former U.S. ambassador to South Korea."I hope Asians will focus on the unusually long time he will spend in Asia rather than on the one meeting he will miss."Donald Tusk from the European Council, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, and United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres are all expected to attend this year's meeting.
The GOP tax bill would wipe out key deduction for nursing home residents:::::"It tends to be mostly older people who do not have long-term care insurance, and end up in a nursing home," said Richard Kaplan, a professor who specializes in tax policy and elder law at the University of Illinois College of Law.The cost of living in a nursing home can easily run up to tens of thousands of dollars per year and wipe out the savings of elderly residents who are paying out of pocket.The deduction can be an important offset to taxes those Americans would owe on their retirement savings distributions."For people who are receiving long-term care and are paying for it themselves, this is going to be a huge deal," said Kaplan.The medical expense deduction is not a big expense when it comes to budget line items.According to the Treasury Department, it will cost the government about $10 billion a year in lost tax revenues in 2018 and about $144 billion over the next 10 years.By contrast, the exemption for employer-sponsored health plans amounts to more than $225 billion a year in lost tax revenues next year and more than $3 trillion over the next decade.Past efforts to scale back the employer plan exemption have been highly unpopular.The GOP tax bill leaves the employer plan exemption unchanged, but the proposal would now require employers to report the value of contributions to workers' health savings accounts on W-2 tax forms."Right now on the tax return, if an employer provides health insurance, they have to show that in one of the boxes (on the W-2)," said Kaplan, but under the new proposal, "the health savings amount would be in the box, as well."It's not a big deal if employer health plans continue to remain exempt from being taxed, Kaplan said.But it could potentially boost the number of employers and workers subject to the so-called Obamacare Cadillac Tax, which effectively caps the current exemption by imposing an excise tax on high-cost health benefits.The tax is currently slated to be implemented starting in 2020."That would be useful information to implement the Cadillac Tax," said Kaplan, though he notes that implementation of the unpopular provision has been repeatedly delayed.
Sen. Warren says GOP tax plan is a $2 trillion 'giveaway' to giant corporations:::::Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., had some choice words about the GOP's tax reform bill unveiled on Thursday.In an interview on CNBC's "Closing Bell," Warren called the tax plan a "$2 trillion giveaway to giant corporations" and added that the biggest beneficiary would be Wells Fargo, the bank at the center of a massive fake-accounts scandal last year.She also said beneficiaries include foreign investors and multinational companies."This gives real subsidies to move jobs overseas," she said, adding she would "do my best to stop it."On the nomination of Jerome Powell to succeed Janet Yellen as the next Federal Reserve chairman, Warren said it's a good sign that he has aligned himself with Yellen.Still, she plans to reserve judgment until after the nomination hearing."I'm going to ask him some tough questions and hear what his answers are," she said.
49% of Americans think Trump committed a crime: Washington Post-ABC poll:::::A strong majority of Americans approves of FBI Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign, according to a new poll from The Washington Post and ABC.The poll, which surveyed 714 adults across the country, found that 58 percent approve of the way Mueller is handling the investigation, compared with just 28 percent who disapprove, the Post reported Thursday.What bodes worse for Trump is that more than half of Americans surveyed say they think that the charges brought so far against former campaign chair Paul Manafort, his associate Richard Gates and former advisor George Papadopoulos will not be the last of it.In perhaps the most damning indicator of the public's view of the investigation, 49 percent of overall respondents say they think Trump himself committed a crime related to the subject of Mueller's investigation.Fifty-three percent say the charges made public Monday represent broader wrongdoing by people involved in the presidential campaign versus 28 percent who say the charges will stop there.Manafort, chairman of Trump's presidential campaign for several months in 2016, was charged along with Gates in a 12-count indictment, which includes allegations of laundering millions of dollars and acting as an unregistered foreign agent over the course of many years.Papadopoulos pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his connections in Russia.Documents released by the special counsel Monday describe his efforts to connect the Trump campaign with high-level Russian officials, the Post reported.The Post-ABC poll results appear to be heavily skewed in accordance with respondents' prior political leanings: 78 percent of Democrats approve of the way Mueller is handling the investigation, for instance, whereas just 38 percent of Republicans approve.That said, people across the aisle tend to be more aligned in supporting the case against Manafort and Gates, the Post reported.Fifty-seven percent of Republicans and 78 percent of Democrats approve of that case.Read more about the results of the Washington Post-ABC poll here.
Republican tax plan has big advantages  but also real problems:::::That doesn't eliminate their problems, which remain substantial.The GOP holds narrow majorities and faces significant ideological divides.Leaders can only lose two Republican senators and still pass the bill, which makes any individual objection significant.The congressional budget plan permits the tax bill to boost the deficit by $1.5 trillion over 10 years.That's too much for some fiscal conservatives who worry about the federal debt including Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona who criticized the plan Thursday.The plan gives businesses tax cuts more than three times as it gives individuals, and early analyses suggest some individual taxpayers would actually pay more.Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida on Thursday said he wants the child tax credit, which would rise from $1,000 to $1,600 under the plan, to go up even more.Regional opposition could also be decisive.There are 35 House GOP members from New York, New Jersey, Illinois and California states that would be hit by the plan's elimination of the federal deduction for state income taxes.That's more than enough to sink the bill if they hold together in opposition.Specific sectors of the economy can also cause trouble.Homebuilders and Realtors have announced their strong opposition over new curbs on the value of tax deductions for mortgage interest.And as Republican leaders try to surmount these obstacles, public support for the plan is weak as the debate gets underway.In this week's NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll, just 25 percent of Americans called the plan a good idea, 14 percent said it would reduce their tax bills, and 19 percent said it would give the economy a big boost.
Trump picks Jerome Powell to succeed Yellen as Fed chair:::::Powell led a diverse field of potential nominees that included former Governor Kevin Warsh, Stanford economist John Taylor, chief Trump economic advisor Gary Cohn and Yellen herself.Trump's relationship with Yellen has evolved; during the 2016 presidential campaign he said the Fed chief should be "ashamed" of the way she has run the Fed, arguing that Yellen kept policy loose for political reasons to boost the fortunes of former President Barack Obama.Since taking office, though, his views have changed and he offered warm words for her Thursday despite deciding to replace Yellen and make her the briefest-serving Fed chair since G. William Miller from 1978-79.Yellen's term has been marked by a mostly uninterrupted bull market run in stocks that began in March 2009 and low interest rates even as the Fed has sought to unwind the stimulus initiated during the crisis.The central bank has hiked its benchmark interest rate four times under Yellen and has taken the first steps in unwinding the $4.5 trillion balance sheet built up during the efforts to spur growth through bond purchases.Yellen is "a wonderful woman who's done a terrific job," Trump said."We have been working together for 10 months and she is absolutely a spectacular person.Janet, thank you very much.We appreciate it."Though the Powell nomination was widely reported and anticipated for weeks, markets reacted positively to the announcement, with the Dow industrials tacking on about 60 points in the half-hour or so after Trump spoke."Jerome Powell is a smart choice for Fed chair," said Richard Clarida, global strategic advisor at bond giant Pimco."He is likely to provide monetary policy continuity by adopting Yellen's framework of gradually normalizing rates and predictably reducing the Fed's balance sheet.He is also likely to be more receptive to calls for adjusting financial regulation prudently, especially for smaller banks."Powell had been named to fill an unexpired term in 2012 that won't end until 2028.He is viewed as a convenient choice, someone who likely will continue the programs of the Yellen Fed but allow Trump a chance to put his own stamp on the central bank."I'm both honored and humbled by this opportunity to serve our great country," Powell said."If I am confirmed by the Senate, I will do everything within my power to achieve our congressional assigned goals of stable prices and maximum employment."The Fed is in the midst of normalizing the historically accommodative monetary policy it had begun to help pull the U.S. from the throes of the financial crisis and the Great Recession.Under Yellen, the Fed has hiked interest rates four times and is expected to approve another increase in December.In addition, it is unwinding its balance sheet, which primarily consists of bonds the Fed purchased in an effort to drive down mortgage rates and push investors to risk assets like stocks and corporate bonds.Powell has been part of the Fed's voting consensus since taking his seat, not once veering from the majority's position."I think the president has made a spectacular choice, and I'm really supportive of what the president is doing," Cohn told the Economic Club of Washington, D.C. earlier in the day.But the move had some critics, primarily from those worried about Powell's academic background.Most Fed chairs have been Ph.D.s and have more background in economics than Powell, who has spent much of his career as a lawyer, in investment banking and at the Treasury under former President George H.W.Bush."Powell's resume is not up to the standards we would expect of a nominee for Fed Chair," Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at forecasting firm Capital Economics, said in a note."The risk of a serious policy mistake in either direction will arguably be higher under Powell's leadership than under Yellen's."
What Jerome Powell means for your pocketbook:::::It looks like consumers can expect the interest rates they pay on credit cards and many loans to continue ticking upward at a slow and steady pace.President Donald Trump on Thursday named Jerome Powell, a former investment banker, as his choice to serve as the next chairman of the Federal Reserve.A member of the Fed's Board of Governors since 2012, Powell is broadly viewed as a policymaker who would carry on the cautious approach to influencing interest rates that's been the hallmark of current Chair Janet Yellen."I wouldn't expect any material deviation of that path," said Jonathan Wright, an economics professor at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore.Assuming Powell is confirmed by the Senate, he would succeed Yellen when her term ends in February.An Obama appointee, Yellen took over in February 2014 in the midst of an economic expansion that began in early 2009 and is now in its ninth year.The Federal Reserve is charged with using monetary policy to keep inflation at bay and employment strong, and uses a key interest rate to try accomplishing that.Called the federal funds rate, it's the rate that banks charge one another for overnight loans.When the Fed nudges that rate up to help cool off the economy by making money more expensive to borrow, banks typically pass on the higher cost of borrowing to consumers in the form of higher rates on loans and credit.Jerome Powell Age: 64 Nominated by President Donald Trump to replace Janet Yellen in February 2018 as chair of the Federal Reserve.2012-current: Member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors.Appointed by former President Barack Obama.Career highlights: 2010-2012: Visiting scholar at the Bipartisan Policy Center, focusing on federal and state fiscal issues.1997-2005: Partner at asset manager The Carlyle Group of Washington, D.C. 1990-1993: Served as undersecretary for finance in the Treasury Department under former President George W. Bush.Education: Bachelor's degree in politics from Princeton University; law degree from Georgetown University (and editor-in-chief of Georgetown Law Journal).While the federal funds rate has risen from zero to 1.25 percent under Yellen's tenure including two hikes of 0.25 percentage point this year it remains historically low.And on Wednesday, the Federal Open Market Committee, which is the Fed's policy-making arm, left that rate unchanged.At its next meeting, scheduled for Dec. 12-13, the committee is expected to raise the federal funds rate by another 0.25 percentage point."It's not a done deal, but they've made it pretty clear that they are highly likely to [make that increase] in December," Wright said.While many consumers might pay little attention to the eight meetings the Fed holds annually or who's at the central bank's helm, for that matter the interest rates paid on borrowed money (and earned on certain bank accounts) typically trace back to decisions made at these policy-making get-togethers.(Click on graphic below to enlarge.)
Blankfein hints to Bloomberg that ex-mayor could unite divided country: 'We know where that middle is, Mike':::::Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein joked Thursday that former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg could be the one to draw the United States together.Blankfein asked Bloomberg during an on-stage discussion at Goldman Sachs' Sustainable Finance Innovation Forum when the next presidential election will begin."In 15 minutes?"Blankfein joked.The former mayor said it would start right after the mid-term elections, which would indicate which party was ahead.Bloomberg then described how the emerging candidates were being pulled to the political right and left."A whole bunch of people have dropped out of both of these parties," he said."We know where that middle is, Mike," Blankfein then joked."I'm going to need about 63 million of you," Bloomberg said."In New York City, if I had 90 percent approval rating when I left, it still meant 840,000 people still hated me."Bloomberg was mayor of New York City for three terms and considered running as an independent candidate in the 2016 presidential election.He decided not to run for fear a three-way race would give Trump a better chance at winning.Bloomberg still heads his financial data company and Bloomberg Philanthropies and is the UN Secretary-General's Special Envoy for Cities and Climate Change.Blankfein has indirectly criticized President Donald Trump on Twitter.Blankfein's first tweet on June 1 said the Trump administration's decision to withdraw the U.S. from the Paris climate agreement was a "setback for the environment and for the U.S.'s leadership position in the world."Subsequent tweets have also trolled Trump's plans on infrastructure spending.Separately Thursday, as the Republicans rolled out their tax proposal, Blankfein said in a Reuters report that a good U.S. tax plan will have "stimulative elements" and could get the U.S. to higher than 3 percent GDP.The initial reading on third-quarter U.S. GDP last week showed better-than-expected 3 percent growth.Former Goldman Sachs president and COO Gary Cohn is now the White House's chief economic advisor.Blankfein is one of the CEOs scheduled to travel with Trump to China on Friday.CNBC's Christina Wilkie contributed to this report.
Here are the corporate dealmakers joining Trump in China:::::When President Donald Trump lands in China next week, he'll be joined by more than two dozen business titans representing American energy, industrial, financial services and agricultural industries, according to a list obtained by CNBC.An attendance list submitted to China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs for a state banquet held in honor of Trump's November visit included Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein, Qualcomm CEO Steve Mollenkopf, Cheniere Energy CEO Jack Fusco and Air Products CEO Seifollah Ghasemi.Division heads from Boeing and General Electric were also included.An application posted by the Department of Commerce in September touted the trade mission as a way to connect with high-level officials, encourage market access and promote investments.Five people familiar with the planning said the White House homed in on companies that could announce "done deals": multibillion-dollar export announcements that would have the effect of chipping away at the U.S. trade deficit with China."The Chinese are always willing to play ball with regard to concrete purchases," said Bruce Hirsh, principal at Tailwind Global Strategies and a former official at the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative during the Obama, George W. Bush and Clinton administrations."The bigger question is whether they're willing to deal with broader trade problems."It's the broader trade problems that could prove thorny when they arise in bilateral talks.In briefings with reporters, senior administration officials have said the president will continue to stress the need for China to remove barriers to investment for U.S. companies and rebalance the "colossal" deficit.Trump highlighted the U.S. trade deficit with China which stood at $347 billion at the end of 2016 in a Wednesday meeting with Cabinet officials at the White House."We have trade deficits with China that are through the roof.They're so big and so bad that it's embarrassing saying what the number is.But you know what the number is," Trump said."I don't want to embarrass anybody four days before I land in China, but it's horrible."Traditionally, foreign trips carry quid pro quo announcements where each country can secure a win.Early proposals by China that were rebuffed by the White House were said to include broader, long-term access to the financial markets, a follow-up to prior objectives the two countries negotiated that allowed U.S. banks to underwrite bonds and apply for licenses to process payments.As a result, a rough draft of the CEO delegation included a handful of high-octane Wall Street executives, according to five people familiar with the planning."It's very ripe for opening," said Stephen A. Orlins, president of the National Committee for United States-China Relations.Orlins said the financial services industry was low-hanging fruit, given the Wall Street background of the Trump administration, and the fact that further access for U.S. banks in capital markets and insurance would end up hastening the maturity of China's markets."They'd get a big win from making what appeared to be concessions, but the winners are ultimately Chinese corporates and the Chinese public."In an Oct. 30 briefing with reporters, China's ambassador to the United States, expressed cautious optimism talks between the world's two largest economies would be mutually beneficial."I think the two teams have already spent a lot of time and a lot of energy on" economic and trade cooperation, Ambassador Cui Tiankai said, according to a transcript of a briefing."I am confident that there will be a significant outcome, or what we call deliverables, on the economic and trade front."
Don't celebrate those cuts just yet. This tax overhaul could leave you high and dry.:::::The winners and losers of the Republican tax proposal are beginning to emerge.Lawmakers released the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on Thursday.The proposed legislation aims to simplify the tax code by slashing itemized deductions and cutting down the number of income tax brackets.Republicans are also seeking to reduce the federal corporate tax rate to 20 percent from its current maximum level of 35 percent."There will be winners and losers in tax reform, and as it stands now, I worry that the benefits that are claimed to go to middle-income households won't play out," said Bill Hoagland, senior vice president at the Bipartisan Policy Center.Here's how your tax picture may change if the legislation is adopted without major changes.
Trump on tax reform: It's a 'great day for the American worker':::::President Donald Trump on Thursday called the newly released Republican tax-reform plan "a great bill," and "another important step toward providing massive tax relief for the American people.""Today is a great day for the American worker," Trump said at the White House."Over the past 10 months, we've witnessed something remarkable happening to our country, a lot of change, a lot of difference.We've hit close to 60 records in the stock market since November 8, that very big day," Trump said, referring to the day he was elected president.Speaking at a special event to announce a move by Singapore-based Broadcom to a U.S. based tax domicile in Delaware, Trump touted the tax-reform bill as an example of his administration's pro-business agenda."It'll be the biggest tax cut in the history of our country, it will be tax reform, and it will create jobs," Trump said.Trump met later in the day with House Republican lawmakers responsible for crafting the bill, and told them he wants "a bill on my desk hopefully by Thanksgiving, if that's possible, and I want everybody in this room standing by me.""Do you want to see changes to the bill?"a reporter asked Trump."I don't think we'll need very many," replied the president.Earlier in the day, Trump put out a statement emphasizing how many of his priorities were included in the legislation unveiled Thursday."My tax reform priorities have been the same since day one: bringing tax cuts for hardworking, middle-income Americans; eliminating unfair loopholes and deductions; and slashing business taxes so employers can create jobs, raise wages, and dominate their competition around the world," Trump said.But he also warned that there was still a long way to go before the bill becomes law."We are just getting started, and there is much work left to do.The special interests will distort the facts, the lobbyists will try to save their special deals, and some in the media will unfairly report on our efforts," he said."My administration will work tirelessly to make good on our promise to the working people who built our nation and deliver historic tax cuts and reforms the rocket fuel our economy needs to soar higher than ever before."
Democrats waste no time slamming 'catastrophic' GOP tax plan:::::DNC Chair: GOP doesn't want you to see the fine print of tax bill 22 Hours Ago | 01:42 The most comprehensive version to date of the GOP's long-awaited tax plan came a little earlier than many expected Thursday morning but not too soon for Democrats to immediately plant a flag of staunch opposition.Among other changes, the summary details of the proposal outline large increases of the standard deduction for individuals and families, as well as raising the child tax credit and doubling the estate tax while scheduling its repeal in six years.The bill would also permanently lower the corporate tax rate to 20 percent, sources told CNBC.In a time of stark polarization in Congress, Democrats didn't bother waiting for the full text of the bill before taking their criticisms public.Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., an especially outspoken critic of both the opposition party and President Donald Trump's administration, said the plan is essentially designed to transfer money from poor to rich, from Democrat to Republican, and away from government programs generally.House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of California, branding the plan with the hashtag #BillionairesFirst, called the proposal "disastrous" in a tweet.At a press conference Thursday, Pelosi said the GOP plan would constitute a "catastrophic transfer" of wealth to the rich from the middle class.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York, using similar language as his colleague in the House, said the plan will raise taxes on the middle class and serve the wealthiest Americans most, according to reports.Former Michigan Gov.Jennifer Granholm described the tax plan as a "giveaway to the ultra-rich winners of the ovarian lottery" in a tweet.Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Bernie Sanders, the Independent senator from Vermont and former Democratic presidential candidate, went a step beyond a pugnacious tweet by posting a nearly four-minute video discussing the plan.Warren said the biggest beneficiaries of the GOP plan will be large banks and multinational corporations."Estimated to be number one on the list is Wells Fargo.Remember our friends from the fake accounts scandal?"she asked Sanders."The socially conscious institution?"He joked.And Rep. Ted Lieu, D-Calif., chided his opponents while responding to a report that an unnamed House Republican thinks the tax proposal "sucks."To be sure, members of high political office were far from the only ones weighing in on the Republicans' tax code overhaul.Political PACs, activist websites and political advisors with varying degrees of affiliation with the Democratic Party all took a swing at the GOP plan.An activist group supporting Sanders, for instance, took a hard jab at the plan while sounding off on another Trump-related headline this time that Sam Clovis, a questionably credentialed nominee to head the Agriculture Department, had withdrawn his nomination.
Republicans say you can file your taxes with a postcard if new bill passes; H&R Block shares drop:::::Rep. Kevin Brady says nine out of 10 Americans will be able to file taxes using a postcard 12:18 PM ET Thu, 2 Nov 2017 | 00:58 The new tax bill unveiled by House Republicans Thursday is so simple that taxpayers will be able to file using a postcard, according to GOP lawmakers."This is a complete redesign of the code, so we can simplify it so much that 9 out of 10 Americans can file using a postcard-style system, lowering the rates, protecting more of the first dollars you earn," said Rep. Kevin Brady, R-Texas, while holding up a mock-up of the tax postcard."We're not just putting higher octane fuel in an old clunker of a tax car, we've proposed to drive a newer tax car that can beat and win against any country in the world."The postcard prop read at the top, "Simple, Fair 'Postcard' Tax Filing."The new plan aims, in part, to lower the corporate tax rate to 20 percent.The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act the bill's official name would also slash the number of income tax brackets from seven to four: 12 percent, 25 percent, 35 percent and 39.6 percent.Republican leaders have rallied behind the idea of tax reform, as President Donald Trump's campaign leaned heavily on promising substantive tax change."It's redesigned for simplicity, fairness and benefits," Brady added."I predict, under this tax reform plan, America will evolve from 31st in the world among our competitors to the top 3 as the best places on the planet for the best new job, that next new manufacturing plant."As both Brady and House Speaker Paul Ryan delivered the news, shares of tax-planning firm H&R Block fell about 2.7 percent Thursday.Because much of the company's appeal derives from do-it-yourself tax return assistance, news of a simplified tax code could be seen as a threat.The stock is off more than 24 percent from its 52-week high, with much of that decline coming since the summer as details about the simplified tax plan began to emerge."It's going to make life very simple," said President Trump later in the day."The only people that aren't going to like this is H&R Block.They're not going to be very happy.That's probably one of the only companies in the country that's not going to be thrilled."Shares of H&R Block ticked added slightly more to their losses after the president's comments.
GOP bill will kill the estate tax, after 6 years:::::Under the new proposal, coined the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the estate tax exemption will double and then be repealed as of 2024.In addition, there would continue to be a "step-up in basis," which means if you inherit shares of stock, for example, and turn around and sell those shares, you wouldn't pay any capital gains taxes either."That's a double win for the beneficiaries," said Bill Smith, managing director at CBIZ MHM."It would be hard to argue that's a benefit for the middle class."Because of the sky-high threshold, only the wealthiest Americans now pay the federal levy.The Tax Policy Center estimated there were about 11,310 estate returns filed and about half of those were taxable for 2017.Still, the amount of tax collected on those returns was just under $20 billion, the Tax Policy Center said.However, any tax code changes could just as easily be undone in the next election cycle, said Brad Dillon, a senior wealth planner at Brown Brothers Harriman in New York City."Since the ancient Egyptians there's been some form of an estate tax," he said."We'll plan as though there will be an estate tax [again] at some point."The estate tax has been on a roller coaster since first imposed in 1917, when 10 percent was levied on portions of an estate exceeding $5 million.At its peak in the 1940s, it charged 77 percent on portions of more than $10 million, then 70 percent for amounts over $5 million from 1976 to 1982.
Student loan interest deduction is on the chopping block:::::"The real question for a lot of borrowers isn't going to be the loss of this particular deduction.It's, do I come out better with all of the changes or am I worse off?"Under current rules, borrowers can deduct up to $2,500 in interest paid toward qualifying federal and private student loans.(See infographic below for some of the ins and outs.)It's an "above-the-line" deduction on your Form 1040, meaning it directly reduces your taxable income and you don't need to itemize to claim it.The student loan interest deduction is subject to income limits, however.It begins phasing out for single individuals with a modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) of $65,000 and married-filing-jointly couples earning $130,000.Singles with a MAGI of $80,000 or more, and married-filing-jointly couples with one of $160,000 or more, can't claim the deduction, period."You get these forms from your lender, and then you find out you can't deduct the interest," Gavin Morrissey, managing partner at Financial Strategy Associates in Needham, Massachusetts, told CNBC earlier this year."That happens with a lot of people."Your repayment schedule also limits the value of the deduction.Graduates typically have a six-month grace period before student loan repayment begins, so the value of that loan interest deduction won't amount to much until the tax year following graduation.But then the value decreases in subsequent years as you pay down the loan and more of your payment goes toward principal rather than interest.
Ex-Trump campaign official withdraws nomination for agriculture post:::::A former Trump campaign official linked to the Russia investigation by Special Counsel Robert Mueller has withdrawn his nomination for an agriculture post.Sam Clovis, a former Trump campaign national co-chairman and chief policy adviser, wrote in a letter to President Donald Trump dated Thursday that he does "not want to be a distraction or a negative influence."Questions had been raised about his qualifications to serve as the Agriculture Department's chief scientist.Clovis is a self-described skeptic of climate change.Republicans were preparing to hold a hearing on his nomination next week.But it was revealed this week that Clovis had communications with George Papadopoulos, who has admitted to lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russian intermediaries last year.In his letter, Clovis said the political climate in Washington "has made it impossible for me to receive balanced and fair consideration for this position.""The relentless assaults on you and your team seem to be a blood sport that only increases in intensity each day," Clovis wrote."As I am focused on your success and the success of this Administration, I do not want to be a distraction or negative influence, particularly with so much important work left to do for the American people."White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said: "We respect Mr. Clovis' decision to withdraw his nomination."Clovis was a professor of economics at Morningside College in Sioux City, Iowa, before he joined the Trump campaign.If he had been confirmed, Clovis would have overseen the department's nearly $3 billion investment in research and education grants.He also would have helped set the research priorities for the department and ensure that research is conducted with integrity.
Mysterious Trump backer Mercer stepping down at fund, selling Breitbart stake. Read full letter:::::Robert Mercer, a billionaire supporter of President Donald Trump and former White House senior counselor Stephen Bannon, is stepping down as co-CEO of the quant hedge fund Renaissance Technologies, according to a memorandum to employees on Thursday.Mercer, 71, said he will leave the role on Jan. 1 but stay at the firm in a research role.He is also selling his personal stake in the right-wing news outlet Breitbart News to his daughters.Peter Brown will continue on as CEO of the hedge fund.In the memo, Mercer responds to unidentified misinformation he says has been published about him."Of the many mischaracterizations made of me by the press, the most repugnant to me have been the intimations that I am a white supremacist or a member of some other noxious group," Mercer wrote."Discrimination on the basis of race, ethnicity, gender, creed, or anything of that sort is abhorrent to me.But more than that, it is ignorant."But Mercer also says he regrets associating himself with the polarizing former senior editor of Breitbart, Milo Yiannopoulos, and is in the process of distancing himself from him and severing all ties.Mercer donated millions of dollars to Republican candidates and PACs during the 2016 election.Meanwhile Renaissance Technologies' founder, James Simons, tends to support Democrats.Mercer's Renaissance co-COE Brown is also a Democrat supporter whose wife, Margaret Hamburg, was commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration in the Obama administration.Bannon returned to Breitbart, which he helped found, after he left the White House this summer and he and Mercer are said to be close.But in his memo to employees, Mercer says the two don't always see eye to eye."I make my own decisions with respect to whom I support politically.Those decisions do not always align with Mr. Bannon's," he said.Renaissance manages $50 billion of assets.Here is the text of his memo: Dear Colleagues, During the past year, I have been the object of a great deal of scrutiny from the press.I have declined to comment on what has been written about me, imagining that with time the attention would dissipate.Because that has yet to happen, I have decided to correct some of the misinformation that has been published about me.It is not my intention to impose the views I describe below on anyone else.My goal is simply to explain my thinking, the very essence of which is that all of us should think for ourselves.I believe that individuals are happiest and most fulfilled when they form their own opinions, assume responsibility for their own actions, and spend the fruits of their own labor as they see fit.I believe that a collection of individuals making their own decisions within the confines of a clear and concise set of laws that they have determined for themselves will advance society much more effectively than will a collection of experts who are confident in their knowledge of what is best for everyone else.This is why I support conservatives, who favor a smaller, less powerful government.A society founded on the basis of the individual freedom that flourishes under a limited federal government has no place for discrimination.Of the many mischaracterizations made of me by the press, the most repugnant to me have been the intimations that I am a white supremacist or a member of some other noxious group.Discrimination on the basis of race, ethnicity, gender, creed, or anything of that sort is abhorrent to me.But more than that, it is ignorant.The press has also intimated that my politics marches in lockstep with Steve Bannon's.I have great respect for Mr. Bannon, and from time to time I do discuss politics with him.However, I make my own decisions with respect to whom I support politically.Those decisions do not always align with Mr. Bannon's.Without individuals thinking for themselves, society as a whole will struggle to distinguish the signal of truth from the correlated noise of conformity.I supported Milo Yiannopoulos in the hope and expectation that his expression of views contrary to the social mainstream and his spotlighting of the hypocrisy of those who would close down free speech in the name of political correctness would promote the type of open debate and freedom of thought that is being throttled on many American college campuses today.But in my opinion, actions of and statements by Mr. Yiannopoulos have caused pain and divisiveness undermining the open and productive discourse that I had hoped to facilitate.I was mistaken to have supported him, and for several weeks have been in the process of severing all ties with him.For personal reasons, I have also decided to sell my stake in Breitbart News to my daughters.I would also like to inform you of a decision I have reached with respect to my role at Renaissance, an organization I adore with colleagues whom I deeply respect and admire.I am 71 years old, the same age that Jim Simons was when he retired.I do not plan to retire, but I do plan to relinquish my management responsibilities.Peter Brown and I have been Co-CEOs for the past eight years.On January 1, 2018, I will step down from my position as Co-CEO and resign from the board of directors.I will continue with the firm as a member of its technical staff, focusing on the research work that I find most fulfilling.Peter will continue on as CEO, and I will provide him with my counsel whenever he feels that I can be helpful to him and to the company where I have spent so many wonderful years.RLM
Tech companies are 'soul searching' in the wake of Russia meddling, former Twitter CEO says:::::Former Twitter CEO: There's an extraordinary amount of soul searching inside tech companies now 11:12 AM ET Thu, 2 Nov 2017 | 02:51 If Russian interference on internet platforms isn't affecting tech's bottom line, it doesn't mean executives at Facebook, Twitter and Google aren't concerned about it."There's an extraordinary amount of soul searching inside these companies about what's happened," former Twitter CEO Dick Costolo told CNBC's "Squawk on the Street" on Thursday.Revelations of Russian meddling on Facebook, Twitter and Google have put the tech giants on their heels, still struggling to fully understand the scope of the foreign campaign and publicly promising to be better.Costolo said internal debates have sprung up around where and how to deploy resources.Facebook said this week it would double its staff devoted to safety and security to 20,000."These things are always an arms race," Costolo said."There's already an extraordinary amount of money spent on security, abuse and spam inside these companies."Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said Wednesday the company was prioritizing security over profits a declaration Costolo said was likely more about optics than anything else."They've done a pretty good job of nailing down maximizing profits and so they can move onto some of the other issues they're facing," he said.Costolo said any increase in security efforts would be unlikely to affect Facebook's profitability.He anticipated that much of the increased security would result from redirecting existing resources.Facebook, Twitter and Google sent representatives to Capitol Hill this week where they were grilled by members of Congress on their inaction and inability to contain the foreign threat.
Here are the new tax brackets in the GOP plan:::::Here are the new tax brackets in the GOP plan 17 Hours Ago | 00:58 As part of the tax overhaul, House Republicans are cutting the current income tax brackets to four.Currently, there are seven tax brackets: 10 percent, 15, percent, 25 percent, 28 percent, 33 percent, 35 percent and 39.6 percent.Under the House bill, The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, there will be four: 12 percent, 25 percent, 35 percent and 39.6 percent, according to The Wall Street Journal.The bill roughly doubles the standard deduction to $12,000 for single filers and $24,000 for married couples.
Tax reform plan halves the cap on mortgage interest deduction:::::America's popular mortgage interest deduction is about to lose a lot of its punch.The House Republican tax plan halves the cap on the deduction of mortgage debt for newly purchased homes to $500,000.It does, however, maintain the current deduction of up to $1 million in mortgage debt for current homeowners.The plan also nearly doubles the standard deduction, meaning fewer taxpayers would itemize and take the mortgage interest deduction.Currently, about 21 percent of filers take the mortgage deduction, but under the new framework only about 4 percent would, according to recent estimates from the Tax Policy Center."The proposal to double the standard tax deduction is one piece of the Congressional Republicans' tax plan that could put more money in middle-income Americans' pockets," Svenja Gudell, Zillow's chief economist, said in a release."For many Americans struggling with high housing costs and for young adults paying high rents and dreaming of buying their first home, this could be something of a reprieve."The Republican plan also allows state and local property tax deductions of up to $10,000.This will hit the Northeast hard New Jersey, New York and Connecticut have some of the highest property tax rates and the highest-priced homes.It will hurt less for states in the South, where tax rates and home prices are low.Hawaii does have the lowest property tax rate in the nation but the highest median home price.Washington, D.C., is much the same.California falls in the middle on property tax rates but has some of the highest home prices in the nation.Homebuilder and overall housing stocks moved lower on the news and are now at their worst levels of the day.The housing industry has been lobbying hard to keep homeowner incentives, and this is not what they were looking for."We are currently reviewing the details of the tax proposal released today, but at first glance it appears to confirm many of our biggest concerns about the Unified Framework," said National Association of Realtors President William Brown, in a statement."Eliminating or nullifying the tax incentives for homeownership puts home values and middle-class homeowners at risk, and, from a cursory examination, this legislation appears to do just that."In a statement, the National Association of Homebuilders called the plan "particularly disappointing.""By sharply reducing the number of taxpayers who would itemize, what's left is a tax bill that essentially eviscerates the mortgage interest deduction and strips the tax code of its most vital homeownership tax benefit," said NAHB Chairman Granger MacDonald."Contrary to their assertions, the Republicans are picking winners and losers," NAHB CEO Jerry Howard told The New York Times."They are picking rich Americans and corporations over small businesses and the middle class."
Here's how the GOP wants to overhaul the tax system:::::Speaker Ryan on tax reform: Typical family of four will save $1,182 in taxes 12:25 PM ET Thu, 2 Nov 2017 | 02:42 House Republicans unveiled their plan to overhaul the tax code on Thursday in what could be the biggest rewriting of the system in decades.For President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly pledged to slash taxes, passing the Tax Cut and Jobs Act would give him his first major legislative win of his administration.As part of that reform package, the GOP aims to permanently lower the corporate tax rate to 20 percent.The House bill would also slash the number of income tax brackets from seven to four: 12 percent, 25 percent, 35 percent and 39.6 percent.The bill seeks to raise the child tax credit to $1,600 from its current maximum of $1,000.It also preserves popular retirement savings plans like 401(k)s and Individual Retirement Accounts.Under current law, taxpayers can put a specified amount in 401(k) retirement savings plans without paying taxes upfront.The amount workers can contribute to a 401(k) rises to $18,500 next year, up from $18,000 in 2017.People age 50 and older can tack on a so-called catch-up contribution of $6,000.The GOP bill would also allow taxpayers to write off up to $10,000 in state and local property taxes.But the plan would cut a popular mortgage interest deduction in half.While it would maintain the current deduction of $1 million in mortgage debt for current homeowners, that cap would be slashed to $500,000 for newly purchased homes.Homebuilder stocks were hit hard on the plan.Both the SPDR S&P Homebuilder ETF and the iShares U.S. Home Construction ETF fell more than 2 percent, pacing for their worst daily performances in about a year.
Senators create bogus Facebook group to show how easy it is to spread fake news:::::Two Democratic senators recently created a fictitious Facebook group to prove just how easy it is to target specific people with fake news.Sens.Mark Warner of Virginia and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota built a group on Facebook and named it "Americans for Disclosure Solutions" which has the acronym ADS.The senators then paid Facebook to show ads to journalists and staffers on the Hill.The news was first reported by Axios.According to data provided to CNBC by Senator Warner's office, $20 was enough to reach 1,369 Hill staffers in under 24 hours.An additional $20 allowed the fake Facebook group to target 1,407 Washington, D.C.-based journalists, a spokesperson for the Senator's office explained."That's a pretty good ROI you can see why this would be so appealing to the Russians, and anybody else who is trying to target Americans in order to sow division and discord," a spokesperson in Senator Warner's office told CNBC."There are no existing policies in place to prevent running nefarious ads on Facebook.Despite registering ADS on Facebook as a "Political Organization," we were able to run an ad campaign without providing basic information necessary to ensure compliance with federal, state or local election laws, such as campaign contact information, candidate ID, etc.""Online political advertising represents an enormous marketplace, and today there is almost no transparency.The Russians realized this, and took advantage in 2016 to spread disinformation and misinformation in an organized effort to divide and distract us," Senator Warner said."Our bipartisan Honest Ads Act extends transparency and disclosure to political ads in the digital space.At the end of the day, it is not too much to ask that our most innovative digital companies work with us by exercising additional judgment and providing some transparency."The Senators were making a point: They could easily create a group and spread any narrative without having to prove who they were or what they stood for.This is what Russian-linked operatives were allegedly doing ahead of and during the U.S. presidential campaign, and why Facebook, Google and Twitter representatives testified on Capitol Hill this week.The House Intelligence Committee recently published several of the ads that Russian-controlled groups were posting.Facebook was not immediately available for comment.
3.5% economic growth is possible with GOP tax cuts, says House Financial Services chair:::::The House Republican tax reform bill that's being unveiled on Thursday morning could boost long-term economic growth above the Trump administration's goal, said retiring Rep. Jeb Hensarling.President Donald Trump, while talking about growth as high as 4 percent on the campaign trail, has been focusing lately on sustained gross domestic product advances of 3 percent.Hensarling, chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, told CNBC's "Squawk Box" on Thursday he believes the votes will be there to pass the GOP package of tax cuts for American workers and corporations."What I would encourage my colleagues to look at ... the difference between 3 and 3.2 [percent] economic growth versus 1.5 to 2 percent economic growth under the Obama plan," the Texas Republican said ahead of the unveiling of the tax plan."We are now finally, finally after a decade, seeing wages rise for working people.And right now under President Trump, we've had two quarters of 3 percent economic growth, and that's even without this plan," Hensarling said."I think we're capable of maybe 3.5 percent economic growth.That's going to be make a huge difference to everybody."However, many Democrats, including former Obama Treasury Jack Lew, believe the economy is not capable long-term growth of even 3 percent.On CNBC Wednesday, Lew predicted sustained GDP growth "north" of 2 percent."We have demographic issues that are just a constraint that anyone would face right now," he said, warning that denying such factors "could lead you to make big mistakes."One of those mistakes would be to implement the approach to tax reform that Republican leaders advocate, Lew said, arguing the U.S. can't afford it.
Major, Major Tax Cut May Not Be in Store for Middle Class:::::If those benefits do not accrue, many workers could face higher taxes while companies keep their savings or pass them on to shareholders in the form of higher dividends.Democrats assailed the bill as a corporate handout at the expense of workers.Representative Suzan DelBene, Democrat of Washington, said the bill included tax cuts for the wealthiest paid for on the backs of our children and grandchildren.Republicans, she said, "have cooked up a plan behind closed doors that could actually increase taxes on working families.The Republican architects of the bill headlined their sales pitch by saying the plan would deliver a tax break of $1,182 a year to a typical family of four earning $59,000 a year.This plan is for the middle-class families in this country who deserve a break, Paul D. Ryan, the speaker of the House and Republican of Wisconsin, said on Thursday.It is for the families who are out there living paycheck to paycheck, who just keep getting squeezed.For those families, the potential benefits are complicated.Calculations by David Kamin, a former Obama administration official who now works on tax issues at New York Universitys law school, suggest that the family cited by Mr. Ryan would see its tax cut evaporate over a decade, because of the expiring tax credit (assuming it is not extended) and a change in inflation indexing.By 2024, Mr. Kamin estimates, the familys tax bill would be higher than it would have been under the current law.If the bill simply cut income or payroll tax rates for middle-class workers and doubled the standard deduction for individuals and married couples, it would be easy for Republicans to make their middle-class case: They could just calculate the value of those changes, as the Bush administration did when it pushed its own tax cuts in 2001 and 2003.Those cuts reduced rates for the rich and for low- and middle-income earners alike.But the new bill goes beyond rate cuts and the standard deduction to eliminate many tax preferences, some of which benefit the poor and the middle class and also presumes spillover effects from returning money to corporations.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Under the current law, parents may claim personal exemptions on their tax forms for themselves, their spouses and their children.The new bill would replace those exemptions with an expanded child tax credit and a $300 personal credit for each parent.For some families, the value of the new package appears to be less than the value of the old package, so their taxes would go up.Also, the $300 credit is set to expire after five years.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Other workers will see tax increases by losing access to deductions they currently make heavy use of.Most notably, that includes workers with high out-of-pocket medical costs, who would no longer be able to deduct them under the Republican bill.If youre a middle-class family, how do you judge this?said Nancy Pelosi, the House minority leader and Democrat of California.If you own a home or want to one day, you lose.If you have a sick child or a family member with long-term medical care needs, they take away the medical deduction, you lose.If you have student loans or want to have student loans or use the credit for lifetime learning, theres a credit for lifetime learning, you lose.The Tax Foundation, an independent think tank that tends to find high growth effects from tax cuts in its models, found more hopeful results.It chose eight example tax filers last month to examine when the bill was released, and when it analyzed them on Thursday, the incomes of all eight rose from the plan.In recent weeks, White House officials have focused less on the amount of tax cuts that would flow to workers under any Republican bill and more on the wage increases that could be prompted by corporate rate cuts.The White House Council of Economic Advisers has produced two studies suggesting the cut to a 20 percent rate, as the bill calls for, could deliver a $4,000 income boost or more to an average household over time, a number that liberal economists call inflated.I would expect to see an immediate jump in wage growth, the councils chairman, Kevin Hassett, said last month.Polling suggests a middle-class message is critical for both the Republicans trying to pass a bill and the Democrats attempting to kill it.A new survey of battleground states by Global Strategy Group and Hart Research Associates, conducted on behalf of the liberal groups Not One Penny and Americans for Tax Fairness, found even a strongly pro-Trump group of voters voicing concerns over the plans effects on workers.Six of 10 respondents in the survey said they believed the plan would benefit the wealthy more than the middle class.Only two in 10 said they believed they would benefit personally.The respondents voted for Mr. Trump by a 13-point margin last year.The poll also tested attack messages on the plan and found that those that stressed its benefits to the rich and corporations were effective at eroding support for it.It puts us in a very strong position to win this battle, said Bryan Bennett, polling adviser for Not One Penny, a group formed to fight tax cuts for the wealthy.Public Opinion Strategies also conducted a poll about the tax plan recently, on behalf of the American Action Network, a conservative group that supports Republicans tax efforts.It tested which messages could move voters on the bill.One of the most effective started with this: The plan will benefit those who need it most, the middle class.
Republican Plan Delivers Permanent Corporate Tax Cut:::::Americans will still be able to make both traditional, pretax contributions and Roth contributions in the way that works best for them, Republican lawmakers said in their talking points.But the legislation includes several land mines that could complicate its passage, including limits on the popular mortgage interest deduction and caps on the state and local tax deduction, as well as its overall cost.Several Republicans from the high-tax states of New York and New Jersey said the bill would need to change to gain their support, while powerful trade groups representing the real estate industry and small businesses blasted the bill as ineffective and harmful to Americans.Contrary to their assertions, the Republicans are picking winners and losers, Jerry Howard, the chief executive of the National Association of Homebuilders, said in an interview.They are picking rich Americans and corporations over small businesses and the middle class.Meanwhile, Senate Republicans are working on their own tax bill, and on Thursday, Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee, lobbed a grenade into the House plan over its cost.As I have made clear from the beginning of this debate, it is my hope that the final legislation while allowing for current policy assumptions and reasonable dynamic scoring will not add to the deficit, sets rates that are permanent in nature and closes a minimum of $4 trillion in loopholes and special interest deductions, Mr. Corker said.Representative Kevin Brady, Republican of Texas and the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said that the House plan had the full support of Mr. Trump and predicted that it would be on the presidents desk this year.Anticipating the resistance from industry groups, Mr. Brady said, Were going to prove them wrong once and for all.Representative Peter Roskam, Republican of Illinois and a member of the Ways and Means Committee, said he was bracing for the lobbyist onslaught but would not be deterred.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Weve just finished the opening ceremonies of the lobbyist Olympics.My phone has all kinds of messages and there are all kinds of criticisms, he said.The notion of just defending the status quo is insufferable, and were not going to do it.Slide Show The bill is estimated to cost $1.5 trillion over a decade, and lawmakers must keep it at that amount if they are to pass it along party lines and avoid a filibuster by Democrats.Lawmakers have been scrambling for days to find revenue to offset tax cuts that will cost trillions of dollars.That has prompted a host of changes on the individual side, including repealing tax breaks for things like medical expenses, moving expenses, student loan interest and adoption, as well as making some business tax breaks temporary.The benefits for individual taxpayers will be mixed and depend largely on where they fall on the income scale, where they live and the types of tax breaks they tend to claim.Those making up to $24,000 will pay no income tax.For married taxpayers filing jointly, earnings up to $90,000 would be taxed in the 12 percent bracket; earnings up to $260,000 would fall in the 25 percent bracket; and earnings up to $1 million would be taxed at the 35 percent rate.For unmarried individuals and those filing separately, the bracket thresholds would be half of these amounts, other than the 35 percent bracket, which would be $200,000 for unmarried individuals.The proposal roughly doubles the standard deduction for middle-class families, expanding it to $24,000 for married couples, from $12,700, and setting it at $12,000 for individuals, from $6,530 today.Republicans also plan to expand the child tax credit to $1,600 from $1,000 and add a $300 credit for each parent and nonchild dependent, such as older family members, though that credit would expire after five years.But it also tightens rules for claiming the child tax credit, a change that would hit immigrant parents whose children were born in the United States.Filers would need to provide a work-eligible Social Security number rather than just a taxpayer identification number in order to claim the credit.The left-leaning Center on Budget Policy and Priorities said the bill would roll back eligibility for about three million children in working families, including about 80 percent of whom were born in the United States.The bill includes a host of other changes that will affect taxpayers in different ways.For instance, it repeals certain tax credits, including a 15 percent credit for individuals aged 65 or over or who are retired on disability.Right now, those individuals can claim up to $7,500 for a joint return, $5,000 for a single individual, or $3,750 for a married individual filing a joint return.The House bill would entirely repeal that tax credit.It would also repeal the adoption tax credit, no longer allow deductions for tax preparation and repeal credits for alimony payments.And deductions for moving expenses would no longer be allowed.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.One of the biggest flash points is a proposed change to the popular mortgage interest deduction.Under the Republican plan, existing homeowners can keep the deduction, but future purchases will be capped at $500,000, down from the current $1 million limit.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The National Association of Realtors came out swinging against the bill, suggesting a huge fight awaits over how real estate is treated.Eliminating or nullifying the tax incentives for homeownership puts home values and middle-class homeowners at risk, and from a cursory examination this legislation appears to do just that, said William E. Brown, the president of the association.We will have additional details upon a more thorough reading of the bill.Mr. Howard of the homebuilders group said the bill was a broken promise.It puts such severe limitations on homebuyers ability to use the mortgage interest deduction that home values will fall, he said.Another area of contention is the bills treatment of the state and local tax deduction, which is popular among many middle- and upper-middle-class taxpayers in high-cost states like New Jersey, New York and California.The House bill would limit the deduction to just property taxes, rather than state and local income taxes and general sales taxes, and cap the benefit at $10,000.Several Republican lawmakers said they would oppose the bill in its current form, including Representatives Leonard Lance and Frank A. LoBiondo of New Jersey.The proposal will double the estate tax exemption to roughly $11 million, from $5.49 million, meaning families can avoid paying taxes on large inheritance.And it eventually repeals the estate tax altogether, phasing it out entirely in six years.Business groups that include large multinationals praised the bill effusively for lowering corporate rates permanently and sharply, and for overhauling the international tax system.Advertisement Continue reading the main story For the first time, the United States is proposing to effectively levy a global minimum tax of 10 percent, which would apply to income that high-profit subsidiaries of American companies earn anywhere in the world.The effort is aimed at preventing companies from shifting profits abroad and grabbing back some of the tax revenue on income earned overseas.Those profits are currently not taxed until they are returned to the United States, giving companies an incentive to keep that money offshore since they are taxed at the current corporate tax rate of 35 percent.The White House has said more than $2.5 trillion in American profits are held offshore.The bill would force companies to pay a one-time 12 percent tax on liquid assets held overseas, like cash.The tax, which is reduced from the current 35 percent tax rate, would be payable over eight years.For illiquid assets, like equipment or property, the tax rate would be 5 percent.It would also force American subsidiaries of foreign-owned companies to pay a 20 percent excise tax on any payments sent back to foreign affiliates.Neil Bradley, the chief policy officer at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, called the bill a home run for economic growth and warned other groups against blocking it.Everyones going to look at this and find something they dont like, Mr. Bradley said.So they are going to have to decide?Am I going to help get this done?Among those less sanguine about the bill are small businesses, which said the bill does not go far enough to help them reduce their tax burden.Republicans stuck to their promise of lowering the tax rate for pass through businesses to 25 percent.But to prevent the rate from becoming a loophole for all sorts of individuals, tax writers have created a formula they say will ensure that business owners will pay a higher individual tax rate on income that they receive as wages.The formula would be applied based on the circumstances of the business.That provision is not enough to satisfy the National Federation of Independent Business, which said in a statement it is unable to support the House tax reform plan in its current form.Placing even more pressure on lawmakers, the Peter G. Peterson Foundation is planning to spend $6 million on a nationwide ad campaign, including a TV commercial, that warns against a tax plan that adds to the national debt.The message of the campaign is that overhauling the tax code should grow the economy, not the debt, said Michael A. Peterson, the president and chief executive of the foundation, which advocates reining in federal budget deficits.
Math Problem Bedevils Republican Tax Rewrite:::::Representative Kevin Brady, Republican of Texas and the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, said that the intention was to make the corporate tax cut permanent, but that it might not appear that way immediately.Thats our goal, he told reporters.I think its going to take several steps through the process to achieve that.Mr. Trump has resisted a push to reduce the cost of the corporate cut which is estimated to reduce revenues by $2 trillion over a decade by phasing it in over time.Rank-and-file Republicans in the House have pushed back against efforts to raise revenues by limiting the amount of pretax dollars Americans can save in 401(k) retirement plans and limiting deductions for state and local taxes paid.That has set off a scramble to find more revenue.Mr. Trump used his Twitter feed to toss another wrinkle into the deliberations on Wednesday when he suggested once again that Republicans should tie tax legislation to the dismantling of the Affordable Care Act.Wouldnt it be great to Repeal the very unfair and unpopular Individual Mandate in Obamacare and use those savings for further Tax Cuts, Mr. Trump said.According to the Congressional Budget Office, getting rid of the Affordable Care Acts mandate that most people have health coverage would reduce federal deficits by a total of $416 billion by 2026, mainly because fewer people would be enrolled in Medicaid and in private health plans subsidized by the government.The same analysis said that repealing the individual mandate would cause a substantial increase in the number of people without health insurance.While Republican congressional leaders originally hoped that repealing the health law and its taxes would help make their tax overhaul easier, most have decided that injecting the toxic politics of health care into the tax effort could imperil their chances of getting a bill passed.Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah and the chairman of the Finance Committee, said on Wednesday that health care should be kept out of the tax bill.Mr. Brady has also expressed concerns about marrying the two.The Republicans plan is also likely to include a major concession to social conservatives: the repeal of a law known as the Johnson Amendment, which prohibits tax-exempt entities like churches from participating in political campaigns.The law, which has been in place since 1954, has been a source of contention for many Christian conservatives who have argued that it restricts the rights of pastors and other religious leaders to speak freely.Mr. Trump has repeatedly vowed to push to eliminate the law.Advertisement Continue reading the main story At a meeting that Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin held with conservative leaders on Tuesday, he indicated that a repeal would be in the House plan, according to two people in attendance.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.As the Ways and Means Committee scurried to finish the bill by Thursday, Representative Patrick T. McHenry, Republican of North Carolina and the chief deputy whip, played down the significance of the one-day delay, while adding that Republicans were still on pace to move quickly.Arbitrary deadlines do not work, he said.We saw that with health care.Were not going to allow the idea of rolling out on a Wednesday rather than a Thursday determine something as substantive and as important as tax reform.Representative Tom MacArthur, Republican of New Jersey, said a plan was taking shape to resolve the conflict over the state and local tax deduction, which has threatened to derail the bill.Republican lawmakers from high-tax states have been adamant that the deduction remain largely intact or at least in some form that is acceptable to constituents.Mr. MacArthur said the plan would allow property taxes to be deducted, with a cap that he said needed to be higher than what had been sketched out.Im willing to accept the concept as long as it covers enough homes, and thats what Im after now, he said.Mr. MacArthur said the Ways and Means Committee appeared to be leaning toward a cap on the amount of tax dollars that you can deduct, rather than a cap based on income, but he declined to specify a dollar figure.I think unless most of New York and New Jerseys on board, the bill has a problem, Mr. MacArthur said, because theres outliers on a whole bunch of other issues where theyll lose some votes you know, a vote here, two votes there.You cant afford to lose the bulk of New York and New Jersey and have a bill go forward.Trust me if I tell you the bill is moving every hour, he said.Once the bill is released, Mr. Trumps top economic lieutenants will fan out to make the case for tax cuts.Gary D. Cohn, the director of the National Economic Council, will give a midday speech to the Economic Club of Washington, while Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, will be in Los Angeles speaking to entrepreneurs at the International Franchise Association conference.Mr. Trump said on Wednesday that the two officials would stay behind during his coming trip to Asia so that they could oversee the tax legislation.Advertisement Continue reading the main story So if I have any problems, I will be blaming Mnuchin and Cohn, Mr. Trump said ahead of a cabinet meeting.Lawmakers had not settled on a name for the bill on Wednesday afternoon, but outside groups said Mr. Trump had suggested The Cut Cut Cut Act, which House leaders had rejected.Asked about that name at a news briefing on Wednesday, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, did not say whether Mr. Trump had made the suggestion.If its called Cut Cut Cut and it includes massive tax cuts like this president is proposing, she said, I think wed perfectly be fine with that.
Justice Department Accuses A.C.L.U. of Misconduct in Abortion Case:::::WASHINGTON In an extraordinary Supreme Court filing on Friday, the Justice Department accused the American Civil Liberties Union of misconduct in the case of an undocumented teenager known as Jane Doe.The teenager obtained an abortion last month over the governments objection after an appeals court allowed it.The A.C.L.U.misled the United States as to the timing of Jane Does abortion, said Devin M. OMalley, a Justice Department spokesman.After informing Justice Department attorneys that the procedure would occur on October 26th, Jane Does attorneys scheduled the abortion for the early morning hours of October 25th, thereby thwarting Supreme Court review.In light of that, the Justice Department believes the judgment under review should be vacated, and discipline may be warranted against Jane Does attorneys.David Cole, the A.C.L.U.s legal director, said the accusations were baseless.The Trump administration blocked Jane Doe from getting constitutionally protected care for a month and subjected her to illegal obstruction, coercion, and shaming as she waited, he said.After the courts cleared the way for her to get her abortion, it was the A.C.L.U.s job as her lawyers to see that she wasnt delayed any further not to give the government another chance to stand in her way.This administration has gone to astounding lengths to block this young woman from getting an abortion, Mr. Cole said.Now, because they were unable to stop her, they are raising baseless questions about our conduct.Our lawyers acted in the best interest of our client and in full compliance with the court orders and federal and Texas law.That government lawyers failed to seek judicial review quickly enough is their fault, not ours.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The appeals court, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, ruled in favor of the teenager on Oct. 24.According to the Justice Departments brief, lawyers for the A.C.L.U.initially indicated that the abortion would take place on Oct. 26.On that understanding, the departments brief said it had planned to file an emergency application for a stay in the Supreme Court on Oct. 25.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Under Texas law, women must attend a counseling session at least 24 hours before having an abortion with the doctor who will perform the procedure.The teenager had attended such a session on Oct. 19, but the doctor she consulted was initially thought to be unavailable to perform the procedure.
Trumps Grueling Asia Trip: 5 Nations, 12 Days:::::Photo WASHINGTON President Trump has decided to attend a summit meeting of Pacific Rim leaders in the Philippines on Nov. 14, the White House said on Friday, a decision that will tack an extra day onto his already marathon tour of the region.Speaking to reporters as he left the White House for Hawaii, the first leg of his trip, Mr. Trump said he planned to spend an extra day in the Philippines at the end of his 11 days on the road.Later, the White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, confirmed that he would attend the East Asia summit, a meeting of leaders from Australia, Japan, China, Russia and other countries that his predecessor, President Barack Obama, had made a priority.Mr. Trumps earlier decision to skip the meeting had rattled officials in the region, who warned that it would raise questions about the United States commitment to Southeast Asia.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Coupled with Mr. Trumps withdrawal of the United States from the Trans-Pacific Partnership and his heavy focus on the North Korea crisis, some analysts said that if he were a no-show at the summit, it would deepen questions about Americas future in the region.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Separately, a spokesman for the Kremlin said that American and Russian officials were discussing a meeting between Mr. Trump and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, which could occur on the sidelines of the annual meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Vietnam, before Mr. Trump flies to Manila.The importance for international affairs of any contact between the Russian and U.S. presidents can hardly be overestimated, the spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, told reporters on Friday.On Thursday, Mr. Trumps national security adviser, Lt. Gen. H.R.McMaster, did not rule out a meeting.
Trump, Calling Justice Dept. Disappointing, Urges It to Investigate Democrats:::::He once again turned to the sort of name calling that has characterized his relatively short political career, assailing Crooked Hillary, Crazie Bernie Sanders and Pocahontas, a derisive nickname he has used for Senator Elizabeth Warren, the liberal Democrat from Massachusetts.He said that Mrs. Clinton stole the Democratic Primary from Mr. Sanders and asserted there was Major violation of Campaign Finance Laws and Money Laundering.Mr. Trump on Thursday acknowledged that presidents are not supposed to interfere with Justice Department investigations, but he weighed in anyway with a series of Twitter posts early Friday morning and said the department should investigate the Democrats activity during the 2016 campaign.The American public, he said, deserves it.At some point the Justice Department, and the F.B.I., must do what is right and proper, Mr. Trump said in a series of early morning Twitter posts that echoed some of the presidents comments late Thursday.Mr. Trumps demands for new investigations into Democratic campaign activity come the same week as the special counsels first charges in the investigation into Russias interference in the 2016 election.In addition to the charges against Mr. Manafort and his deputy, Rick Gates, one of Mr. Trumps foreign policy advisers pleaded guilty to lying to the F.B.I.about his efforts to connect the campaign with Russians who had dirt on Mrs. Clinton from stolen emails.It is extremely unusual for a sitting president to publicly badger his Justice Department to investigate a political opponent, but Mr. Trump has consistently tried to deflect attention away from the Russia investigation by suggesting Democrats should also be the subjects of federal inquiries.This is real collusion and dishonesty, Mr. Trump said in a Twitter post late Thursday.A recent first-person book excerpt in Politico by Donna Brazile, the former interim chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, offered new ammunition for Mr. Trump.Ms. Brazile wrote a stinging account of how Mrs. Clintons campaign gained a controlling grip on the party during the primary election contest against Mr. Sanders.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.She wrote that when she took over the party last summer she discovered that it had made a joint fund-raising agreement with Mrs. Clintons campaign the previous year that let her control the partys finances, strategy, and all the money raised and make final decisions on party staff even before she won the nomination.The party had been left in debt by President Barack Obama and needed a financial rescue, giving Mrs. Clinton control in exchange, according to Ms. Brazile.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The funding arrangement with HFA and the victory fund agreement was not illegal, but it sure looked unethical, she wrote, using the initials for Hillary for America.If the fight had been fair, one campaign would not have control of the party before the voters had decided which one they wanted to lead.This was not a criminal act, but as I saw it, it compromised the partys integrity.Mr. Trump has previously called for the Justice Department to investigate Mrs. Clinton.This week, he repeated those requests and called for the death penalty for the suspect in the recent terrorist attack in New York, even as he acknowledged on Thursday that presidents are not supposed to insert themselves into federal investigations.But you know the saddest thing, is that because Im the president of the United States I am not supposed to be involved with the Justice Department, Mr. Trump said in a radio interview on the Larry OConnor Show.I am not supposed to be involved with the F.B.I.Im not supposed to be doing the kind of things that I would love to be doing.And Im very frustrated by it.Mr. Trump added, Ill be honest, Im very unhappy with it, that the Justice Department isnt going now maybe they are, but you know as president, and I think you understand this, as a president you are not supposed to be involved in that process but hopefully they are doing something and at some point maybe we are all going to have it out.The presidents comments about the death penalty could pose problems for prosecutors and help defense lawyers for Sayfullo Saipov, the immigrant from Uzbekistan accused of carrying out the attack in New York that killed eight people and injured others.Defense attorneys could argue that Mr. Saipov could not get a fair trial when the president of the United States publicly calls for the most extreme punishment before a judge has heard any evidence.Representative Jim Himes, a Democrat from Connecticut, warned the president in a Twitter post on Friday morning that interfering with investigations is dangerous.
China Deflects Blame for Opioid Crisis as Trump Visit Nears:::::Mr. Trump has pointed to China as the drugs main source, saying it is either shipped into the United States or smuggled across the southern border by drug traffickers.Last year in the United States, about 64,000 people died of drug overdoses.A congressional commission in the United States has also found fault with China.China is the main supplier of fentanyl to the United States, Mexico, and Canada, the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission said in a report in February, citing law enforcement and drug investigators.The Chinese authorities place little emphasis on controlling its production and export, according to the report.Analysts say the countrys poorly regulated chemicals industry has helped fuel a booming trade in fentanyl.Under pressure from the United States, Beijing has banned the manufacture and sale of 23 variations of the synthetic drug, including four types this year, which a spokesman for the American Drug Enforcement Administration called a potential game-changer in February.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.China takes a strict stance on narcotics domestically, remembering how the country was ravaged by opium addiction in the 19th century, a factor in the Opium Wars.Chinese officials say that they are trying hard to combat fentanyl exporters but that doing so is a cat-and-mouse game, with drugmakers easily modifying their products to avoid detection.Mr. Wei criticized the Department of Justices public announcement last month of indictments against two major Chinese drug traffickers a case that both Beijing and Washington were working on.Last week the department highlighted the indictments against Yan Xiaobing and Jian Zhang, who are living in China, as a sign that the United States was making its fight against opioids a global one.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Saying it would hinder the investigation, Mr. Wei said, China regrets that the U.S. chose to unilaterally hold a news conference to announce the hunt for these fugitives.China has no extradition treaty with the United States, and Mr. Wei said a decision on extraditing the two men would be dependent on evidence that the Americans could provide or the Chinese could unearth.Saying that fentanyl abuse does not exist in China, Mr. Wei said the authorities had nonetheless responded forcefully to the crisis in the United States by banning more fentanyl analogues than those on a United Nations drug bodys list of controlled substances.He stressed that the Chinese government takes into full account the concerns of the international community, including the United States, and has continued to take legislative measures and actions to control the flow of illicit drugs.Once China controls a substance, it has a dramatic effect on the United States in terms of lives saved, Lance Ho, the Beijing-based country attach for the Drug Enforcement Administration, said at the news conference.
Sarah Huckabee Sanders Makes the Heart Grow Fonder:::::She has perfected the presidents I-know-you-are-but-what-am-I manner of public debate and insisted this week not only that Clinton was the one in cahoots with the Russians but also that journalists were guilty of making a needless story out of the Civil War.She went so far as to take profound personal offense that anyone could read Kellys remarks, which bizarrely pinned that conflict on a generic failure to compromise, as a minimization of slavery.He was pristine.His critics were pigs.General Kelly was simply making the point that just because history isnt perfect, it doesnt mean its not our history, she said on Tuesday with an impossibly straight face, utterly ignoring Kellys compromise comment and his gauzy eulogy of Robert E. Lee.She added that journalists refusal to brush off those tangents was the truly outrageous and absurd development.Thus she aced her favorite trick: the moral inversion of the universe.Other press secretaries demonized the media, but not as ambitiously and artlessly as she.On Wednesday, she was reminded of her recent statement that all leaders have flaws, and she was asked to name one of Trumps.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.Probably that he has to deal with you guys on a daily basis, she said.She needs a vocabulary lesson.The bloat of Trumps ego is a flaw.The plunge of his necktie: also a flaw.Being answerable to a skeptical news media may be an inconvenience or, for someone as thin-skinned as he is, an absolute torment but its not a flaw.It also happens to be a vital component of democracy, should she and her boss care to reacquaint themselves with that.When her boss does something execrable, she validates it at greater length and with more passion than most paid sycophants would muster.She chalked up that tweet of his about Mika Brzezinski (bleeding badly from a face-lift) to a laudably bold retaliation against a merciless adversary, and she used it as a springboard to swoon over him anew.I think the American people elected somebody whos tough, whos smart and whos a fighter, she said.And thats Donald Trump.She zealously parrots his contention that theres no evidence of anything untoward between his campaign and Russia, dismissing his hapless namesakes infamous meeting in Trump Tower with a Russian emissary as pretty standard campaign operating procedure.Advertisement Continue reading the main story She edits out the revelation that George Papadopoulos once named by Trump himself as an important adviser to the campaign was trying to coordinate with Moscow.When that news broke on Monday, she said that it had nothing to do with the president.So began an audacious week when she came into her mendacious own.She asserted that Trump had not politicized the deaths of eight people in Lower Manhattan because the immigration complaints that he almost instantly raised were ones that he had bellowed about before.So he was what grandfathered in?Well, then, so are gun-control advocates who react to yet another mass shooting by repeating their observation that this nation is drowning in firearms.Jim Acosta of CNN asked her why, at a cabinet meeting on Wednesday, Trump called the American justice system a joke and a laughingstock.Thats not what he said, she shot back its like a reflex with her and later added, He said the process has people calling us a joke and calling us a laughingstock.Wow.Huge difference.Small problem: Acostas description of Trumps remarks came closer to his verbatim words than her tortured, wishful version did.Shes awful at this, but that makes her an excellent fit for an administration in which mediocrity, inadequate experience and nepotism run rampant.Besides, shes serving a function other than communication, which turns out not to be her forte.(To listen to her pronounce priorities is akin to hearing the air seep out of a flat tire, and she leaves half of the consonants on the curb.)Shes a bogus message to Middle America that Trumps White House is really a homespun, family-values kind of place.Hence her repeated references to being a working mom and managing a boisterous brood at home.Hence her invocation of religion shes the daughter of a rather well-known pastor when asked during one briefing how shed explain Trumps worst behavior to her own children.When it comes to role models, as a person of faith, I think we all have one perfect role model, she answered, characteristically using a non sequitur as an evasion.I point to God.I point to my faith.And thats where I would tell my kids to look.Advertisement Continue reading the main story But if theyre to look away from Trump, why does she so willingly look up to him?And how does she square her faith with the purveyance of so much gobbledygook?Maybe she tells herself that theres no contradiction.That would be her grandest fiction of all.
Season of the Witch:::::Advertisement Michelle Goldberg Season of the Witch Image Credit Jens Meyer/Associated Press On a Wednesday evening last week, I sat in on a class called Witchcraft 101: Curses, Hexes and Jinxes, at Catland, a fashionable occult boutique in Bushwick, Brooklyn.More than a dozen people, most of them young women, sat in folding chairs in the stores black-walled event space.The instructor was one of Catlands co-owners, Dakota Bracciale, a charismatic, foul-mouthed 28-year-old former M.A.C.makeup artist dressed in flowing black, with a beard and long, lavender nails.If youre not ready to admit that the universe is chaos, Im not sure how far youre going to go, Bracciale said to the class, describing witchcraft as a way to exercise power in a world without transcendent moral rules, a supernatural technology for taking care of yourself when no one else will.Witchcraft, Bracciale said, lets you be the arbiter of your own justice.I suspect that this assumption of chaos the sense that institutions have failed and no one is in charge helps explain the well-documented resurgence of occultism among millennials.Attempts at spell-casting are obviously not unique to todays young people; the Washington writer and hostess Sally Quinn just published a book in which she boasts about hexing the renowned magazine editor Clay Felker, my former journalism professor, before his death from cancer.Still, magic and witchcraft have a renewed cachet, one that seems related to our current climate of political and cultural breakdown.Witches are everywhere these days, says the introduction to Basic Witches, a cheeky how-to book about witchcraft published in August.At Catland, along with candles, pheasant feet and little jars of mouse bones, you can buy the beautifully produced feminist witchcraft magazine Sabat , whose covers feature black-and-white photos of gorgeous girls looking like pensive pop stars.There are a surprising number of magical paraphernalia subscription boxes.Why the Witch Is the Pop-Culture Heroine We Need Right Now, said the headline of a recent piece on New York Magazines Vulture site, part of its Witch Week Halloween series.Some of this vogue is about witch-as-metaphor, an icon that captures the boiling rage and determined independence of legions of nasty women.But some of it is a real, if eclectic, spiritual practice, adopted by people skeptical of organized religion but unfulfilled by atheism.Its these sincere attempts to use magic that interest me, because occultism often gains currency during times of social crisis.There was a vibrant spiritualist movement in pre-Civil War America, and during the war the first lady, Mary Todd Lincoln, is said to have held sances in the White House.Occultism flourished in pre-revolutionary Russia and Weimar Germany as well as in the churning, distraught America of the 1970s.Often when traditional institutions and beliefs collapse and people are caught between cultural despair and cosmic hopes, they turn to magic.As Bracciale told me, If the powers that be and established structures are leaving you by the wayside, and there is this thing which essentially offers a back door in, or a way to manipulate circumstances, why wouldnt you try it?Bracciale, who uses the gender-neutral pronouns they and them, grew up in an evangelical household somewhere between Jesus Camp and snake handlers and said that the new atheism of Richard Dawkins and Christopher Hitchens had a profound effect on their generation.But atheism wasnt enough, said Bracciale: It left this huge vacuum, and that vacuum had to be filled with something.This is a familiar pattern.Theosophy, the mother of all new age movements, was founded in the 19th century as the discoveries of Charles Darwin undermined faith in Christian creation stories, which led some to abandon religion altogether but others to embrace new forms of mysticism.The rise of occultism among the counterculture of the 1960s and 70s befuddled scholars who assumed that American society was moving toward ever-greater secularism.The dominant sociological model of the time, a University of Chicago professor wrote in 1970, cannot cope with the new manifestations of the sacred on the college campus and in the communes where the collegians go when they flee from the campus.Today, too, technocratic rationality is losing its hold.Though youth culture occultism predates Donald Trumps presidency, Bracciale believes the calamity of the election accelerated interest in witchcraft.Witchcraft itself has certainly gotten political.Every month, thousands of witches, neo-pagans and other magic practitioners virtually join together to cast a binding spell on Trump: So that he may fail utterly.That he may do no harm.(The pop star Lana Del Rey has participated .)When a big crisis is happening, then maybe you feel powerless to do anything through whatever tangible means are available to you, Jaya Saxena, one of the co-authors of Basic Witches, told me.Youre not a politician.Maybe you dont have a ton of money.Youre not in control of all this stuff that ends up very much affecting you, and you look for ways in your individual life to change that.Catland has held three packed ceremonies to hex Trump, which involve the use of cursing ingredients as well as the recitation of Psalm 109: Let his days be few, and let another take his office.Let his children be fatherless, and his wife a widow.Let his children be continually vagabonds, and beg; let them seek their bread also from their desolate places.It might seem strange for people who reject monotheism to chant Bible verses, but Bracciale often uses the Book of Psalms as a spellbook.(Wary of cultural appropriation, some of todays young occultists look for esoteric strains in their own cultures rather than borrowing from foreign traditions.)Bracciale notes, savoring the irony, that for eight years, some Christian prayer warriors used the same imprecatory psalm against Obama.They just use thoughts and prayers, and we know what those are worth, Bracciale said with contempt.With us, theres structure around it, there is a methodology behind it.For decades now, the right has spiritualized political warfare, treating it as a metaphysical contest between good and evil.Its not surprising that the rise of Trump, a person who for many represents the inversion of all decent values, would create a supernatural reaction on the left.Millennial occultists might seem silly to outsiders, but you dont have to believe in hexes, witchcraft or magic to take them seriously as a sign that many people find the present intolerable.Just under the surface of American culture, something furious is brewing.

Ivanka Trump, a Media Darling in Japan, Draws Light Turnout in Tokyo:::::Perhaps another hint could be found in the Japanese publics view of Mr. Trump: According to a survey last month by the Pew Research Center, less than a quarter of the population is confident that Mr. Trump will do the right thing in world affairs, down 54 percentage points from the confidence expressed for President Barack Obama last year.Still, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is one of Mr. Trumps closest allies among world leaders and Mr. Abe has steadfastly supported the Trump administration in its aggressive stance toward North Korea.Photo Commentators in Japan have suggested Ms. Trump played an instrumental role in planting the seeds of that relationship, which has since blossomed with the leaders shared love of golf, which they are scheduled to play during Mr. Trumps visit.Mr. Trump didnt like Japan at first, Katsuya Konishi, a journalist, said on a morning news show on TV Asahi on Friday.But he gradually changed his mind.I think it was the influence of Ivanka.She said Prime Minister Abe is smart and advised Mr. Trump to listen to him.Ms. Trumps appearance at the World Assembly for Women added a touch of celebrity glamour to the event, and was consistent with Mr. Abes approach to female empowerment, in which public gestures have outstripped genuine change.In his introductory remarks at the Friday event, Mr. Abe invoked his oft-stated goal of creating a society in which women can shine.But concrete changes have been slow to materialize.This week, the World Economic Forum released its annual Global Gender Gap Report, which ranked Japan 114th out of 144 countries in making progress toward gender equality.In a parliamentary election last month, women won about only one in 10 seats.And while Mr. Abe said that 1.5 million more women have joined the work force since he became prime minister five years ago, making women about 45 percent of the total in Japan, more than half of them work in part-time jobs with lower benefits and fewer hopes of career advancement.Advertisement Continue reading the main story What is Ivanka Trump going to be to Japan more than a celebrity figure?said Nancy Snow, a professor of diplomacy at Kyoto University of Foreign Studies who attended the speech.Is she really going to up the ante here or move the needle?Its sort of window dressing and making Japan maybe feel better about itself, despite these statistics.Among Japanese, reaction to Ms. Trumps visit reflected some entrenched attitudes toward women.Several commentators on TV Asahi noted the salmon-colored, miniskirted suit that Ms. Trump wore to her speech, and one suggested that her skirt was rather short for a presidential adviser.Several women who attended Ms. Trumps speech commented on her appearance in explaining why they admired her.Photo She is a beautiful female leader, Rena Hayakawa, 21, a political science major at Meiji University in Tokyo, said before the speech.Her fashion is great.She is a role model for women.Maina Tanaka, 33, a financial trade dealer, said that she appreciated Ms. Trumps fair views on politics and economy and that she respected how Ms. Trump stays positive and gorgeous.Mieko Nakabayashi, a professor of politics at Waseda University, said Ms. Trumps glamour would draw attention to the cause of women.Shes not just an official, but also a princess of the president, said Ms. Nakabayashi, who spent a decade working as a budget staff member in the United States Senate.So that kind of celebrity is really liked in Japan.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Ms. Nakabayashi added that many Japanese women were not yet conscious about the large pay gap between men and women.Therefore, for the Japanese government, getting attention is really an important step.In her speech, Ms. Trump focused on initiatives in the United States, citing the presidents budget plan for paid family leave and his administrations proposed tax changes, which she said would put more money back in the pockets of hard-working Americans.She also called for countries like the United States and Japan to empower women who live in countries that prevent them from leading.Advertisement Continue reading the main story In Mr. Abes introductory remarks, he said Japan would contribute $50 million to the Women Entrepreneurs Finance Initiative, a program that aims to lend money to womens businesses that Ms. Trump helped introduce at the Group of 20 summit meeting in Hamburg, Germany, in July.Critics noted that Ms. Trump, who did not take any questions from the audience or the news media, did not address concerns about how workers are treated at factories in China and Indonesia that manufacture clothing for the fashion brand that Ms. Trump founded.Over the summer, Ms. Trumps brand called off a deal with a large Japanese clothing company after learning that its largest shareholder was a government-owned bank.
White Nationalist Richard Spencer Is Barred From Speaking at a Federal Building:::::Michigan State University, Ohio State University and Pennsylvania State University have all recently denied Mr. Spencer the space to speak on campus.But he was permitted to book a speaking venue last month at the University of Florida though it led to a campuswide outcry and a state of emergency declaration by Rick Scott, the Florida governor.The right to reserve event space at the Reagan building comes with its own idiosyncrasies.Owned by the General Services Administration, it is the first and only federal building dedicated to government and private use.The Reagan building is operated by Trade Center Management Associates, a private firm that oversees event spaces in the sprawling complex.Debra Cope, a spokeswoman for the management group, said the Reagan building is unique in that it is a public-private partnership that operates differently from other federal buildings.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.In a statement, a General Services Administration spokeswoman said that the agency does not have the authority to consider requests to hold events in the part of the building that Mr. Spencer sought to reserve.The building managements misgivings are partly a response to last years conference, which drew hundreds of protesters and required dozens of police officers to control the crowd.Ms.Cope described violent incidents, arrests and threats to building employees during that protest, and noted that the building was damaged in some places.Additionally, she said, Mr. Spencers meeting and the protests against it disrupted another event in the building that was taking place at the same time.Last years commotion did not deter Mr. Spencers plans to return to the site for this years annual meeting.In August, he urged supporters to join us in Washington in an email promoting the conference at the Reagan building.That same month, Mr. Spencer was a keynote speaker at a white nationalist march in Charlottesville, Va., to protest the removal of a statue of Robert E. Lee in a city park.A 32-year-old woman, Heather D. Heyer, was killed when one of the protesters plowed his car into a crowd of people who were holding a counterdemonstration against the white nationalists.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The Reagan building management said in a statement that it rejected Mr. Spencers application in part because of the National Policy Institutes participation in the Charlottesville protests.Mr. Spencer may have a valid complaint about being barred from speaking in a space owned by the government, said Laura Beth Nielsen, a professor at Northwestern University and a research professor at the American Bar Foundation.But, she said, that does not mean he has a winning case.One thing most people dont know: The First Amendment only prohibits the government from restricting your speech, said Ms. Nielsen, who specializes in matters of hate speech and First Amendment rights.The question is, How do you think about the kind of speech that might pose a threat of violence?Whose obligation is it to secure the space?The government can restrict speech when they think the person is going to incite lawless activity, she added.Its not just that it can.It might be obligated to.Thursdays decision could hint at a more theatrical standoff between Mr. Spencer and the federal government in the future especially if taxpayers have to pay the bill for the police and other security forces to keep his events under control.Of course the state cant stop that person from speaking, Ms. Nielsen said.But whats our financial and moral obligation to give that speech a platform when it would be really expensive to do that safely?
Hillary Clinton Gets an Award and Tears Are Shed:::::The double standard that applies to women in politics is alive and well, Mrs. Clinton said in a so-called fireside chat with Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California.Ambitious is a compliment for men and its not for women.Mrs. Clintons appearance signaled the continuation of the Democratic mourning process that has persisted since the election, even as drama continues to mark her campaign.On Thursday, Politico published a first-person article by Donna Brazile, the former chair of the Democratic National Committee, who wrote that the Clinton campaign in 2016 controlled the committee and rigged the nomination process.Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, made the same accusation on CNN on Thursday.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Ms. Brazile also wrote that the Clinton campaign had used a joint fund-raising agreement that would grant it control over strategy in exchange for raising funds.Ms. Brazile characterized the agreement as a cancer for the Democratic Party.Through a spokeswoman, officials for the party disagreed.Joint fund-raising committees were created between the DNC and both Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders in attempt to raise the general election funds needed to win in 2016, Xochitl Hinojosa, the communications director for the committee, wrote in an email on Thursday.Clinton was the only candidate who raised money for the party through her joint fund-raising committee with the DNC, which would benefit any candidate coming out of the presidential primary process.But intraparty tension was not on the Democratic womens clubs agenda.In the midst of stacks of copies of Mrs. Clintons memoir, What Happened, and a man outside the building selling T-shirts emblazoned with her photo and the caption The Peoples Choice, Mrs. Clinton was more focused on the external forces she believed brought about her downfall.In terms of affecting the momentum of the race, she said, a letter sent by James B. Comey, the director of the F.B.I.in 2016, was the proximate cause.The letter reopened an investigation into Mrs. Clintons emails days before the election.Still, Mrs. Clinton also displays an edgy sense of humor.At a book tour stop in Chicago on Monday, she was asked what her Halloween costume would be.I think I will maybe come as the president!she said to laughter from the crowd.At the Womens National Democratic Club, Mrs. Clinton received a standing ovation as she left the room.
House to Vote on Child Health Care, but Funding Will Remain in Limbo:::::About 4.7 percent of children under 19 were uninsured last year, down by about two-thirds from 1997, when the child health program was created.More than eight million children are insured through CHIP.We know that states are going to run out of money pretty quickly, Representative Greg Walden, Republican of Oregon, the chief author of the bill to pump money into CHIP, said this week.They are pounding on our door, as they should.Republicans and Democrats in the House and the Senate have agreed to provide money for the child health program for five years and for community health centers another popular program for two years.They have also agreed to delay cuts in federal payments to hospitals that treat a disproportionate share of uninsured and Medicaid patients.But the question of how to pay for these measures, a cost of roughly $23 billion, has made further progress uncertain.House Republicans want to take money from a fund created by the Affordable Care Act that pays for a wide range of public health efforts, like preventing diabetes, vaccinating children, reducing the use of tobacco and fighting the opioid epidemic.To help offset the cost of new spending, the House Republican bill would shorten the grace period for consumers who fail to pay their share of premiums for health insurance purchased through a marketplace established under the Affordable Care Act.Several hundred thousand people could lose coverage as a result, and the government would save money because it would no longer subsidize their insurance, the Congressional Budget Office says.Republicans say that some states have used the prevention fund as a slush fund, and that some consumers have abused the grace period to obtain a full years coverage while paying premiums for only nine months.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Democrats are outraged that Republicans insist on offsetting every dollar of new spending on the child health program while pushing a tax bill that could add as much as $1.5 trillion to federal budget deficits over 10 years.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.None of the tax cuts being talked about are paid for, said Representative Anna G. Eshoo, Democrat of California.Representative Frank Pallone Jr. of New Jersey, the senior Democrat on the Energy and Commerce Committee, said the bill effectively pays for two worthy health programs by undermining the Affordable Care Act.This is robbing Peter to pay Paul, Mr. Pallone said.Republicans are taking money from the Prevention and Public Health Fund to pay for CHIP and community health centers.On the other side of the Capitol, senators have been working in a spirit of bipartisan comity, though they too have not agreed on how to pay for CHIP and community health centers.They are unlikely to accept the cuts in the House Republican bill.The chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, takes immense pride in having created the child health program in collaboration with Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, in 1997, when Bill Clinton was president and Republicans controlled both houses of Congress.Mr. Hatch is working now with Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the senior Democrat on the committee.The last three presidents, Mr. Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama, were ardent supporters of community health centers.But funds for that program were allowed to expire last month.Dr. Neil S. Calman, the president and chief executive of the Institute for Family Health, which operates 31 community health centers in New York, said the uncertainty over federal funding affects every decision he makes.He has deferred hiring doctors and nurses and put off purchases of dental chairs and other equipment because we know we soon wont have the money.I just dont understand why the parties cant get together to figure out how to provide the money for a program they both support, Dr. Calman said.Advertisement Continue reading the main story While Congress squabbles, state officials agonize over the uncertainty.Carrie Williams, a spokeswoman for the Texas Health and Human Services Commission, said the state expected to exhaust its CHIP funds in January or early February and was already making preparations because state law requires officials to notify families at least 30 days before coverage is ended.The Texas program covers more than 400,000 children.Cathy Caldwell, director of the CHIP program in Alabama, said state officials would have to revise computer eligibility systems, notify families and perform many other tasks before funds run out in February or March.With such a short timeline, she said, I dont know how we could get it all done.We assume that funding will be continued, Ms. Caldwell said.But we have a great fear.What if its not?There would be real disruption.Nathan Checketts, the deputy director of the Utah Health Department, said he was confident that Congress and President Trump would eventually fund the program, but he was not sure they would act in time to prevent a gap in coverage for children.
Rogue Twitter Employee Briefly Shuts Down Trumps Account:::::Photo This is the way the world ends: not with a bang but a deleted Twitter account.At least, so it appeared for 11 minutes Thursday evening, when visitors to President Trumps personal account, @realDonaldTrump, were informed that there was no such thing.The error message on some devices was even more dire: @realDonaldTrump does not exist.Amid a presidency that has seemed, at times, to be conducted primarily in 140-character pieces, this was a seismic event and what was left of Twitter erupted.It was a raucous, modern-day town-square gathering of the sort not seen since well, since five months ago, when Mr. Trump coined a new word in the middle of the night.It was just before 7 p.m. Thursday, and the internet was in an uproar.Time stopped.The sun rose in the west and set in the east.What, the watchers wondered, was going on?Had Twitter closed the presidents account?Had a White House aide snatched the phone from Mr. Trumps tweeting hands?Had Robert Mueller chosen this moment to rifle through the presidents direct messages?Had Mr. Trump himself could it be?decided hed had enough of his favorite medium?The answer, revealed three hours later, was something straight out of Office Space.After saying in an initial statement that the account had been inadvertently deactivated due to human error by a Twitter employee, Twitter announced that a rogue customer support worker had done it on his or her last day at the company.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Many of Mr. Trumps supporters were incensed, with some saying the incident showed a disregard for free speech.His opponents, on the other hand, were gleeful.America: Hire this person, former Representative John Dingell of Michigan tweeted.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.Even before Twitter confirmed that the deactivation had been deliberate, some were speculating about it.In the tech world, the statement raised more questions than it answered.Twitter has never said how many employees have access to Mr. Trumps account, or described the safeguards it has in place for its highest-profile users.And the company is already under the microscope in Washington, where Congress is investigating how technology giants might have shaped the outcome of the 2016 presidential election.
A Tax Cut That Lifts the Economy? Opinions Are Split:::::Its hard to see the stimulative benefit on the economy, said Lawrence H. Summers, a Treasury secretary under President Bill Clinton.Most of the benefits as best I can tell will go to wealthy people.The idea that youre going to get a huge spur to growth is delusional.Such dismissiveness failed to deter fans of the twin pillars of the House bill: lowering the top nominal tax rate on corporations to 20 percent from 35 percent, and changing the way global profits are taxed.This will make the United States a better place to invest and a better place to be headquartered in, said Mihir A. Desai, an economist at Harvard Business School who has at times complained about the White Houses economic claims.Under the current system, multinational corporations have been shopping around the globe for countries with low tax rates where they can locate their profits and sometimes their operations.Those global profits are taxed by the United States, but only after they are booked at home.The result is that companies warehouse trillions of dollars offshore, indefinitely postponing the payment of United States taxes.Tax rates dont single-handedly drive investment decisions, and even now deductions and tax credits often shove the rate paid by corporations far below the 35 percent maximum.Still, many economists argue that matching or undercutting the top rate in other advanced industrialized countries particularly in Western Europe should encourage investment and productivity.Slashing the rate to 20 percent is a pretty dramatic change in the attractiveness of the United States relative to other countries, said Alan Viard, a tax specialist at the conservative American Enterprise Institute.Companies were noncommittal on how the plan might actually change their tax practices like those of Corning, the glass and ceramics manufacturer, which had $3.2 billion of cash and cash equivalents outside the country on March 31.Given the complexity of our U.S. taxation system, a spokesman said Thursday, the devil will lie in the details of any new legislation.Follow the Money The tax code has rewarded companies for warehousing profits abroad.These 30 companies

abroad.Most other nations have embraced some version of this approach, known as a territorial system.Advertisement Continue reading the main story But economists are split on whether that will reduce or worsen global tax avoidance.The bill proposes a global minimum tax of 10 percent to ensure that companies will have to pay something no matter where they have their headquarters.If they pay a lower rate in a foreign country, they would have to remit the difference to the United States.What could bite even harder is a proposal to tack a 20 percent excise tax on transactions between multinationals and their foreign affiliates to deter them from stripping profits out of the United States tax base.No safeguards are foolproof, supporters concede, but they argue thats the price of admission.The reality is, base-erosion rules will always be messy and imperfect, said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a conservative economist and a former director of the Congressional Budget Office.If you want a territorial system, get over it.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Yet if the House plan resolves some longstanding issues with the corporate tax code, it also creates new ones.Congress has, in effect, set aside $1.5 trillion over the next 10 years to pay for revisions to the tax code, but to keep the cost of the plan to that limit, the Republican leadership is relying on financing gimmicks to phase in some provisions, or put time limits on others.A proposal that allows companies to immediately deduct business expenses rather than stretching them over a number of years potentially has the most impact on smaller companies that need money to build up or expand their business.Indeed a hefty chunk of the administrations growth estimates is based on the extra investing it is supposed to cause.But the proposal has a five-year time limit.If expensing goes away at the end of 2022, they should not expect any permanent growth effect, said Mr. Viard of the American Enterprise Institute.For businesses, predictability about the tax code is as important as any specific alteration.And temporary measures that obscure the costs

United States, which should, in turn, produce more jobs and stockholder returns.Advertisement Continue reading the main story They want to create a system that is widely judged as fair.And they need to collect enough revenue to keep the lights on.That includes having the money to cover Social Security payments, antiterrorism measures and disaster relief, as well as maintaining or upgrading the

shrift.The corporate rate cuts are a windfall immediately for stockholders, and not workers, said Steven M. Rosenthal, a tax lawyer and senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center.And because 35 percent of United States stocks are foreign-owned, he calculated that $70 billion a year of the tax benefits would go to people in other countries.As for working people, he labeled the supposed benefits a sideshow because they come so far down the road and are so speculative.As economists can attest, American competitiveness can be an elusive concept.Business folks wont describe it like this, but I think the best way to describe what it means to be more competitive is to describe it in terms of increasing the standard of living of the American people, said Michael J. Graetz, a professor of tax law at Columbia Law School.If it doesnt do that, then why do we care?
Lovers, Prospectors and Predators:::::I still think most men, when they are children, grow up in that room.But when they hit adolescence a strange thing happens.That room basically drops from common culture.So a lot of men cross the threshold and enter another room, the room of the prospector.In this room sex is a gold nugget, a pleasure, like any other pleasure, except maybe its better and the desire for it is stronger.If youre straight, women are the people who can give you this pleasure.When you go to a college party or a club, youre on the prowl for women who want to share this pleasure with you.Most pop songs are about this kind of conquest.Girl I want your body.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.In this room, sex is almost like a market transaction.You can measure yourself by how successful you are, which depends on how hot you are or how smooth you are.You can rack up victories.But a small percentage of men are not satisfied with this room and they cross over to the next room, the predators room.In this room, the pleasures of sex get mixed up with the pleasures of power.Harassment is not just sex and its not just power; its a wicked mixture of the two.Harassers possess what psychologists call hostile masculinity; they apparently get pleasure from punishing the women who arouse them.There hasnt been enough research into what goes on in the minds of harassers, but the studies we do have suggest a few things.There are no standard personality types.But predators do seem to start young, often beginning their predatory behavior in college.They are not looking for a relationship.Narcissistically, they are unwilling to acknowledge what their victim is feeling.They have morally obliterated that person.But they are far from irrational.They perpetrate their acts in male-dominated environments where they think they can get away with harassing women.Advertisement Continue reading the main story There are three points to be made about this situation.First, one key element in any relationship is how well you see the other person.In the first room people see each other deeply.In the second regime they see each other in a degraded way.In the third regime the harasser doesnt see his victim at all.The men who have recently been exposed say they had no idea how much pain they were causing.Second, the line between the prospector room and the predator room is getting blurrier.On campuses, the few predators use the general prospector atmosphere as a perfect playground for their exploitation.More important, in the public mind the line between unwanted sexual attention and force is growing indistinct.In the political world, for example, partisans of left and right rationalize their support for Bill Clinton or Donald Trump because they could tell themselves in effect, Oh, hes just a horny prospector.By treating such behavior as locker-room talk or laddish behavior, they helped smooth the ground for all the predators to come.Finally, one core problem is the collapse of the first room, the room of love.It is necessary but not enough to have a negative vision of what men should not do.It would also be nice if there were some positive vision of how sexuality fits into a rich life, how it flourishes in the private sphere as a (very fun) form of deep knowing.If we had a clearer concept of a beautiful relationship wed also have a clearer concept of what predatory behavior looks like and what it takes to eradicate it.In a degraded environment, the predators, who are few and vicious, are more likely to be tolerated by the many, who are numb.
Donald Trump, Paul Ryan and the Con Man Caucus:::::But these big tax cuts would blow a multitrillion-dollar hole in the budget, so Republicans have been scrambling to find pay-fors that limit the addition to the deficit.What they came up with was a hodgepodge of stuff: ending deductions for some state and local taxes, limiting deductions for mortgage interest, phasing out child tax credits, and so on.Since the point of these measures is to offset tax cuts for the rich, they will, more or less by definition, end up raising taxes on large numbers of middle-class families.Will this bill pass the House?Unclear: Some important interest groups, like homebuilders and the small-business lobby, have already declared opposition.In any case, it almost surely cant become law in anything like its current form: A tax bill cant pass the Senate with less than 60 votes if it raises the long-term budget deficit, which this bill surely does.In fact, this bill might not even get a simple Senate majority.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.So right now tax cuts are looking like health care redux: With many years to prepare, Republicans turn out to be completely unready for prime time.But how did they get to this point?The answer is that this weeks debacle was predictable from the moment, more than seven years ago, that Ryan began establishing himself as a media darling by publishing impressive-looking blueprints for fiscal reform with titles like Roadmap for Americas Future.Like the bill just released, all these blueprints included huge tax cuts for corporations and the wealthy; but Ryan insisted that any revenue losses would be made up for by ending unjustified tax breaks.Which tax breaks would he eliminate?He refused to say.These evasions worked brilliantly as a public relations strategy.Those who warned about his plans phoniness were ignored.Ryan even received awards for fiscal responsibility.Advertisement Continue reading the main story But actual legislation cant close huge fiscal gaps with vague promises.To hand out those big tax cuts while raising the deficit by only $1.5 trillion, Republicans needed to find real money somewhere, and that turns out to be really hard.The big question should be, why do any of this?Ryan used to claim that his plans were about reducing the budget deficit, but he has now given up that pretense.And why should tax cuts even be on the table?We have budget deficits, not surpluses, and lots of unmet needs for future spending.U.S. taxes are low, not high, compared with other wealthy countries.Predictions that tax cuts will lead to rapid economic growth have been wrong time and again.And by large margins, voters want taxes on corporations and the wealthy to go up, not down.The ruling theory among Republicans seems to be that going into the midterm elections they need a win to offset their failure to repeal Obamacare.I guess this might be right, although its a theory that reveals extraordinary contempt for voters, who are supposed to be impressed by the G.O.P.s ability to ram through policies that only benefit a tiny elite.However the politics turn out, this is remarkably terrible policy, devised via a remarkably terrible process.Most Americans realize that Donald Trump is a very bad president; they need to realize that his partys congressional leadership is pretty awful, too.
Trump and Sessions Denied Knowing About Russian Contacts. Records Suggest Otherwise.:::::He went into the pitch right away, said J. D. Gordon, a campaign adviser who attended the meeting.He said he had a friend in London, the Russian ambassador, who could help set up a meeting with Putin.Mr. Trump listened with interest.Mr.Sessions vehemently opposed the idea, Mr. Gordon recalled.And he said that no one should talk about it, because Mr.Sessions thought it was a bad idea that he did not want associated with the campaign, he said.Several of Mr. Trumps campaign advisers attended the March 2016 meeting, and at least two of those advisers are now in the White House: Hope Hicks, the communications director, and Stephen Miller, a senior policy adviser.After Mr. Trump was sworn in, he could not escape questions about Russia.At a Feb. 16, 2017, White House news conference, a reporter asked Mr. Trump, Can you say whether you are aware that anyone who advised your campaign had contacts with Russia during the course of the election?No, Mr. Trump said.Nobody that I know of.Nobody.The White House has sought to portray Mr. Papadopoulos as an insignificant figure in the campaign.Ty Cobb, the White House lawyer dealing with matters related to Mr. Muellers investigation, said the White House stood behind the presidents comments.The medias willingness to inflate Papadopoulos, a young unpaid volunteer and supposed energy expert, into an important thought leader in the campaign or Russian operative is ludicrous, Mr. Cobb said.The evidence so far suggests he attended one meeting, said something about Russia and was immediately shut down by everyone in the room.Its very important to remember that he is not a criminal now because of anything he did for the campaign he is a criminal because he initially lied to the F.B.I.Advertisement Continue reading the main story A Justice Department spokesman declined to comment.Another member of the foreign policy team, Carter Page, said on Thursday that he told Mr.Sessions in passing in June 2016 that he planned to travel to Russia for a trip completely unrelated to his volunteer role in the campaign.Understandably, it was as irrelevant then as it is now, Mr.Page said.Mr.Page traveled twice to Russia in 2016.Democrats in the Senate said on Thursday that they would push to have Mr.Sessions return to the Judiciary Committee for further questioning.He now needs to come back before the committee, in person, under oath, to explain why he cannot seem to provide truthful, complete answers to these important and relevant questions, said Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, who is on the Judiciary Committee.Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, another Democrat on the committee, pointed out that Mr. Sessionss testimony was under oath and wasnt just some random comment he made in passing on the street.Mr.Sessions faced similar questions in January before the Senate Judiciary Committee, when Senator Al Franken, Democrat of Minnesota, asked him about contacts between the campaign and Russia.Im not aware of any of those activities, Mr.Sessions said.He denied having any such contacts himself.Democrats condemned those remarks as misleading when it was revealed that Mr.Sessions held meetings with the Russian ambassador during the campaign.Last month, Mr. Franken renewed his questioning.You dont believe that surrogates from the Trump campaign had communications with the Russians?he asked.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.I did not, and Im not aware of anyone else that did, Mr.Sessions replied.And I dont believe it happened.He did not make any reference to Mr. Papadopoulos.Mr.Sessions has said he answered honestly because he was being questioned in the context of Russian officials continuously exchanging information with campaign advisers.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Gordon said that while the March 2016 meeting technically contradicted Mr. Sessionss testimony, he defended the attorney general.This is something he heard way back in March from some young man who was not authorized to speak for the campaign, he said.I dont blame Senator Sessions for not remembering that.He said that only in the political gotcha game could the matter be considered significant.The court documents in the Papadopoulos case represent the most explicit evidence yet that Mr. Trumps campaign was eager to coordinate with Russian officials to undermine his rival, Hillary Clinton.Federal investigators suspected that Russian intelligence services used intermediaries to contact Mr. Papadopoulos to gain influence with the campaign, offering dirt on Mrs. Clinton in the form of thousands of emails.Mr. Papadopoulos pleaded guilty to lying about those contacts and is cooperating with the F.B.I.On Thursday, as news of Mr. Papadopouloss Russian ties continued to ripple through Washington, Mr. Franken sent a stern letter to Mr.Sessions.This is another example in an alarming pattern in which you, the nations top law enforcement official, apparently failed to tell the truth, under oath, he wrote.The case against Mr. Papadopoulos was unsealed at the same time as an unrelated indictment against two other former campaign advisers, Paul J. Manafort and Rick Gates.Taken together, the three charges sent a foreboding message to a fourth adviser to Mr. Trumps campaign, Michael T. Flynn.White House officials and others in the case are bracing for charges against Mr. Flynn, a retired three-star general who had a short and tumultuous tenure as national security adviser.Mr. Mueller is investigating Mr. Flynn for not disclosing his Russian contacts or his foreign lobbying work.Mr. Manafort was indicted on seldom-used charges of concealing foreign lobbying, as well as for lying on federal documents the same activities for which Mr. Flynn is being investigated.Its a bad sign, said Paul Krieger, who until recently was the top federal fraud prosecutor in Manhattan.It shows that the special counsels office will not hesitate to charge individuals connected to the administration or campaign with obstruction-like offenses.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Flynn, one of the architects of Mr. Trumps America first foreign policy, did not disclose payments from Russia-linked entities on financial disclosure documents.He did not mention a paid speech he gave in Moscow, and he belatedly disclosed, after leaving the White House, that the Turkish government had paid him more than $500,000 for lobbying services.Charging people for not disclosing their foreign lobbying is extremely rare, a point that Mr. Manaforts lawyers made in documents filed in court on Thursday.Since 1966, his lawyers wrote, only six such cases have been filed and only one person has been convicted.Such violations are typically handled administratively.It is far from clear what activity triggers a requirement to file a report as a foreign agent, said Kevin M. Downing, Mr. Manaforts lawyer.Mr. Manafort and Mr. Gates appeared in court briefly on Thursday.Lawyers discussed the conditions of their house arrest and the possibility of a trial in April.White House officials have long been anticipating the indictments of Mr. Manafort and Mr. Flynn, and have tried to distance themselves from both men.They were caught by surprise, however, by Mr. Papadopouloss guilty plea and the fact that he had been cooperating with the F.B.I.since July.That cooperation agreement fueled speculation that Mr. Papadopoulos had secretly recorded his conversations with White House officials this summer.But Mr. Cobb said he had seen no evidence that Mr. Papadopoulos had visited the White House or had recent conversations with staff members.We have no indication that this George Papadopoulos came to this White House, Mr. Cobb said, adding that a different person with the same name had entered the White House this year.Court documents do not explain the extent of Mr. Papadopouloss cooperation with Mr. Muellers investigation, but prosecutors said they showed him emails, chat transcripts, text messages and other records in an attempt to refresh his recollection about his contacts with Russians and with members of the Trump campaign.

What Donald Trump Thinks It Takes to Be a Man:::::To Mr. Trump and many of his increasingly nihilistic supporters, this is a threat to their fantasy of masculinity.We could have guessed that men who believe in gender equality would do more housework than men with conservative views, and it is not news that white conservative men overwhelmingly vote Republican.What is different from generations before is that many of the men making up Mr. Trumps base are less attached to the institutions that offered respect and required responsibility unions, church, marriage, school, even independent living.In the face of womens success, many of them have fallen behind on adult obligations and fallen back on misogyny.Many of these men now seek community online.Mr. Trump knows how to speak to them, and he adopted the modern man-childs medium.When he tweets insults about the stature of those who challenge him Liddle Bob Corker and Little Marco Rubio hes not just emasculating his tormentors by suggesting that manly authority is tied to height (although hes doing that, too); hes adopting the ad hominem rhetorical tactics that are a staple of angry men on Twitter and Reddit.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.Today, young women are more likely to attend college than young men, while young men are more likely to live with their parents, and its not only student loan debt thats driving them home.Economic shifts that have decreased employment in blue-collar jobs but increased opportunity in female-dominated sectors have had a psychic as well as financial impact.Care jobs are not jobs men are generally willing to take, in part because of the depressed pay, but also because of social constraints: Nursing, elder care and child care are womens work.A desire to reclaim this psychic masculinity is why Mr. Trump fetishizes a specific (and specifically white) kind of rough-hewed American maleness while embodying an envy-inducing lack of obligation.The white working men of Trump speeches have the kind of dirty-fingernail jobs so revered in the American imagination: coal miners, firefighters, autoworkers.In real life, more Trump voters work in cubicles than in coal mines.But the point was never Mr. Trumps understanding of reality.It was his grasp of white male aspiration and identity.Mr. Trumps own life and actions paint an appealing picture of masculine entitlement for those who want power without the shackles of responsibility.He may not be the smartest or most qualified guy in just about any room, but his money allowed him to marry and reproduce with a succession of models, star in a reality television show, live in vulgar gold-plated glory, say whatever offensive thing danced through his brain and still make a successful run for president.It was a plus that in the three Trump marriages, there have been no power couple partnerships of equals, just Mr. Trump on The Howard Stern Show talking about his wifes breasts and bragging that he never changed a diaper.Most American men are unable to actually achieve this level of authority minus accountability; as a result, admiration for men like Mr. Trump gets paired with an if I cant have it, no one can nihilism.White male power remains a dominant force in America, but it is no longer the only force that matters.For many men, this is not a leveling of the playing field, but a plundering of what was rightly theirs.Resentful of the changing order of things, some men have simply leaned in to chaos: If the system no longer serves them, it will at least be fun to blow it all up.Which is exactly why the old rules of political engagement dont work with Mr. Trump or his base.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The president is a perfect figurehead for this bizarre moment: a man who carries all of the negative characteristics of stereotypical masculinity while adopting almost none of the virtues, occupying the most powerful and exclusively male seat of power in the nation (and perhaps in the world), who ascended in large part because a yawning fear of female power kept one of the best-qualified candidates in history out of office.He is ego unchecked, narcissism in place of dignity.In a 1961 essay for Vogue, Joan Didion wrote that people with self-respect have the courage of their mistakes.They know the price of things.The piece went on to say, In brief, people with self-respect exhibit a certain toughness, a kind of moral nerve; they display what was once called character.Character, she wrote, is the willingness to accept responsibility for ones own life.Our current president, who cant even accept responsibility for his own social media use or admit that all-caps tweeting might suggest hes angry about continuing criminal investigations and low poll numbers, may indeed be a new low.Mr. Trump has ushered in a fresh era of noxious manhood wherein bullying is conflated with toughness and self-interest is more important than self-respect.But all is not lost.Every generation believes it is uniquely observing diminishing standards of behavior, even while by most measures, life improves.Plenty of American men are doing exactly the opposite of Mr. Trump and embracing the more productive characteristics of masculinity while rejecting the malicious ones.And the virtues of self-respect toughness, moral nerve, character have never been, unlike the presidency, male-only business.
Tax Plan Would Scrap Electric-Car Credit, Dampening Market:::::Despite the small numbers, other automakers, such as Ford, Volkswagen and BMW, are gearing up to introduce their first mass-market electric vehicles.Cutting the federal tax credit, however, is likely to dampen expectations for the segments expansion.Tax credits are an important customer benefit that can help accelerate the acceptance of electric vehicles, G.M.said in a statement on Thursday.Because General Motors believes in an all-electric future, we will work with Congress to explore ways to maintain this incentive.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.There was no comment from Tesla, which is preparing to introduce its first mass-market entry, the Model 3 sedan, next year at a base price of $35,000 before any tax credit is applied.The loss of the tax credit may cause Tesla to lose some interest among the hundreds of thousands of prospective Model 3 buyers who have put down $1,000 deposits to reserve their cars.Its shares were down almost 7 percent on Thursday, though the companys financial performance and production delays also weighed on the stock.The tax credit was among the measures the Obama administration took to drive innovation and sales of cleaner vehicles, in the aftermath of the government bailout of General Motors and the former Chrysler in 2009.Companies were allotted 200,000 tax credits to distribute among customers, yet no company has come close to using up its credits because of the low demand.Environmental groups, as expected, were sharply critical of the elimination of the credits.Electric vehicles are a new industry, and the electric vehicle purchase incentive has been a vital part of getting it off the ground, said Michelle Robinson, director of the clean-vehicle program at the Union of Concerned Scientists.Dropping the credit would throw the market for electrified vehicles into disarray, and possibly stall broader efforts to build more zero-emission vehicles, Ms. Robinson said.Advertisement Continue reading the main story These changes would increase pollution and undermine Americas leadership in energy innovation, she said.Wed squander the progress we have made.
Tax Change on Mortgages Could Shake Up the Housing Market:::::The proposed bill has no phase-in period; people who bought homes before Thursday could continue claiming the deduction on a mortgage up to $1 million, but after that, the ceiling is lowered by half.This will raise the overall cost of buying a home, and discourage existing homeowners from moving.This is one more problem for a real estate business that has seen the homeownership rate fall to about 64 percent from its pre-recession peak of around 69 percent.Home sales have been sluggish of late, in part because homeowners who capitalized on rock-bottom interest rates are staying put, reducing the number of available homes for sale.The whittling away of the mortgage interest deduction gives homeowners one more reason to stay put, said Svenja Gudell, chief economist at Zillow.On Thursday morning, hours after the proposal was unveiled, Redfin, a national real estate brokerage firm based in Seattle, started drafting a memo to its more than 1,000 real estate agents instructing them to ensure that prospective home buyers can still afford homes in their desired price range.There are people writing offers on homes today who have spent the past few days trying to figure out if they can afford a home, and we need to put them on notice that that might change, said Glenn Kelman, Redfins chief executive.Might is the operative word here.Many economists from both parties have complained that the mortgage interest deduction is wasteful and unfair.It favors homeowners over renters, rich over poor, and distorts the housing market and even migration patterns by encouraging people to leave smaller urban quarters for bigger and more tax-advantaged homes in the suburbs.Even Mr. Kelman a man whose fortunes are directly tied to commissions on homes bought and sold said it could be hard to see the usefulness of a deduction that so forcefully favors one group over another.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.The current tax code favors people who are buying a home versus the rest of America, he said.As a captain of industry, I would prefer more tax breaks to help people buy houses, but as a citizen, I realize someone has to pay.Nevertheless, the powerful real estate lobby has consistently beat back attempts to reduce or eliminate the mortgage interest deduction.On Thursday, William E. Brown, president of the National Association of Realtors, issued a statement signaling that lawmakers could expect a fight.Advertisement Continue reading the main story We are currently reviewing the details of the tax proposal released today, but at first glance it appears to confirm many of our biggest concerns about the tax plans making their way through Congress, the statement said.Eliminating or nullifying the tax incentives for homeownership puts home values and middle-class homeowners at risk, and from a cursory examination this legislation appears to do just that.Edward Glaeser, a Harvard economist who has long been in favor of reducing the mortgage interest deduction, liked parts of the plan.His main concern was that by retaining the existing deduction for current homeowners, the bill would further reduce the propensity of Americans to move not just to a better or more expensive home, but also to cities or states where job opportunities might be brighter.This effectively becomes a tax on selling a home, he said.To be sure, the tax proposal has a lot of variables that make it hard to determine exactly how it would affect any particular familys tax bill.For instance, the standard deduction would double, a factor that would partly offset the loss of the mortgage interest deduction.But the deductibility of property taxes would be capped at $10,000, another provision that could weigh on the construction and resale of more expensive homes.In any case, between the loss of the mortgage interest deduction and a separate measure to eliminate the deduction of state and local income taxes something that would also disproportionately affect the higher-cost cities and states the biggest losers will be most heavily concentrated on the coasts.
Who Wins and Who Loses from the Republican Tax Plan:::::Winner: Multinational corporations American multinational companies fare well under the plan, which calls for shifting toward a more territorial tax system, albeit with caveats.The plan levies a 10 percent global minimum tax on overseas earnings, but thats still far below the current 35 percent they need to pay on income thats returned home.In theory, the new system will reduce the lockout effect that encourages firms to stash cash abroad.The plan would also force companies to pay a one-time 12 percent tax on liquid assets that are held overseas, like cash.They would have eight years to pay the tax.Winner: Some middle class families The Republican tax plan would collapse the income tax brackets to three from seven and nearly double the standard deduction, meaning many middle class families would see smaller tax bills.However, this impact will vary depending on every taxpayers individual situation.People who live in high-tax states and currently itemize their tax returns could pay more because of the limitations on the state and local tax deduction.The capping of the mortgage interest deduction could also impact middle class families who live in states with high property taxes.And, if the legislation dampens home prices, as realtors are warning, it could diminish the wealth of middle class families whose biggest investment is generally their home.Winner: The rich and their families Despite all of the talk about helping the middle class, it is hard to argue that the wealthy do not benefit from the tax plan.The top tax rate for millionaires holds steady at 39.6 percent, while the estate tax and the alternative minimum tax or A.M.T.which hit primarily wealthy Americans are ultimately eliminated.Mr. Trump, a billionaire, has criticized the death tax and the A.M.T.provisions over the years as unfair.Winner: Hedge funds and other general partners President Trump campaigned on getting rid of the so-called carried interest loophole, which allows fees paid to some of the richest people on Wall Street to be taxed at low capital gains rates, not income tax rates.But it makes no appearance in the House plan.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.During the presidential campaign, Mr. Trump pledged to close the loophole and make its beneficiaries, private equity and hedge fund executives among them, pay their fair share of taxes.He once proclaimed that hedge fund guys are getting away with murder.Carried interest, which is essentially the profits reaped by hedge fund managers and private equity executives, is currently taxed at a long-term capital gains rate that is about half the roughly 40 percent ordinary income rate for the highest earners.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Loser: The real estate industry The tax plan doubles the standard deduction and caps the mortgage interest deduction at $500,000, down from $1 million.It also caps property deductions at $10,000.This significantly weakens a tax incentive that has encouraged many Americans to buy homes rather than rent.Homebuilders and realtors quickly came out against the bill, warning that it could create a recession in the housing market and cause a slide in home prices.Loser: The sick Under the Republican plan, the deduction for medical expenses would be eliminated.This currently applies to taxpayers, spouses or other dependents with health expenses that exceed a tenth of the taxpayers income.AARP, which advocates for retirees, said that they strongly opposed the repeal of the deduction and said that doing so would impose a health tax on the oldest and sickest Americans.Loser: Charities.Like the housing industry, charities are also fretting about the impact of doubling the standard deduction.While charitable deductions are preserved in the plan, middle class families that take advantage of the larger standard deduction could be less likely to give to charity as a way of reducing their taxable income.This, in turn, could mean less giving.Loser: University endowments Currently, private universities are exempt from the tax that private foundations pay on their investment income.That would change under the Republican plan, which would levy a 1.4 percent excise tax on private colleges and universities with at least 500 students and assets that are valued at $100,000 per full-time student.The plan will likely draw strong opposition from the higher education community.It would raise $3 billion in revenue over a decade.Loser: Rare disease sufferers The tax plan calls for the repeal of a tax credit that drug companies use to perform clinical testing for drugs that treat rare diseases.The credit is central to the business model for such firms and eliminating it could mean that big pharmaceutical companies will have little reason to invest in drugs that help small patient populations.Loser: The deficit Republicans used to consider themselves deficit hawks, but their plan will add at least $1.5 trillion to the federal debt over a decade.Many economists think that it will be more than this, because Republican tax-writers are using optimistic assumptions about economic growth when assessing their plan.If deficits continue to swell, it would depress economic growth and lawmakers would likely have to consider raising taxes or cutting spending to compensate as an aging population puts pressure on federal entitlement programs like Social Security and Medicare.Loser: Tesla (and electric car owners) The Republican plan repeals the tax credit currently allowed for taxpayers who own a qualified plug-in electric-drive motor vehicle.Under current law, a taxpayer may claim a maximum credit of $7,500 for each qualified plug-in electric-drive motor vehicle placed in service.The bill would take that benefit away.
Navy Orders New Training After Deadly Ship Collisions:::::Seven sailors were killed in June when the destroyer Fitzgerald collided with a container ship near Japan.And 10 sailors died in August when the John S. McCain another destroyer, named after Senator John McCains father and grandfather collided with an oil tanker while approaching Singapore.The broader review, conducted by Adm. Philip S. Davidson, the head of the Navys Fleet Forces Command in Norfolk, Va., focused on the Seventh Fleet, based in Yokosuka, Japan.But the reports findings and recommendations will affect Navy ships worldwide, and to some extent, the services aviation and submarine branches.The Seventh Fleet is the Navys largest and busiest, consisting of 20,000 sailors and 50 to 70 vessels, including about a dozen cruisers and destroyers.Even as the Navy has shrunk overall in recent years, its missions have grown to meet demands in a region that has become increasingly unstable with a rising China and North Koreas nuclear weapons arsenal.Despite repeated warnings from congressional watchdogs and the Navys own experts over the past several years, Navy ship commanders and their chains of command have more recently approved waivers to expiring certifications of standards so long as temporary steps were put in place to mitigate the risks.As of June, 37 percent of the certifications for the crews of cruisers and destroyers based in Japan had expired, according to the Government Accountability Office, the investigative arm of Congress.That was more than a fivefold increase in the percentage of expired certifications for the crews of those ships since the G.A.O.s report in May 2015.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Navy officials found that commanders came to believe these lower standards were the new normal.The risks that were taken in the Western Pacific accumulated over time, and did so insidiously, Admiral Davidsons review concluded, adding the accidents stemmed from an unrecognized accumulation of risk that resulted in ships not ready to safely operate at sea.While that can-do attitude culture has served us well in crisis and combat for decades, it does not relieve our commanders of the need to continuously assess, mitigate and accept risk, the review continued.In response, the Navy is revamping its scheduling process for ship operations in region, assessing the readiness standards for all ships based in Japan, and a creating a new naval office in the Western Pacific specifically to ensure those standards do not erode.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Compounding the stress of the increasing operations, officers and crew have said the Navy has allowed ships to rely on grueling watch schedules that leave captains and crews exhausted, even though the service ordered submarines to abandon similar schedules two years ago.A G.A.O.report from May said sailors were on duty up to 108 hours each week.Navy officials have now ordered more sleep for crews and no more 100-hour workweeks for sailors.The new rules essentially will adopt studies by the Naval Postgraduate School to develop a shorter watch schedule to match circadian rhythms, which uses three hours of watch duty and nine hours off.The Navy will also buy new equipment, such as additional simulators to be used in the increased training programs and updated search radars that can more effectively track nearby vessels.Ships steaming in crowded waters, like those near Singapore and Tokyo, will now broadcast their positions, as do other vessels.Until now, most Navy ships had the Automatic Identification System devices on board, but did not turn them on to prevent other countries, like China, from easily tracking them.Before Admiral Davidsons report was made public on Thursday, the Navy had already adopted a range of new measures based on lessons collected from a 24-hour safety stand-down conducted over the summer.Those steps included standardized rules for watch teams on the bridge when the captain is not present; new reporting requirements for major equipment failures and near misses; and manually tracking vessels that come within 5,000 yards of a Navy ship to avoid collisions.Immediately after the collision, there were some suspicions that the Navy ships internal systems had been hacked and interfered with.But Admiral Richardson in the interview ruled out any cyber intrusions in the two deadly accidents, although he said the Navy will now add that to the list of factors to examine in future collision investigations.
Newcomers, Mostly Women, Shake Up Council Race in Quiet Connecticut Town:::::Its a very unusual thing, Lucy B. Krasnor, a longtime member of the council, known as the Representative Town Meeting, said of the campaign.But were living in very unusual times.Greenwich, a genteel coastal community, is largely defined to the outside world by its affluence: a hedge fund capital and bedroom community near New York City with billionaires, corporate executives and media personalities, and sprawling estates and country clubs.Whatever ties Greenwich has to New York, the council that governs the town is purely New England, a throwback to an era when an entire town would assemble to discuss and vote on issues.The council, referred to almost universally as the R.T.M., consists of 230 volunteer members serving two-year terms making the legislative body larger than the State Legislature in Hartford and the United States Senate, but governing a town of 60,000 people.Youre not in New York anymore, said Elizabeth Peldunas, a co-president of the Riverside Association, a neighborhood civic group.I think it makes us New England.The race to join the council viewed by some as arcane and resistant to repeated attempts at modernization has had a slump in participation in recent years.In the last election, there were more seats available than there were candidates.But this time, some 270 people are running more than 110 of whom are first-timers, and well over half of them are women.That has made some of the races across the towns 12 districts competitive.Many candidates were recruited through various efforts by local groups to generate more interest, especially among women, in town government, with cocktail parties and coffee gatherings, posts on social media and letters published in the town newspaper.Many of the people they approached said that they avoided politics or that their lives were too busy, between work and family obligations, to accommodate holding public office.But organizers of the efforts have been surprised by the response.One group, March On Greenwich, has about 50 candidates running.Some conceded that they knew almost nothing about the town legislature or how it worked before joining the race.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Karen Giannuzzi, one of the groups organizers and a candidate, said she was motivated after taking part in the Womens March demonstrations the day after President Trump was inaugurated.The one thing we heard at the march, she said, if you want to make a change, start locally.
Silicon Valley Cant Destroy Democracy Without Our Help:::::Some blame social media for Donald Trumps rise to power.The election shook Silicon Valleys belief that the internet always fosters societal good, Representative Ro Khanna, Democrat of California, wrote in a Washington Post op-ed essay, Trump used the tools of technology to win.Twitter remains the perfect vehicle for Mr. Trumps nuance-free missives.But its not Twitter that is making Mr. Trump go viral; its Twitters users.They include all the citizens and journalists who follow, retweet and reply to Mr. Trump even when we do so out of shock or outrage or because his statements have news value.If it werent for all of us, the president would be shouting into a void.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.Twitter could work harder to fight hate speech, but that wouldnt solve other difficult problems like ideological echo chambers and a general dumbing down of the national conversation, because those are also happening in real life.People already seek out cable television channels and newspaper opinion columns that reinforce their views.Facebooks algorithms may encourage echo chambers, but thats because the company figured out what users want.Have you really never unfriended, unfollowed or muted someone who didnt agree with you?Those who fret about the idea that many Americans dont have access to diverse perspectives should scrutinize Americans individual choices as well as the platforms on which those choices are made.Shouldnt Silicon Valley be able to fix all of this?If Facebook can connect all of humanity, as its chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, aims to do, the platform should be able to root out fake news, critics might argue.But misinformation is a legitimately tricky problem, and the wrong approach could give Silicon Valley even more power than it already has.Who will be the new arbiter of truth?An algorithm?The government?Mr. Zuckerberg or Twitters chief executive, Jack Dorsey?Some crowdsourcing exercise that involves the American people, many of whom believed the fake news in the first place?The real problem is that Americans dont have a shared sense of reality.It has become popular to demonize Silicon Valley.Three recent book titles describe big tech as a wrecking ball, an existential threat and an underminer of democracy.Antonio Garca Martnez, a former Facebook employee who helped create the companys ad machine, observed that people feel addicted to Facebook, and then hate themselves and the company because of it.He noted that Facebook is extraordinarily skilled at increasing our addiction.Mr. Garca Martnez acknowledged in a Twitter exchange that yes, Facebook is effectively giving users what they want, but the question is whether to give it to them.Put another way, shouldnt social media platforms try to make us eat our vegetables, even if we prefer to gorge ourselves on candy?A couple of years ago, I was part of a team that tried that very experiment.We ran a Silicon Valley start-up called Parlio, which was later acquired by Quora.Parlio aimed to be a social media platform for civil debate.But what we discovered was that people loved the idea of reasoned debate, then decided that those debates took too much time.Thoughtful content was also less likely to go viral, and many users are addicted to the sugar rush of virality.So while people liked the idea of eating their vegetables, they still gravitated to Twitters candy aisle.Social media platforms magnify our bad habits, even encourage them, but they dont create them.Silicon Valley isnt destroying democracy only we can do that.
How to End International Tax Competition:::::Conservative lawmakers have long touted the idea that cutting corporate tax rates spurs economic growth.Proponents point to many mechanisms; a central one is that lower tax rates attract investment that might otherwise go to other countries.President Trumps chief economic adviser, Gary Cohn, recently highlighted this goal when discussing the Republican plan to reduce the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 20 percent, below the world average of 22.5 percent.This idea seems like a simple way to attract investment: If the tax rate is lower in the United States, corporations might prefer to invest here.But it turns out the situation is not so straightforward.By using game theory the science of strategic interaction we can see that America may be contributing to a problem that ultimately harms us economically.This is because the United States is not the only country seeking to attract investment by lowering corporate taxes.This rivalry among countries is known as tax competition.Tax competition occurs when nations compete to attract investment by imposing ever lower tax burdens on corporations.Mechanisms such as lower corporate income taxes, favorable tax-base definitions and tax holidays encourage multinational corporations to repatriate assets held overseas.This competition is an example of what game theorists call a collective action problem.These problems no doubt are familiar to many of us: In joint projects at work, every member of a team stands to benefit if the project is completed on time.But if individuals think they can avoid their share of the work, they will, leaving others to pick up the slack.Without some mechanism like good management to enforce shared norms, everyone on the team will shirk their responsibilities and the team will fail.Photo This is the core feature of a collective action problem: All members of a group would do better if everyone chose to work together, but each member has an incentive to abandon the cooperative approach and pursue its own interests.These problems occur throughout our economic and political lives, in situations as diverse as arms control treaties and the management of fisheries.Absent some kind of extra incentive to cooperate, collective action problems typically lead to outcomes that are worse for all.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Globally, corporate taxation is ripe for collective action problems.If nations didnt have to compete with one another, they would all benefit from imposing higher corporate taxes.But they do have to compete, so each individual country has a self-interested reason to lower its corporate tax rate, undercutting other countries to attract investment.Even if all other states agree to coordinate (or harmonize) to maintain higher rates of taxation, individual countries will still face an incentive to lower their tax rates to attract greater investment.
Trump Team to Promote Fossil Fuels and Nuclear Power at Bonn Climate Talks:::::According to new figures put out by the U.S. Energy Information Administration, coal production has risen since President Trump took office a fact Mr. Trump highlighted late Tuesday in a tweet.President Trump has vowed to withdraw from the Paris agreement, calling it a deal that punishes the United States.But under the rules of the deal, the United States cannot actually withdraw until 2020.Until then, the administration has said, it will continue to work toward bringing the Paris agreement into force.Photo Barry K. Worthington, executive director of the United States Energy Association, who will speak on the panel, said he hoped to deliver a dose of reality about the future of fossil fuels at a forum dominated by activists demanding the end of coal, oil and gas.He argued no credible projection shows fossil fuels meeting less than 40 percent of global energy demand by midcentury.Mr. Worthington said he expected that delivering that message before climate change activists would be a horrible experience but it is important for many to hear.The reality of it is the world is going to continue to use fossil fuels, he said, and if I can throw myself on the hand grenade to help people realize that, Im willing to do it.George David Banks, special assistant to President Trump for international energy and environment, will give introductory remarks and Francis Brooke, an aide to Vice President Mike Pence, will moderate the discussion among industry executives.This discussion is a follow-up to the Administrations success at the G20, where the United States expressed its support for helping countries meet their climate objectives through the use of cleaner and more efficient fossil fuels and other clean energy sources and technologies, a White House spokesman, Raj Shah, said in a statement.It is undeniable that fossil fuels will be used for the foreseeable future, and it is in everyones interest that they be efficient and clean.Through innovation, the United States continues to be a global leader in cutting carbon emissions.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The administrations emphasis on fossil fuels represents a sharp break from the Obama administration, which focused almost exclusively on ways America can promote renewable energy abroad.Critics called it a poke in the eye of the international community.Its embarrassing, said Senator Brian Schatz of Hawaii, a Democrat.After forfeiting international leadership on climate, the Trump White House is compounding their error with a silly stunt.Fossil fuel companies are not clean energy companies, and no amount of spin will change that.Saleemul Huq, director of the International Centre for Climate Change and Development in Bangladesh, who helps advise the least developed countries in the United Nations climate talks, said fossil fuels were hurting, not helping, the worlds poorest nations.Any country or company continuing to champion further exploration for and mining of coal and even other fossil fuels from now on would be willfully carrying out a crime against humanity, and they would be held accountable, he said.
Who Is Jerome Powell: Trumps Pick for Fed Chairman:::::A year later, he married Elissa Leonard, a filmmaker.They have three children.A Brief Stint at Treasury, Then Wealth Building in Finance In 1990, during first President George Bushs term, he moved back to Washington to become the Treasury Departments under secretary for finance.The Treasury secretary, Nicholas F. Brady, had been chairman of Dillon Read.Mr. Powell was responsible for policy on financial institutions and the Treasury debt market.After Bill Clinton took office in 1993, Mr. Powell joined Bankers Trust, but decided to leave a couple of years later after several clients suffered large losses as a result of derivative deals they did with the bank.In 1997, Mr. Powell became a partner at the Carlyle Group, the asset management firm, where he built his fortune; his 2016 financial disclosure form showed a net worth of as much as $55 million.In late 2011, President Barack Obama nominated him to fill an unexpired term on the Feds Board of Governors, and the Senate confirmed him the following May.Two years later, he was renominated and sworn to a full term.Photo A Centrist, Behind-the-Scenes Voice at the Fed Mr. Powell, a Republican, is a centrist voice in the Feds internal debates, often raising his concerns in private conversation rather than in public speeches.He has voted for every policy decision since joining the Fed, including four interest rate increases, and supported the Feds decision to unwind the bond-buying program put in place during and after the 2008 financial crisis.In September 2012, when Ben S. Bernanke, the Fed chairman at the time, announced a third round of bond buying as part of that program, Mr. Powell pressed for a clarification of the Feds goals, establishing what Mr. Powell called an offramp for the program.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Powells recent comments on monetary policy are basically interchangeable with recent comments by Janet L. Yellen, the current Fed chairwoman.In a June speech, he said strong job growth weighed in favor of raising interest rates while weak inflation suggested the need for caution.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.If the economy performs about as expected, I would view it as appropriate to continue to gradually raise rates, Mr. Powell said.A survey of 144 investors conducted by Evercore ISI found investors expected that Mr. Powell would push rates modestly higher over time than Ms. Yellen would.Assessing Trumps Regulatory Reform Plan: A Mixed Bag Mr. Powell gave a detailed account of his views on financial regulation in a June appearance before the Senate banking committee.He said he supported the Feds efforts to strengthen regulation since the 2008 crisis, but added that life under the new rules showed opportunities for improvement.The whole idea is to preserve the significant core reforms that were made but to go back and clean up our work, Mr. Powell said.Mr. Powell made clear that he did not fully embrace the Trump administrations plans for significant reductions in regulation, released a few weeks earlier.I see it is a mixed bag, he said.There are some ideas in the report that make sense, maybe not as expressed there, but it would enable us to reduce the cost of regulation without affecting safety and soundness.Willingness to Seek Non-Doctrinaire Solutions Mr. Powell has shown a willingness to reach across the aisle to seek solutions to problems.In 2005, he left Carlyle to focus on public policy as a scholar at the Bipartisan Policy Center, a Washington-based research organization.He later worked behind the scenes to persuade congressional Republicans to raise the debt ceiling an initiative that got the attention of the Obama administration, leading to his initial nomination to the Fed.
The Trump Debate Inside Conservative Citadels:::::In the past two weeks, I spoke to more than a dozen employees and former employees of the most well-respected think tanks on the center-right: the Manhattan Institute, known for its expertise on local and state policies; the Hudson Institute, the home of foreign-policy heavyweights like David Satter and Walter Russell Mead; the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, where researchers are largely focused on Iran, North Korea and terrorism; and the American Enterprise Institute, which defends classical liberalism and free markets.At each, I found scholars concerned about the following questions: Will the Trumpists capture the principled conservative intellectual establishment in 2017 as easily as they captured the Republican Party in 2016?And should independent scholars at these organizations break ranks over the powerful and growing influence of this president and his allies?More than nine months into this shambolic presidency, the vast majority of conservatives skeptical of Mr. Trump havent broken with their Trump-curious institutions at least not yet.Most of those who have and spoke to me for this story didnt want to be identified, citing the fact that they still need to work in Washington.Sol Stern didnt have that concern.Im 82 years old, he told me.I want to say what I believe and feel a little cleaner.Last month, Mr. Stern, whos worked at the Manhattan Institute for more than two decades, tendered his resignation from its flagship publication, City Journal.This is very important.Its about the future of our country.Its about the degradation of language and ideas, Mr. Stern insisted.He, along with several others I spoke to, felt the think tank and City Journal were acting like Sweden in the face of the Trump threat.This now seems to be the only way for me to protest the magazines intellectual abdication on the most urgent crisis facing the nation today: the election of an unfit, dangerous man to the presidency, plus the myriad ways in which the forces of Trumpism and Bannonism are tearing the country apart, Mr. Stern wrote in a resignation letter addressed to Larry Mone, the president of the think tank, and Brian Anderson, the editor of City Journal.Mr. Mone took issue with Mr. Sterns characterization.The notion that weve stayed on the sidelines through this election and current administration is demonstrably false, he wrote in an email, pointing me to pieces by Judith Miller, Heather Mac Donald, Steven Malanga and Nicole Gelinas.When we think the administration is right, we write about it.When we think they are wrong, we write about it.And unlike some other conservative and libertarian think tanks, which tend to focus on federal policy, since its founding in 1977, the Manhattan Institute and its scholars are looked to for their expertise on subjects such as urban policing and school choice.Advertisement Continue reading the main story But to one journalist previously published by City Journal, that doesnt justify the way the publication has responded to the Trump presidency.While City Journals desire to sit out the Republican civil war was perfectly understandable, it is not a viable long term option now that Donald Trump is president, he wrote me.A political journal in the Trump era that hardly engages with the president isnt like ignoring a 900-pound elephant.Its like ignoring an invasion from Mars.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.In the broader conservative world, Mr. Stern isnt alone in making the choice to leave in protest.At The Wall Street Journals editorial page, nearly every editor and writer of the Never Trump persuasion left the paper in the past year, this writer included.George Will did not have his contract renewed at Fox News after his anti-Trump views fell afoul of a network in thrall to the president.At the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a hawkish, nonpartisan research group, at least two people left over the way the think tank responded to Mr. Trumps election.The ability to criticize became very limited.We had to be more and more populist and right wing in our views and our analysis, one former employee told me.He said that the reason was explained clearly by the leadership: We were told time and time again that for eight years weve been out in the wilderness.Now we have an opportunity for access.We cant pass it up.Mark Dubowitz, the chief executive of the foundation and a self-described political independent, acknowledged to me that after the election, some F.D.D.people wanted to join the resistance.But thats not what his organization does, he said.Our mission has been to provide research and policy options to three administrations to defend American interests and global leadership.Access is one reason.Money is another.Among the biggest donors to the Foundation for Defense of Democracies is Bernie Marcus, a co-founder of Home Depot and a major Trump supporter.In June 2016, Mr. Marcus wrote an article endorsing Mr. Trump and urging Republicans to get in line: I have a message for the #NeverTrump crowd: Enough already.Donald Trump is our presumptive nominee and it is time to get over wishing it were not so.If you dont, change your social media hashtag to #HillaryGOP.But its very difficult to draw a direct line between pro-Trump donors and the operations of a particular organization.In part thats because all of the boards of these think tanks are mixed bags when it comes to Mr. Trump.Take the American Enterprise Institute.Its large board includes Seth Klarman, a well-known anti-Trump billionaire, and Dick DeVos, the billionaire husband of Mr. Trumps secretary of education, Betsy DeVos.A number of A.E.I.scholars have joined the Trump administration: Scott Gottlieb is now the commissioner of the F.D.A., and Kevin Hassett is the chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers.And yet the think tank is also home to Norman Ornstein, a liberal who just co-wrote a book about the danger of the Trump presidency.Though he says he is further to the left than almost all of his colleagues, he said that I dont get any sense at all that what theyve been doing or what theyve been saying has been shaped in any way by the donors to the institution.I have little doubt that some of our donors rail against me, he added.But Im not told about it.And if anyone in a position of influence here leaned on me politically I wouldnt be here.Id leave.Advertisement Continue reading the main story From the outside, the board of the Manhattan Institute seems similarly diverse: The pro-Trump intellectual Roger Kimball sits alongside William Kristol, a leading Never Trumper.But Rebekah Mercer is also on the board, and several sources described her as very active.In his resignation letter, Mr. Stern singled out Ms. Mercer and her billionaire father, calling her an accomplice in one of the most malignant political movements in the country.The Mercers are the key backers of Breitbart News: In 2012 they donated $10 million to the site, which Mr. Bannon has boasted is the platform of the alt-right.After Andrew Breitbarts death later that year, Mr. Bannon took over the site, and under his watch it has become an open sewer of conspiracy theories and barely veiled white nationalism, anti-Semitism and racism.The Mercers also serve as patrons of the former Breitbart editor Milo Yiannopoulos, a man whose views have earned him a proud Nazi salute from Richard Spencer.(Just today, however, Mr. Mercer announced that he was severing all ties with Mr. Yiannopoulous, saying he was mistaken to have supported him.He also said he was selling his stake in Breitbart to his daughters.)In his resignation letter, Mr. Stern asked if it made any sense for the Manhattan Institute to make common cause with Ms. Mercer, who Christopher Ruddy, a Trump surrogate and the owner of Newsmax, has called the first lady of the alt-right.As he put it: Shouldnt we be fighting back in this war, instead of withdrawing from combat or, even worse, providing institutional legitimacy for the bomb throwers?For a sense of what it looks like for the bomb throwers to run the joint, one neednt look far.The Heritage Foundation, by far the most influential think tank of the Trump era, is widely seen as a redoubt of Trumpism in large part because of the tremendous influence of the Mercers, who are major donors.Ms. Mercer sits on the board; one source called her a wrecking ball.In May, Jim DeMint was ousted abruptly as the think tanks president in a shake-up largely seen to be driven by Ms. Mercer.At the time, Mr. Bannons name was publicly floated as a possible replacement.Heritage has gotten away from its core function, which was to provide top-notch policy research to advise conservative lawmakers.Its become the de facto arm of Bannonism, one person close to Heritage told me.In recent weeks, the think tank has hosted the president.The home page of its website boasts: Donald Trump and many newly elected Republican congressmen promised theyd drain the swamp.And Heritage is here to help them do just that!Is the Hudson Institute at risk of capitulating to Trumpism, too?Several fellows I spoke to at the Washington think tank told me they were shocked by Hudsons recent decision to host Mr. Bannon.I and a lot of other people were very upset that he was on the same stage as David Petraeus and Leon Panetta, Ronald Radosh, a historian and an adjunct fellow, told me.The decision to give a platform, and thereby lend the prestige of Hudson, to a sinister character like Stephen Bannon was an appalling lapse, said Gabriel Schoenfeld, a senior fellow.Kenneth Weinstein, the president and chief executive of Hudson, declined to comment.Bannon and Trumpism is a definitive threat to the country.The ideology is a dramatic departure from a long American tradition of America being a global leader, added Mr. Radosh.Bannon has spoken of wanting an international alliance with all these emerging right-wing populists in Europe.It is a fundamental rejection of liberalism.Mr. Stern agrees about the severity of the threat posed by Mr. Bannon and his ilk.I am convinced that Manhattan Institute will find itself in an untenable situation as the Bannon-Mercer war machine gathers force and attracts more media attention, as he said in his resignation letter.I hope my action prompts a conversation at the institute about the Mercer-funded assault against traditional conservatism.Lets see if it does.
Trump Nominee Sam Clovis Withdraws From Consideration for Agriculture Department Post:::::Photo WASHINGTON A former Trump campaign aide dropped out of the running on Thursday for a senior position at the Department of Agriculture three days after his name was tied to a former campaign foreign policy adviser who pleaded guilty to lying to the F.B.I.over his contacts with Russia.The campaign aide, Sam Clovis, told President Trump that he decided to withdraw from consideration to be the chief scientist at the Department of Agriculture, the White House said.The political climate inside Washington has made it impossible for me to receive balanced and fair consideration for this position, Mr. Clovis wrote in a letter on Wednesday to Mr. Trump.Mr. Cloviss qualifications to be the chief scientist at the department have been questioned, as he is not a scientist himself.The relentless assaults on you and your team seem to be a blood sport that only increases in intensity each day.Mr. Cloviss request to drop out of consideration is the latest blow to the Trump administration that for months has been dogged by the special counsel investigation into possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russia.Mr. Clovis, an early campaign adviser, has met with the special counsels team.Advertisement Continue reading the main story On Monday, it was disclosed that Mr. Clovis discussed the Trump campaigns priorities for relations with Russia with the foreign policy adviser, George Papadopoulos, who pleaded guilty last month to lying to the F.B.I.about his communications with Russian officials during the 2016 presidential campaign, according to interviews and court papers.
Your Race Against Time: How Climate Affects the Marathon:::::And while the biggest impacts show up in the performances of amateurs and weekend warriors, elite runners are not immune to these effects.When considering the top 20 finishing times at the largest marathons, the assessment found that temperatures in the 50s did not slow them, relative to days in the 40s.But temperatures in the 60s and the 70s increased their times by three and four minutes, respectively.Photo Since temperature has such a big effect on times, would it make sense to adjust official records for the weather?If this were done, five of the 25 fastest mens marathon times through the 2016 marathon season would beat the current adjusted world record.Indeed, three of them would be more than two minutes faster.The current world-record holder is Dennis Kimetto from Kenya, but the temperature-adjusted record-holder would be Kenenisa Bekele from Ethiopia, who would move up from No.3 on the list.The second-fastest time would belong to the Ethiopian Tamirat Tola, who would move up from No.18.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Adjusting times for temperatures would lead to smaller changes among women.Paula Radcliffe of Britain (who has won the New York race three times) would remain the record-holder.The interactions between climate and a sport like long-distance running are only going to get more pronounced as the climate changes.Over the last 50 years, the temperature has exceeded 60 degrees on just 5 percent of the days during the first week of November, when the New York race is typically held.By 2050, this is projected to rise to 18 percent of days, and by 2090 it is expected to be 38 percent.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.How will runners and organizers react?National governments, city planners and large corporations are all realizing that a warmer world will force them to change the ways they do business.Marathons will be no exception.The organizers of the New York race will probably not want their event to be one where it is difficult, or perhaps even impossible, for people to set their personal best or to lower the world record.So they may want to adapt by moving the marathon to later in the year.At the same time, runners may switch from the New York City Marathon to others held in cooler climates to find the perfect temperature at just the right time of year.Could a Montreal Marathon be among the worlds most prestigious by 2050?Athletic equipment companies will surely develop new technologies to aid adaptation as well.For runners, the breathable mesh and cooling towels of today could easily be traded in for shirts with built-in air-conditioners.Seem far-fetched?They already exist.Indeed, I was one of the authors of a recent study of just how powerful a role technology can play in helping people adapt to warmer temperatures.For example, the rise of air-conditioning has reduced the mortality consequences of extremely hot days in the United States by more than 70 percent since 1960.Marathons and marathon runners appear likely to be able to adapt to climate change with relative ease through changes in when, where and how.But in many other areas of our lives, the costs of climate change are expected to be greater.More intense hurricanes, and the increased occurrence of extremely hot days, will elevate risks to life and property, which can only be offset through costly adaptation efforts.These include building more expensive housing, accelerating the deployment of air-conditioning and making painful decisions to move away from current homes as well as acceptance of increased risks.In this way, the climate choice in front of us is similar to the one faced by people training for a marathon.More time spent training makes for a faster marathon.Its not a great idea to show up on the day of the race without having invested much in your performance.The time for that is well in advance of the big day.In the case of climate change, we can devote resources now to reducing greenhouse gas emissions so that we face lower costs in the future.As with so many things in life, both marathons and the climate problem are subject to an old rule no pain, no gain.
What Did Bernie Sanders Learn in His Weekend in Canada?:::::Mr. Sanders, who drew huge crowds as a presidential candidate in the United States last year, learned firsthand that he is also a household name in Toronto.His policy vision, decidedly from the left in the United States, matches mainstream Canadian views.You received the welcome here that is normally reserved for celebrity rock stars, said Greg Marchildon, the director of the North American Observatory on Health Systems and Policies at the University of Toronto.Ed Broadbent, the chairman of the progressive Broadbent Institute, called Mr. Sanders the most important social democrat in North America even though Mr. Sanders is not a Canadian social democrat, and is not even a particularly powerful member of the Senate.Photo Lesson 2: Doctors like the system as much as patients do Many developed countries have achieved universal health coverage, but Canada is relatively distinct in its insistence that individuals should not have to pay any money at the point of care.When Canadians go to the doctor or hospital, they just show their Canadian Medicare card.At Womens College Hospital, executives showed Mr. Sanders an empty billing window.The hospital, they told him, has one employee who manages bills.For the entire hospital?Mr. Sanders said, in mock disbelief.Several patients told him about the comfort that comes from not having to pay for their care directly.And doctors, too, said they felt more comfortable recommending their patients get an operation or see a specialist than they might if those treatments werent free.I didnt have to fill out any forms; I didnt have to worry about how I was going to pay for the simple job of staying alive, said Lilac Chow, a kidney transplant patient at Toronto General Hospital, who had been brought in to share her experience with the senator.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Whenever Mr. Sanders was asked what he learned about the Canadian system, the value of free care came up.What I think stuck out to me was from both the patients and the physicians, the importance of not having to worry about money in terms of the doctor-patient relationship, he said in an interview after his trip on Tuesday.His Medicare-for-All bill includes free care as a central feature.If the legislation became law, no American would pay directly for a doctor, dentist or hospital visit, and co-payments for prescription drugs would be limited.(Taxpayers would, of course, finance the system.)Photo Lesson 3: Sometimes, you have to wait At a round-table discussion at Womens College Hospital, the chief of surgery noted that Canadian patients cant always get all the care they want right away.Wait times, you could argue are a problem for certain procedures, said Dr. David Urbach, before discussing the ways the province and hospital were working to shorten the lines.Mr. Sanders quickly turned to the glass-half-full interpretation.What you are arguing correct me if Im wrong is that waiting times are not a problem, and its an issue you are dealing with, he said.In Canada, where government finances health insurance and the private sector delivers a lot of the care, patients with life-threatening emergencies are treated right away.But patients with cataracts or arthritis often have to wait for operations the Canadian system considers elective.A governmental review of the Ontario system recently found that wait times were getting worse in some cases, like knee replacements.The Canadian system puts hospitals on a budget and limits the number of specialists it trains, both factors that can lead to lines for complex care thats not life-threatening.The system also limits access to services, like M.R.I.scans, that are much more abundant south of the border.On his weekend tour, Mr. Sanders didnt see the places where patients might wait.Hospital executives instead showed him a refugee primary care clinic, a neonatal intensive care unit and a cardiac surgery unit.But he points out that many Americans who are uninsured or who have limited savings and insurance with high deductibles may wait even longer than Canadians for elective, or even urgent, care.Advertisement Continue reading the main story If youre very, very rich, youll get the highest-quality care immediately in the United States, Mr. Sanders said, in the interview.If youre working class, if youre middle class, it is a very, very different story.The Commonwealth Fund, a health research group, ranked the United States health system at the bottom of its most recent 11-country rankings, published in July.But Canada did only a little better, at No.9.Of all the measures in the study, Canada ranked the worst on the timeliness of care.(A team of Upshot experts eliminated Canada in the first round in an eight-country virtual bracket tournament of international health system performance.)Any single-payer system will need to grapple with how much it should spend over all, and where it will save money.Mr. Sanderss Medicare-for-All bill currently includes few details about how the government would set budgets and allocate resources once all Americans were brought into the government system.Photo Lesson 4: Even Canadas system has holes Mr. Sanders wants to bring big, sweeping change to the American health care system.Unlike the Affordable Care Act, which filled in holes in an existing system, his Medicare-for-All plan would take away the health coverage that most Americans hold now, replacing it with a single, very generous government system.It would do away with the premiums, deductibles and co-payments that individuals and businesses pay for health care, and instead impose large tax increases.That is not the kind of change that would be politically trivial.In his speech, he noted that the creation of a single-payer system in Canada and Britain followed grass-roots movements, and political landslides by the parties that favored the change.Real change always happens from the bottom up, he said, to big applause.Youve got to struggle for it.Youve got to fight for it.Youve got to take it.And that is the history of all real change in this world.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Yet even in Canada, he learned, changes to the health care system have been difficult.The Canadian system, with insurance run at the province level, covers doctors and hospitals.But decades after the 1984 Canada Health Act, many Canadians pay for supplemental private insurance through their jobs for prescription drugs, dentistry and optometry despite a growing recognition that medications are essential to care.Any one of us around the table is just a job loss away from having access to prescription medications, and thats a problem, said Danielle Martin, a vice president at Womens College Hospital and policy researcher, who helped organize the trip, at a round-table discussion.Im on my own going to the dentist, said Naomi Duguid, a patient, sitting across the table.Its the only time I get to experience what it must be like to be an uninsured American.Ontario has recently started a program that will provide coverage for medications to residents under 25.And there is a patchwork of drug coverage programs for older people, the poor and those who get insurance from work.But even in Canada, its tough to find the resources to expand coverage.Advertisement Continue reading the main story We have to find the money to fund the program up front, said Kathleen Wynne, the premier of Ontario, who helped establish the youth drug coverage program.Photo Lesson 5: Canadians seem to value fairness more than Americans do Equity.Fairness.Throughout the weekend, Mr. Sanders kept asking Canadians what they thought about the higher taxes theyd paid to finance their system.Every one among the patients and doctors selected to meet him said the trade-off was worth it because it made the system fair.I think its a really fair way to do it, said Frederick Brownridge, 67, of Etobicoke, Ontario, as he sat by the window in his Toronto General Hospital room, with IV lines in his arms.Mr. Brownridge had had two heart valves repaired and a double bypass three days earlier.It also means if youre in a lower economic status or higher economic status, youll get the treatment you need.On Tuesday, Mr. Sanders said the uniformity of this message really stuck out to him: There really is, I think, a deep-seated belief in Canada that health care is a right, and whether youre rich or whether youre poor or whether youre middle class, you are entitled to health care.In the United States, though, Republicans control the presidency and the Congress, and many candidates last year ran on a promise to roll back government support for health care coverage.Several recent public opinion surveys show majority support for a government guarantee of health coverage, but support declines substantially when pollsters mention that government coverage would mean higher taxes.Mr. Sanders said he knows his bill isnt going to become law anytime soon, but he thinks discussing the idea will help make its underlying values more broadly acceptable.When you talk about health care, youre not just talking about health care, he said in his Toronto speech.Youre talking about values, because how a society deals with health care is more than medicine.Its more than technology.It is about the values that those societies hold dear.
Just Say No to Opioids? Ads Could Actually Make Things Worse:::::Photo In declaring the opioid epidemic a public health emergency last week, President Trump promised that the federal government would start a massive advertising campaign to get people, especially children, not to want to take drugs in the first place.But past efforts to prevent substance abuse through advertising have often been ineffective or even harmful.Perhaps the most famous American antidrug advertisement featured a sizzling egg in a frying pan to the sound of ominous music and a stern voice-over warning, This is your brain on drugs.A sequel to this ad featured Rachael Leigh Cook smashing an egg and the better part of a kitchen to dramatize the impact of heroin.Many other ads denouncing drugs and emphasizing their destructive effects as in the Just Say No campaign appeared regularly on television and in print beginning in the 1980s.Most of them were funded by the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy, which received hundreds of millions of dollars a year from Congress for such campaigns.Visually dramatic though the ads were, evaluations of them were deeply discouraging.The billions spent from the late 1980s through the mid-2000s at best had no effect on drug use, research shows.At worst, exposure to the campaign might have actually increased the likelihood of adolescent marijuana use.A study of over 20,000 youths 9 to 18 found that those who had been exposed to more antidrug ads expressed weaker intentions to avoid marijuana and more doubts that marijuana was harmful.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Why was the original campaign such a failure?In part it suffered from perverse incentives.Congress provided substantial money for the ads and was intensely interested in them at the height of the so-called war on drugs, creating internal pressure to make the ads appealing to members of Congress.But while ads that lectured or scared people about drugs might have seemed compelling to the modal member of Congress (a 60-year-old white male), they did not necessarily dissuade drug use by adolescents.In some cases, this kind of approach may make drugs more attractive as a sign of rebellion.
Revised Data Shows Community Colleges Have Been Underappreciated:::::The old graduation measures date to the late 1980s, when Senator Bill Bradley championed legislation requiring colleges to report graduation rates for their basketball and football players and, while they were at it, everyone else.The measures were limited to students who enroll in college for the first time and take a full course load.This is a perfectly reasonable way to measure graduation rates at Mr. Bradleys alma mater, Princeton, because nearly all undergraduates there start full-time, a few months after finishing high school.The federal graduation rates also calculated the percentage of students who graduated within six years of enrollment.This made sense for four-year universities, where the vast majority of bachelors degrees are earned within six years.The problem was that the graduation rate rules were then applied to the entire higher education system, including two-year community colleges, where nearly half of all undergraduates begin.The typical community college student isnt a fresh-faced 18-year-old taking a full slate of courses.Most community college students are nontraditional adults, parents, people with full-time jobs, people returning to school after years away.They often enroll part-time, taking longer to graduate than the three years the Education Department used to gauge the success of people pursuing two-year degrees.Many community college students also transfer to four-year colleges before finishing a degree a good result, but one that wasnt counted for graduation rates.So, following the committees lead, education officials made several changes.They included part-time and returning students in the calculation.They extended the time period to eight years.And they made separate calculations of how many students transferred before graduation, and how many were still in college.The results paint a very different picture of community college success.The old measures, for example, captured about 620,000 students who began as first-time, full-time freshmen in 2008.Only 20 percent graduated from the community college they started at within three years.North Shore Community College was typical its old graduation rate was 19 percent.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Such dire numbers became fodder for people defending for-profit colleges from heavy criticism of their high cost and poor outcomes.In 2014, Steve Gunderson, head of the main for-profit college trade association, wrote: Our institutions have a 63% graduation rate in our two-year programs, while our colleagues at comparable public institutions community colleges have a graduation rate of 20%.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.The new graduation rates, by contrast, captured more than 1.5 million community college students.Even though that group included more than 710,000 part-time students, who are often less likely to graduate, extending the time frame to eight years increased the average graduation rate to 27 percent.But transfers are where community colleges really shine.Some 510,000 students transferred before graduating, bringing the combined graduation and transfer rate up to 60 percent.Including all of the part-time and returning students and looking over eight years boosted North Shores graduation rate to 35 percent.Another 19 percent transferred before graduation.Others were still working toward a degree.All told, more than half of Mr. Burtons students had a successful outcome not, as the old rates suggested, fewer than one in five.The for-profit picture is not so rosy.The two-year programs Mr. Gunderson chose for comparison make up less than one-fifth of all for-profit enrollment.Four-year programs at for-profits have much lower graduation rates than those of comparable public institutions.Combined, they had a 34 percent graduation rate under the old measures.And in contrast with community colleges, the new measures make for-profits look worse, dropping their average graduation rate to 32 percent.For-profit students seldom bring their credits elsewhere.Including transfer students increases the average for-profit success rate to just 39 percent, compared with 60 percent at community colleges.In other words, Mr. Gunderson had it backward.The new measures suggest that community colleges are much more successful than for-profit colleges, not much less.They are also far cheaper and leave the average student with much less debt.Some for-profit results are catastrophic.Take South University, a Savannah, Ga.-based for-profit college.In 2008, it enrolled 12,233 new students in its online degree programs more than the University of Georgia and Georgia State University combined.The old measures show South University Online with a mind-boggling 2.4 percent graduation rate.But, as with community colleges, most South University Online students are nontraditional.What happens when all the students are counted over a full eight years?Answer: The graduation rate increases to just 7.8 percent.Add in transfers?8.1 percent.Include those still enrolled?8.5 percent.Three years after leaving college, only 23 percent of South University Online students have paid back even a dollar on the principal of their student loans, probably because nearly all of them failed to earn a degree.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Despite these results, South University Online remains accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools, the same body whose response to a multidecade academic cheating scandal at the University of North Carolina was to put the campus on probation for a single year.By comparison, the graduation rate of Georgia Northwestern Technical College, a public school, increases to 50 percent from 25 percent using the new measures.Preparing students to transfer falls to regional public universities in Georgia, instead of community colleges.Savannah State University has only a 33 percent eight-year graduation rate.But include transfer students, and its success rate rises to 81.2 percent.Not all community colleges look better.San Jose City College in California, which graduates 19 percent of traditional students within three years, sees its graduation rate drop to 18 percent when part-time and returning students are included, even when the time frame is extended to eight years.Transfers improve the success rate only to 21 percent.Most students at San Jose City College are falling short.Many community colleges have room to improve.But the big picture shows that community colleges were unfairly tarred by the old graduation rates.The results produced by including all students and by looking over the right time frame and accounting for transfers suggest that many prospective undergraduates may benefit from giving their local community college another look when searching for an affordable path to a degree.And lawmakers who have typically underfunded community colleges may want to direct more resources to institutions that are doing a difficult job better than we knew.
How a Republican Idea for Reducing Medicare Costs Could Affect You:::::If Medicare already has a form of a premium support model, whats all the fuss about?The important difference is in how stipend levels are set.Todays stipends are not driven by the market, but are set according to legislatively established formulas.But the type of premium support Medicare reformers usually advocate what people generally mean when they use this term would use market signals to set stipend levels.Photo Premium support could result in increased efficiency in the Medicare program, said Bryan Dowd, a health economist at the University of Minnesota, and co-author of a book that analyzed various premium support options.That efficiency could push the hospital trust fund depletion date further into the future and reduce the financial burden on future generations.Premium support models take many forms, but there are two crucial variables.One is how stipend levels are set, which determines how much of beneficiaries own money they need to contribute.The other key feature of premium support is how much the stipend grows over time.Both aspects are hotly debated.Advertisement Continue reading the main story In some versions of premium support, the stipend level would grow more slowly than health care costs, forcing people to pay more out of pocket over time to purchase coverage.In other versions, the stipend level would grow at the same rate as health care costs, so beneficiaries would continue to pay about the same share of their own money for health insurance.Most premium support approaches would retain traditional Medicare, though its fate would be uncertain, a source of controversy.A lot rides on how the governments support level differentially impacts the cost to beneficiaries of private plans versus traditional Medicare, said Timothy McBride, a health economist with Washington University in St. Louis.Geography also plays a role.If traditional Medicare is disadvantaged, that would hit rural beneficiaries harder, because a larger share of rural America relies on the traditional program than do urban Americans.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.As a report this month from the Congressional Budget Office reveals, how much premium support could save the government varies considerably depending on how stipend levels are established.Across the variations the C.B.O.examined, Medicare spending could fall by as much as 9 percent or as little as about 0.5 percent.But premiums could rise, including the premium for traditional Medicare.Under one projection, the C.B.O.estimates, traditional Medicares premium could double.In all the scenarios the C.B.O.analyzed, stipend levels would be based on bids from Medicare Advantage plans and traditional Medicare that reflect the cost to cover a person for standard Medicare services.Stipend levels would keep pace with overall health care costs, but they could still be lower than what many Medicare beneficiaries receive today.For example, tying the stipend to the second-lowest bid and requiring all Medicare beneficiaries to be subject to that new, lower level would save $419 billion over 2022-2026, the C.B.O.estimated.Tying it to the average bid or requiring only new beneficiaries to be subject to the new stipend would save less.In either case, people would have access to plans that dont cost more than todays.But those who opted for more expensive plans because they offer more benefits, or the traditional program because it covers any doctor willing to accept Medicare patients, would pay more out of pocket.Consequently, more people would opt for cheaper, private plans and fewer would choose traditional Medicare.This worries some health policy experts.Traditional Medicare has been the leader in reforming the health care payment and delivery system to improve efficiency, said Paul Van de Water, senior fellow with the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.It has outperformed private insurance in holding down the growth of health costs, but its ability to continue to do that would shrink significantly if premium support caused its enrollment to dwindle.Exactly how much more people would pay depends not only on the plans they select, but also on where they live.In some markets, many plans, including the traditional program, might charge premiums close to the second-lowest bid.In others, plans that many beneficiaries may want might cost a lot more.In the premium support debate, theres a fundamental lesson: Its conceptually simple to reduce federal spending on health care, but its very hard to do so in a way that doesnt increase costs for at least some consumers.To actually reduce total (not just federal) health care spending for everyone, one has to overhaul how care is delivered, not just how it is paid for.Thats much harder.
When Silver Costs More Than Gold: How Trumps Actions Have Scrambled Insurance Prices:::::It also organized plans on its site in order of their premium price, so that customers who live in a place where a gold plan costs less than the cheapest silver plan would have an easier time figuring that out.If you live in one of the places where the gold plan is cheaper than the silver plan, and you earn more than about $24,000, you should not buy the more expensive silver option.The gold plan will cost less, and have a lower deductible.There are also high-deductible bronze plans that will have substantially lower premiums that you may also want to consider.If you qualify for a government subsidy, those will be your best options.If you earn too much to qualify for federal help buying insurance, you should also steer clear of the more expensive silver plans on HealthCare.gov.But there may be cheaper options in the silver category if you buy directly from an insurance company.A broker may be able to help you examine all of those options.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.If you earn less than $24,000, a silver plan will still be your best choice.Thats because you qualify for additional discounts that will lower your deductible and co-payment, making a silver plan even more generous than a gold plan.Premium subsidies, which are unaffected by the presidents actions, will protect you from premium price increases.The loading of cost increases onto silver plans also makes it hard to easily describe how much more expensive insurance will be next year, compared with this year.The consulting group Avalere Health published a report Wednesday saying that the average silver plan on HealthCare.gov would increase in price by 34 percent by far the largest annual price increase since the Obamacare markets began.Normally, that silver price increase is a good barometer for whats happening with the entire health insurance market.But the Avalere report highlighted that the prices of other plan types arent rising as fast.Gold plans are going up, on average, by 16 percent.Bronze plans are rising, on average, by 18 percent.Some of those increases are probably because of Trump administration actions as well.The government has cut back on advertising and outreach to help enroll healthy customers, and has signaled that it may not enforce the government mandate to obtain insurance as vigorously as the Obama administration did.In their filings with regulators, insurance companies said they were increasing premiums to address that broader policy uncertainty.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Our map draws on prices that were published online Wednesday for 2018 plans on HealthCare.gov.The website serves 39 states, and the precise prices we examined were for single customers who dont smoke, age 40, though the trends should be the same for customers with different family sizes and ages.Information from the remaining states, which run their own marketplaces, will become available next week.
The Unhealthy Politics of Pork: How It Increases Your Medical Costs:::::Advertisement The Unhealthy Politics of Pork: How It Increases Your Medical Costs Image The term pork barrel spending has been around for well over 100 years.It means using government funds on local projects that are primarily used to bring more money to a specific representatives district.Credit Matt Cardy/Getty Images No industry in America spends more on lobbying than health care.In 2016, the health care industry spent half a billion dollars on lobbying, with pharmaceutical companies, hospitals and health professionals making the largest contributions.In 2009, the year the Affordable Care Act was debated, health care lobbying exceeded $550 million.(Last year, by comparison, defense lobbying totaled $129 million, and the gun lobby spent just $10.5 million.)Closely related to industry lobbying is the political maneuvering that congressional leaders use in an effort to pass legislation specifically, targeted provisions known as earmarks, sweeteners or pork barrel spending.The final version of the Graham-Cassidy health bill, for example, would have sent extra money to Alaska and Maine for the crucial votes of senators from those states, Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins.In 2010, Democrats hoping to secure votes from reluctant rural state senators added the Frontier States provision to the A.C.A., which increased Medicare payments to five states with low population densities.We all know earmarks and lobbying influence policymakers and policy.In health care, this has critical implications: who gets care, how much they get, how we pay for it.But theres little hard data on exactly who benefits and how large the effects can be.A new study illuminates the ways these political dynamics can change congressional and hospital behavior and how they can increase health care costs for the rest of us.Research by Zack Cooper, Amanda Kowalski and Jennifer Wu at Yale and by Eleanor Powell at the University of Wisconsin-Madison analyzed a provision in the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003 (M.M.A.), known as Section 508, that helped secure Republican votes for the laws passage.The M.M.A., which created Medicare Part D and provided prescription drug coverage for seniors, was a political priority for President George W. Bush ahead of his 2004 re-election campaign.But fiscally conservative Republicans were hesitant to sign on to what amounted to the largest expansion of Medicare in its history, and the bill seemed unlikely to pass.Thats when Section 508 was added.The rate at which Medicare pays individual hospitals is determined largely by a hospitals location and the labor costs, or wage index, in its area.Hospitals can, however, request to be reclassified into a different wage index area to raise their payments.Sometimes there are good reasons for this: Two hospitals might be competing in the same region, and because theyre separated by an arbitrary bureaucratic line, one gets paid more than the other.But Section 508 waivers created new, more ambiguous ways that hospitals in specific districts could appeal their assigned wage index, and gave the executive branch considerable discretion about which requests would be granted and how big the pay increases would be.The Section 508 waivers had large effects on how both politicians and hospitals operated.About 400 hospitals applied for a Medicare pay increase, and 120 waivers were granted.Hospitals in districts represented by a Republican member of Congress who voted for the M.M.A.were seven times more likely to receive a waiver compared with those in districts of members who voted against it.On average, these hospitals saw a 6.5 percent increase in Medicare payments, but the 29 hospitals with the biggest payment increases high 508 recipient hospitals received a 10 percent boost.How did hospitals spend the extra money?Perhaps unsurprisingly, they started treating more Medicare patients about 8 percent more per year.They also expanded nursing staffing by roughly a third, and invested in new technologies.But extra cash also meant big raises for hospital C.E.O.s: nearly half a million dollars per year at each hospital.Over all, high 508 recipient hospitals had $1.25 billion in additional spending from 2005 to 2010 about 25 percent more than they otherwise would have.There was no evidence of improved quality or outcomes.If you told me in advance that wed find this tight a link between Congress and hospitals, I would have been very surprised, Mr. Cooper said.We knew there was some connection, of course, but the more we kept digging, the stronger and more precise the link became.Section 508 payment changes were supposed to expire after three years.But hospitals with lucrative waivers had considerable interest in seeing the program extended, and worked together to form the Section 508 Hospital Coalition.In the years between passage of the M.M.A., and its reauthorization in 2007, legislators in districts with a Section 508 hospital saw a 22 percent rise in total campaign contributions, and a 65 percent increase in donations from the health care sector specifically.In the end, a provision that budgeted $900 million over three years led to billions in extra spending for nearly a decade.Pork, it seems, is as bad for budgets as it is for waistlines.Every time you pass legislation, big or small, these elements are added in, Mr. Cooper said.Its not that any single one is hugely offensive.Its their accumulation and continuation over time.Although Mr. Coopers research offers perhaps the clearest empirical glimpse of the links between lobbying, earmarks and medical spending, this political maneuvering is not new and Medicare hospital payment seems to be a particularly susceptible target.Both Democrats and Republicans have won pay increases for hospitals they represent.In the 1999 budget, the House Republican whip, Tom DeLay, and House Speaker Dennis Hastert reclassified hospitals in their districts into other regions, leading to hundreds of thousands of dollars of extra funding per year.About a dozen years later, in what was called the Bay State Boondoggle , John Kerry, then a senator, succeeded in lobbying for Medicare to pay Massachusetts urban hospitals at the same rate it paid the states rural hospitals.The catch: There was only one hospital that qualified as rural in Massachusetts on the wealthy island of Nantucket.None of this is surprising.A primary motive of elected representatives is getting re-elected.Passing expansive legislation like Medicare Part D or the A.C.A.is hard, especially when legislators cant point to specific benefits for their constituents.But a critical flaw in our current system is that payments are hugely influenced by politicians who have every incentive to increase them for their own districts.You cant get upset at a snake for having fangs, Mr. Cooper told me.We need to design a system that takes payment decisions out of the hands of elected representatives.We think of interest rates as so important and complicated that weve tried to remove politics and give the responsibility to the Fed.The same argument holds for health care.When the government spends a trillion dollars on health care, its too easy for members to direct funds to their districts.Weve been close to a possible solution.The A.C.A.called for establishing an Independent Payment Advisory Board , a 15-member panel charged with making changes to Medicare to control costs.The proposed reforms would have been put into effect unless Congress introduced alternate policies to achieve the same savings.But the advisory board faced fierce bipartisan opposition and was never created.Americas increasingly burdensome health care spending has many roots: new technologies, high drug prices, fragmented care, administrative expenses and the like.But lobbying and political maneuvering can increase costs, too without clear benefits for patients, communities or society at large.Often these costs are borne by all of us, while the benefits if any go to a favored few.Excess medical spending, then, is driven not only by inefficiencies in our health system, but also by those in our political system.Our solutions, it seems, must confront that uncomfortable reality.Dhruv Khullar , M.D., M.P.P., is a physician at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital and a researcher at the Weill Cornell Department of Healthcare Policy and Research.Follow him on

Democrats Lack Strong Challengers for Some Vulnerable G.O.P. House Seats:::::Over all, there are 11 districts (out of the 50 districts that ought to be most competitive, by our estimates) where the Democrats dont have a candidate who raised $100,000.On average, those 11 districts are much less educated than the battlegrounds as a whole; just 31 percent of whites over age 25 have a degree.In comparison, whites with a degree represent 41 percent of the population in the other 39 districts that ought to be most competitive.Democratic Fund-Raising Lagging in Working-Class Districts Democratic share of fund-raising in the 50 Republican-held districts that are expected to be most competitive in 2018, by white educational attainment.20% 40 60 100% 75 50 25 0 Whites with degree Democratic share of fund-raising 20% 30 40 50 60 100% 75 50 25 0 Whites with a college degree Democratic share of fund-raising There is still plenty of time for Democrats to find candidates in those districts.And even in working-class areas, Democrats are doing far better at recruiting and fund-raising than in recent years.They have attracted strong recruits in many competitive working-class districts, like Maines Second, New Yorks 21st and Illinoiss 12th.Democrats even have well-funded challenges in a few working-class districts that werent bound to be competitive at all, like Paul Ryans district in Wisconsin, Kentuckys Sixth or Kansas Second.And working-class districts are often in less expensive media markets, making it easier for Democrats to make a late bid.Photo The Democrats will clearly have the money to compete in expensive markets like Los Angeles and New York.Theyve posted staggering fund-raising totals in many of the best-educated districts, often outpacing longtime Republican congressmen.If anything, Democrats might have the opposite problem in these well-educated areas: too many viable candidates.In Orange County, Calif., Democratic challengers have outraised Republican incumbents by a two-to-one margin this year, even though the Republicans got a head start before their Democratic challengers entered the race.But theres a catch: There are 15 Democratic candidates who have raised more than $100,000 in just those four districts, setting up a series of costly primaries that might ultimately prove detrimental to the partys general election chances.Theres a similar pattern in well-educated districts across the country.Democrats Have Many Candidates in Well-Educated Districts Number of Democrats who have raised over $100,000 in the 50 Republican-held districts that are expected to be most competitive in 2018.20% 40 60 6 4 2 0 Number of Dems over $100k Whites with a degree Number of Democrats who have raised over $100,000 in the 50 Republican-held districts that are expected to be most competitive in 2018.20% 30 40 50 60 6 4 2 0 Pct.whites with a degree Number of Dems over $100k The abundance of Democratic challengers in these well-educated districts is a reflection of huge enthusiasm.In these areas, theres no shortage of well-to-do and well-connected political novices looking to do something about Mr. Trumps presidency, just as there was no shortage of well-educated Democrats lining up for the Jan. 21 Womens March or donating to the campaign of Jon Ossoff in Georgias Sixth District special election.Few established politicians are standing in the way of these political newcomers.The Democratic bench is quite weak in these traditionally Republican and often heavily gerrymandered areas.There are no obvious contenders strong enough to clear the field.The enthusiasm among well-educated Democrats and the relative lack of success recruiting established politicians in working-class areas has occasionally led to an odd mismatch: affluent, liberal types running in working-class districts.Take Josh Harder, who worked for a San Francisco venture capital firm but is now running in Californias typically competitive 10th District in the Central Valley, or ex-Obama administration officials like Elissa Slotkin, Lauren Baer and Andy Kim, who are running in middle-class districts in Michigan, Florida and New Jersey.The good news for Democrats is that they dont need perfect recruits to pull off big wins if its a so-called wave election year.Mr. Ossoff was a true political novice and still came close to winning, and the 2006 and 2010 wave midterm elections are full of examples of fairly weak recruits who pulled off important victories.Advertisement Continue reading the main story But the G.O.P.starts from a position of strength: The Democrats path to a House majority is much more challenging than it was in 2006, or than it was for the Republicans in 2010.They cant afford to leave many districts like New Yorks 24th or Californias 21st off the board.
Mexicos Record Violence Is a Crisis 20 Years in the Making:::::It makes me desperate, he said, shaking his head at his countrys missteps, because this violence, its increasing.Extreme Measures Photo In 2006, a new president and a new drug cartel both took extreme actions, the consequences of which are still unfolding.The implosion of Colombian cartels set off a fierce competition in Mexico for control of the drug trade.A new cartel, La Familia Michoacna, broke off from a larger group, then cemented its power by deploying extreme, theatrical violence.Though they principally targeted other cartels, the gruesome attacks shocked Mexico.That same year, Felipe Caldern won the presidency by a hair.Though monitors approved the vote, his leftist opponent called it illegitimate, and the narrow victory for Mr. Caldern left him without a strong mandate.Shortly after taking office, the new president declared war on the cartels and sent in the military.Critics say Mr. Caldern sought to legitimize his presidency through the show of force.Defenders say he had little alternative.Mexico had been a single-party state and, like most such states, had controlled local officials through patronage and corruption.When that system disappeared, drug cartels filled the vacuum, buying off mayors and judges.Only the military had the firepower and autonomy to take them on.This began the drug war that has killed tens of thousands of people.But it also created a subtler set of problems now driving more and broader violence.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Short-Term Solutions, Long-Term Problems Photo Mr. Caldern adopted the so-called kingpin strategy, in which troops captured or killed cartel leaders.This generated headlines, pleased the United States and could be accomplished top-down, with little input from corrupt or weak local law enforcement.But this short-term solution to the drug war deepened long-term problems.In bypassing mayors and governors because Mexicos pre-democratic practices had left them systemically corrupt and unaccountable, the government further reduced their accountability.And in bypassing already weak local police and judges, the government allowed those institutions to atrophy, with money and political attention diverted to military and federal forces instead.Murder rate per 100,000 15 10 5 0 18.7 1998 2007 2011 2016 15 10 5

officers from conducting investigations drifted.As the kingpin strategy fractured the cartels, smaller groups rose in their place.Since then, said Alejandro Hope, a security analyst, there has been a significant change in the way organized crime works in Mexico.Drug trafficking required resources and infrastructure that the new groups lacked, leading many to turn to kidnapping, theft and extortion.Predatory crimes spiked.Ordinary Mexicans, once bystanders to the conflict, became its targets at a moment when the state had left them vulnerable.In the process of that fragmentation, we didnt do the job of structuring the institutions of the police forces, said Mr. Valds, who ran the civil national security intelligence service as this was unfolding.So we have the worst of the worst.Advertisement Continue reading the main story The Key Point of Failure Photo The solution to the problem would seem obvious.Strong police and prosecutors, overseen by politicians who are held accountable by voters, could close the vacuum in which gangs and corrupt officials flourish.Instead, disorder and violence have risen.Joy Langston, a political scientist at the Center for Research and Teaching in Economics in Mexico City, traces many of the countrys woes to a seemingly minor quirk in its political system.All candidates are selected by the party, and officials serve one term before being shuffled off to another post.During the one-party era, this was meant to impose accountability, which flowed from party leadership.Oversight institutions, seen as superfluous, never fully developed.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Subscribe to the Interpreter Newsletter Understand the world with sharp insight and commentary on the major news stories of the week.Democracy, as intended, undercut the partys once all-encompassing power.But the old system built around the assumption of a strong central authority remains in place.This has weakened the state while cementing many of its old problems, creating what Ms. Langston called a nightmare scenario in which the institutions of accountability and transparency are extraordinarily weak even after 17 years of democracy.For example, voters have little opportunity to kick out bad leaders or reward good ones, giving officials little incentive to push through difficult reforms.And criminal groups are able to fill the pockets of notoriously underpaid policemen and other civil servants often providing the wrong kind of incentives.At the end of the day, this is all an issue of accountability, Mr. Hope said.That is the key point of failure in Mexico.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Nothing happens if a police officer does not do their work, he added.Nothing happens if a mayor fails to transform local law enforcement.Nothing happens if a governor fails to invest in prosecutorial services.Nothing happens.A Frail State Recedes Though recent electoral changes will allow some officials to stand for re-election in 2021, deeper problems are taking root.As public outrage over corruption rises, party leaders, seeing their own careers in peril, are becoming more reluctant to risk pushing for change.I cannot think of a single prosecutor or judge who stands out on fighting corruption, said Paul F. Lagunes, a Columbia University professor who studies corruption.There are people staking their careers on this, but not in the judiciary in the press, Mr. Lagunes said.But, he added, Mexico is one of the riskiest countries in the world to do journalism.The combination of corruption, weak accountability and weak institutions has left the state vulnerable.In poor and rural areas, it has effectively receded.Criminal groups and youth gangs are filling the void, co-opting local officials or simply muscling them out.The result may be less dramatic than Mr. Calderns drug war, in which warring cartels publicly displayed dismembered corpses.But it is just as deadly, playing out in thousands of home invasions, gang killings and stickups gone wrong.State and Society Atomize This is leading communities to do, at the grass-roots level, what Mr. Caldern did a decade earlier: bypass distrusted institutions, worsening the underlying problem.Advertisement Continue reading the main story Businesses and middle-class Mexicans are hiring private security in record numbers.But like the Army, hired guards cannot solve crimes or lock up suspects.Mark Ungar, a Brooklyn College professor, said this growing practice relieves a lot of political pressure on the state to improve the police.Rural communities, which are more vulnerable, have formed self-defense militias to run off gangs and mayors alike.Inevitably, the militias are even more corruptible and less accountable than the police they replaced.Nearly all target their onetime sponsors for extortion, robbery and kidnapping.Many are involved in the heroin trade, which is booming as opioid addiction drives up American demand.In a disturbing trend, desperate and frightened communities increasingly seek at least the illusion of security by lynching suspected criminals.Mr. Ungar said these expressions of vigilantism represent a disempowerment of the state.Paralysis Amid Disaster Photo Mexicans seem keenly aware that their government is growing less responsive just as streets are becoming more dangerous.Polls show growing dissatisfaction, particularly over corruption.We have this political class that totally forgets why they are there, said Armando Torjes, a community activist in Guadalupe, a working-class city in the northeast.Each election, he said, brings a new official with a new three-year plan.Most, he added, leave office conspicuously wealthier.Advertisement Continue reading the main story When officials do act, they address superficial issues, adding more patrols or changing police strategy without confronting what he called the countrys social decomposition.Mr. Valds, the former head of the intelligence service, described facing a similar struggle in top levels of government.We wanted to improve the institutions, the judges, the jails, the police, he said.We spent years trying to convince the political class.But he found those institutions dominated by parties rather than technocrats and subject to the whims of officials who are required by law to cycle out every term unresponsive, just as Mr. Torjes had.Whats happening in Guadalupe is whats happening in all of Mexico, Mr. Torjes said.There was a political demand for change, but nothing really changed for us.
The Cookie Crumbles: A Retracted Study Points to a Larger Truth:::::Before the study period, about 20 percent of the children chose an apple, and 80 percent the cookie.But when researchers put an Elmo sticker on the apple, more than a third chose it.Thats a significant result, and from a cheap, easily replicated intervention.While the intervention seems simple, any study like this is anything but.For many reasons, doing research in nutrition is very, very hard.Photo First, the researchers have to fund their work, which can take years.Then the work has to be vetted and approved by an Institutional Review Board, which safeguards subjects from potential harm.I.R.B.s are especially vigilant when studies involve children, a vulnerable group.Even if the research is of minimal risk, this process can take months.Then theres getting permission from schools to do the work.As you can imagine, many are resistant to allowing research on their premises.Often, protocols and rules require getting permission from parents to allow their children to be part of studies.If parents (understandably) refuse, figuring out how to do the work without involving some children can be tricky.Finally, many methodological decisions come into play.Lets imagine that we want to do a simple test of cookies versus apples, plus or minus stickers as this study did.Its possible that children eat different things on different days, so we need to make sure that we test them on multiple days of the week.Its possible that they might change their behavior once, but then go back to their old ways, so we need to test responses over time.Its possible that handing out the cookie or apple personally might change behavior more than just leaving the choices out for display.If thats the case, we need to stay hidden and observe unobtrusively.This matters because in the real world its probably not feasible to have someone handing out these foods in schools, and we need the methods to mirror what will most likely happen later.Its also possible that the choices might differ based on whether children can take both the apple and the cookie (in which case they could get the sticker and the treat) or whether they had to choose one.I point out all these things to reinforce that this type of research isnt as simple as many might initially think.Without addressing these questions, and more, the work may be flawed or not easily generalized.Advertisement Continue reading the main story These difficulties are some of the reasons so much research on food and nutrition is done with animals, like mice.We dont need to worry as much about I.R.B.s or getting a school on board.We dont have to worry about mice noticing whos recording data.And we can control what theyre offered to eat, every meal of every day.But the same things that make animal studies so much easier to perform also make them much less meaningful.Human eating and nutrition are typically more complex than anything a mouse would encounter.Overcoming these problems and proving spectacular results in preteens are some of the reasons this study on cookies and apples, and others like it, are so compelling.The authors have transformed this work into popular appearances, books and publicity for the Food and Brand Lab.Photo But cracks began to appear in Mr. Wansinks and the Food and Brand Labs work not long ago, when other researchers noted discrepancies in some of his studies.The numbers didnt add up; odd things appeared in the data, including the study on apples and cookies.The issues were significant enough that JAMA Pediatrics retracted the original article, and the researchers posted a replacement.The problems didnt end there.As Stephanie Lee at BuzzFeed recently reported, it appears that the study wasnt conducted on 8-to-11-year-olds as published.It was done on 3-to-5-year-olds.Just as mice cant be easily extrapolated to humans, research done on 3-to-5-year-olds doesnt necessarily generalize to 8-to-11-year-olds.Putting an Elmo sticker on an apple for a small child might matter, but that doesnt mean it will for a fifth grader.On Friday, the study was fully retracted.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Making things worse, this may have happened in other publications.Ms. Lee has also reported on a study published in Preventive Medicine in 2012 that claimed that children are more likely to eat vegetables if you give them a cool name, like X-ray Vision Carrots.That study, too, may be retracted or corrected, along with a host of others.As a researcher, and one who works with children, I find it hard to understand how you could do a study of 3-to-5-year-olds, analyze the data, write it up and then somehow forget and imagine it happened with 8-to-11-year-olds.The grant application would have required detail on the study subjects, as well as justification for the age ranges.The I.R.B.would require researchers to be specific about the ages of the children studied.I reached out to the authors of the study to ask how this could have happened, and Mr. Wansink replied: The explanation for mislabeling of the age groups in the study is both simple and embarrassing.I was not present for the 2008 data collection, and when I later wrote the paper I wrongly inferred that these children must have been the typical age range of elementary students we usually study.Instead, I discovered that while the data was indeed collected in elementary schools, it was actually collected at Head Start day cares that happened to meet in those elementary schools.This is a level of disconnect that many scientists would find inconceivable, and I do not mean to suggest that this is the norm for nutrition research.It does, however, illustrate how an inattention to detail can derail what might be promising work.The difficulties of research in this area are already significant.Distrust makes things worse.The social sciences are already suffering from a replication problem; when work that makes a big splash fails to hold up, it hurts science in general.We want to believe there are easy fixes to the obesity epidemic and nutrition in general.We want to believe there are simple actions we can take, like putting labels on menus, or stickers on food, or jazzing up the names of vegetables.Sadly, all of that may not work, regardless of what advocates say.When nutrition solutions sound too good to be true, theres a good chance they are.
Why the Fact-Checking at Facebook Needs to Be Checked:::::Advertisement Why the Fact-Checking at Facebook Needs to Be Checked Since the 2016 presidential campaign, Facebook has taken a number of actions to prevent the continued distribution of false news articles on its platform, most notably by labeling articles rated as false or misleading by fact checkers as disputed.But how effective are these measures?To date, Facebook has offered little information to the public other than a recent email to fact checkers asserting that labeled articles receive 80 percent fewer impressions.But more data is necessary to determine the success of these efforts.Research (including my own) suggests the need to carefully evaluate the effectiveness of Facebooks interventions.Yales Gordon Pennycook and David Rand offer two principal warnings.First, the effects of exposure to false information are not easily countered by labeling, as they find in a paper they wrote with Tyrone D. Cannon.False information we have previously encountered feels more familiar, producing a feeling of fluency that causes us to rate it as more accurate than information we have not seen before.This effect persists even when Facebook-style warnings label a headline disputed.We should be cautious about assuming that labels tagging articles as false are enough to prevent misinformation on social media from affecting peoples beliefs.Image Images from the survey Brendan Nyhan and his students used as research for their paper about the effects of labeling news as fake.(For the record, Mr. Trump did not plagiarize Bee Movie in his inaugural address.)Credit In a second paper , Mr. Pennycook and Mr. Rand find that the presence of disputed labels causes study participants to rate unlabeled false stories as slightly more accurate an implied truth effect.If Facebook is seen as taking responsibility for the accuracy of information in its news feed through labeling, readers could start assuming that unlabeled stories have survived scrutiny from fact checkers (which is rarely correct there are far too many for humans to check everything).Encouragingly, my students at Dartmouth College and I find that the effects of Facebook-style disputed banners on the perceived accuracy of false headlines are larger than those Mr. Pennycook and Mr. Rand observed.The proportion of respondents rating a false headline as somewhat or very accurate in our study decreased to 19 percent with the standard Facebook disputed banner, from 29 percent in the unlabeled condition.It goes down even further, to 16 percent, when the warning instead states that the headline is rated false.(We find no evidence of a large implied truth effect, though we lack the statistical precision necessary to detect effects of the size Mr. Pennycook and Mr. Rand measure.)Other results suggest further reason for caution.Back in April, Facebook provided users with Tips to Spot False News in an article that was linked above users news feeds.We find that general warnings of this sort are also potentially counterproductive.When we showed a warning reminding users to remain skeptical and think critically to spot misleading articles, it did reduce belief in the accuracy of false news headlines somewhat but it also somewhat reduced the perceived accuracy of news articles that were not false.Readers seemed to become more skeptical of all the headlines that they encountered.(A similar effect was not observed for the fact-check banners.)Given these challenges, Facebooks partnership with fact checkers may be most effective in providing information to the platforms news feed algorithm, which allows the company to reduce the prominence of articles that fact checkers have rated as false or misleading.As the studies weve cited suggest, changing human beliefs is far harder than providing input to a computer program.But it seems we should be cautious about placing too much trust in a private algorithm that works most effectively by suppressing information, especially without further evaluation of its effects.Ultimately, the fight against false news must be won in public.
Post-ABC poll: Most Americans approve of Trump-Russia probe, and nearly half think Trump committed a crime:::::More than twice as many Americans approve as disapprove of special counsel Robert S. Mueller IIIs investigation of possible coordination between Donald Trumps 2016 campaign and the Russian government, a new Washington Post-ABC News poll finds, indicating that the conservative effort to discredit the probe has fallen flat as the case has progressed toward its first public charges.A 58 percent majority say they approve of Muellers handling of the investigation, while 28 percent say they disapprove, the Post-ABC poll finds.Peoples views depend in large part on their political leanings, but overall, Americans are generally inclined to trust Mueller and the case he has made so far.Meanwhile, fewer than 4 in 10 Americans say they believe Trump is cooperating with Muellers investigation, while about half believe he is not.A similar 49 percent think it is likely Trump himself committed a crime in connection with possible Russian attempts to influence the election, although more say this view is based on suspicion rather than on hard evidence.[Read full poll results | How the poll was conducted] Muellers investigation entered a new phase this week as he revealed charges against three former Trump campaign officials: former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, his longtime business partner Rick Gates, and foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos.Manafort and Gates were charged with crimes unrelated to their campaign work.In a 12-count indictment, the special counsel alleged that they engaged in a conspiracy to launder money and defraud the United States, stemming from their attempts to hide their work advising a Russia-friendly political party in Ukraine.Papadopoulos, meanwhile, pleaded guilty to lying to FBI agents about the nature and timing of his conversations with foreigners claiming to have high-level Russian connections.His plea, which was unsealed Monday, describes how he had extensive talks to try to broker a meeting between campaign and Russian officials, and high-level members of the campaign seemed to entertain what he was doing though some seemed to be wary.[For low level volunteer, Papadopoulos sought high profile as Trump adviser] The poll finds strong backing for the charges against Manafort and Gates nearly 7 in 10 approve and a general suspicion that more is to come.A narrow 53 percent majority say those charges and the plea by Papadopoulos for lying to the FBI represented broader wrongdoing by people involved in Trumps campaign, while 28 percent think they are limited to these instances.A spokesman for Muellers office declined to comment, and a White House lawyer did not immediately return messages.Mueller and Trump have notably different styles, with the president often airing his grievances publicly, while the special counsel works largely in secret.Trump was said to have fumed Monday at news of charges in the case, and on Twitter, he tried to cast the case against Manafort and Gates as unconnected to him.Sorry, but this is years ago, before Paul Manafort was part of the Trump campaign.But why arent Crooked Hillary & the Dems the focus?????he wrote, adding minutes later, ....Also, there is NO COLLUSION!The president and his surrogates have long sought to raise questions about the credibility of Mueller and his team.In the summer, they focused on the people Mueller was hiring, noting that many had donated to Democratic political candidates and Trumps opponent in the presidential election, Hillary Clinton.In a June 15 tweet, Trump called the probe the single greatest WITCH HUNT in American political history, adding that it was led by some very bad and conflicted people!More recently, Trump and his allies, buoyed by conservative media, have tried to point attention toward the Clinton campaigns role in funding the production of a salacious dossier about Trump which was prepared by a former British spy who got information from Russian sources.The special counsel has explored some of the allegations in the dossier.Conservatives have also sought to highlight Clintons alleged role in approving the sale of a Canadian company with mining rights in the United States to Russians nuclear energy agency.The Post-ABC poll finds politics influences peoples responses, with 78 percent of Democrats and 56 percent of independents approving of the way Mueller is handling the investigation, compared with 38 percent of Republicans.People on both sides of the aisle are more unified in supporting the particular charges against Gates and Manafort.A 57 percent majority of Republicans say they approve of that case, as do 78 percent of Democrats.Manafort and Gates have pleaded not guilty, and in a court filing Thursday, attorneys for Manafort asserted that the evidence against him had been embellished.Partisanship also colors how people perceive the significance of Muellers charges, with more than three-quarters of Democrats saying they represent broader wrongdoing by people involved in the Trump campaign, compared with a small majority of independents.Republicans are less united, with 46 percent saying wrongdoing is limited to Manafort, Gates and Papadopoulos and 30 percent saying they suspect broader misconduct.Almost a quarter of Republicans say they have no opinion.An 82 percent majority of Republicans say it is unlikely that Trump himself committed a crime, although half of independents and 74 percent of Democrats say that is likely.Among the public overall, 19 percent think there is solid evidence Trump committed a crime, while 30 percent say that is merely their suspicion.Among Democrats, a 30 percent minority believe there is solid evidence Trump committed a crime.Trump had in the past inquired about his power to pardon aides, and Democrats have feared he might move to fire Mueller before the probe is complete.White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, though, said this week that Trump had no intention or plan to make any changes with regard to the special counsel.And Ty Cobb, a White House lawyer overseeing the administrations handling of the Mueller probe, said there had been no talk of possible pardons for Manafort or Gates.The Post-ABC poll was conducted Oct. 30-Nov. 1 among a random national sample of 714 adults reached on cell and landline phones.The poll has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 4.5 percentage points.Scott Clement contributed to this report.
Trump heads to Asia where concerns are growing over possible war with North Korea:::::First lady Melania Trump and President Trump greet visitors at the White House on Friday before departing for a trip to Asia.(Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) President Trump departed Washington on Friday for his first visit to Asia, a 12-day swing through five countries that comes as the once unthinkable has become a palpable concern from Tokyo to Seoul to Beijing a war with a nuclear-armed North Korea.Trumps escalating rhetoric and Pyongyangs accelerating weapons programs have set the region on edge and prompted national security adviser H.R.McMaster to declare this week that the world is running out of time to stop the North.North Korea is a threat to the entire world, McMaster told reporters at the White House.Trumps trip with bilateral visits to Japan, South Korea and China and stops at regional summits in Vietnam and the Philippines could go a long way toward determining the success of his administrations policy.Aides said they are committed to applying maximum pressureon Pyongyang to head off its nuclear threat and resolve the situation peacefully.Senior White House aides said Trumps top priority on the longest overseas trip of any president since George H.W.Bush in 1991 will be to build on the initial success his administration has had in rallying international support for isolating North Korea.Responding to pressure from the United States, the United Nations Security Council approved two rounds of stiffer economic sanctions and a growing number of countries have severed diplomatic ties with Pyongyang and banished North Korean guest workers.But beyond the sanctions and the silent treatment looms the very real prospect that none of these tactics employed to varying degrees by previous administrations will convince North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un to veer from his pursuit of a nuclear weapon that can reliably reach the U.S. mainland a goal analysts said would sharply tilt the leverage in his favor in any future negotiations.That raises the question being privately assessed and publicly debated across Northeast Asia: How real are Trumps threats of using military options to prevent Kim from succeeding?I think the Chinese are divided on the seriousness of President Trump about the potential of a U.S. military strike, said Bonnie Glaser, a China analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies who visited Beijing last week.Some say President Trump is unpredictable and that he could launch a preventative or a preemptive attack.They worry the situation is getting out of control.Other experts think Trump is bluffing to scare Beijing into greater pressure on Kim.Glaser added: I sensed more of the former view.Theres more seriousness about the considerations being taken by the Trump administration.[What to look for during Trumps landmark Asia trip] In Tokyo, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe raised eyebrows during a gathering of international foreign policy experts last week when he acknowledged there is some worry about applying that much pressure on North Korea and whether this will lead to war.The Japanese leader, whose governing Liberal Democratic Party emerged stronger last month after winning more parliament seats in a snap election, emphasized that his administration fully supports Trumps position that direct diplomatic talks with the Pyongyang are not worthwhile given Kims consistent provocations.Of course, I do not wish for a conflict, Abe said at the Mt.Fuji dialogue.However, dialogue with North Korea for the sake of dialogue is meaningless.In Seoul, Trumps handling of the North Korea crisis has led to a number of angry public protests ahead of his arrival and widespread confusion and apprehension over his intentions.President Moon Jae-ins administration, which came to power this year advocating for a more open policy toward the North that favored talks, has sought to align more closely with the United States in the wake of Kims increased nuclear and ballistic missile tests.But Moons aides objected to White House proposals that Trump visit the heavily guarded demilitarized zone that divides North and South Korea over fears that his rhetoric would further inflame tensions at a time when the South is preparing to play host to the Winter Olympics early next year.Trump has threatened that Pyongyang would feel the fire and fury of the U.S. military if it continued its threats and the president pledged to totally destroy the North if necessary during a speech at the United Nations in September.The White House agreed to have Trump instead visit Camp Humphreys, a joint U.S.-South Korea military base south of Seoul.But at recent protests, South Koreans waved signs that superimposed the American leader over nuclear explosions.President Trump is frequently making ludicrous comments implying war, said Han Sun-bum, a representative of one of the largest protest groups, the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions.His comments, coupled with large scale joint military exercise, have created a very precarious situation in the Korean Peninsula.Trumps trip includes heavy messaging on the U.S. commitment to strong defense cooperation with allies in East Asia.The president will stop first at Pearl Harbor in Hawaii, where he plans to tour the USS Arizona, the battleship sunk during the Japanese surprise attack in 1941 that drew the United States into the Pacific theater in World War II.In Tokyo, Trump is scheduled to speak with U.S. troops at Yokota Air Base and meet with the families of Japanese citizens who were abducted by North Korean agents in the 1970s.In Seoul, he will address the South Korean National Assembly emphasizing that all nations must act with increased urgency.Asked if Trump plans to use same type of inflamed rhetoric he often has when discussing Pyongyang, McMaster said: I dont think the president really modulates his language.He added: Ive been aware of the discussions about, Hey, is this inflammatory?And whats inflammatory is the North Korean regime and what theyre doing to threaten the world.Foreign policy experts called Trumps public threats and belittling of Kim the president has dubbed him Little Rocket Man a misguided attempt to apply psychological pressure.In fact, they said, such tactics allow Kim to further demonize the United States.[In U.N. speech, Trump threatens to totally destroy North Korea and calls Kim Jong Un Rocket Man] One former Obama administration official called Trumps rhetoric sophomoric and said it was a primitive misreading about how they operate.This former official, who asked for anonymity to speak bluntly, said if Trump veers off the teleprompter into belittling insult-land that could significantly increase the distress felt throughout South Korea, where some hard-liners in parliament have suggested the nation should consider developing its own nuclear arsenal.Meantime, China, where Trump will have a three-day state visit, has announced a crackdown on banks that do business with the North, although experts said it is hard to gauge how seriously Beijing will implement the new controls.Chinese President Xi Jinping emerged more powerful after the Communist Party Congress last month, and Cui Tiankai, Chinas ambassador to Washington, told reporters this week that the United States and its allies could do more to resolve the standoff peacefully.If only China is making its best efforts and others are doing things that lead to an escalation of tensions, this issue will not be solved, Cui said.The Trump administration, following the policies of past administrations, has refused to entertain the Chinese proposal of freezing U.S. and South Korean military cooperation in exchange for a freeze on North Koreas weapons testing.McMaster ruled out the idea again this week, saying Pyongyang cannot be trusted to abide by any such agreements.Were out of time, McMaster said.In terms of scenarios, the presidents always very clear: You know he doesnt draw red lines, he doesnt forecast directly or say directly what hes going to do.But hell do whatever it takes to protect the American people and our allies.Taylor reported from Seoul.Yoonjung Seo in Seoul contributed to this report.
Trump: I dont remember much about meeting with Papadopoulos, campaign adviser who has pleaded guilty:::::President Trump said he did not remember much about a meeting last year with former adviser George Papadopoulo, who pleaded guilty as part of a federal probe into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election.(Reuters) President Trump on Friday sought to diminish the importance of the campaign foreign policy meeting where former adviser George Papadopoulos tried to broker connections between Russians and the Trump campaign, with the president claiming that he did not remember what was said.The meeting, which took place in Washington on March 31, 2016, included a team of foreign policy advisers as well as Trump and then-Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), who is now the attorney general.The session has become a key focus of special counsel Robert S. Mueller III's wide-ranging investigation of Russia's interference in the election and possible coordination with the Trump campaign.Mueller's office revealed this week in court documents that Papadopoulos pleaded guilty on Oct. 5 to lying to the FBI about trying to meet with Russians offering dirt on Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton based on stolen Democratic emails.Trump, who recently boasted of having one of the great memories of all time, told reporters Friday morning as he departed the White House for his 12-day trip to Asia, I don't remember much about that meeting.It was a very unimportant meeting, Trump said.It took place a long time ago.Don't remember much about it.In the meeting, according to court documents, Papadopoulos touted his connections to Russia in front of Trump and Sessions and offered to arrange a meeting between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin.J.D.Gordon, a Trump adviser who attended the meeting, recalled in an interview with The Washington Post that after Papadopoulos said he could introduce Trump to Putin, Sessions shut him down.It was a bad idea and the senator didn't want people to speak about it again, Gordon said.The meeting is a growing complication for Sessions, who is now under pressure from Senate Democrats to explain why he did not disclose details about it previously, considering he was asked multiple times under oath on Capitol Hill whether he or anyone on the campaign ever discussed meeting with Russians.[Democrats demand that Sessions explain his meeting with Papadopoulos] In February, a few weeks after being sworn in as president, Trump was asked at a news conference whether anybody who advised his campaign had any contacts with Russia.The president responded, No.Nobody that I know of.Trump and his aides have sought to diminish Papadopoulos's standing on the campaign.Trump cited him as a foreign policy adviser in March, during a meeting with The Post's editorial board.But he, as well as White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, have said this week that Papadopoulos played an insignificant role on the campaign.Trump tweeted Tuesday, Few people knew the young, low level volunteer named George.
Trump administration suggests possibility of disciplinary action against ACLU lawyers in abortion case:::::The Trump administration told the Supreme Court Friday that discipline could be warranted for lawyers for an undocumented teenage immigrant seeking an abortion because they misrepresented the status of her request in a way that kept the government from asking the high court to intervene.In a highly unusual filing reflecting the pre-eminence of abortion politics, Solicitor General Noel J. Francisco called out ACLU lawyers representing the girl, identified in court papers as Jane Doe.The document said the girls lawyers knew that the Justice Department planned to ask the Supreme Court on Oct. 25 to review a lower court decision saying the 17-year-old had a right to an abortion while in government custody.The ACLU lawyers had told government lawyers that under abortion laws in Texas, where the girl was detained, the abortion could not be performed until Oct. 26, according to the filing.Instead, the girl ended her pregnancy in the early hours of Oct. 25, before the Justice Department could file a stay request with the Supreme Court.The government is asking the court to vacate the decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C.Circuit that said she was entitled to an abortion.The government recognizes that respondents counsel have a duty to zealously advocate on behalf of their client, but they also have duties to this court and to the bar, the filing says.It appears under the circumstances that those duties may have been violated, and that disciplinary action may therefore be warranted.At the least, this court may wish to seek an explanation from counsel regarding this highly unusual chain of events.ACLU Legal Director David Cole said in a statement the governments charges were baseless.This administration has gone to astounding lengths to block this young woman from getting an abortion, Cole said.Now, because they were unable to stop her, they are raising baseless questions about our conduct.Our lawyers acted in the best interest of our client and in full compliance with the court orders and federal and Texas law.That government lawyers failed to seek judicial review quickly enough is their fault, not ours.The Justice Department has been criticized by some for failing to take the issue to the Supreme Court quickly enough to prevent the abortion, and Attorney General Jeff Sessions last week blamed the girls lawyers.This was a total surprise and really a breach of the kind of confidence that lawyers should be able have with one another, and we were very upset about it, Sessions said in an interview with Foxs Bret Baier.I think its a serious problem, should not have happened and were disturbed about it.Im very disappointed that these lawyers were able to take the client around the law to avoid a court hearing at least.Lawyers who practice at the Supreme Court said that they could not remember a similar request to the court, and some theorized that the solicitor generals office was feeling political heat from not moving faster to try to get the high court to step into the fight before it was too late.A news release from Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton (R) after the girl obtained the procedure mentioned that the the Department of Justice failed to appeal to the United States Supreme Court a ruling allowing the abortion.Others, however, said it was quite common for lawyers in high-profile cases to rely on each others representations in making decisions about the timing of appeals.The Central American teenager, identified only as Jane Doe in court papers, is being held in a government-funded shelter and had been seeking an abortion since late September.She learned she was pregnant shortly after crossing the border where she was detained, her lawyers said.She convinced a Texas judge she was mature enough to make the decision to end the pregnancy without the notification of her parents, whom she said she feared, according to her lawyers.But the Trump administrations Department of Health and Human Services has changed its policies, and says it will not facilitate abortions for undocumented minors in federal custody.Scott Lloyd, director of the Office of Refugee Resettlement, the HHS agency that oversees the minors, said in a March email that government-funded shelters caring for the minors should not be supporting abortion services pre or post-release; only pregnancy services and life-affirming options counseling.A federal district judge ordered the abortion to proceed, but a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C.Circuit stopped the process, and said it was preferable that the government find a sponsor for the girl, which would take the government out of helping her receive an abortion.The full circuit reversed that decision in a 6-to-3 ruling, followed a few hours later by a new order from the district judge.And that started the race that Tuesday night.For the solicitor generals office, it was to get the issue before the Supreme Court.For lawyers for the girl, it was to get her the abortion.She was 15 weeks pregnant at the time.Texas law requires medical counseling at least 24 hours in advance of an abortion by the same physician who performs the procedure.The 17-year-old underwent counseling on Oct. 19, allowing her to have the abortion any time after lower courts issued the order in her favor, depending on the doctors availability.The ACLU said the procedure was done in full compliance with Texas law.
Trump claims one of the great memories of all time. Its certainly one of the most convenient.:::::Last week, President Trump said that he had one of the great memories of all time.On Friday, he said he didn't remember details of a meeting that took place last year.I dont remember much about that meeting, Trump said of the meeting where adviser George Papadopoulos said he could arrange a sit-down between Trump and Vladimir Putin.It was a very unimportant meeting.It took place a long time ago.Dont remember much about it.And this is hardly the first time that one of the greatest memories ever has also proven to be one of the most convenient memories ever.The reason Trump would downplay the memorability of the meeting is clear: Papadopoulos's proposal for a Trump-Putin get-together was revealed this week in unsealed documents from the Russia investigation, and that flies in the face of Trump's and his campaign's statements that they didn't talk to Russia during the campaign.Details of this meeting were also apparently forgotten by Attorney General Jeff Sessions, whose denials of contacts with Russians are now riddled with holes.But Sessions never claimed to have a historically superior memory; that would be Trump.And a brief trip down memory lane suggests that memory fails him at plenty of opportune times.There are, of course, the 35 times he said he didn't remember something during a deposition in the Trump University lawsuit in December 2015.Then there were the 24 times he said that in a separate Trump University lawsuit deposition in 2012.Some other examples: And in fact, even Trump's ability to remember his claims of having a fantastic memory are subject to this convenient memory block.Back in that 2015 deposition, when Trump said repeatedly that he didn't remember things, he was asked about another time that he had claimed to have one of the best memories in the world.He didn't remember that.I remember you telling me, but I don't know that I said it, Trump said, adding: I don't remember saying that.As good as my memory is, I don't remember that.The quote Trump didn't remember?It had come less than three weeks earlier.
Trumps latest target, the diversity visa program, wasnt always aimed at achieving diversity:::::Cyclists ride past a message paying tribute to the Oct. 31 terrorist attack victims in New York on Nov. 2.(Jewel Samad/AFP) Some of President Trump's critics are wondering whether he would be so opposed to the diversity visa lottery program if the demographics of its beneficiaries hadn't changed from those who inspired the original version of it.After federal authorities said Sayfullo Saipov, who came to the United States under the diversity visa program also known as the green card lottery, killed eight people and injured a dozen others Tuesday by driving a rented truck into walkers and cyclists, Trump began railing against the program.I am going to ask Congress to immediately initiate work to get rid of this program, diversity lottery, diversity lottery.Sounds nice, it is not nice, it is not good.It hasn't been good and we have been against it, Trump said on Wednesday.It's not clear how long Trump has been against the program since there are no tweets or records of him speaking out about it specifically before this week.Ironic that the Diversity Visa Program, created largely to benefit white immigrants, is by virtue of its name now associated with PC culture Lachlan Markay (@lachlan) November 1, 2017 Historian Carly Goodman wrote about the history of the program for The Washington Post in July: The drive for the diversity visa program began in the late 1980s, when tens of thousands of Irish fled economic problems in Ireland and moved to the United States without going through the formal immigration procedures.Unlike previous generations of Irish immigrants, they no longer enjoyed privileged access to visas based on their nationality, and because few people from Ireland had emigrated in the booming postwar years, aspiring emigrants in the 1980s had no close relatives to sponsor them for visas.In the country without permission, they found themselves castigated in the United States as undocumented immigrants.Undocumented Irish immigrants and Irish Americans, through groups like the Irish Immigration Reform Movement, lobbied Congress to legalize the Irish already in the United States and to make sure future visas would be reserved for the Irish.Policymakers were moved by their plight, not least because the image of the Irish immigrant contrasted starkly with who they imagined were illegal aliens.But the Irish and their allies in Congress needed to deflect criticism that they were proposing a special gift just for the Irish.They framed the program as an issue of diversity, borrowing the word from a 1981 report by the Select Commission on Immigration and Refugee Policy that identified cultural diversity as an important goal.The choice of words reflected the popularity of diversity as a cultural value in a country that was rapidly becoming more racially and ethnically diverse.The current recipients of green cards through the program are no longer predominantly white.The Washington Post previously reported the State Department offers 50,000 visas through it each year, and most are awarded to people from African nations.Applicants must meet some education and job requirement standards, then are chosen at random from a computer lottery.Trump has this week supported moving to a merit-based system, which would give preference to applicants with professional skills and higher education credentials.The terrorist came into our country through what is called the "Diversity Visa Lottery Program," a Chuck Schumer beauty.I want merit based.Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 1, 2017 That the program no longer primarily benefits white people from Europe has led some to wonder if Trump's main problem with current immigration policy is with the people who now are helped by it: ethnic and religious minorities.[President Trumps incomplete history of Schumer and the Diversity Visa Lottery Program] Regarding Trump's policies on immigration with ending the Dreamer program and now threatening to end this diversity visa program to me it all springs from a far-right white nationalist agenda akin to what we see with right-wing, anti-immigrant parties in Europe, Sirius radio host Dean Obeidallah told the Fix.They truly fear changing racial demographics because they believe it will hurt America or their own income.New York Times contributor Wajahat Ali said Trump's approach to focus on the ethnicity of an immigrant in moments like this is red meat for his base.It's a deliberate strategy right after a terrorist attack where the suspect is Muslim, ethnic or foreign, he told the Fix.Compare and contrast that to his relative impotence in any policy reform after Las Vegas or even Charlottesville.Jonathan Jayes-Green, co-creator of UndocuBlack, said that Trump's interest in ending the program is the latest example of how he and other conservatives want different rules for immigrants of color.We see this latest move as a continuation of Trump's white supremacist agenda that seeks to make America white again, he said.Thats what Trump wants.To get rid of all of our black and brown communities through any means necessary.And we refuse to be silent while he wages war on our communities.Trump supporters regularly defend the president by saying that he is not against immigration but simply illegal immigration.But when Trump says that policies aimed at diversifying the country sound nice but are not nice, it sends a message to those who truly believe that one of the things that makes America so great is diversity.
Laura Ingrahams tough(ish) Trump interview highlights a line in conservative media:::::Less than a year ago, Laura Ingraham was in the running to become President-elect Donald Trump's spokeswoman.I am honored to be considered for that job and other jobs, she said on Fox & Friends, shortly after Election Day.So, we'll see what happens.What happened is that Ingraham's name came up again when Sean Spicer's stint as White House press secretary came to an end, but the conservative talk radio host and founder of Lifezette ultimately landed a prime-time show on Fox News, which premiered this week with an all-star guest lineup: White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly on Monday, Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas on Wednesday and President Trump on Thursday.At times in her sit-down with Trump, Ingraham was as obliging as would be expected of someone who previously contemplated a role as the president's official mouthpiece.Take this exchange, for example: INGRAHAM: Hillary Clinton said [Wednesday] night that paying for the dossier she defended it, basically.That it's different from meeting with Russians, like meeting with Russians.She's trying to make a comparison to say, oh, no.She totally defended it.TRUMP: Well, she talked about oppo research is wonderful, oppo research and it's but not when it comes to us, okay?Oppo research for us, of course, is no good.No, that dossier, which is totally fake and made up it's like a novel but that dossier is a disgrace.And it should not have been allowed to be used.And then I hear the kind of money they spent.INGRAHAM: Nine million.TRUMP: I mean, it's inconceivable.It's absolutely inconceivable.It's horrible.Ingraham wasn't so much questioning Trump here as teeing him up to attack Clinton.And the dollar figure she quoted was a misleading way of helping the president create the false impression that his opponents spent millions to gin up a fake dossier of alleged connections to Russia.Here's what actually happened: The Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee paid $9.2 million to the law firm Perkins Coie for various services.That's where Ingraham got her number.But Perkins Coie paid only $1.02 million to a firm called Fusion GPS for opposition research.And Fusion GPS, in turn, paid $168,000 to Orbis Business Intelligence, the firm run by a former British spy who produced the dossier.The dossier's real price tag was far smaller than Ingraham suggested.Yet, in other moments, Ingraham pressed Trump on his commitment to securing funding for a southern border wall and an end to chain migration as part of any deal that would allow DACA recipients to remain in the United States long term.Witness this exchange in which Ingraham tried over and over to pin down the president: INGRAHAM: Is that going to be part of any DACA deal?So if the Democrats TRUMP: Yes.INGRAHAM: want dreamer help, they're going to have to do TRUMP: Yes, we're going INGRAHAM: they're going to have to do E-Verify, chain migration?TRUMP: Sure.Sure, chain migration is one of the most important things and most people frankly INGRAHAM: Is that a requirement for you?TRUMP: until yesterday, most people never heard of chain migration.I gave a form of a news conference, and I started talking about chain migration.And this horrible animal he's an animal, as far as I'm concerned 23 people have touched him.Maybe came in because he was and he was only in with a green card, supposedly.But chain migration, where his whole family comes in, his mother can come in, his father, his grandmother.Everybody comes in.Chain migration is a disaster for this country.And it's going to end.Now, I've been talking about it for a while, but I think the public until yesterday probably never heard about chain migration.INGRAHAM: Oh, the Republicans, they didn't want to touch it for a long time.(CROSSTALK) TRUMP: It's become a very, very strong point right now.INGRAHAM: Will it be part of a dreamer deal in the DACA deal?TRUMP: Yes, it'll be part of a DACA deal.DACA is a lot different than dreamer.INGRAHAM: Yes, I think it's for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals.TRUMP: Right, yes.INGRAHAM: Will you require that if any amnesty talks will require chain migration to end?TRUMP: I don't think any Republican would vote for anything having to do with leaving chain migration.Chain migration is a disaster for this country, and it's horrible.Ingraham's approach to Trump highlights a line in conservative media.For outlets and commentators who generally support the president, there is a clear, categorical division between acceptable criticism and unacceptable criticism.The acceptable category includes criticisms aimed at holding Trump accountable for the promises he made to his base.Even Breitbart News is willing to hammer Trump when he deviates or falls short in areas such as health care, immigration and foreign policy.Virtually all other criticisms are in the unacceptable category.Trump's rhetoric is fine, and the whole Russia thing is fake news.The early indication is that Ingraham's show will adhere to these guidelines.She will be an advocate for Trump's voters and check the president's progress on the to-do list he made as a candidate.On most other points, she will defend him.
The Energy 202: Alaskans are sick and tired of everyone telling them not to drill:::::THE LIGHTBULB Lisa Murkowski speaking to reporters in September.(REUTERS/Joshua Roberts) The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is back on the legislative table again as GOP lawmakers search for revenue to help pay for a massive package of tax cuts.As part of a budget bill passed by the Senate last month, lawmakers instructed members of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee to find $1 billion in additional revenue a maneuver widely seen as designed to open the refuge to drilling.With the tax package on center stage yesterday in the House, senators sparred in the Energy and Natural Resources Committee on the other side of the Capitol over whether to allow drilling on one of few undisturbed parcels of land in the United States.The tiff foreshadows the partisan rifts that are likely to divide the upper chamber over paying for a tax package that Republicans need to claim as an accomplishment.On one side of the debate sat Republicans and virtually every Alaskan elected to statewide office, including Chair Lisa Murkowski (Alaska), who argue that opening ANWR to drilling will boost the states economy and the nations energy security.Using modern drilling techniques, they argue, it can be done with little environmental impact.On the other side sat virtually every Democrat, including ranking member Maria Cantwell (Wash.), who contend that the region is too ecologically critical to indigenous caribou hunters and the broader Arctic ecosystem to bore for oil.The committee meeting turned tense at times, with Cantwell pressing her Republican counterpart about why the bipartisan energy bill she and Murkowski introduced in June has been abandoned to take up the ANWR question yet again.This hearing is a great departure from the strong working relationship that Sen. Murkowski and I have set to work together on an energy agenda that will move our country forward, Cantwell said.Meanwhile, Alaska's independent streak was on display among the plethora of elected officials from the state in the hearing room.For those of us who call Alaska home, to suggest that we would despoil our environment for short-term gain is offensive, Murkowski said.(You can read more about the hearing here.)Tucked against the Beaufort Sea in Alaskas North Slope, a 1.5 million-acre coastal plain in the refuge has been part of a heated political debate since the 1980s.In 1989, Congress considered the issue of drilling in the refuge, and the Energy and Natural Resources Committee passed a pro-drilling bill.But it was shelved after the Exxon Valdez ran ashore in the Prince William Sound.In the 1990s, then-Sen. Frank H. Murkowski (R-Alaska), Lisas father, tried unsuccessfully, again.A 1995 attempt to open the refuge passed the GOP-controlled House and Senate but was vetoed by President Bill Clinton.A group of moderate Republicans defeated a similar attempt in 2005.Alaskas elected officials turned out in force for the hearing.Rep. Don Young, Alaskas long-serving and lone member of the House, shot back at opponents of the drilling plan, without naming names, for what he saw as their ignorance on Alaskan issues.I dont feel too comfortable on the Senate side, Young said.I need a flashlight most of the time because sometimes its pretty dark over here.Saying "I am Alaska," he went on to compare the size of the area that would be drilled to a dot on his nose.Alaska Public Radio Network's Liz Ruskin: @repdonyoung says he weighs 200 lbs.Compares impact of #ANWR drilling to a small blue dot on his nose.pic.twitter.com/wHYV0sCq5D Liz Ruskin (@lruskin) November 2, 2017 The hearing was attended by seemingly every Alaskan elected to statewide office, including Gov.Bill Walker (I), Lt. Gov.Byron Mallott (D) and Sen. Dan Sullivan (R), who all supported drilling in the refuge.During the four-hour hearing, Murkowski and other Republicans emphasized only one ten-thousandth, or 2,000 acres, of the refuge would be open to drilling if restrictions were eliminated.Cantwell and Sen. Angus King (I-Maine) countered that that figure discounts the impact of roads, airports and pipelines necessary to bring the oil out of the refuge and to the states primary petroleum artery, the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System.At one point, Cantwell held up a map showing, she said, that drilling will take up a significant portion of the refuge.Later, Young offered a rebuttal.The map that the ranking member showed was actually drawn up by the Sierra Club, he added.That bothers me.Thats old information.ANWR, the largest national wildlife refuge in the country, is owned by the federal government and is, in turn, an asset of all Americans not just Alaskans.But Alaskans along with other Western representatives, like Sen. Steve Daines (R-Mont.)are fiercely defending the right of those living and working in the state to have an outsize role in deciding ANWR's fate.As Jennifer A. Dlouhy of Bloomberg News noted: It's "a bit arrogant" for politicians in Washington to be dictating to Alaskans what to do on ANWR, @SteveDaines says.Jennifer A. Dlouhy (@jendlouhyhc) November 2, 2017 Many residents of Western states with significant federal footprints, including Alaska, would like to see their states take more control and in some cases, outright ownership of federally held land, which they see as often un- or underdeveloped.In turn, environmentalists worry that state officials are more likely to acquiesce to interests from the fossil-fuel, lumber and other industries.Because Republcians had more spots for invitees than Democrats at yesterday's Senate hearing, most of the Alaskans in attendance supported drilling.But not all of them.As Samuel Alexander, a member of the Gwichin tribe, put it during his committee testimony (via, again, the Sierra Club): Gwichin Samuel Alexander calls opposing drilling in Arctic Refuge an issue of freedom for Alaska Natives.#savetheArctic Sierra Club Lands (@WildLegacy) November 2, 2017 POWER PLAYS -- Clovis, out: President Trumps nominee to be his top scientist at the Agriculture Department withdrew his name from consideration Wednesday after it surfaced as part of the investigation into the relationship between Trumps campaign and Russian officials, report The Post's Juliet Eilperin and Philip Rucker.Clovis had encouraged Trump foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos to have an off the record meeting" with Russian officials, court documents from special counsel Robert S. Mueller III investigation show.In withdrawing his nomination, Clovis told Trump he didn't believe he would get a fair hearing from the Senate.Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) released a blistering statement following Cloviss withdrawal, calling him a comically bad nominee, even for this administration.He is inarguably unqualified, and he is wrong on almost every major issue relevant to the chief scientist post to which he was nominated," Leahy said."His nomination is all too typical of the anti-science agenda and the know-nothingism pushed by President Trump and his administration.But President Trump already knew that when he nominated Mr. Clovis, and that is not why his nomination was abruptly pulled today.Not because of his association with birtherism or as a climate change denier, or his other repugnant assertions.Rick Perry listening during a hearing about the electrical grid on Capitol Hill in October.(AP Photo/J.Scott Applewhite) -- Perry blunder alert: Energy Secretary Rick Perry on Thursday suggested the increased development of fossil fuels could help prevent sexual assault.After recently returning from a trip to Africa, Perry described an interaction he had during his visit at an energy policy discussion."I just got back from Africa, I'm going to finish up with this, because I think I heard a lady say there are people dying.Let me tell you where people are dying, is in Africa, because of the lack of energy they have there, Perry said at a talk held by Axios and NBC.And it's going to take fossil fuels to push power out into those villages in Africa, where a young girl told me to my face, 'one of the reasons that electricity is so important to me is not only because I'm not going to have to try to read by the light of a fire and have those fumes literally killing people.'But also from the standpoint of sexual assault.When the lights are on, when you have light that shines, the righteousness, if you will, on those types of acts.So from the standpoint of how you really affect people's lives, fossil fuels is going to play a role in that.I happen to think it's going to play a positive role."In addition to a broader effort by the energy secretary to endorse the use of fossil fuels, Perrys comment drew criticism for the connection he tried to make between their prevalence and any sexual-assault prevention: From The New Republic's Emily Atkin: But Perry's comments also willfully ignore the renewable energy boom and increasing potential in the developing countries he claims he wants to help.Emily Atkin (@emorwee) November 2, 2017 The Energy Department's press office said in a statement that Perry was "making the important point that while many Americans take electricity for granted there are peple in other countries who are impacted by their lack of electricity" adding that while on his trip to Africa, "he was told how light can be a deterrent to sexual assault and can provide security in remote areas."Read the full statement: The Sierra Club has called for Perry to resign over his remarks, calling it an inexcusable attempt to minimize a serious and pervasive issue.Read the statement from the groups Executive Director Michael Brune here, shared by The Hills Devin Henry: .@SierraClub calls on Rick Perry to resign over his sexual assault remarks pic.twitter.com/MfaM9RQmlu Devin Henry (@dhenry) November 2, 2017 The Post's Christopher Ingraham also explores further the concept of "more lights, less crime.""Although it's an assumption that many of us take for granted, evidence is mounting that nighttime brightness may do little to stop crime, and in some cases may make it worse," Ingraham writes, citing five studies from 1991 to 2005 that explored lighting practices and crime in the United States and in England.He adds: "Going back to Perry's remarks, the notion that light deters crime is probably the least baffling part of the line he drew from fossil fuel burning to sexual assault prevention.But there's little indication that the 'righteousness' of nighttime lighting will do much to stop crime in general to say nothing of sexual assault in particular."Andy Revkin, a climate reporter at ProPublica, defended Perry's remarks in part in a tweetstorm, arguing that academic studies focused on the developed rather than developing world: 1.@shanvav rebuttal of Perry's idea dark African streets are more dangerous for women relies on study of UK towns.https://t.co/m9ZfpTd3RJ Andy Revkin (@Revkin) November 2, 2017 3.Same

Energy Holdings worked to fix the island's power grid on October 15.(REUTERS/Alvin Baez) -- Perry on Puerto Rico: Also at the Axios event, the energy secretary conceded that the Trump administration was slow to respond to hurrican damage in the U.S. territory compared with recovery efforts in Texas and Florida.But he defended the reasons for the delay.So, were we slow getting it back?Yes, I would suggest to you we were slow getting it back, if you use Florida and Texas as your model.Puerto Ricos not Florida and Texas, for a lot of reasons, he said.Puerto Rico is very, very different from any other natural disaster that Ive seen in my 30 years of public service.Partly because it was an island, Perry added.He also noted that Bruce Walker, the departments assistant secretary for electricity was in Puerto Rico and teased that well be announcing some, I think, very positive changes to get electricity back on, per The Hill.As of Thursday, local government data reported that about 63 percent of customers on the island were still without power.-- Here's something about the Whitefish contract that was normal: Amid criticism over Puerto Ricos decision to award a no-bid contract to Whitefish Energy, FEMA itself has issued similarly noncompetitive contracts at a record rate, Bloomberg reports.The agency awarded $200 million in single-source contracts in the latest fiscal year, the most since 2008, per the report.And in the last month, FEMA gave $189 million in no-bid contracts, reporters Christopher Flavelle and Paul Murphy continue.The agency has not granted that many noncompetitive contracts in a single month since 2005 following Hurricane Katrina.Though no-bid contracts are sometimes awarded as a way to hasten processes in times of need, experts say its a worrisome practice.Neil Gordon, an investigator from the Project on Government Oversight told Bloomberg that lack of competition in contracting is a recipe for trouble as competition acts as a natural

Model S electric vehicle sits on display at the company's showroom in Shanghai, China.(Qilai Shen/Bloomberg) -- Electric vehicles targeted: Included in the tax plan that House Republicans finally unveiled on Wednesday is a proposed elimination of $7,500 of tax credits for electric vehicles, a development that may threaten projects by companies like Tesla.Even with the launch of its cheapest new model, the repeal of the credit would make it more difficult for a broad range of consumers to be able to afford the less-expensive model, Bloomberg reports.Trade groups have already expressed opposition to the proposed repeal.The potential elimination of the federal electric vehicle tax credit will impact the choices of prospective buyers and make the electric vehicle mandate in 10 states - about a third of the market - even more difficult to meet, Gloria Bergquist, a spokeswoman for the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, a trade group representing companies including GM, Toyota Motor Corp, and Volkswagen AG told Reuters -- Renewables, too: The tax proposal also strikes a blow against wind and solar credits, "reneging on a bipartisan deal made in Congress in 2015," according to The Post's Steven Mufson.Here's more from Mufson: "The credits were extended and will be phased out under a deal made by President Obama in exchange for allowing crude oil exports.Solar and wind companies were eager to make sure those credits remain untouched.But the new bill would increase how much work must be done to qualify for a production tax credit and it would reduce inflation adjustments for future production tax credits.The changes would generate $12.3 billion in revenues ultimately an added cost for renewable energy sources."THERMOMETER A view of the Los Angeles city skyline as heavy smog shrouds the city.(MARK RALSTON/AFP/Getty Images) -- Ten million Americans will be substantially affected by the changing climate by 2075, according to a new projection by the Congressional Budget Office.That kind of massive effect from rising seas and natural disasters will eventually lead to $39 billion in annual federal disaster spending, up from the current $28 billion, the office projects, per Bloomberg.But the CBO is suggesting that rather than spend on preventive measures, local officials should bear more of the financial burden."To the extent that households, businesses, and state and local governments in coastal areas do not bear the full cost of hurricane damage, such growth is subsidized by U.S. taxpayers," the budget office wrote, per Bloomberg."Shifting costs would increase incentives for private and public entities to take measures to limit expected damage."The CBO is now part of a trend, along with the Government Accountability Office, of non-partisan agencies issuing climate-related reports the Trump administration can do nothing to stop.In a report issued last month, the GAO concluded that the economic effects of climate change will be widespread both geographically and across sectors of the economy in the United States.Read more from The Energy 202 here.DAYBOOK POST PROGRAMMING ALERT: The Post and Live Nation will bring the Can He Do That?podcast to a live audience at the Warner Theatre on Tuesday, Nov. 7.In this live taping, political reporters Bob Woodward, David Fahrenthold and Karen Tumulty will join host Allison Michaels to review the past year in President Trumps White House and the biggest moments that made people wonder Can He Do That?Tickets can be purchased now at Live Nation.Attendees will also receive a free 30-day digital subscription to The Washington Post.Coming Up House Natural Resources Committee oversight hearing for Examining Challenges in Puerto Rico's Recovery and the Role of the Financial Oversight and Management Board is set for Nov. 7 .The Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works will hold a committee hearing on the nominations of Kathleen Hartnett-White and Andrew Wheeler on Nov. 8 .House Natural Resources Committee is scheduled for an oversight hearing on The Need for Transparent Financial Accountability in Territories Disaster Recovery Efforts for Nov. 14.EXTRA MILEAGE President Trump jokes that his mother would have never thought hed be president: A hippopotamus from Israels central safari zoo ventured out of its enclosure: Seth Meyers takes a closer look at the GOP tax plan and President Trump's recent comments after the attack in New York:
The Health 202: If the GOP really wanted to repeal key parts of Obamacare, they could use their tax plan to do it:::::THE PROGNOSIS Flanked by House Speaker Paul Ryan and House Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady, President Trump speaks about tax reform legislation at the White House on Thursday.(Drew Angerer/Getty Images) There's an opportunity through the GOP tax revamp introduced yesterday to dramatically overhaul how most Americans get their health insurance.But Republicans aren't going there.The single biggest carve-out in the U.S. tax code is for health plans offered by employers, who don't have to pay federal income or payroll taxes on their monthly premiums.This exemption -- created shortly after World War II as a way for employers to boost job benefits even amid wage controls -- has made employer-sponsored plans the chief source of health insurance for Americans.But it is also blamed for contributing to the country's health-care spending binge and costing people their health insurance whenever they change jobs.You heard that right the way to shift the U.S. health-care system back to one that's more market-driven, where people are encouraged to shop around for the best deal, is through a tax change, not through Obamacare repeal.The health-care bills Congress recently tried to pass would have affected the one-quarter of Americans who buy coverage on their own through the marketplaces created by the Affordable Care Act or via Medicaid.But way more people about half of all Americans receive health coverage through their jobs.The biggest policy reforms are often the hardest, and that's true in this case.Even though most conservative and liberal health economists agree that decoupling health insurance from the workplace could improve the U.S. health-care system in the long run, employers overwhelmingly oppose the idea.And any such move would likely spark a massive public outcry from the 150 million Americans who get insurance through their jobs.The tax draft that House Republicans released yesterday doesn't propose any changes to the employer exemption, even though Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) advocated capping the deduction in his Better Way agenda last year.This is not just a Republican issue.Democrats also regarded capping or even scrapping the employer tax break as too politically risky as they were writing the ACA back in 2010.Instead, they decided to tax high-cost health plans through the "Cadillac tax," which didn't appear to hit Americans so directly.There's another way Republicans have ducked controversy in their tax bill: by so far excluding a repeal of the ACA's individual mandate to buy coverage (something Trump is already pushing for on Twitter).Some conservatives, including Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), urged leaders to tack it on to the draft proposal, and the idea was even being tossed around Wednesday night as the final details were being crafted.I have what I will call maybe a creative idea, a novel idea, but one that I think is gaining momentum in the Senate and in the House, Cotton told reporters yesterday.We can repeal the individual mandate of Obamacare.But for now at least, the House tax plan doesn't try to touch Obamacare.That could change as Trump -- and conservative lawmakers and their allies in the interest group world -- keep pushing for a a long-sought victory in that arena.Trump had demanded individual mandate repeal in two tweets Wednesday: Wouldn't it be great to Repeal the very unfair and unpopular Individual Mandate in ObamaCare and use those savings for further Tax Cuts.....

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 1, 2017 Trump again told House Republicans in a meeting yesterday that he wants to roll back the individual mandate in the tax bill -- perhaps in the Senate, two lawmakers in attendance told the Hill."He just said he liked the idea and he had asked the senators about it and they said they were considering it," said Rep. Kristi Noem (R-S.D.), who participated in the meeting at the White House.Don't get us wrong: The House tax bill contains plenty of other controversial elements that Republicans will have to navigate if they have any hope of passing a final restructuring into law.The measure slashes corporate and individual income tax rates and jettisons numerous tax breaks Americans and businesses have used for years to limit their costs, my colleagues Damian Paletta and Mike DeBonis report.In the coming weeks, lobbyists will be furiously pressuring Congress to protect their preferred deductions.The tax bill does propose to do away with one health-care tax break a deduction on medical expenses beyond 10 percent of gross income.The deduction particularly benefits low-income families in which someone has a serious chronic condition requiring high-cost medical equipment or therapy.Per my colleague Glenn Kessler: Eliminating medical deduction saves just $8 billion a year.And 70% of those who claim it make less than $75,000 a year, per JCT pic.twitter.com/0fVqMIZndy Glenn Kessler (@GlennKesslerWP) November 2, 2017 From the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee: Bottom line, this entire bill is about putting an economic double standard into black letter law and the American people wont like it.Ron Wyden (@RonWyden) November 2, 2017 Cleaning up the tax code so you can lower overall tax rates might be a worthy goal -- it's riddled with exemptions, deductions and other loopholes that make filing taxes extremely complicated and cost the government tons of money every year.But for just about every carve-you try to repeal, there will be a an interest group fighting to protect it.Exactly so with the medical expense deduction: No one should face a large tax increase simply because they have high medical costs.But that's what the Health Tax does.pic.twitter.com/K1pDX7J6U8 AARP Advocates (@AARPadvocates) November 2, 2017 8.6 million Americans count on this deduction for much-needed relief from high health care costs.A tax hike is the last thing they need.AARP Advocates (@AARPadvocates) November 2, 2017 From Lisa Mascaro, who covers Congress for the Los Angeles Times and Chicago Tribune: Here's a bunch of deductions getting repealed: medical, alimony, dependent care, moving expenses, adoptions.... pic.twitter.com/bu2kZalpxC Lisa Mascaro (@LisaMascaro) November 2, 2017 Oh, and there's another tweak worth mentioning in the GOP tax proposal.Page 10 of the tax plan says parents can start a tax-exempt "529" college savings account for an unborn child.The provision provides that an unborn child may be treated as a designated beneficiary or an individual under section 529 plans, the plan says.An unborn child means a child in utero.A child in utero means a member of the species homo sapiens, at any stage of development, who is carried in the womb.That inclusion prompted praise from anti-abortion advocates.March for Life President Jeanne Mancini said she hopes lawmakers will also eventually expand the child tax credit to include the unborn.A child in the womb is just as human as you or I yet, until now, the U.S. tax code has failed to acknowledge the unborn child, Mancini said in a statement.But Rep.

opioid crisis a 'public health emergency.'(JIM LO SCALZO/EPA-EFE/REX/Shutterstock) AHH: If you listen to President Trump talk about the opioid crisis, you might think it's only a criminal justice issue.But the final report from his opioid commission rather surprisingly treats opioid abuse mostly as a medical issue, notably avoiding rhetoric indicating a return to the war on drugs, Vox's German Lopez writes.Consider the context, German writes.The commission was focused on a big drug crisis, established by a Republican administration, and chaired by a Republican governor a recipe that just a few decades or even years ago would have guaranteed that much of the report would have focused on how to punitively crack down on drugs through the criminal justice system.Yet the commission mostly treats the epidemic as a public-health issue.Take this excerpt: It is time we all say what we know is true: addiction is a disease, the commission writes.However, we do not treat addiction in this country like we treat other diseases.Neither government nor the private sector has committed the support necessary for research, prevention, and treatment like we do for other diseases.And just one of the commission's 56 recommendations is punitive.It suggests increasing penalties for fentanyl, a synthetic painkiller that is 50 to 100 times stronger than morphine.A few of the commissions recommendations also call on law enforcement to target drug trafficking organizations and bolster efforts to intercept fentanyl being sent via mail.German compares this language to a strategy blueprint released by the Office of National Drug Control Policy in 1989 during the cocaine crisis.We should be tough on drugs much tougher than we are now, that report said.In a televised address about the issue, then-President George H.W.Bush spoke about drug abusers more as culprits, not as victims.Of course, the commissions recommendations are just that -- recommendations.German described the report as a step forward but its up to the Trump administration to act.(iStock/Getty Images/Image Source) OOF: The House plans today to approve a bill funding the Children's Health Insurance Program, more than a month after funding for the program covering 9 million low-income kids technically expired.But Democrats are still refusing to support the measure because they don't like how it's paid for."A partisan morass over how to pay for the legislation all but ensures that state governments and millions of children will get little relief from the uncertainty that has faced the programs since funding officially expired a month ago," the New York Times' Robert Pear reports.It's a testament to the level of partisan rancor that grips Washington, Robert writes, since CHIP has typically been one of the few bipartisan areas of agreement in Congress.The lack of funding is sparking uncertainty among states, which depend on federal CHIP financing to keep their programs running."Unsure when Congress will provide more funds, some states have begun drafting notices to inform families that they could lose coverage.And lawmakers have shown little urgency in responding," Robert writes.Democrats and Republicans have agreed they want to fund CHIP for five years and community health centers for two years.The sticking point: Coming up with the $23 billion needed to pay for it all."House Republicans want to take money from a fund created by the Affordable Care Act that pays for a wide range of public health efforts, like preventing diabetes, vaccinating children, reducing the use of tobacco and fighting the opioid epidemic," Robert writes.It would also shorten the grace period for consumers who fail to pay their share of premiums for Obamacare premiums."Republicans say that some states have used the prevention fund as a slush fund, and that some consumers have abused the grace period to obtain a full years coverage while paying premiums for only nine months," Robert writes."Democrats are outraged that Republicans insist on offsetting every dollar of new spending on the child health program while pushing a tax bill that could add as much as $1.5 trillion to federal budget deficits over 10 years."Tujuana Bigelow sits outside her home in Glenarden, Md.Bigelow's son Warren Webb, may have died as a result of medical errors at the United Medical Center Nursing home.(Michael Robinson Chavez/The Washington Post) OUCH: Officials at D.C.'s only public hospital failed to report to regulators key details about a patient left alone to die at the facilitys nursing home in August, the Post's Peter Jamison reports.An incident report submitted to the D.C. Department of Health -- and obtained by The Post through a public records request -- left out information about the case of 47-year-old Warren Webb, which would likely have triggered an investigation of the long-term care unit at beleaguered United Medical Center.It didn't disclose that Webb died, let alone that he repeatedly cried out for help, complained of shortness of breath and was left lying on the floor for at least 20 minutes by his nurses after he rolled out of bed details reported by The Post based on interviews with eyewitnesses and a time-stamped audio recording of the incident.Instead, the Aug. 25 report says Webb was lower [sic] to the floor in sitting position when observed sliding out of his bed and was encouraged to wait for staff before attempting to get out of bed by himself.In response to a question on the reporting form that asks whether medical treatment was necessary, hospital officials wrote, No."The reports omissions could intensify scrutiny of the hospital by D.C. lawmakers," Peter writes."Next week the D.C.

Harris (Calif.), Ed Markey (Mass.), Maggie Hassan (N.H.), Jeanne Shaheen (N.H.) and Tom Udall (N.M.) and Baldwin said she plans to encourage Republicans to sign on as well.CMS Administrator Seema Verma.(Pete Marovich/Bloomberg) --Three major hospital lobbying groups say they will sue the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services over a rule finalized this week that would cut what hospitals are paid under the federal 340B drug discount program.Currently, nonprofit hospitals that qualify for the program receive 6 percent more than the sale price of drugs.But the finalized rule cuts that payment down to 22.5 less than the sale price, which will result in a 1.6 billion decrease in payments, Axios reports.The American Hospital Association, Americas Essential Hospitals and the Association of American Medical Colleges said they plan to sue over the rule, which indicates the Trump administration was siding with drugmakers and doctors who say hospitals are abusing the 340B program.It applied to just 1 percent of hospitals back when it was created in 1992, but has since dramatically expanded.By 2014 an estimated 45 percent of all Medicare acute care hospitals participated in the program, according to a 2015 overview by Medicare Payment Advisory Commission.A few more reads from The Post and beyond: Patrick Kennedy: At least $100 billion needed to fight opioids In an interview with The Hill, Kennedy said he views that $100 billion figure as "a starting point."The Hill EpiPen Failures Cited in Seven Deaths This Year, FDA Files Show Its not just about the price anymore.Complaints about the lifesaving device have doubled since 2016.Bloomberg HEALTH ON THE HILL What Did Bernie Sanders Learn in His Weekend in Canada?Canadian doctors seem to like their health care system as much as patients do, and Canadians generally appreciate the systems fairness.New York Times MEDICAL MISSIVES REPRODUCTIVE WARS Ohio House bans Down syndrome abortions, hears Heartbeat Bill After a lengthy, emotional debate, the Ohio House approved a controversial bill Wednesday that would ban abortions in cases in which the fetus might have The Colombus Dispatch DAYBOOK DON'T MISS THIS: The Post and Live Nation will bring the Can He Do That?podcast to a live audience at the Warner Theatre on Tuesday, Nov. 7.In this live taping, political reporters Bob Woodward, David Fahrenthold and Karen Tumulty will join host Allison Michaels to review the past year in President Trumps White House and the biggest moments that made people wonder Can He Do That?Tickets can be purchased now at Live Nation.Attendees will also receive a free 30-day digital subscription to The Washington Post.MORE POST PROGRAMMING: The Washington Post hosts Secretary of Veterans Affairs David Shulkin for a discussion that will include his departments efforts to curb the veterans suicide rate, address post-traumatic stress disorder and other health concerns on November 9.Today The Brookings Institution holds an event on policy approaches to the opioid crisis.Coming Up The American Enterprise Institute hosts an event on Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria on November 6.Axios hosts an event on a new era in cancer innovation with former Vice President Joe Biden and former first lady Jill Biden on November 8.The American Enterprise Institute holds an event on the opioid crisis with Rep.

The Finance 202: Wall Street escapes GOP tax cutters unscathed, so far:::::THE TICKER Speaker of the House Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) shakes hands with President Donald Trump.(Photo by Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) Want to keep up with all the ins-and-outs of Washington's tax plan in one easy package?Tory Newmyer has you covered.Businesses come in first under the tax plan that House Republicans debuted Thursday.Yet some of them have formed the point of the spear already aimed against it.The mixed reviews from the crowd that stands to reap some of the greatest rewards from the GOPs first draft of a tax overhaul reflects in part the complexity of a plan that cuts jaggedly across the existing code.It also flashes a red warning signal for Republicans as they try to compress the bulk of work on a once-in-a-generation project into what amounts to a legislative month.The plans top-line benefits for business interests are plain.After flirting as late as Wednesday with a proposal that offered only a temporary cut to the corporate rate, Republicans instead rolled out a plan that dramatically and permanently chops that rate from 35 percent to 20 percent, while skewing more than two-thirds of its benefits to businesses both large and small.That amounts to about $1 trillion of the $1.5 trillion in cuts the package hands out, according to a preliminary analysis by the Joint Committee on Taxation released Thursday by the House Ways and Means Committee.But a motley though potent array of industry groups has aligned against the package (see the bill text here), and its ranks could swell in the days ahead.Before the plan was even unveiled, the National Association of Home Builders and the National Association of Realtors signaled their opposition, pointing to new limits on deductions for mortgage interest and state and local taxes.On Thursday, they were joined by the National Federation of Independent Business the small-business lobby, a political powerhouse whose approval Republicans typically crave.The group said the plan doesnt do enough to relieve its members burden, since it limits a reduced rate for small businesses that pay through the individual side to only 30 percent of their income.The BUILD Coalition a collective of financial services firms, private equity investors, real estate developers and farmers came out against the bill for scaling back the write-off for interest on business debt.And the National Farmers Union, a group that rivals the NFIBs apple-pie credentials, said it will oppose the package for what it called shifting the tax burden from top earners to the backs of American family farmers, ranchers and the middle class.Rep. Kevin Brady (R-Tex.)vowed the tax cuts in the plan would be "transformational:" Other industry groups released placeholder statements, praising the release of the plan but indicating room for improvement.The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, for one, noted that a lot of work remains to be done.Meanwhile, tax departments in corporate headquarters across the country spent Thursday sifting through the 400 pages of bill text to try to assess what the proposal would mean for their bottom lines.Big tech companies blue-state stalwarts unloved by Republicans in general and facing new heat from Democrats over their role in the 2016 election are on especially high alert, industry lobbyists tell me.The proposal forces home their stash of overseas profits at a at a 12 percent rate, two points higher than they anticipated.And it subjects their future earnings to a new minimum tax changes that could add up to higher tax bills for some tech giants than the ones they pay now.(Rep. Ro Khanna, a Democrat whose Silicon Valley district includes the corporate headquarters for Apple, Intel, Yahoo and eBay, tells me that hes perfectly confident that the tech companies in my district are going to do great.But an industry lobbyist lamented that the sector finds itself seemingly friendless on the Hill all of a sudden.)Wall Street, that other money center in a liberal bastion, got what CapAlphas Charles Gabriel described as generally benign treatment in the bill.That maybe shouldnt come as a shock, considering two of the Big Six negotiators who spent months behind closed doors developing a framework for the plan namely Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and top White House economic advisor Gary Cohn just left financial services jobs last year to join the policymaking arena, both for the first time.Yet the industry, like tech, offers a juicy target for Republicans desperate for revenue and loathe to look for it in their own backyards.(Wonkblog has this analysis of how the bill's proposed elimination of deductions would hit blue states hardest.)House Speaker Paul D. Ryan unveils the GOP tax plan: Big banks pay high effective rates, so the corporate cut would mean a windfall."The five biggest diversified U.S. banks alone might have had tax savings of $11.5 billion in 2016 at that rate, the biggest sum for any sub-industry group tracked by S&P," WSJ's Rachel Louise Ensign and Telis Demos write.The bill also favors financiers by what it leaves out.The package doesnt revive a bank tax included in the last comprehensive Republican tax package, from then-Rep. Dave Camp in 2014, though it would stop big banks from expensing assessments they pay to the FDIC; it abandoned a cap on tax-free contributions to retirement plans, to the relief of asset managers; and it dropped a Trump campaign promise to hike the capital gains rate for carried interest earned by private equity investors and others.Further, an idea that Rep. Tom Reed (R-N.Y.) has been developing to impose a new tax on derivatives didnt make it into the bill and it wont be added later.We were ready to go, but there are so many ripple effects in this world, Reed, a Ways and Means member, tells me.This is going to be a longer-term effort, once tax reform is done, to normalize a lot of what we were discussing, getting support from all the stakeholders and educating people off the committee.Much is still subject to change.But those businesses that find themselves on the losing side of the bills math face a challenge.Tax writers used up all the deficit-spending leash the budget unspooled, so convincing lawmakers to write back in a preferencs means forcing them to pay for it elsewhere.The zero-sum battle will be joined as quickly as vested interests determine what side theyre on.(Read my colleague Steven Mufson's rundown on how a host of other industries look primed to fare, including manufacturers, oil and gas companies, and the renewable energy sector and this broader look from Heather Long at the bill's winners and losers, from the super-rich to the working poor.)Watch President Trump say the GOP tax plan will make the U.S. "competitive again": Watch this video explainer of the tax plan released yesterday: MARKET MOVERS FED WATCH: Powell's Rose Garden nod.FT's Sam Fleming and Demetri Sevastopulo: "Jay Powell was named by President Donald Trump as his nominee to serve as the next chair of the Federal Reserve, as he moved to make his mark on the worlds most powerful central bank...The 64-year-old Mr. Powell has been a serving Fed governor since 2012.A centrist on monetary policy, he is known as a pragmatic and down-to-earth official with private sector and government experience.A trained lawyer and former partner at private equity firm Carlyle, he also served in the Treasury under former president George H W Bush in the 1990s.Underlining the sense of stability he is expected to bring to the role, Mr. Powell said he would continue to work with colleagues 'to ensure that the Federal Reserve remains vigilant and prepared to respond to changes in markets and evolving risks'.""A safe gamble."WSJ's Greg Ip: "Trumps selection of Federal Reserve governor Jerome Powell to succeed Janet Yellen as chairman of the central bank is something of a gamble.Unemployment is at a 16-year low, economic growth is picking up, the stock market is setting records, and yet hes changing leaders at the institution most responsible for all of that.As gambles go, it looks like a safe one.Of all the candidates Mr. Trump considered after deciding not to keep on Ms. Yellen, Mr. Powells temperament and views come closest to hers.He believes the Fed should use all available toolsbond buying, interest rates and verbal guidanceto get unemployment down and keep inflation at its target of 2%.He backs the regulatory framework put in place under President Barack Obama, albeit with less strict implementation.Mr. Powells job will be turning those beliefs into effective policy."Who is Powell?Here's his bio, in 98 seconds: Four challenges.The Post's Sarah Binder and Mark Spindel: "Powell will confront at least four speed bumps.1.This could be the most polarizing vote ever to confirm a Fed chair... 2.How will Powell forge consensus at the Fed?...3.Will the new Fed unravel Dodd-Franks regulatory policies?...4.Will a Republican Congress ease up on a Republican-led Fed?"Bloomberg reports Senate Republicans aim to confirm Powell by the end of the year: Senates goal is to confirm Jerome Powell as Federal Reserve chair by end of year, Senate Banking Cmte Chair Crapo says, per @kevcirilli.Jennifer Jacobs (@JenniferJJacobs) November 2, 2017 Reuters's Pete Schroeder reports Sen.

Goldman Sachs chief executive tells Bloomberg that he "cant say this is the moment where you want the most fiscal stimulus in the market, when were mostly at full employment, when GDP last registered

set to join the president on his trip to Asia as part of a business delegation.Here's a roster of who else is going.)And economists are divided.The New York Times's Patricia Cohen: "Economists are still parsing the details, but even some ardent supporters of the plan say expectations about heady growth and job gains are exaggerated.Interest rates are already at bargain-basement levels, plenty of potential investment capital is sloshing around, and the official jobless rate is at lows not seen in many years.Moreover, the cost of the tax package will inevitably deepen the deficit and lead to spending cuts that are likely to hit low- and middle-income workers."The hidden 46 percent bracket.Politico's Danny Vinik: "House Republicans claim the tax plan they introduced Thursday keeps the top individual rate unchanged at 39.6 percentthe level at which its been capped for much of the past quarter-century.But a little-noticed provision effectively creates a new band in which income is taxed at over 45 percent.Thanks to a quirky proposed surcharge, Americans who earn more than $1 million in taxable income would trigger an extra 6 percent tax on the next $200,000 they earna complicated change that effectively creates a new, unannounced tax bracket of 45.6 percent.It hasnt been advertised by Republicans, who have described their plan as maintaining the current top tax rate of 39.6 percent.And it goes against decades of GOP orthodoxy that raising taxes on the rich discourages work and reduces economic growth."Estate tax gone, after 6 years.CNBC: "Under the new proposal, coined the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the estate tax exemption will double and then be repealed as of 2024.In addition, there would continue to be a "step-up in basis," which means if you inherit shares of stock, for example, and turn around and sell those shares, you wouldn't pay any capital gains taxes either.Because of the sky-high threshold, only the wealthiest Americans now pay the federal levy.The Tax Policy Center estimated there were about 11,310 estate returns filed and about half of those were taxable for 2017.Still, the amount of tax collected on those returns was just under $20 billion, the Tax Policy Center said."Housing market shakeup?The New York Times's Conor Dougherty: "The Republican tax plan unveiled on Thursday takes aim at the most sacred of cows: the provision that subsidizes homeownership by allowing the deduction of interest on mortgage debt...If the idea holds and history suggests that will be difficult it will echo loudly through higher-priced cities on the coasts.'The impact on the market is going to be recognizable,' said Ure R. Kretowicz, chief executive of Cornerstone Communities, a homebuilder in San Diego.'Theres going to be less incentive to build, and less incentive to buy.'For the builders, it will also squeeze the high end of the market, where the biggest profits lie.The stocks of homebuilders fell sharply on Thursday: Lennar was down 3.3 percent, KB Home dropped 3 percent and Toll Brothers plummeted 6.1 percent."Sen.

Trump pressures Justice Department to investigate Crooked Hillary:::::President Trump speaks during a Cabinet Meeting at the White House on Nov. 1.(Photo by Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) President Trump on Friday pressured the Department of Justice and specifically the FBI to investigate Hillary Clinton, ticking through a slew of issues involving the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee and her party, and urging law enforcement to do what is right and proper.Trump's advocacy for criminal probe of his political opponent marked a significant breach of the traditional boundaries within the executive branch designed to prevent investigations from being politicized.In a Thursday radio interview, Trump said the saddest thing about being president is that he is not supposed to give orders to the Justice Department or FBI.The president said he was very frustrated that he could not be involved with those agencies, and said it was very discouraging to me that they were not going after Hillary Clinton.Hopefully they are doing something and at some point, maybe we are going to all have it out, Trump said Thursday on The Larry O'Connor Show.Trump has long been annoyed, and at times angry, with Attorney General Jeff Sessions for not taking on Clinton more aggressively and for not better protecting him from the wide-ranging Russia probe led by Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller III, the president's advisers have said.As he departed the White House Friday morning for an 12-day trip to Asia, Trump told reporters: A lot of people are disappointed in the Justice Department, including me.In a series of Friday morning tweets, Trump claimed there was mounting public pressure for the Justice Department to investigate Clinton.Trump suggested law enforcement reopen its probe of the deleted emails from Clinton's private server while she was secretary of state, as well as a Russian uranium sale and the international business of Democratic super-lobbyist Tony Podesta.Here is what you need to know about the political storm sparked by Donna Brazile's allegations against the Clinton campaign.(Amber Ferguson,Melissa Macaya/The Washington Post) Trump also raised the Clinton campaign's joint fundraising agreement with the Democratic National Committee that effectively gave her control over the party's finances, strategy and staffing before the primaries began.The details were outlined in a new book by former DNC interim chair Donna Brazile.Trump tweeted: Everybody is asking why the Justice Department (and FBI) isn't looking into all of the dishonesty going on with Crooked Hillary & the Dems ...New Donna B book says she paid for and stole the Dem Primary.What about the deleted E-mails, Uranium, Podesta, the Server, plus, plus ...People are angry.At some point the Justice Department, and the FBI, must do what is right and proper.The American public deserves it!Everybody is asking why the Justice Department (and FBI) isn't looking into all of the dishonesty going on with Crooked Hillary & the Dems..

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 3, 2017 In a fourth tweet, Trump alleged that the real story on Collusion is the fundraising agreement noted in Brazile's book.The president appears to be conflating collusion with a foreign government, which is a subject of Mueller's Russia investigation, with the financial arrangement Clinton's campaign made with the DNC.The real story on Collusion is in Donna B's new book.Crooked Hillary bought the DNC & then stole the Democratic Primary from Crazy Bernie!Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 3, 2017 And in a fifth tweet on the subject, Trump invoked Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who said Thursday on CNN that she believed the Democratic primaries were rigged in Clinton's favor.Using his pejorative nickname for Warren, the president tweeted (apparently misspelling the word led): Pocahontas just stated that the Democrats, lead by the legendary Crooked Hillary Clinton, rigged the Primaries!Lets go FBI & Justice Dept.Pocahontas just stated that the Democrats, lead by the legendary Crooked Hillary Clinton, rigged the Primaries!Lets go FBI & Justice Dept.Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 3, 2017 This marks only the latest attempt by Trump to use his presidential bully pulpit to influence the criminal justice process.He has delivered off-the-cuff remarks this week recommending punishment for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect accused of killing eight people with a rental truck in New York.Trump at first said he was considering sending Saipov to the military prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, but then reversed course and advocated a civilian trial in federal court for the terrorism suspect he called an animal.[Trump speaks, but prosecutors may not listen] The Justice Department is a part of the executive branch; the attorney general is nominated by the president.So it is normal for the White House to direct the Justice Department on broad policy goals.But unlike other executive branch agencies, the Justice Department traditionally enjoys a measure of independence, especially when it comes to individual criminal investigations.Government lawyers have long sought to enforce a clear line preventing White House officials from influencing specific investigations or prosecutions to ensure such work is not politicized.The president directing a particular investigation especially of a former political rival would be viewed by most in law enforcement as inappropriate.When Trump made similar comments on the campaign trail a year ago, even former Republican attorney general Michael Mukasey, a vocal Clinton critic, said Trump ordering a prosecution of her would be like a banana republic.A Justice Department spokesman declined to comment Friday.In his Thursday radio interview, Trump said, You know, the saddest thing is, because I am the president of the United States I am not supposed to be involved with the Justice Department.I'm not supposed to be involved with the FBI.I'm not supposed to be doing the kind of things I would love to be doing and I am very frustrated by it.Trump continued by referencing a salacious research dossier detailing Trump's ties to Russia, which was initially sponsored by the conservative Washington Free Beacon and later paid for by the Clinton campaign and DNC, through the Perkins Coie law firm.The Washington Post's Adam Entous looks at the role that Hillary Clinton's campaign and the Democratic National Committee played in funding the research that led to a dossier containing allegations about President Trump's links to Russia.(Bastien Inzaurralde,Patrick Martin/The Washington Post) Trump added on the radio show: I look at what's happening with the Justice Department, why aren't they going after Hillary Clinton with her emails and with her dossier, and the kind of money ...I don't know, is it possible that they paid $12.4 million for the dossier ...which is total phony, fake, fraud and how is it used?It's very discouraging to me.I'll be honest.Trump has not provided evidence to support his $12.4 million figure, and he may have grossly exaggerated how much the dossier cost.Fusion GPS, the firm that commissioned the dossier, has said it paid former British spy Christopher Steele $168,000 for his research, according to Reuters.The Washington Post has reported that the Clinton campaign paid Perkins Coie $5.6 million in legal fees from June 2015 to December 2016, and the DNC paid the firm $3.6 million since November 2015, according to campaign finance records.But the filings do not detail how that money was spent, so it is impossible to tell how much work was related to the dossier research and how much was for legal services.[Clinton campaign, DNC paid for research that led to Russia dossier] Devlin Barrett and Matt Zapotosky contributed to this report.
Conservative Republicans demand Mueller recuse himself over uranium deal:::::House Republicans have announced a probe into a deal involving U.S. uranium reached under the Obama administration in 2010.Heres what you need to know.(Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post) House Republicans have announced a probe into a deal involving U.S. uranium reached under the Obama administration in 2010.Heres what you need to know.(Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post) Three conservative House Republicans are expected to file a resolution Friday calling on special counsel Robert S. Mueller III to recuse himself from his probe of Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, accusing him of conflicts of interest.Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), who wrote the resolution, accuses Mueller of having a conflict of interest because he was serving as FBI chief when the Obama administration approved a deal allowing a Russian company to purchase a Canada-based mining group with uranium operations in the United States, according to a draft obtained by The Washington Post.President Trump has often brought up the Uranium One deal in 2010 as a way to accuse Hillary Clinton of potential corruption and foreign collusion, despite scant evidence she was directly involved in the decision to allow it to proceed.Nine government agencies make up the government committee that reviews such deals, along with five other observer agencies; the FBI is not one of them.The GOP also launched two congressional probes into the matter last month, questioning whether the FBI and Justice Department were looking into Russias attempts to influence the U.S. uranium market.Gaetz wants the deal to be investigated by a special counsel, and he does not think Mueller is the one to do it.Former FBI Director Robert Mueller at the agency headquarters in 2013.(Charles Dharapak/AP) [What you need to know about the Uranium One deal] Someone who was involved in a deal cannot reasonably be trusted to scrutinize that probe, Gaetz said in an interview.Gaetz added that he does not trust Mueller because of his close personal relationship with former FBI director James B. Comey.Similar complaints have been raised by other Republicans, though there is considerable dispute over whether the Comey-Mueller relationship was primarily professional.Republicans, including Gaetz, have also called on the Justice Department to better investigate Comeys conduct in the FBI investigation into Clintons emails, a matter several congressional committees are also probing.As of late Thursday, Reps. Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.) and Louis Gohmert (R-Tex.), both members of the Houses conservative Freedom Caucus, had signed onto Gaetzs effort.A spokeswoman for Gaetz said they expect to pick up more support from the Freedom Caucus, the bulk of whose members signed onto an earlier Gaetz bill calling on the attorney general to appoint a special counsel to look into Comeys actions.But Gaetz may struggle to build wider support.He admitted Thursday that he does not expect any Democrats to support his Mueller resolution.And many Republicans who have questions about Clintons role in the 2010 uranium deal still support Muellers right to do his job free from political interference.There have been no reports that Mueller is including the uranium deal in his investigation.Earlier this week, Mueller announced the first charges of his probe against three members of the Trump campaign: former campaign manager Paul Manafort, his business partner Rick Gates, and campaign foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos.Gaetz said he spoke to Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Sept. 28 and asked him to appoint another special counsel to look into the uranium deal, but that Sessions claimed his own recusal from all matters related to the 2016 campaign prevented him from weighing in on the matter.Staffers for deputy attorney general Rod J. Rosenstein, Gaetz added, would not commit to making a decision on his request.Read more at PowerPost
The Daily 202: Republican committee chairmen are retiring in droves, despite unified control of Congress:::::House Speaker Paul Ryan meets with his leadership team at the Capitol yesterday morning before Republicans unveiled a plan to rewrite the tax code.(Melina Mara/The Washington Post) With Breanne Deppisch and Joanie Greve THE BIG IDEA: Two powerful Republican committee chairmen from Texas announced this week that they will not seek reelection.Lamar Smith, who heads the House Science, Space and Technology Committee, said yesterday that he wont stand for a 17th term.Jeb Hensarling, chairman of the Financial Services Committee, said Tuesday that he wont run for a ninth.Both said they were primarily driven to step down because of term limits put in place by Newt Gingrich in 1994.Chairmen can only lead a committee for six years before they must step aside for someone new, although waivers are sometimes given out to let them stay on longer.Once you lose a gavel, its hard to go back to being a back bencher, said former congressman Tom Davis (R-Va.), who retired in 2008 at the end of his third term as chairman of the House oversight committee.The upside of term limits for committee chairmen is you dont get somebody super entrenched.The bad news is you lose good people.Hensarling is going to make a lot of money in the private sector and it behooves him to get out while hes on top, a Republican operative involved in House races emailed last night, expressing confidence that the GOP will hold both seats.-- Something bigger than term limits is afoot, though.Even though they have unified control of all three branches of the federal government, a lot of Republican lawmakers are just not having that much fun in this unproductive Congress.Based on several deep background conversations, heres how a bunch of incumbents who have either retired or are contemplating it see things: You spend most of your time hitting up rich people and lobbyists for money but have little to show for it.Many colleagues in your own party seem unserious about governing.President Trump publicly blames you for his own ineffectiveness.Youre getting attacked from the Steve Bannon wing of the party.The very real prospect of losing the majority next November makes sticking around even less desirable.Unlike in the Senate, where all 100 members can wield immense power, being a backbencher in the minority party of a majoritarian institution like the House is depressing and joyless.You get to wear a members pin and get invited to some cool parties.But unless youre Nancy Pelosi, youre functionally irrelevant.Rep. Pat Tiberi (R-Ohio) emerges from the House chamber after a vote last week.(J. Scott Applewhite/AP) -- Slots on the House Ways and Means Committee, which writes the tax code, are highly coveted.Yet the chairmen of the key subcommittees keep throwing in the towel.Rep.

Charlie Dent (R-Pa.) talks to reporters during the health-care debate this summer.He played a leading role.(Oliver Contreras for The Washington Post) -- Rep. Charlie Dent (R-Pa.), who announced his retirement in September, is a powerful cardinal, which in congressional parlance means that he chairs an appropriations subcommittee.That gives him control of tens of billions in annual spending related to veterans affairs and military construction.He was formerly chairman of the Ethics committee.He expects more mainstream Republicans to also retire in the coming months, driven away by the constant chaos that emanates from the White House.As co-chairman of the moderate Tuesday Group, which has about 50 center-right members, he has also grown weary and exhausted from ideological battles with the hard-right Freedom Caucus.-- Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) started this trend when he resigned in June, giving up his chairmanship of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee so that he could become a paid talking head on Fox News.If Clinton had won, he would have been able to stay in the media spotlight by investigating her full time.But he showed little inclination for conducting serious oversight of the Trump administration.-- Over in the Senate, Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker announced in September that he would not seek a third term after it became clear that he would face a well-funded primary challenge from his right.Theres rampant speculation that Senate Finance Chairman Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) will also ride into the sunset.The Atlantic reported last Friday that Hatch has privately told allies in Utah that he is planning to retire at the end of his term next year, and if he does, Mitt Romney intends to run for his seat.McKay Coppins, reporting from Utah, cited five unnamed sources familiar with the situation.A Hatch spokesman insists that the senator has not made a final decision about whether to seek reelection, but plans to by the end of the year.Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) is giving up three subcommittee gavels by ending his reelection campaign: He is the chairman of the judiciary subcommittee responsible for technology and privacy (which is so important right now in the wake of Russias information warfare against us), the energy and natural resources subcommittee with jurisdiction over water and power (critical for a desert state like Arizona) and the foreign relations subcommittee that oversees Africa (the continent holds a special place in Flakes heart because he went there as a Mormon missionary.)Rep. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) speaks to conservative activists at a "Freedom Summit."(Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg News) -- Most members of the House dream of winning statewide office.This year, that up-or-out calculus has driven several committee and subcommittee chairs to move on before their terms expire: Rep.

Lamar Smith (R-Tex.)in January.(Zach Gibson/AP) -- Smith, a Yale-educated lawyer who has been in Congress since 1987, represents a district that includes affluent suburbs of San Antonio and Austin, as well as a swath of Hill Country.He became chairman of the science committee in 2013 after getting termed out as chairman of the Judiciary Committee.Denying climate change and using his subpoena power to cause headaches for scientists in the Obama administration earned him boogeyman status on the left and made him a darling of the oil industry.It is humbling living in a small apartment in Washington four nights a week.And I seldom leave the office before late at night, the 69-year-old said in an email to friends last night.For several reasons, this seems like a good time to [step aside].At the end of this Congress, I will have completed my six-year term as Chairman I have one new grandchild and a second arriving soon!!And I hope to find other ways to stay involved in politics.National Republican Congressional Committee Chairman Steve Stivers called Smith a leading policy mind in our conference while expressing certitude that the GOP will hold the seat.Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee spokesman Meredith Kelly said the GOP chairmen are dropping like flies because its nothing short of miserable to be part of Speaker Paul Ryans establishment Congress.These retiring Republicans have seen the writing on the wall, and theyre not waiting around for the midterms, she said.Trump won Smiths district by 10 points and Hensarlings by 28 points.Retirements like Reicherts worry GOP campaign strategists much more.But Republicans are enthusiastic that they got a top recruit in Washington State.Dino Rossi, a former GOP nominee for governor and Senate, raised $1 million in his first three weeks as a candidate.-- Either way, the House will continue to change with the departure of these seasoned veterans.Hensarling was someone who received buzz as a possible contender to become House speaker after Paul Ryan.He was NRCC finance chairman during the 2010 wave and led the House Republican Conference before taking over on Financial Services.Ryan lobbied Hensarling to stick around for another term, dangling the possibility that he could become chairman of the Budget Committee, the Washington Examiner reports.If Ryan serves two more years I think he would like to have Jeb around, a Republican lobbyist told David Drucker Monday just before news of Hensarling's retirement broke.-- Two guys to keep an eye on: Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) is in his third term as chairman of the Judiciary Committee, so theres some buzz that he might retire.Rep. Fred Upton (R-Mich.) decided to stay in Congress after finishing his three terms as chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee last year, but its not clear that hes happy as a rank-and-file backbencher.That might prompt him to run against Sen.

overhaul the tax system, which relies on reducing or eliminating popular breaks to pay for $1 trillion in corporate cuts and $500 billion in cuts for families and individuals over the next 10 years.Damian Paletta and Mike DeBonis have specifics on the bill: It would slash the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent, the most significant in a series of benefits the bill contains for businesses.the most significant in a series of benefits the bill contains for businesses.It would mean $300 billion in tax cuts for households and families, as well as $200 billion in tax cuts almost all of which will benefit the wealthiest families by repealing the estate tax[.]The bill would nearly double the standard deduction that many Americans claim on their taxes, raising it from $12,700 to $24,000 per family.raising it from $12,700 to $24,000 per family.The highest income-tax rate of 39.6 percent would only apply to families who make more than $1 million.Americans will only be able to deduct $500,000 worth of loans on new mortgages, rather than the current cap of $1 million.rather than the current cap of $1 million.The bill would allow people to deduct their local property taxes from their taxable income, but only up to the first $10,000.The bill would also increase the child tax credit from $1,000 per child to $1,600.That credit would phase out once a family earns more than $230,000 a year, more than double the current $110,000 threshold.-- So, does it help the middle class?The trade-off between reducing tax rates but curtailing deductions such as the amount that homeowners can write off for their mortgage interest payments means the impact will vary widely from one family to another, Damian and Mike write.-- One preliminary analysis found that the bill could result in tax increases for almost 13 million Americans making less than $100,000.(The New York Times) -- But the wealthy and corporations make out the best in the proposal, which poses distinct problems for its prospects.Heather Long writes: Many of the ideas in the Republican tax proposal unveiled Thursday have found bipartisan support in the past and endorsements from economists who see a way to improve the U.S. economy.That includes plans to make the corporate rate more competitive, simplify personal taxes, curb several tax breaks of dubious value and provide more assistance to working families.The controversy is over who will gain the most[.][C]ritics say the GOP could have chosen to overhaul the tax code in a way that concentrated benefits on middle- and working-class Americans and chose not to.WILL IT PASS?-- The uneven effects of the legislation and the possibility that some middle-class Americans could see their tax bills increase promise to complicate the Republican effort to unify behind the bill, Damian and Mike write.But for Republicans, the tax push represents possibly their last opportunity to pass a major piece of legislation before campaign season begins for next Novembers elections, when their majorities in the House and Senate will be challenged.-- New polling (taken before the bill was released) shows that Americans are skeptical of the GOPs plan and critical of Trumps approach to overhaul the tax code so far.Scott Clement and Emily Guskin report: One-third of Americans support Trump's tax plan ...while 50 percent oppose it, a 17-point negative margin driven by overwhelming opposition from Democrats and skepticism among political independents and people with lower incomes.Six in 10 say Trump's proposals on cutting taxes favor the rich, a perception that has dogged Republican efforts in pursuing tax reform for months.-- A pro-Trump group plans to spend $1 million on ads supporting the plan, and the ads will feature former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski.Bloombergs John McCormick reports: The television and online campaign is the biggest yet financed by the White House-sanctioned America First Policies political organization.The spending is an initial down payment on what the group says will be a multi-million dollar effort it hopes will help the president and Republicans score their first major legislative win.THE OPPOSITION: -- Some normally GOP-allied business groups are already rallying against the bill, an ominous sign for it.Steven Mufson reports: Many companies, especially in the real estate industry, would suffer from the proposed elimination of tax breaks, loopholes and incentives.A broad business coalition known as BUILD condemned the elimination of interest deductions for businesses, while the real estate industry bemoaned the curtailment of the deductibility of large mortgages.And the National Federal of Independent Business opposed the package in its current form, declaring that the bill leaves too many small businesses behind.-- The Senates top Democrat argued there would be substantial public backlash.The more people find out about it, the less theyll like, Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) told The Post.This bill is like a dead fish.The more its in sunlight, the more it stinks, and thats whats going to happen.Schumers comments came hours after Nancy Pelosi called the bill a Ponzi scheme that corporate America will perpetrate on the American people.(Mike DeBonis and Damian Paletta) -- A few House Republicans also declared their opposition, complaining about the effect the elimination of state and local taxes will have in high-tax states.(Carolyn Y. Johnson, Reuben Fischer-Baum and Aaron Williams) -- Even if the House passes, the Senate is an uphill battle (and the upper chamber is crafting its own version anyway).Politicos Seung Min Kim reports: Fiscal hawks are squawking about how tax legislation could balloon the deficit.Moderates like Sen. Susan Collins of Maine are worried tax cuts will disproportionately favor the rich.Even an Obamacare-related row could bubble up and trip up passage.While a small handful of Democrats might get on board, its more likely Republicans will have to go it alone meaning they can lose just two GOP votes before their tax bill tanks.-- HOW ITS PLAYING: Blue states that went for Hillary Clinton in 2016 could bear the brunt the costs in the plan, Carolyn Y. Johnson, Reuben Fischer-Baum and Aaron Williams report.Carolyn Y. Johnson, Reuben Fischer-Baum and Aaron Williams report.Home-builder stocks sunk after the release of the bill.(Aaron Gregg) (Aaron Gregg) Middle-class residents of the D.C. region will be among those hardest hit by the new mortgage interest deduction cap, given the areas high housing costs.(Kathy Orton) (Kathy Orton) Parents could use tax-free savings accounts for college tuition to put money away for private elementary school.Moriah Balingit reports: The proposal would further a key piece of the agenda of Education Secretary Betsy DeVos , who seeks to expand school choice and to allow public dollars to follow children to private schools.But even some school choice proponents assailed the plan, saying it offered no benefits for poor families who have little choice in where they send their children to school.Moriah Balingit reports: , who seeks to expand school choice and to allow public dollars to follow children to private schools.But even some school choice proponents assailed the plan, saying it offered no benefits for poor families who have little choice in where they send their children to school.Teachers spend nearly $1,000 a year on supplies.Under the GOP tax bill, they will no longer get a tax deduction, from Moriah Balingit.Jeff Sessions gestures as he testifies before a Senate Judiciary oversight hearing.(Joshua Roberts/Reuters) THERE'S A BEAR IN THE WOODS: -- Jeff Sessions is under renewed scrutiny on Capitol Hill after it was revealed that he attended the March 31 meeting at which George Papadopoulos offered to broker a meeting between Vladimir Putin and Trump.Karoun Demirjian, Sari Horwitz and Adam Entous report: Sessions had not previously disclosed the meeting, despite being asked over multiple appearances on Capitol Hill whether he or anyone on the campaign ever discussed meeting with Russians.This is another example in an alarming pattern in which you, the nations top law enforcement officer, apparently failed to tell the truth, under oath, about the Trump teams contacts with agents of Russia, [Sen. Al Franken] wrote Thursday in a letter to Sessions.Last month, Sessions told the same committee he was not aware of any Trump surrogates having contacts with Russian officials.Democrats on the committee, including Franken, are now arguing that statement may have been false, too.The attorney general needs to explain to our committee what are the obvious implications of his presence at that meeting , and how he can square that with his testimony to our committee, said Sen. Christopher A. Coons (D-Del.), a member of the Judiciary Committee., and how he can square that with his testimony to our committee, said Sen. Christopher A. Coons (D-Del.), a member of the Judiciary Committee.I think there are many more questions for Jeff Sessions, said Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.).He should be honest and disclose all truths, especially when he is under oath or testifying before the United States Congress.-- Trumps former foreign policy adviser Carter Page told lawmakers he informed Sessions of his own travels to Russia during the campaign.CNNs Manu Raju and Jeremy Herb report: During more than six hours of closed-door testimony [to the House Intelligence Committee], Page said that he informed Sessions about his coming July 2016 trip to Russia, which Page told CNN was unconnected to his campaign role.Sessions' discussion with Page will fuel further scrutiny about what the attorney general knew about connections between the Trump campaign and Russia[.]-- Court records unsealed this week revealed Trump was also present at the March 31 meeting and the New York Times now reports the present appears to have been present when Papadopoulos boasted about his Putin connections.The New York Times's Michael S. Schmidt, Matt Apuzzo, and Scott Shane report: '[Papadopoulos] went into the pitch right away, said J. D. Gordon, a campaign adviser who attended the meeting.He said he had a friend in London, the Russian ambassador, who could help set up a meeting with Putin.Mr. Trump listened with interest.Mr.Sessions vehemently opposed the idea, Mr. Gordon recalled.And he said that no one should talk about it because it might leak, he said.Several of Mr. Trumps campaign advisers attended the March 2016 meeting, and at least two of those advisers are now in the White House: Hope Hicks, the communications director, and Stephen Miller, a senior policy adviser.Hicks, for her part, is slated to be interviewed by Muellers team this month.Sam Clovis and President Trump.(Charlie Neibergall/AP) -- Clovis, out: The former Trump campaign co-chairman withdrew his nomination as the USDAs chief scientist after it was revealed that he encouraged efforts by Papadopoulos to broker a meeting between the Trump campaign and Putin.Juliet Eilperin and Philip Rucker report: In a letter to the president Wednesday, Clovis explained that he did not think he could get a fair consideration from the Senate[.]...The political climate inside Washington has made it impossible for me to receive balanced and fair consideration for this position, wrote Clovis, who currently serves as USDAs senior White House adviser.The relentless assaults on you and your team seem to be a blood sport that only increases with intensity each day.However, Clovis indicated in his letter that he will stay on at the Agriculture Department in a senior role, writing, that he will continue to serve at the pleasure of you and the Secretary of Agriculture.A USDA official confirmed that Clovis would remain at the department in his current job, but did not offer any further details.Clovis was already a controversial pick because, as Juliet and Phil note, he has no experience in the hard sciences and had made controversial comments in the past on climate change and gay rights.While providing information to the Senate for his confirmation, Clovis was asked, Please list all graduate level courses you have taken in natural science.None, he replied.-- Jared Kushner has turned over documents to Muellers team in recent weeks, as investigators have begun asking about his role in the firing of then-FBI Director James Comey.CNNs Evan Perez, Pamela Brown and Shimon Prokupecz report: It is not clear how Kushner's advice to the President might relate to the overall Russia investigation or potential obstruction of justice.Two separate sources [said] investigators have asked other witnesses about Kushner's role in firing Comey.Investigators have also asked about how a statement was issued in the name of Donald Trump Jr. regarding a Trump Tower meeting and about the circumstances surrounding the departures of other White House aides Those in Trumps orbit dispute how much influence Kushner had in Comeys ousting: While Kushner and those close to the White House will only say he was in favor of the decision or, in the words of one attorney, did not oppose it there are multiple sources who say that Kushner was a driver of the decision and expected it would be a political boon for the President.Robert Mueller departs a meeting with members of the Senate Judiciary Committee.(Saul Loeb/Getty Images) -- THE BIGGER PICTURE?Trump has a Mueller problem, Molly Ball writes in Time Magazine.And its definitely not going away soon.Muellers opening gambit struck at two of Trumps most sensitive spots.The indictments of [Paul] Manafort and [Rick] Gates, for crimes like tax evasion and fraud suggest that Mueller is following the money, digging up old financial records potentially the tax returns that Trump has sought to shield.And [George] Papadopoulos alleged work with Russia inflames Trumps fear of having his election win delegitimized.Worst of all for the President, the filings paint a broad and damning picture of where the probe may be heading a process over which Trump has no control.Now weve seen the iceberg, says a Republican operative.The question is whats below the water line.-- Twice as many Americans approve than disapprove of Muellers Russia investigation, a fresh Washington Post-ABC News poll found indicating that efforts to discredit the special counsel's probe as a witch hunt have failed, so far.A 58 percent majority say they approve of Mueller's probe, while just 28 percent said they disapprove.Meanwhile, nearly half of voters or 49 percent believe the president committed a crime.Some other key findings: Fewer than 4 in 10 Americans believe Trump is cooperating with the probe.Half believe he is not.And among the public overall, 19 percent think there is solid evidence Trump committed a crime.(30 percent say that is merely their suspicion.)believe Trump is cooperating

Inside Story of the Break-ins and Breakdowns That Put Donald Trump in the White House in Politico Magazine, suggesting the party rigged the Democratic primary for Hillary Clinton.In the excerpt, Brazile details a complex financial relationship between the DNC and Clintons campaign beginning months before Clinton sealed the nomination.Brazile writes: [Gary Gensler, the chief financial officer of Clintons campaign] described the party as fully under the control of Hillarys campaign, which seemed to confirm the suspicions of the Bernie [Sanders] camp.The campaign had the DNC on life support, giving it money every month to meet its basic expenses, while the campaign was using the party as a fund-raising clearinghouse.The funding arrangement with [Hillary For America] and the victory fund agreement was not illegal, but it sure looked unethical.If the fight had been fair, one campaign would not have control of the party before the voters had decided which one they wanted to lead.This was not a criminal act, but as I saw it, it compromised the partys integrity.-- The revelations caused outrage among many in the Democratic Party.Michael Scherer, David Weigel and Karen Tumulty report: Throughout the campaign, the DNC and its then-chairwoman, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, fiercely denied any suggestion that the party was helping Clinton over other candidates.Some Democrats now say the arrangement is evidence that the concerns were valid.The current leadership of the party said it would address the problem.One of my goals here, as DNC chair, is to make sure that the nominating process for 2020 is a process thats fair and transparent for everybody, DNC Chairman Tom Perez said in an interview with CNBC.Were going to set the primary debate schedule well in advance of when we know which candidates will be there.-- In an interview with CNN, possible 2020 contender Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.)said she agreed the primary was rigged in Clintons favor.(Aaron Blake) -- Meanwhile, the DNC dismissed its finance director after just five months on the job.The decision comes amid slow fundraising problems that continue to plague the party in wake of the 2016 election with Democrats raising less than half of the RNCs total haul since January.(Politico) -- Trump called on the Justice Department to investigate the DNC over Brazile's accusations: Donna Brazile just stated the DNC RIGGED the system to illegally steal the Primary from Bernie Sanders.Bought and paid for by Crooked H....

Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 3, 2017 Iranian President Hassan Rouhani enters a hall for talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin.(Sergei Karpukhin/AP) THE NEW WORLD ORDER: -- Hours after Trump wrapped a September U.N. speech slamming Iran as a murderous regime, Rex Tillerson asked France if it could help broker a conversation between Trump and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani.Irans response was an unequivocal no.Karen DeYoung reports: In declining Trumps offer, the French said the Iranians 'dont believe youre serious' and 'thought it was some kind of trick.'In his own U.N. speech the next day, Rouhani denounced the ignorant rhetoric of rogue newcomers to the world of politics, although he did not mention Trump by name.Before Tillersons request, Trump already had broached the general idea of using France as a go-between during a bilateral meeting with the French president the night before his U.N. speech You guys have good relations with Iran, Trump told [Emmanuel] Macron[.]Could you use your relations to ask if Tehran is willing, should the Americans want to talk?the official said Trump asked.Macron said sure Asked why Trump wanted to meet with Rouhani, the official said it was in order to say, Heres all the mean stuff you do in the world, and we want you to stop.If not, you should know were working on a strategy to get you to confront all of this.The primary message, the official said, was that the golden Obama-era window of rapprochement is over.-- National security adviser H.R.McMaster said Trump will not moderate his language during his five-country, 12-day trip to Asia that begins today.CNN's Dan Merica, Jeremy Diamond and Elise Labott report: "The President will use whatever language he wants to use, obviously, McMaster said.I don't think the President really modulates his language.I mean, have you noticed him do that?He has been very clear about that.McMaster also told reporters that Trump is considering putting North Korea back on the list of state sponsors of terrorism, a designation the country lost under President George W. Bush in 2008.That is an option that is under consideration, He added that reporters will hear more about that soon.The officials said the decision would likely be made after Trump's trip to Asia.-- Ahead of Trumps visit, two U.S. bombers conducted drills over South Korea.Reuterss Soyoung Kim and Phil Stewart report: News of the Thursday's drills was first reported by North Korean state news agency KCNA on Friday, which said the exercises involving South Korean and Japanese fighter jets were a surprise nuclear strike drill.The reality clearly shows that the gangster-like U.S. imperialists are the very one who is aggravating the situation of the Korean peninsula and seeking to ignite a nuclear war, KCNA said.-- Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein is joining Trump on his trip to China.Goldman Sachs officials confirmed his trip on Thursday, saying Blankfein plans to accompany Trump there next week as part of a two-day business delegation.He has previously called the relationship between China and the United States the most important in the world.(CNNMoney) -- Ivanka Trump spoke to a half-empty room at Tokyos World Assembly for Women this morning.The New York Timess Motoko Rich reports: The lukewarm turnout on Friday morning contrasted with the breathless coverage of her visit by the Japanese news media[.]...It was unclear why so few people attended Ms. Trumps speech, although a public holiday on Friday may have been to blame.Perhaps another hint could be found in the Japanese publics view of Mr. Trump: According to a survey last month by the Pew Research Center, less than a quarter of the population is confident that Mr. Trump will do the right thing in world affairs, down 54 percentage points from the confidence expressed for [Obama] last year.-- Cubas foreign minister called reports of severe health problems among U.S. diplomats in Havana deliberate lies meant to unravel building diplomacy.Karen DeYoung reports: It is high time for the United States to tell the truth or otherwise present evidence, [Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno] Rodrguez said at a news conference in Washington.The Cuban government has no responsibility whatsoever for these incidents, he said.His comments marked a sharp change in Cubas approach to the charges.Immediately after a September meeting in Washington with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Rodrguez pledged Cubas ongoing cooperation in finding the cause of the mysterious diplomatic ailments and expressed hope that the issue would not undermine relations.-- The Gulf blockade of Qatar could push the country closer to Iran, the Cipher Briefs Fritz Lodge writes.Nearly five months on, the crisis between Qatar and a coalition of nine countries led by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates has reached a relatively stable equilibrium.The countries resultant blockade of Qatar over its alleged support for terrorist groups and ties to Iran has not significantly changed Dohas behavior according to Qatars detractors, but rather has pushed it closer to Tehran.Billionaire Robert Mercer speaks on the phone during the 12th International Conference on Climate Change.(Oliver Contreras/The Washington Post) PERSONNEL IS POLICY: -- GOP megadonor and Trump backer Robert Mercer is stepping down from his hedge fund and selling his stake in Breitbart News.Renae Merle reports: In a letter to investors reviewed by The Washington Post, Mercer noted he has come under intense scrutiny for his financing of Breitbart, his relationship with former White House strategist Stephen K. Bannon and his backing of conservative provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos.In his letter, Mercer said he was selling his stake in Breitbart to his daughters for personal reasons and sought to distance himself from Bannon.Mercer also said he was severing all ties with Yiannopoulos, one of Breitbarts former stars, adding that it was a mistake to have supported him.Earlier this month, BuzzFeed unearthed a video of Yiannopoulos singing America the Beautiful at a karaoke bar while some in the crowd raised their arms in Nazi salutes.-- Trump has established a habit of installing members of his clubs in government positions, USA Todays Fredreka Schouten, Brad Heath and Steve Reilly report: A USA TODAY review finds that Trump has installed at least five people who have been members of his clubs to senior roles in his administration[.]Presidents often name campaign donors and close allies to administration posts, particularly prized diplomatic postings in cosmopolitan European capitals, such as Paris and London, and the tourist playgrounds of the West Indies.But never in modern history has a president awarded government posts to people who pay money to his own companies.-- EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt plans to travel to a luxury resort next week to speak to the American Chemistry Council.Juliet Eilperin and Brady Dennis report: Pruitt, who has traveled across the country to meet with industry groups regulated by the EPA, is scheduled to address the board during a session on Nov. 9, according to the events official schedule.The administrator plans to bring eight EPA staffers to the event.The contingent includes his chief of staff, a senior adviser on state and regional affairs, a press aide, a public engagement official, a security detail of three and an advance person.The EPA on Thursday said the government is paying for the groups expenses.Traveling to the session, held at the Sanctuary Hotel at Kiawah Island Golf Resort, is the latest example of Pruitt going outside the Beltway to meet with top corporate officials.NEXT WEEKS ELECTIONS: -- Virginia Republicans are hammering Democratic gubernatorial candidate Ralph Northam on the issue of sanctuary cities, a campaign tactic that has become a nationwide trend.David Weigel and Laura Vozzella report: Never mind that Virginia has no sanctuary cities.Or that there is no evidence that they lead to increased crime or gang activity.Republicans have seized on the issue as a way of portraying Northam as soft on crime.And Northam is not alone.In tight elections from New York to Albuquerque, Republicans are using sanctuary cities to attack Democrats as enabling Latino gang violence.Democrats, who have criticized the Trump administration for deporting undocumented immigrants with no criminal records, are struggling to explain their positions.-- The Libertarian candidate in Virginias gubernatorial race accused Northam and Gillespie of allowing the election to descend into wild-eyed accusations and divisive rhetoric.What is politics coming to, what is our society coming to, when two candidates for statewide office spend millions of dollars on ads accusing their opponent of sympathizing with violent street gangs, pedophiles, white nationalists and neo-Nazis, and of harboring supporters who want to run over our children with trucks?Cliff Hyra said at a news conference.(Laura Vozzella) -- Maryland Gov.Larry Hogan (R) will headline a rally tomorrow for Northams Republican opponent, Ed Gillespie.(Ovetta Wiggins) Wisconsin Gov.Scott Walker (R) speaks to reporters during a news conference in Madison, Wis. (Scott Bauer/AP) COMING ATTRACTIONS: -- Gov.Scott Walker (R-Wis.), who turned 50 yesterday, will kick off his bid for a third term on Sunday in Waukesha.A source familiar with the campaigns strategy previews some of the themes to expect in his announcement speech: Walker is gearing up to make the case that after bold reforms that have charted Wisconsin's come back, it's time for more reform.In other words, we need to keep moving Wisconsin forward, and his opponents want to take us back to the days before Act 10, when Madison and government were in control.Expect him to emphasize his record of cutting taxes while investing in Wisconsin's priorities.His most recent budget, for example, contributes to a cumulative $8 billion in tax cuts during his time in office by the end of 2018, while still making a record investment in K-12 education.He'll likely talk about how all of this is possible because of Act 10 and other reforms, but then make the case that there's more to be done.Bottom line: Wisconsin is an example of a state where conservative reform has worked, and he's going to make the case for more reform.MEN BEHAVING BOORISHLY: -- A former House of Cards employee has accused Kevin Spacey of sexual assault.CNNs Chloe Melas reports: Spacey made the set of Netflix's House of Cards into a toxic work environment through a pattern of sexual harassment, eight people who currently work on the show or worked on it in the past tell CNN.The former production assistant told CNN that Spacey sexually assaulted him during one of the show's early seasons.All eight people described Spacey's behavior as predatory, saying it included nonconsensual touching and crude comments and targeted production staffers who were typically young and male.-- Another man alleges that he had a sexual relationship with Spacey when he was 14 and Spacey was 24, which ended in what was described as an attempted rape.Vultures E. Alex Jung reports: He first met Spacey in 1981, when the actor was a guest teacher at a weekend acting class he took in Westchester County; he was then a 12-year-old student.Spacey was 22 and working in the New York theater scene.They met again by chance in line at Shakespeare in the Park in 1983, when the student was 14 years old; Spacey had made his Broadway debut in Henrik Ibsens Ghosts the year prior.After that meeting, he says, Spacey gave him his phone number, and the two began a sexual relationship.-- One current and four former women lawmakers alleged they were sexually harassed by other members of Congress.APs Erica Werner and Juliet Linderman report: For years, Republican Rep. Mary Bono [R-Calif.] endured the increasingly suggestive comments from a fellow lawmaker in the House.But when the congressman approached her on the House floor and told her hed been thinking about her in the shower, shed had enough.She confronted the man, who she said still serves in Congress, telling him his comments were demeaning and wrong.And he backed off.The incidents occurred years or even decades ago, usually when the women were young newcomers to Congress.They range from isolated comments at one hearing, to repeated unwanted come-ons, to lewd remarks and even groping on the House floor.-- Four women have accused Danny Masterson, star of That 70s Show of rape, but the investigation into has stalled.HuffPosts Yashar Ali reports: Masterson is a longtime member of the Church of Scientology, an organization that has a history of covering up allegations of misconduct leveled against the organization and its members.At least three of the women who have accused him of rape were also Scientologists and reported the incidents to the Church of Scientology at the time.The LAPD in late 2016 began to interview the women accusing Masterson of rape.In April 2017, police referred the case to the district attorney.-- Alec Baldwin acknowledged having bullied women in the past and encouraged industry-wide change in Hollywood.I think its important for us to try to make the workplace and beyond not only comfortable and right and fair and appropriate but as productive, as well.I think a lot of what were dealing with within this issue is hurting our business.Its making it less productive, Baldwin said while being recognized for his career achievements at the Paley Center for Media.(The Hollywood Reporter) -- Mother Joness Washington bureau chief David Corn is now under further investigation for inappropriate workplace behavior based on emails from former staffers.Politicos Michael Calderone reports: One of the emails, written in 2015 by a former staffer outlining concerns she had heard from other women in the Washington office, said Corn, now 58, made rape jokes, regularly gave [several women] unwelcome shoulder rubs and engaged in uninvited touching of their legs, arms, backs, and waists, and made inappropriate comments about womens sexuality and anatomy.The other email, from 2014, was by a former female staffer who claimed that Corn came up behind me and put his hands and arms around my body in a way that felt sexual and domineering.[T]he magazines leaders acknowledged dealing with allegations of inappropriate touching and comments around the time the emails were written, and said they believe Corn has stopped those behaviors.-- Callum Borchers writes that Fox News and NPR have pursued two radically different approaches in covering their own employees accused of sexual harassment and assault: On the air, Fox News handled [Roger] Ailes's resignation amid sexual harassment allegations last year like an honorable discharge, lauding the professional accomplishments of the longtime network chairman while scarcely mentioning the claims against him.But NPR's coverage of [Mike] Oreskes, its senior vice president for news until his resignation on Wednesday, has been unsparing.Shortly after Oreskes stepped down, host Mary Louise Kelly grilled NPR chief executive Jarl Mohn about his decision not to remove Oreskes sooner.If you knew of these multiple allegations, did it cross your mind that leaving Mike in his job might put other women, might put our colleagues, at risk?Kelly demanded to know.-- Danielle Paquette reports on how confidentiality agreements in sexual harassment cases can silence victims but can also protect their privacy: California State Sen. Connie Leyva said its time to ban such confidentiality agreements, which she said allow wrongdoers to keep their positions of power and hurt more people.Genie Harrison, an employment and sexual abuse lawyer in Los Angeles, said the reality is more complicated.Confidentiality agreements can lead to larger monetary awards for victims, who often seek time off from work and expensive therapy to heal, she said.I don't like the idea of forcing it upon the plaintiff that he or she cant have confidentiality provisions, said Harrison[.]Some of her clients want to make sure no one finds out about the harassment they endured, she added.SOCIAL MEDIA SPEED READ: Trump repeated his criticism of James Comey's leadership of the FBI: The @TuckerCarlson opening statement about our once cherished and great FBI was so sad to watch.James Comey's leadership was a disaster!Donald J.

When members of Congress announce their retirement, this is how they change:::::Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) speaks to reporters after announcing in October that he will not run for reelection.(Reuters) Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) and Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) recently denounced President Trumps behavior and announced that they will not seek reelection in 2018.Many wonder whether severing their ties to voters will free the senators to vote more often against Trump.Dont hold your breath.Voting counter to the interests of voters back home is known as vote shirking and its rare.But retiring lawmakers are likely to change their behavior in other ways, including shifts in how they couch their words when they speak publicly on the big issues of the day.Two ways for retiring lawmakers to shirk their ties to voters Many expect that lawmakers who are not running for reelection will vote more freely.Why represent your districts views if you no longer have to face the voters?But studies find very little evidence of this.Ideological ties between lawmakers and voters remain strong.Thats because legislators ideological stances tend to be stable.Retirement does lead to some changes in voting behavior.Most notably, lawmakers tend to miss a lot more votes during their last term in office once voters can no longer sanction them for being missing in action.But lawmakers also shirk by changing the way they speak once they decide to retire.Call it cognitive shirking.This makes sense when you consider how our thinking which changes in response to new situations determines our language.Humans have the ability to look at the same problem in a number of ways.Which viewpoints we acknowledge will naturally change as our lives change.Heres how I studied cognitive shirking or speaking out more freely I collected remarks from the Congressional Record made by representatives on the House floor between 1997 and 2007.Using content analysis, I then compared language used by members before and after announcing retirement during those years.In all, the data included 103 representatives who chose retirement during that decade, 56 percent of whom were from the Republican Party.[Republicans are the party of ideological inconsistency] I looked for patterns in language related to psychological indicators that measure the presence of greater complexity in thinking about an issue.For example, inclusive language like, we are not so different, you and I was marked as displaying greater complexity of thought since it shows an attempt to see and accept several viewpoints on an issue.In contrast, the language of certainty like you lost because you are weak was marked as displaying lesser complexity.Such statements suggest that a speaker is relying on clear-cut rules when thinking and speaking instead of accepting differences of opinion.My hypothesis was that members of Congress who were shirking shedding their sense of responsibility that they must represent their districts points of view at all times would be more likely to think and speak with more complexity.The idea was that if you remove partisan responsibilities and the fear of electoral backlash for saying the wrong thing, they would feel freer to move beyond strict black and white ways of thinking.[This is why the congressional budget process is broken] Retiring lawmakers change their speaking habits in these three ways So what changes did I find after lawmakers announce their retirements?One notable consideration is that these findings were consistent across partisan and geographic divides.The only significant factor that appeared to affect retiring members way of thinking was their own ideology.Interestingly, more extreme ideologues appeared to embrace more complex ways of thinking when exiting office, which inevitably links to a few key conclusions.First, retiring members appear to feel more comfortable voicing their true and more complex opinions on political issues.Retiring representatives seem to develop new perspectives on salient issues.Second, legislators tend to express appreciation for bipartisanship when deciding to retire.In retirement announcements on the floor, these lawmakers sometimes lament Congresss partisan polarization.That was true for Flake in his announcement, even though his votes place him on the far-right flank of the Senate.But that is not uncommon.Notably, when Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) retired in 2012, she bemoaned what she characterized as the Senates lack of bipartisanship.And after leaving office in 2015, former speaker of the House John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) gleefully released his mute button, as a New York Times headline put it, to condemn what he called rampant factionalism in the Republican Party for instance, calling Texas Sen. Ted Cruz Lucifer in the flesh.Boehner was recently in the news again, and again spoke nonchalantly about his disdain for his former colleagues overtly partisan behavior.Relinquishing institutional responsibilities may be especially cathartic for former party leaders.[Watch out, Republicans.Tax reform could be just as hard as health care.]Anecdotally, this helps explain why Corker and Flake were willing to publicly rebuke Republican Party leaders, including Trump, something that other Republicans tend to avoid.Third, as you can see in the figure below, such language tends to ebb and stabilize over the course of a lawmakers last term.Retiring representatives shirk most in the first few months after choosing to retire during their first taste of freedom.They then slowly return to stable patterns of thinking and speaking as they approach their terms end.After announcing retirement, members of Congress speak differently.But they dont return to the same ways of speaking they used before.Rather, this final period is full of nostalgic public statements and testimonials to supporters.For example, during Snowes last few months in office she spoke warmly of the small businesses that supported her throughout her Senate career.This final speaking style emphasizes, for one last time before finally leaving office, legislators bond with their constituents.Those hoping to see voting mavericks when lawmakers declare theyre ready to retire, in other words, will be disappointed.But you may get to hear what theyve really been thinking but kept hidden behind their institutional responsibilities.Michael K.

At courthouse overseeing Trump-Russia probe, DOJs Rosenstein extols rule of law:::::U.S. Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein on Wednesday cautioned current and former federal judges and prosecutors in Washington against allowing political passions to shape overzealous prosecutions.The comments came in a speech extolling the rule of law as Rosenstein, who holds the No.2 position in the Justice Department, spoke at the federal courthouse overseeing special counsel Robert S. Mueller IIIs grand jury probe into whether President Trumps campaign coordinated with Russia to influence the 2016 election.The appearance by Rosenstein, who appointed Mueller in May and has authority over the investigation, was planned months ago.He gave a substantially similar speech six weeks ago at the conservative Heritage Foundation.But his timing, two days after the investigations first criminal charges were unsealed, and his audience lawyers and the judges predominantly appointed by Democratic presidents, including those handling cases brought by Muellers prosecutors lent a political subtext, whether intended or not.Rosenstein took questions, but the audience was told not to ask about the Russia investigation because he could not discuss it.Rosenstein said one of his most important duties was to safeguard the integrity of the Department of Justice and to uphold the rule of law, and noted the presidents constitutional responsibility to take care that the laws be faithfully executed.He reminded the public of its responsibility to uphold democratic institutions, recalling Benjamin Franklins purported answer to a woman who asked what kind of government the Continental Congress had chosen: A republic if you can keep it.But he mostly emphasized prosecutors duty not to rush to judgment, citing former Franklin D. Roosevelt attorney general and Supreme Court justice Robert Jacksons admonition that although violations of the law abound, prosecutors ought to charge only those in which the offense is the most flagrant, the public harm the greatest, and the proof the most certain.Repeating Abraham Lincolns warning in 1838 after a mob in Illinois lynched an African American man suspected of murder, Rosenstein said, When men take it in their heads today to hang gamblers or burn murderers, they should recollect that in the confusion usually attending such transactions they will be as likely to hang or burn someone who is neither a gambler nor a murderer as one who is.He concluded, And that acting upon the example they set, the mob of tomorrow may, and probably will, hang or burn some of them by the very same mistake.[Special counsel is investigating Trump for possible obstruction of justice, officials say] Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself from the Trump-Russia case because of his role in the Trump campaign, leaving Rosenstein with the authority to approve Muellers budget, remove him from his post or veto any investigative step with congressional notification.Muellers team interviewed Rosenstein this year about Trumps removal of James B. Comey as FBI director, investigating whether the president might have attempted to obstruct justice leading up to Comeys firing.[Trump said he was thinking of Russia controversy when he decided to fire Comey] Rosenstein wrote a memo highly critical of the FBI director, which the White House used initially to explain the firing, before Trump later tweeted that he was going to fire Comey regardless.It was not clear whether Rosenstein had the episode in mind when he reminded the Wednesday audience of a saying by author Richard Bach, Live never to be ashamed if anything you do or say is published around the world even if what is published is not true.After a pause, Rosenstein added, And I have some recent experience with that riddle.Rosenstein spoke in the federal courthouses Ceremonial Courtroom at the annual Judge Thomas A. Flannery Lecture Series, named after the late judge and former U.S. attorney for the District who served 30 years at the federal courthouse.Rosenstein has deep ties to the courthouse.Rosenstein, who was U.S. attorney for Maryland from 2005 to 2012, joined the Justice Department in 1990 after clerking for Judge Douglas H. Ginsberg at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C.Circuit.
President Trumps incomplete history of Schumer and the Diversity Visa Lottery Program:::::Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) was involved in creating the diversity lottery program, but the story doesn't stop there.(Meg Kelly/The Washington Post) The terrorist came into our country through what is called the Diversity Visa Lottery Program, a Chuck Schumer beauty.I want merit based.President Trump, in a tweet, Nov. 1, 2017 We are fighting hard for Merit Based immigration, no more Democrat Lottery Systems.We must get MUCH tougher (and smarter).@foxandfriends Trump, in a tweet, Nov. 1 Senator Chuck Schumer helping to import Europes problems said Col. Tony Shaffer.We will stop this craziness!@foxandfriends Trump, in a tweet, Nov. 1 President Trump took aim at Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) and the Diversity Visa Lottery Program in a series of tweets early on Wednesday morning, after a deadly terrorist attack in New York City the day before.The alleged attacker, Sayfullo Saipov, came to the United States from Uzbekistan under the program, which is more commonly known as the green card lottery.So, for the record, heres how the Diversity Visa Lottery Program came to be and how Schumer was involved.(Watch the video above for a clip of a very young Schumer.)The Facts The story of the Diversity Visa Lottery program starts with the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965.Signed into law by President Lyndon B. Johnson, it ended the Emergency Quota Act of 1921.The law was aimed at reuniting families, so applicants who had immediate family living in the United States children, spouses, siblings, parents were given priority.This, however, had some unforeseen consequences.Immigrants from Latin American and Asian countries had come to the United States more recently, and they often had immediate family overseas who were prioritized under the new program.Many Europeans, by contrast, had been in the country for decades, so they had fewer close relatives remaining overseas.According to data from the Census Bureau, after 1965 the number of white immigrants declined rapidly, while Hispanic, Asian and black immigration rose steadily.The change in immigration policy hit the Irish particularly hard.Unlike other European countries, Ireland faced political instability and an economic crisis in the second half of the 20th century.Before 1965, it had been relatively simple for Irish to immigrate.Anne Law, a political science professor at the City University of New Yorks Brooklyn College, wrote in a 2002 paper: Ireland had been a high quota country with a demand for immigration that was below the supply of visas.By the 1980s, the problem was clear tens of thousands of Irish immigrants came to the United States as tourists or students and overstayed their visas.In 1988, the New York Times reported, About 150,000 Irish immigrants came to New York as students or tourists over the last six years and stayed on as undocumented aliens.This was the problem that legislators were trying to fix in the mid- to late 1980s.In 1986, Rep. Brian J. Donnelly (D-Mass.)proposed an amendment to the Immigration and Control Act that would provide a limited number of visas on a first-come, first-served basis to countries adversely affected by the 1965 legislation.The offer would be made only once.After the one-off program concluded, Schumer, then a member of the House of Representatives, and others looked for a more permanent solution.In 1990, Schumer put forth a bill that proposed making a set number of visas available each year to diversity immigrants from low-admission countries.Despite being couched as a diversity action, it was openly pitched as a way to aid the Irish.Schumers bill was absorbed into broader immigration legislation, which, when it passed the House, Schumer said he was proud to put together a major portion of the bill that is going to say to Irish, to Poles, to Nigerians: Youre not going to be excluded anymore.The bill passed with bipartisan support in the House and Senate and was signed into law by then President George H.W.Bush on Nov. 29, 1990.Fast-forward two decades.Schumer is now a member of the Senate.In 2013, he joined with the bipartisan Group of Eight senators who collaborated on what Schumer called a common sense immigration reform proposal.The proposal was the most comprehensive overhaul of immigration reform that Congress had seen since 2007.Among other things, as Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) pointed out on Twitter, the proposal eliminated the Diversity Visa Lottery Program.It would also have increased merit-based visas.In fact, had the Senate Gang of 8 bill passed the House, it would have ended the Visa Lottery Program AND increased merit based visas.https://t.co/o3qJHHAv1C Jeff Flake (@JeffFlake) November 1, 2017 The bill passed the Senate.But never made it to the House floor.Then-Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), a longtime critic of immigration reform, played a key role in killing it.And his aide at the time, Stephen Miller, according to Politico, literally wrote the handbook that House members used to fight the deal.(Sessions is now attorney general and Miller is a senior adviser in the Trump White House.)When then-House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R) shockingly lost a primary in the summer of 2014, in which immigration pushed to the forefront of the debate the reform effectively died.When asked about Trumps tweets, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders defended the presidents recounting of history, telling reporters, [Schumer] helped implement, on the front end, long before the Gang of Eight.And the Gang of Eight would have only addressed one part of that problem.The Pinocchio Test Schumer did advocate for the diversity visa program in 1990, but Trumps tweets entirely miss the context in which the program was created.Moreover, its not insignificant, as Sanders suggests, that he helped craft a bill that would eliminate it 23 years later.In addition to terminating the program, the immigration bill produced by the Gang of Eight would have increased a merit-based system, which is also included in legislation that the president has said he supports.In attacking Schumer, the president is only telling a small part of the story.For this, he receives Three Pinocchios.Three Pinocchios (About our rating scale) Send us facts to check by filling out this form Keep tabs on Trumps promises with our Trump Promise Tracker Sign up for The Fact Checker weekly newsletter Fact Checker User Poll Voting is closed on this poll User Poll Results: Do you rate this claim as true or false?More Pinocchios for false, fewer based on your opinion of the statement's truthfulness.(The check mark means you think the statement is true, not that you agree with the rating.)20% 20% 20% 20% 20% Pardon the interruption!We need to verify that you are an actual person.View Results This is a non-scientific user poll.Results are not statistically valid and cannot be assumed to reflect the views of Washington Post users as a group or the general population.

Democrats demand that Sessions explain his meeting with Papadopoulos:::::U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions delivers remarks about defending national security, at the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, Thursday, Nov. 2, 2017.(Richard Drew/AP) Senate Democrats have demanded that Attorney General Jeff Sessions explain why he did not disclose a March 2016 gathering with then-candidate Donald Trump and members of his campaign team at which an adviser offered to set up a meeting between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin.Sessionss participation in the gathering was detailed in court documents released Monday by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III.The adviser who offered to set up the meeting was George Papadopoulos, who has pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI, according to the documents.Sessions had not previously disclosed the meeting, despite being asked over multiple appearances on Capitol Hill whether he or anyone on the campaign ever discussed meeting with Russians.This is another example in an alarming pattern in which you, the nations top law enforcement officer, apparently failed to tell the truth, under oath, about the Trump teams contacts with agents of Russia, Senate Judiciary Committee member Al Franken (D-Minn.) wrote Thursday in a letter to Sessions.Senate Republicans have not rushed to Sessionss defense but were less ruffled about his participation in the Papadopoulos meeting.If anybodys got any concerns about his meeting, write him a letter and see what he says, said Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.).George Papadopoulos pleaded guilty in early October to lying to federal officials about his contacts with Russian nationals.He is one of three former Trump campaign officials facing criminal charges.(Elyse Samuels/The Washington Post) A Sessions spokeswoman declined to comment this week on the March 31 meeting with Trump and campaign advisers, including Papadopoulos.But on Thursday, a person familiar with Sessionss recollections said that people who remember the conversation believed that Papadopoulos was proposing an idea of using his Russian contacts to try to set up a meeting between Trump and Putin, which was immediately rejected by then-Senator Sessions.Papadopoulos was some 29-year-old that nobody had ever heard of and who struck people in the room as someone who didnt have a lot of credibility, the person said.As far as Sessions seemed to be concerned, when he shut down this idea of Papadopoulos engaging with Russia, that was the end of it and he moved the meeting along to other issues.The March 31 comments by this Papadopoulos person did not leave a lasting impression, the person said.The attorney general immediately dismissed it and moved on.J.D.Gordon, a former Pentagon spokesman and Trump adviser who attended the meeting, also recalled that Sessions shut him down when Papadopoulos announced that he could introduce Trump to Putin.It was a bad idea and the Senator didnt want people to speak about it again, he said.The Washington Post also reported earlier this week that Papadopoulos sat next to Sessions during a dinner at the Capitol Hill Club for campaign advisers weeks before the Republican National Convention, according to another person who attended.[For low level volunteer, Papadopoulos sought high profile as Trump adviser] The Post's Matt Zapotosky and Devlin Barrett explain what could come next following the indictment of former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and the guilty plea of former campaign adviser George Papadopoulos.(Joyce Lee,Bastien Inzaurralde/TWP) At the time of that article, a spokeswoman for Sessions declined to comment.But on Thursday, the person familiar with Sessionss recollections said, the attorney general has no clear recollection of this person.He may have been at future Trump events that Sessions attended including a dinner at the Capitol Hill Club with some members of the foreign policy committee over the summer but Sessions doesnt recall any further interactions with him, including any phone calls or emails.Gordon said that he did not fault Sessions for not recalling things that Papadopoulos said in private settings, noting that thousands of people approached the campaign, including many, many true volunteers.This is not the first time lawmakers have accused Sessions of withholding information from congressional testimony about interactions with or about Russians while working with the Trump campaign.During his January confirmation hearing to become attorney general, Sessions told the Judiciary Committee that he had had no communication with Russian officials, only to have The Post reveal in March that he had spoken twice with the Russian ambassador to the United States, Sergey Kislyak.[Sessions met with Russian envoy twice last year, encounters he later did not disclose] Following the Post report, Sessions recused himself from the Justice Departments Russia probes an action that infuriated Trump.Last month, Sessions told the same committee he was not aware of any Trump surrogates having contacts with Russian officials.Democrats on the committee, including Franken, are now arguing that statement may have been false, too.He needs to clarify his testimony before our committee, said Judiciary Committee member Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.).There were questions that elicited exactly the kind of information that the Papadopoulos plea agreement made.The attorney general needs to explain to our committee what are the obvious implications of his presence at that meeting, and how he can square that with his testimony to our committee, said Sen. Christopher A. Coons (D-Del.), another member of the Judiciary Committee.The person familiar with Sessionss interactions with Papadopoulos said that Sessions had been entirely truthful and consistent on this matter and that he had no knowledge of any conversations by anyone connected to the Trump campaign with any Russian or any foreign officials concerning any type of interference with any campaign or election in the United States.Democrats on the Senate Intelligence Committee, which is also looking into allegations of collusion and Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election, also want a reckoning from Sessions.I think there are many more questions for Jeff Sessions, said Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.), a member of the panel.He should be honest and disclose all truths, especially when he is under oath or testifying before the United States Congress.Rosalind S. Helderman contributed to this report.Read more at PowerPost
Democrats express outrage over allegations of early party control for Clinton in 2016:::::Here is what you need to know about the political storm sparked by Donna Braziles allegations against the Clinton campaign.(Amber Ferguson,Melissa Macaya/The Washington Post) Here is what you need to know about the political storm sparked by Donna Braziles allegations against the Clinton campaign.(Amber Ferguson,Melissa Macaya/The Washington Post) Many Democrats expressed outrage Thursday at allegations from a former party chairwoman that an agreement with the Democratic National Committee gave the presidential campaign of Hillary Clinton some day-to-day control over the party early in the 2016 campaign.Donna Brazile, a former interim chairwoman of the party, says in a forthcoming book that an August 2015 agreement gave the Clinton campaign a measure of direct influence over the partys finances and strategy, along with a say over staff decisions and consultation rights over issues like mailings, budgets and analytics.The control was given in exchange for a joint fundraising pledge by the Clinton campaign that helped fund the DNC through the election year, Brazile says.This was not a criminal act, but as I saw it, it compromised the partys integrity, she wrote in a book scheduled for publication next week, a portion of which was excerpted Thursday in Politico.Throughout the campaign, the DNC and its then-chairwoman, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, fiercely denied any suggestion that the party was helping Clinton over other candidates.The presidential campaign of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) had criticized Wasserman Schultz for limiting the early primary debate schedule, allowing party money to be used for Clinton fundraising, and briefly cutting off Sanderss access to the party voter file shortly before the New Hampshire primary after a Sanders staffer inappropriately accessed information.Some Democrats now say the arrangement is evidence that the concerns were valid.Ray Buckley, the chairman of New Hampshires Democratic Party, said that he first learned of the agreement while serving as DNC vice chair in 2016.The day that Donna discovered this, she called me and I almost passed out, Buckley said.We were blatantly misled.In response to the report Thursday, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.)said in a CNN interview that she believed the primary contest between Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders had been rigged.This is a real problem, she said.We have to hold this party accountable.President Trump also jumped on the controversy with a tweet on Thursday night that suggested the Justice Department should investigate the real collusion and dishonesty, even though Brazile and the Sanders campaign have not alleged criminal activity.Donna Brazile just stated the DNC RIGGED the system to illegally steal the Primary from Bernie Sanders, he wrote.Trump said in an interview with Fox News Channel broadcast Thursday night that the Brazile allegations are a major story.Its illegal, number one, and its really very unfair to Bernie Sanders, Trump told Fox host Laura Ingraham.I thought that was terrible.The current leadership of the party said it would address the problem.One of my goals here, as DNC chair, is to make sure that the nominating process for 2020 is a process thats fair and transparent for everybody, DNC Chairman Tom Perez said in an interview with CNBC.Were going to set the primary debate schedule well in advance of when we know which candidates will be there.Charlie Baker, the chief operating officer of the Clinton campaign, said that in 2015 the campaign agreed to raise money for the parts of the DNC that were going to be most crucial to the general election, including data, research, communications and the like.The agreement also gave the Clinton campaign some say over personnel.If there was a vacancy for a position in one of these departments, the DNC had to consult the campaign on the three finalists but could make the final decision itself.We never tried to be presumptuous, Baker said.We were literally trying to make sure the DNC had the resources it needed, whoever was the nominee.The joint fundraising agreement allowed Clinton to raise hundreds of thousands of dollars from individual donors money that was spread across state parties under federal campaign guidelines.Sanders had a different fundraising model, relying more on small-dollar donations directly to his campaign, and he told the DNC that his campaign was not interested in following the same program.The idea that the DNC was willing to take a position that helped a candidate in the midst of a primary is outrageous, and there is no justification for it, said Mark Longabaugh, a senior adviser to the Sanders campaign.It gets back to the fundamental way that Bernie Sanders was running his campaign, which was to break the stranglehold of big money on politics.Jeff Weaver, Sanderss campaign manager, said in an interview that their campaign was led to believe it had the same joint fundraising agreement as Clinton.We were not offered veto power on staff at the DNC, I can tell you that, said Weaver.This was a laundering operation.Theyd go to fundraisers, theyd get a $350,000 check from donors which was supposed to be divvied up.Instead of disbursing that money, theyd turn around and run a small-dollar fundraising to generate small contributions that went to the Clinton campaign.In a September 2015 email obtained by The Washington Post, a lawyer from Perkins Coie, a law firm representing both the DNC and the Clinton campaign, wrote the Sanders campaign with a copy of what was presented as a standard joint fundraising agreement.This is the same one we have used with other campaigns, wrote attorney Graham Wilson.At the end of the same email, Wilson suggested that should the Sanders campaign raise significantly more money than was required to pay for the party voter file, then Sanders could have a say in how those funds would be used to prepare for the general election.The DNC has had discussions like this with the Clinton campaign and is of course willing to do so with all committees raising funds for the Committee, Wilson wrote.Weaver said the Sanders campaign decided early on to ignore the joint fundraising program and raise small dollars on its own to pay for access to the voter file.Who are the wealthy people Bernie was going to bring to a fundraiser?Weaver asked.We had to buy the voter file right before the primaries.After the election, the effects of the Clinton fundraising effort hit some state parties hard.Jane Kleeb, who took over Nebraskas Democratic Party in late 2016, discovered that the party had accrued $35,000 in debt for the Clinton campaign.Nebraska never even signed the JFA because we ...didnt want to be a funnel for, essentially, money-laundering, Kleeb said.And now we learn that a small group of establishment Democrats got to determine who our nominee was.That goes against everything that Democratic values are built on.Kleeb, who along with Weaver is a member of the Democrats post-primary unity commission, said the party had made some amends under Perezs leadership.In his campaign to run the DNC and since, Perez has chastised Wasserman Schultz for turning the party into a vehicle for the presidential campaign.After Braziles book excerpt surfaced, state chairs began calling and emailing each other about a change to the DNCs rules and bylaws that would forbid any arrangement like the one Clinton got.Buckley and other DNC members suggested that the party should also give DNC members access to its budget, which would have made it clear much earlier how the joint fundraising agreement was affecting the flow of money.I will co-sponsor that amendment and vote for it, Buckley said.Theres so much reform that has to happen.The 2015 agreement was struck at a time when the partys finances were in a dire situation.Two sources said that it was in danger of not meeting its payroll.The Clinton campaign had effectively taken control of the Democratic National Committee in the year before the nominating process began, said Tad Devine, the top strategist for the Sanders campaign.They exercised their control through the use of the joint fundraising agreement.Read more at PowerPost
Public will turn against GOP tax bill, Schumer predicts: The more its in sunlight, the more it stinks:::::House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Charle E. Schumer take questions during a news conference Thursday on Capitol Hill to respond to the Republican tax plan.(J. Scott Applewhite/AP) Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said Thursday that Republicans are bound to run into political trouble by trying to sell their tax legislation as a boon to the middle class when most of its direct benefits will in fact flow to corporations and wealthy individuals.In the old days you could give a crumb to the middle class and give most of the tax breaks to the wealthy, and people would say, Okay, Schumer said in an interview with Washington Post reporters hours after House Republicans released a draft tax bill.But with income distribution, sourness and populism where they are, thats not working, so I think this bill has real trouble.[GOP tax plan would shrink mortgage interest benefit, slash corporate tax rate] The more people find out about it, the less theyll like, he added.This bill is like a dead fish.The more its in sunlight, the more it stinks, and thats whats going to happen.Schumers comments came as Democrats coalesced around a message attacking the GOPs tax plans, one that highlighted the bills benefits to businesses and high-income taxpayers.Earlier in the day, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) took a similar tack, calling the bill a Ponzi scheme that corporate America will perpetrate on the American people.House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) called the Republican's tax plan a "ponzi scheme" at a news conference on Nov. 2.(Reuters) The American people deserve real, bipartisan tax reform that puts the middle class first, she said.This Republican plan doesnt do any of that.In fact, its a giveaway to corporations and the wealthiest.Republicans are selling the bill primarily as a broad-based tax cut for the middle class, touting an internal calculation that the typical family of four will save $1,182 on their yearly federal income tax bill.They also argue that the business tax provisions will grow the economy, create jobs and drive up wages.This plan is for the middle-class families in this country who deserve a break, House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) said Thursday.It is for the families who are out there living paycheck to paycheck, who just keep getting squeezed.This is going to help give people relief.An analysis of the House bill released Thursday evening by the Joint Committee on Taxation calculates the total revenue cut of the House tax bill at $1.49 trillion over the coming decade.Nearly 80 percent of that cost, however, is attributable to business provisions including a lower 20 percent corporate tax rate and a new 25 percent rate for pass-through business income taxed on an individual basis as well as changes to the estate tax that would benefit only the wealthy.[Blue states will be hit hardest by GOP tax plans limits on deductions] Schumer said that Democrats would work over the coming weeks to make sure Americans learn who will reap the bulk of the bills benefits, and he compared the effort to the partys thus-far-successful push to defeat the GOPs health-care agenda.He pointed to polling data showing that Americans are largely against giving tax benefits to corporations and the wealthy.When it started out people were for it, he said.End Obamacare, repeal and replace!Because they were told it would reduce premiums and increase coverage.As they learned what the bill was about, it became unpopular and thats why it lost.Schumer also pointed, with no small amount of glee, to the opposition the bill has provoked from key industry groups including associations representing home builders, real-estate agents and privately owned businesses: Given today was rollout day, I think they had a pretty bad day.He predicted that any changes Republicans would make to placate dissenters including the industry groups and lawmakers from states with high state and local taxes whose constituents stand to lose a key deduction would only make passage harder in the Senate, where Republican deficit hawks are threatening to oppose the bill if it costs too much.Theyre going to have to decrease or keep more of the deductions theyve eliminated, Schumer said.But in the Senate, that will increase the deficit, and the way this bill will go down in the Senate is because enough deficit hawks will vote against it.Its a dynamic that makes it difficult for them.And Schumer warned that those lawmakers in such high-tax states as New York, New Jersey and California would pay a price if they go along and vote for a bill that rolls back the current itemized deduction for state and local taxes and also caps the deduction for mortgage interest at $500,000 instead of the current $1 million.The people who probably end up faring the worst in this bill are their base constituents, which are middle class and upper-middle-class, he said, adding: To do such deep tax cuts for the wealthy and corporate America, big corporations, theyve had to tie themselves in a knot in other areas.Thats why theyre in a pickle.

ANWR tests spirit of bipartisanship between Sens. Murkowski and Cantwell:::::For months, the top Republican and Democrat on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee had worked together to craft a comprehensive energy bill.But that bipartisan spirit was tested Thursday as Republican Chair Lisa Murkowski (Alaska) and ranking Democrat Maria Cantwell (Wash.) clashed over whether to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to drilling.ANWR is back on the legislative table again because GOP lawmakers are desperately seeking revenue to help pay for a massive package of tax cuts they debuted Thursday.As part of a budget bill passed by the Senate last month, lawmakers instructed committee members to find $1 billion in additional revenue a maneuver widely seen as designed to open the refuge to drilling.The Senate narrowly defeated an amendment from Cantwell to strip out the refuge language.[ANWR is back.It could make a tax code overhaul a lot harder.]With the tax package on center stage in the House, the senators sparred on the other side of the Capitol over whether to allow drilling on one of few undisturbed parcels of land in the United States.The sparring foreshadows the partisan rifts that are likely to divide the upper chamber over paying for a tax package that Republicans need to claim as an accomplishment.On one side of the debate sat Republicans and virtually every Alaskan elected to statewide office, who argue that opening ANWR to drilling will boost the states economy and the nations energy security.Using modern drilling techniques, they argue, it can be done with little environmental impact.On the other side sat virtually every Democrat, who contend that the region is too ecologically critical to indigenous caribou hunters and the broader Arctic ecosystem to bore for oil.For those of us who call Alaska home, to suggest that we would despoil our environment for short-term gain is offensive, Murkowski said.The committee meeting turned tense at times, with Cantwell pressing her Republican counterpart about why the bipartisan energy bill has been abandoned to take up the ANWR question yet again.This hearing is a great departure from the strong working relationship that Sen. Murkowski and I have set to work together on an energy agenda that will move our country forward, Cantwell said.I almost want to call this caribou for millionaires because it is the most ridiculous idea Ive heard as it relates to meeting the tax reform agenda, she added.Tucked against the Beaufort Sea in Alaskas North Slope, a 1.5 million-acre coastal plain in the refuge has been part of a heated political debate since the 1980s.In 1989, Congress considered the issue of drilling in the refuge, and the Energy and Natural Resources Committee passed a pro-drilling bill.But it was shelved after the Exxon Valdez ran ashore in the Prince William Sound.In the 1990s, then-Sen. Frank H. Murkowski (R-Alaska), Lisas father, tried unsuccessfully, again.A 1995 attempt to open the refuge passed the GOP-controlled House and Senate but was vetoed by President Bill Clinton.A group of moderate Republicans defeated a similar attempt in 2005.[The Energy 202: Environmentalists gear up for another fight over ANWR] Alaskas elected officials turned out in force for the hearing.Rep. Don Young, Alaskas long-serving and lone member of the House, shot back at opponents of the drilling plan, without naming names, for what he saw as their ignorance on Alaskan issues.I dont feel too comfortable on the Senate side, Young said.I need a flashlight most of the time because sometimes its pretty dark over her.The hearing was attended by seemingly every Alaskan elected to statewide office, including Gov.Bill Walker (I), Lt. Gov.Byron Mallott (D) and Sen. Dan Sullivan (R), who all supported drilling in the refuge.During the four-hour meeting, Murkowski and other Republicans emphasized only one ten-thousandth, or 2,000 acres, of the refuge would be open to drilling if legislation was enacted.Cantwell and Sen. Angus King (I-Maine) countered that that figure discounts the impact of roads, airports and pipelines necessary to bring the oil out of the refuge and to the states primary petroleum artery, the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System.At one point, Cantwell held up a map showing, she said, that drilling will take up a significant portion of the refuge.Later, Young offered a rebuttal.The map that the ranking member showed was actually drawn up by the Sierra Club, he added.That bothers me.Thats old information.The debate over Arctic drilling also marked one of the few times rank-and-file Republicans seemed comfortable bringing up Russia in 2017 without prompting.Producing more energy strengthens our national security, Sullivan said.Its not just American officials who recognize this, he added.The Russians know this as well.

Jeremy Corbyn silent on promotion of suspended MP Kelvin Hopkins:::::Jeremy Corbyn has refused to reveal whether he knew of allegations against a Labour MP before promoting him to the shadow cabinet.The Opposition leader was quizzed on the subject several times on Friday after Kelvin Hopkins was suspended.Labour has withdrawn the whip while it carries out an investigation into the Luton North MP's actions.Mr Hopkins, 76, allegedly inappropriately touched Ava Etemadzadeh, 27, and sent her suggestive text messages.Image: Sky News understands 'fresh information' emerged about Mr Hopkins Mr Corbyn is now facing pressure to explain how much he knew of the 20-year-serving MP's actions.He declined to answer questions outside his house on Friday, saying only: "Good morning.Nice to see you.Thank you for coming to my road - goodbye."Labour MP Jess Phillips said promoting Mr Hopkins "didn't look good to the victim".She told Sky News: "I know, because I have spoken to her and met her, that at the time she felt that her complaint had been handled the way she wanted it to.Image: Jess Phillips said the promotion 'didn't look good' "The chief whip at the time, Rosie Winterton, had listened to her and supported her, asked her what she wanted and then done that."It is unfortunate that some months after that Kelvin Hopkins was put on the frontbench."But another left-wing MP told Sky News: "I can't imagine Kevin pinching people's bottoms".A close friend added: "I don't believe it.I've known him for 20 years - it's absurd.People have been coming out with all sorts of silly things."Image: Mr Hopkins has been MP for Luton North since 1997 It comes as a sexual harassment scandal engulfs Westminster, already claiming the resignation of one minister and prompting the investigation of two more.Labour has also launched another investigation into claims by activist Bex Bailey that she was discouraged from reporting a rape allegation by party officials.Meanwhile, MP Jared O'Mara has had the whip suspended and is facing questions over a series of homophobic and sexist online comments.
Andrea Leadsom compiled 'list of lewd comments that forced Sir Michael Fallon out':::::Sir Michael Fallon was forced to quit the Cabinet after a fellow minister compiled a dossier of allegations against him, it has been claimed.House of Commons leader Andrea Leadsom reportedly recorded a list of lewd comments he made over several years.Among them was a report that when she complained of having cold hands at a meeting, the now former Defence Secretary replied: "I know where you can put them to warm them up."Image: Andrea Leadsom reportedly took her dossier to Downing Street Sir Michael categorically denies the report, carried in The Sun.A source close to him told the paper: "He categorically denies saying something as appalling as he knows where she could warm her hands."Ms Leadsom was said to have delivered the allegations to Downing Street after it failed to investigate Sir Michael, amid a sexual harassment scandal brewing in Westminster.The Sevenoaks MP said he was quitting because "allegations" had been surfacing "about my previous conduct", admitting he had "fallen below" the high standards expected of him.Video: 'I may have fallen below high standards' - Fallon His only public admission was to touching a journalist's knee at a conference 15 years ago.Ms Leadsom has not denied the claims caused her then-Cabinet colleague to resign.Earlier this week, she issued a stern warning to MPs as the claims against them mounted."I am setting the bar significantly below criminal activity," Ms Leadsom told the Commons.Image: Downing Street has only referred to the exchange of letters "If people are made to feel uncomfortable then that is not correct."In terms of the consequences for the perpetrators, I think I have also been perfectly clear: in the case of staff they could forfeit their job, in the case of MPs, they could have the whip withdrawn and they could be fired from ministerial office."A source close to Sir Michael has since told The Sun: "He doesn't remember what he is supposed to have said in the committee.But he doesn't deny making comments that someone might have taken offence at."He may have said something that Andrea was offended by, but he categorically denies saying something as appalling as he knows where she could warm her hands."That is an appalling slur from Leadsom."Theresa May's spokesperson said only that she had "full confidence in her Government and all her ministers".

Contaminated blood scandal to have 'full statutory inquiry':::::A "full statutory inquiry" will be held into the contaminated blood scandal which left 2,400 people dead, the Government has said.It comes after victims and families of those affected raised concerns about the potential involvement of the Department of Health in the probe.The Cabinet Office will now lead the inquiry into the events of the 1970s and 1980s when thousands of haemophiliacs and other patients were given blood products infected with hepatitis C and HIV.Prime Minister Theresa May ordered the inquiry earlier this year, saying she wanted "justice" for the victims and their families.Video: PM: Blood scandal victims need urgent answers Downing Street said it had considered the "strong view" that the Department of Health should not be responsible for the probe when it is under investigation itself.The Prime Minister's official spokesman said: "The inquiry will be conducted under the responsibility of the Cabinet Office rather than by the Department of Health with immediate effect."We have been absolutely clear of our determination to establish what happened in relation to the contaminated blood scandal of the 1970s and 1980s and to work with the families of those affected, and we are now moving forward with that process."Video: Family 'torn apart' by blood scandal Campaigners and families of those affected by the scandal boycotted a meeting with Department of Health officials earlier this year in protest at its involvement in the inquiry.Cabinet documents obtained by Sky News revealed senior ministers in the 1987 Conservative Government pursued a deliberate policy of not accepting any responsibility for the scandal and tried to limit its financial liability to victims - despite privately acknowledging it could not "refute convincingly" the allegation that it was at fault.Video: Contaminated blood 'cover-up' revealed Downing Street said there had been around 800 responses to a consultation which asked families and victims if they wanted a judge-led inquiry into the scandal or a Hillsborough-style panel.A further announcement about the probe is expected before the end of the year.
Irish foreign minister says Brexit promises 'undeliverable':::::Promises made to the British people over Brexit are "undeliverable", Ireland's foreign minister has told Sky News.Simon Coveney, who met with Chancellor Philip Hammond and Brexit Secretary David Davis on Thursday, suggested UK politicians "need to be honest" about Britain's departure from the EU.He outlined how Ireland is hoping for "as close to the status quo as possible" after Brexit, but warned forging a new relationship between his country and the UK is "proving much more complicated and much more difficult than people had anticipated".Image: Simon Coveney says Ireland is hoping for 'as close to the status quo as possible' Mr Coveney said: "What has been promised to the British people in terms of what Brexit offers and the opportunities of it, in the context of also trying to hold on to the benefits of the relationship that Britain has with the EU, I don't think is deliverable."This is such a difficult political challenge and that's why we have to be mature, flexible and pragmatic about how we find solutions."But I think we also need to be honest with people."It is not in my view possible for Britain on the one hand to be negotiating free trade arrangements with countries on a bilateral basis all over the world and at the same time to expect barrier-free trade into the single market of the EU, which is the most open single market in history."Image: Ireland's foreign minister says the British people deserve honesty about Brexit Mr Coveney described Ireland as "more exposed, more vulnerable to a bad deal on Brexit than any other country in the EU", as he pointed to "real and measurable challenges" on UK-Irish trade and the Northern Ireland peace process.But Mr Coveney, who also met with Northern Ireland Secretary James Brokenshire and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn in London, offered some hope to the UK as the Prime Minister looks to move negotiations on from divorce issues to the future relationship by the end of the year.The Irish minister suggested his country would be "Britain's closest friend" in the Brussels negotiating room during the second phase of talks, adding: "The outcome that we want is one that I think Britain also wants."Following his talks with Mr Coveney, Mr Davis expressed confidence a Brexit deal would protect the Good Friday Agreement."We both recognise the importance of finding flexible and imaginative solutions to the issues we face, and I am determined to build on the genuine progress we have made so far when negotiations with the EU begin again next week," he said.Image: David Davis told MPs he will be 'open' over Brexit impact studies Earlier, Mr Davis had told MPs the Government intends to be "as open as we can be" after the House of Commons passed a Labour motion on Wednesday night calling on ministers to make Brexit economic impact studies available.The Government have accepted the motion is binding, with Labour MP Hilary Benn, the chair of the Commons Brexit Committee, writing to Mr Davis to say he expect the studies to be handed to his committee within the next 12 weeks.Ministers had previously resisted their release over fears they could harm the UK's negotiating position, although Mr Benn has promised to discuss confidentiality arrangements with the Brexit Secretary.
A week in Westminster: Sex scandal timeline:::::Aubrey Allegretti, Political Reporter It is only a week since the first rumblings of a sex scandal sent political tremors through Westminster.In seven days a minister has resigned and two further are under investigation, as Labour suspends a veteran MP.Sky News explains how events unfolded from a self-contained WhatsApp group to an explosive scandal some think will be "bigger than expenses".Scandal breaks Image: The claims started out in a Tory staff WhatsApp group The story breaks with The Sun reporting that Tory researchers had set up a WhatsApp group naming "sex pest" MPs.Cabinet ministers are said to among those mentioned, with predictions of a scandal in Parliament and the first senior MP being exposed by the weekend.Theresa May calls the reports "deeply concerning", suggesting victims go to the police.First minister named Image: Mark Garnier asked his secretary to buy him sex toys International trade minister Mark Garnier becomes the first minister to be named.He admits to the Daily Mail calling his secretary "sugar t***" and getting her to buy him sex toys, but denies it was harassment.Former Work and Pensions Secretary Stephen Crabb says he has been "foolish" to send explicit messages to a 19-year-old woman he interviewed for a job in 2013.Downing Street is said to be "fearing the row could prompt an emergency Cabinet reshuffle".Investigations begin Image: A redacted version of the spreadsheet was published The floodgates open when the WhatsApp group becomes a spreadsheet, with Guido Fawkes revealing 36 MPs have been named.The websites redacts personal information, but includes the full list of alleged behaviour - including "handsy in taxis", "paid a female to be quiet" and "inappropriate with male researchers and heavy drinker".As the gravity of the scandal begins to sink in, Mrs May writes a letter to John Bercow calling for a binding code of conduct for all MPs, and says it is "vital" Parliament retains the confidence of its staff and the public.Spreadsheet spreads Image: Andrea Leadsom issued a warning to MPs The unredacted spreadsheet begins circulating round Westminster and the media - making some MPs aware they are named on it.Commons leader Andrea Leadsom issues a veiled warning to everyone in the House."I am setting the bar significantly below criminal activity," she says."In the case of staff they could forfeit their job, in the case of MPs, they could have the whip withdrawn and they could be fired from ministerial office."Fallon apologises Image: Sir Michael Fallon apologised for touching a journalist's knee Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon becomes the first Cabinet minister to become directly involved in the scandal.He admits to and apologises for touching a journalist's knee in an incident at a party conference dinner in 2002.Video: Michael Fallon is the victim of a 'witch hunt' Mrs May's spokesman is forced to say the PM has "confidence in her Government and ministers".Meanwhile, Labour activist Bex Bailey says she was discouraged from reporting a rape allegation against and by party officials.First resignation Image: Damien Green was included on the spreadsheet The scandal claims its first scalp.Sir Michael Fallon quits as Defence Secretary, saying that his behaviour had "fallen below" the high standards expected of him.Mrs May's de facto deputy, Damien Green, is also named by The Sun as being on the spreadsheet, but denies any wrongdoing.A senior Tory MP calls for him to stand down while an investigation is underway.Two ministers - Dominc Rabb and Rory Stewart - reveal their names were listed too, but say they have done nothing wrong.Labour MP suspended Image: Kelvin Hopkins was the second MP suspended by Labour Commons veteran Kelvin Hopkins is suspended by Labour pending an investigation.Mr Hopkins was the subject of a sexual assault complaint in 2014, but Sky News understands Labour's action comes after learning of "fresh information".Video: Corbyn refuses to discuss suspended Labour MP And Sir Michael is put back in the spotlight by claims he was forced out of the Cabinet after Ms Leadsom compiled a dossier of allegations against him.He denies making a suggestion when Ms Leadsom complained of having cold hands.Where the scandal goes next, is yet unknown.But many in Westminster hope - or fear - it will roll on and on.
Conservative backlash at new Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson:::::Gavin Williamson has described himself as "honoured and excited" to be appointed Defence Secretary - but his rise to a leading Cabinet role has sparked concern among Conservative colleagues.Theresa May's former chief whip has been promoted to replace Sir Michael Fallon, who resigned on Wednesday night amid the sleaze scandal engulfing Westminster.Mr Williamson has not previously served in a senior departmental role, and his lack of ministerial experience has caused consternation among Tory MPs.Prominent backbencher Sarah Wollaston described Mr Williamson as an "extremely likeable and respected chief whip" but questioned his suitability to be installed at the Ministry of Defence."I think it would be worth reflecting whether there were others that were more experienced and suitable for that role," she told the BBC.Dr Wollaston suggested Mr Williamson's position as a close ally of the Prime Minister played a part in his appointment.Video: Defence Secretary: New role is a 'privilege' The decision also went down badly with other Tory MPs, with one minister telling Sky's Beth Rigby that Mrs May is "so weak she's allowed the inexperienced chief whip to appoint himself".Another MP suggested to Sky's Lewis Goodall that Mr Williamson "knifed Fallon and pinched his job", adding: "It's way above his ability."Lord Dannatt, the former head of the British Army, branded Mr Williamson's appointment as a "political" decision by the Prime Minister.Video: 'I may have fallen below high standards' - Fallon The new Defence Secretary was backed by Mrs May's former chief of staff Nick Timothy, who claimed Mr Williamson had been a "brilliant chief whip" who the Prime Minister "rates".Posting on Twitter, Mr Timothy also rubbished the idea Mr Williamson had played a role in his own appointment as "absurd".But former minister Anna Soubry offered a further glimpse of the anger within Tory ranks, replying: "Concerning comment from someone who helped lose the Conservative Party its majority & destroy 10 years hard work to make us electable."Ms Soubry later suggested Mr Williamson had "picked himself a plum job".Video: Fallon's resignation 'insane, absurd and ridiculous' Downing Street also denied he was involved in discussions about Sir Michael's replacement."Gavin Williamson was an excellent and hard-working chief whip and the Prime Minister thinks he will make an excellent Defence Secretary," the Prime Minister's official spokesman said.Mr Williamson told Sky News his appointment was an "immense privilege" as he described the Armed Forces as "the greatest pride of our nation".But the South Staffordshire MP also revealed his own shock at being promoted, telling his local Express & Star newspaper he was "absolutely flabbergasted" when the Prime Minister asked him to take on his new position.
UK interest rate doubled - first rise in 10 years:::::The Bank of England has increased interest rates by 0.25 percentage points to 0.5% - the first rate rise since 2007.Millions of mortgage borrowers face an increase in their monthly repayments after the decision by the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) but savers should see a boost.The increase in the Bank rate was widely expected but marks a watershed moment after years of rock-bottom borrowing costs.Governor Mark Carney said that with unemployment at a 42-year low and inflation above its 2% target, it was time "to ease our foot off the accelerator" of stimulus which has been supporting the economy.Royal Bank of Scotland - which includes NatWest and Ulster Bank North - and TSB were among the first to confirm the hike was being passed on to some customers.The Bank of England also signalled that it may increase rates further in the coming years.:: What an interest rate rise means for you :: Why the Bank of England has raised interest rates Video: Carney sees little rate rise strain But currency markets were unimpressed by the announcement, sending the pound more than one-and-a-half cents lower against the dollar to below $1.3050.That was after the pace of future increases implied by the Bank's forecasts was lower than some economists were expecting.They implied rates hitting 1% by 2020, with one increase of a quarter percentage point likely next year.Economists saw this as "dovish" in tone.Howard Archer, chief economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club, said: "We do not expect the MPC to act again until at least the fourth quarter of 2018."The weaker pound boosted dollar earners on the FTSE 100, which closed just one point shy of its record high at 7555.Shares in UK-based banks RBS and Lloyds - which tend to benefit from higher interest rates - fell nearly 1% though.The MPC was split on Thursday's decision, with seven members including governor Mark Carney voting for the increase but two - Sir Jon Cunliffe and Sir Dave Ramsden - voting to keep rates on hold.Experts estimate eight million Britons have never seen an interest rate rise.The Bank of England cut interest rates to a historically low 0.5% in 2009 to try to help nurse the economy back to health at the height of the global financial crisis.They were then cut again last summer in the aftermath of the Brexit vote, to 0.25%.The decision to hike comes in the face of sluggish growth and warnings from some experts that it should be delayed to avoid further risking the economy.The change in Bank rate is likely to be reflected in instant increases in floating rate mortgages and by more gradual changes of other rates, including unsecured borrowing and savings rates.UK Finance, the trade body for Britain's lenders, says there were 9.2 million outstanding mortgage loans outstanding in June this year.Video: Pushing the button on interest rates Of these, 3.7 million were on a variable rate - including tracker mortgages directly linked to the Bank rate as well as those on standard variable rates set by individual banks and building societies.But the immediate impact of the rate hike will be less widespread than it would have been in prior years as a growing number - currently 4.4 million - were on fixed rate deals.The Bank of England said it expected inflation - already at a five-year high of 3% - to peak at 3.2% in the coming month and for economic growth to remain subdued in the coming years.Mr Carney signalled that Brexit was at the heart of weaknesses in the economy - driving up inflation through the fall in the pound since the referendum and holding back growth just as expansion elsewhere in the world is accelerating.He also argued that the impact of Brexit on the supply of workers, and investment, meant that the "speed limit" at which the economy can grow without pushing up inflation had fallen.The Bank slightly cut back its forecast for GDP growth for this year from 1.7% to 1.6%, and left the outlook for 2018 and 2019 unchanged at 1.6% and 1.7%.
Who exactly is governing Northern Ireland?:::::The two largest parties in Northern Ireland - the DUP and Sinn Fein - have failed to reach agreement on restoring devolved government at Stormont.With cash for health and education running out, a Northern Ireland Budget Bill has been tabled at Westminster for the first time in a decade.In a conversation with the Irish Prime Minister, Theresa May said moves to implement a Budget were "not the first step on the road to direct rule".She could not say much else, given that a return to Westminster rule would be a breach of the power-sharing treaty: the St Andrew's Agreement (2006).The Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, reminded the Prime Minister there could be "no return to direct rule as it existed prior to the Good Friday Agreement".But their polite telephone conversation begs an obvious question: without devolution or direct rule, who exactly is governing Northern Ireland?Image: Mr Varadkar says there can be no return to direct rule as it was before the Good Friday Agreement Nearly 20 years after the Good Friday Agreement and 10 years after the DUP and Sinn Fein shared power, Northern Ireland finds itself in political limbo.Mandatory coalition - the system of government which forced the polar opposite parties together - has failed to produce reconciliation.Parties are unable to resolve differences over an Irish Language Act and gay marriage, but these are not the rocks on which Stormont is perishing.They have become touchstones for Sinn Fein - their means of measuring the extent to which the DUP is genuinely prepared to share power.Collapsing devolution earned Sinn Fein votes in the Stormont election.Refusing Sinn Fein demands earned the DUP votes in the general election.Neither party is in the mood for a compromise to restore devolution but there is no legislation permitting a return to direct rule from Westminster.The Irish government will not accept London rule of Northern Ireland, but the DUP will not accept any kind of joint authority.So when is direct rule not direct rule?When the Prime Minister wants the Irish government's help in Brussels and needs the DUP's help in Westminster.
Gavin Williamson's promotion: A missed opportunity for May:::::This morning I'd have bet my bottom dollar that Theresa May would appoint Britain's first female Defence Secretary to replace Michael Fallon.Instead, she replaced him with a man - and not just any man: Gavin Williamson.The MP who, as Chief Whip, probably knew more about the cosseted world of Westminster and was until today the keeper to its secrets, including the sexual misdemeanours of his colleagues.Overnight there had been much feverish speculation that with Fallon's resignation and her de facto deputy Damien Green's potentially in the offing, May might have to resign.I thought this was ridiculous on both moral and political grounds.:: LIVE - May's mini-reshuffle Image: Sir Michael Fallon resigned on Wednesday night Morally - unless it could be shown that May had directly concealed evidence of sexual harassment personally - it would seem outrageous that a person who has never been involved with sexual harassment, much less a female prime minister, should lose her premiership over the actions of men for which she has no responsibility.People might say she knew these things took place but she is no more no less responsible for that than anyone senior who works in Westminster.Gordon Brown didn't resign over expenses, despite being PM at the time, because his reputation was beyond reproach.May should be held no more culpable than he was.Politically, it struck me that far from having to resign, May had the potential to emerge from this morass much strengthened.Image: Gavin Williamson was named the new Defence Secretary Many of her key rivals might become mortally wounded by this crisis.And many MPs, otherwise despairing of May's overall performance, might have been counting their lucky stars that although she might need the odd cough sweet to get through a speech, they have her after all.Imagine if they'd opted for last year's leadership candidate Stephen Crabb, who recently had to apologise for sending "explicit" texts to a 19-year-old woman.A sexual scandal at 10 Downing Street's door.But in this one move, May has been drawn into the morass.Williamson and the PM had already come in for some criticism for not doing more to crack down on the misbehaviour and reveal what they knew.:: Fallon accuser hits back at resignation Video: Fallon's resignation 'insane, absurd and ridiculous' Now that focus will become much, much sharper: What did Williamson know?Had anyone approached him with accusations and what did he do about it?And worst case scenario: did he use the knowledge of sexual misdemeanours to exercise power over an MP in exchange for the party's help in ensuring they never became public?Every journalist in Westminster will now be working on these questions.It will be the PM's judgement in appointing him in the firing line.Politically, it is also extremely curious.May clearly wanted to reward Williamson's loyalty (he ran her leadership campaign) but to remove the Chief Whip at a time when she is trying to get Brexit legislation through Parliament during a minority government is bizarre.She didn't even make the best of it and replace Williamson with a woman - despite many Conservative MPs wanting to see the first female Tory Chief Whip.That person would have been a strong signal that the Whips' operation - and by extension the way Westminster works - had changed.Image: Mrs May is struggling to get key Brexit bills through Parliament Instead the PM appointed Julian Smith, Williamson's erstwhile deputy.Worthy appointment he may be, but hardly one which makes even the weakest of political ripples.And then there's the reaction of her backbenchers.One word: incredulity.Many MPs are astonished that a man with no departmental experience has been promoted to one of the most important Cabinet jobs.There is also anger that he appears to have removed Fallon only to effectively appoint himself.As one senior Tory backbencher texted me: "He's out of the s***storm.He knifed Fallon and pinched his job.He's never spoken at the despatch box.It's way, way above his ability."If the knives do come out for Williamson, he may find few allies to defend him.In some ways this story so far has been eminently predictable.The characters involved, the misdemeanours, the fact that post-Weinstein it happened at all has come as not much surprise to Westminster.Today was the day that changed and the runes became almost impossible to read.And for a Prime Minister one major crisis away from resignation, surprise is the last thing she needs.
Conservatives introduce measure demanding Muellers resignation:::::The move by the three lawmakers to seek Robert Muellers resignation is a sign of intensifying frustration among Trumps allies during the same week Mueller issued his first indictments in the probe.| Alex Wong/Getty Images Conservatives introduce measure demanding Muellers resignation Its the latest sign of GOP resistance to the special counsels Russia probe.Three House Republicans on Friday moved to pressure Special Counsel Robert Mueller to resign over what they contend are obvious conflicts of interest, the latest instance of rising GOP resistance to his Russia probe.Reps. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.) and Louie Gohmert (R-Texas), introduced a measure that, while nonbinding, would put the House on record describing Mueller, a former FBI director, as unfit to lead the probe because of his relationship with James Comey, his successor at the bureau.Story Continued Below [B]e it Resolved, That House of Representatives expresses its sense that Robert Mueller is compromised and should resign from his special counsel position immediately, the resolution states.Mueller is investigating whether any Americans aided Russias interference in the 2016 presidential election as well as whether figures in the Trump administration may have obstructed justice in part by moving to oust Comey in May, when the FBIs Russia investigation was picking up steam.Mueller was appointed by deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein after an uproar following President Donald Trumps decision to fire Comey.The most reliable politics newsletter.Sign up for POLITICO Playbook and get the latest news, every morning in your inbox.Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.You can unsubscribe at any time.The move by the three lawmakers to seek Muellers resignation is a sign of intensifying frustration among Trumps allies during the same week Mueller issued his first indictments in the probe: money laundering charges against former Trump campaign manager Paul Manager and his deputy Rick Gates.Mueller also secured a guilty plea from George Papadopoulos, a low-level campaign foreign policy adviser, who lied to the FBI about his attempts to arrange a meeting between Russian officials and the Trump campaign.The anger from Republicans appears to mirror the feelings of Trump, who on Friday unloaded in a series of tweets urging his own Justice Department to investigate Democrats not him for transgressions he says occurred during the 2016 election."This is real collusion and dishonesty.Major violation of Campaign Finance Laws and Money Laundering," he said, accusing Democrats of the same charges that Manafort was hit with."[W]here is our Justice Department?Most Republicans, including those in GOP leadership, are not on board with dismissing Mueller.But the conservative push has worried some on the left, who are urging Democratic lawmakers to step up their defense of Mueller.While it might be ideal to wait to speak out until Mueller finishes his investigation, Trumps defenders in Congress are not waiting to defend the Presidents actions or to pass judgment on the investigation, CAP Action Fund wrote in a memo being prepared for lawmakers and obtained by POLITICO.The heightened risk to Trump from Muellers investigation also means there is a heightened risk to the Mueller investigation from Trump.Other conservatives, like Reps. Trent Franks (R-Ariz.) and Ron DeSantis (R-Fla.), have already called for Muellers departure.DeSantis, too, has ramped up his efforts to hinder Muellers investigation.He recently pushed an amendment, which failed to gain traction, that would have curtailed Muellers probe within six months and limited its scope.And in a Thursday interview with Breitbart Radio, DeSantis blamed Rosenstein for a clumsy decision to appoint Mueller without putting strict limits on his scope.Rosenstein really muffed this, he said.Breitbart News editor Alex Marlow, who interviewed DeSantis, promised to give his proposal a lot of airtime and ink.Were going to be pushing it heavily or at least content on it heavily, he said.In his interview, DeSantis also foreshadowed the end of the House Intelligence Committees separate investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election.The good news on the congressional side, at least in the House, is from what I understand, theyve really increased the frequency of the interviews of the people and I think on the House side this Russia-Trump [probe] is going to come to an end soon, he said.DeSantis isnt on the intelligence panel but said talking to committee members, hes convinced itll be done certainly before the end of the year.He also said hes been urging Speaker Paul Ryan to curtail the House investigation.I said, Mr. Speaker, weve been spinning these wheels.Theres no evidence.If there is, produce it.I think wed all like to see it.But if not, then weve got to get on with our business, adding, I think that message has been received.While the new resolution faults Mueller for leading the probe despite his professional relationship with Comey, it also includes a broader broadside against the FBI.The three lawmakers say the agency should be investigated for willful blindness over a seven-year-old sale of uranium production facilities to Russian interests, which conservatives have argued was approved in part by the Hillary Clinton-led State Department at the same time a party to the deal was making donations to the Clinton Foundation.Mueller, they note, was presiding over the FBI at the time the agency was investigating a Russian bribery and extortion scheme connected to the uranium deal, but the agency declined to notify Congress of its investigation and prevented a confidential informant from notifying lawmakers.Any thorough and honest investigation into the corruption of American-uranium related business must include investigating the willful blindness of the FBI and its leaders, according to the resolution.
Warren to Trump: 'I understand your desperation to change the subject':::::Sen. Elizabeth Warren acknowledged that the Democratic Party apparatus shouldnt play favorites.| John Shinkle/POLITICO Warren to Trump: 'I understand your desperation to change the subject' Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren fired back at Donald Trump on Friday, insisting the president called her Pocahontas in a desperate attempt to change the subject.The president seized on Warrens Thursday comment to CNN that yes, she agrees the 2016 Democratic primary was rigged, as former interim Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Donna Brazile suggested in a published excerpt of her upcoming book.Story Continued Below Pocahontas just stated that the Democrats, lead [sic] by the legendary Crooked Hillary Clinton, rigged the Primaries!Trump tweeted Friday morning.Lets go FBI & Justice Dept.The tweet was among a series of posts nudging the Justice Department to probe Hillary Clinton and the Democrats.People are angry, he said in one post, adding that DOJ and the FBI must eventually do what is right and proper.The American public deserves it!he exclaimed.Sign up here for POLITICO Huddle A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.You can unsubscribe at any time.I understand your desperation to change the subject, @realDonaldTrump.Your campaign mgr was just indicted for conspiracy against the US, Warren said, referring to special counsel Robert Muellers indictment of former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and his deputy, Rick Gates.You might think your tweets are cute, @realDonaldTrump, but they wont stop Mueller's investigation or keep your people out of jail, she continued.Warren acknowledged that the Democratic Party apparatus shouldnt play favorites.But thats a whole lot different from illegally conspiring with Russia, she contended.The FBI knows the difference.Slurs, lies & trash talk wont stop the FBI from doing its job.This isn't a dictatorship.It's our democracy.And it's stronger than you.
Conservatives push to repeal Obamacare mandate in tax package:::::Despite a public push last week by Sens.Tom Cotton (pictured) and Ron Johnson to include repeal of the mandate in the tax package, tax bill writers didn't include that in the measure released Thursday.| Zach Gibson/Getty Images Conservatives push to repeal Obamacare mandate in tax package Conservatives are attempting to revive efforts to gut Obamacares individual mandate as part of the Republican overhaul of the tax code.Despite a public push last week by Sens.Tom Cotton (R-Ark.)and Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) to include repeal of the mandate in the tax package, tax bill writers didn't include that in the measure released Thursday.But POLITICO Playbook reports there may be new momentum for adding the repeal into the bill.Story Continued Below Cotton and Johnson have been joined by conservative stalwarts like Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and House Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows (R-N.C.).President Donald Trump also indicated his approval of using the tax vehicle to scrap the mandate this week.Wouldn't it be great to Repeal the very unfair and unpopular Individual Mandate in ObamaCare and use those savings for further Tax Cuts, he wrote on Twitter Wednesday.POLITICO Pulse newsletter Get the latest on the health care fight, every weekday morning in your inbox.Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.You can unsubscribe at any time.But there are formidable political obstacles.Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), chairman of the Finance Committee, has expressed skepticism about muddying tax reform by pulling in the toxic politics of Obamacare.Similarly, House Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady poured cold water on the idea earlier this week.What I dont want to do is to add things that could again kill tax reform like health care died over there, Brady said in an interview with conservative talk show host Hugh Hewitt.Repealing the tax penalty for failing to obtain insurance is potentially attractive because it would save nearly $400 billion in spending on Obamacare tax credits over a decade.Its also consistently polled as the most unpopular provision of Obamacare.But the Congressional Budget Office estimates that 15 million more individuals would be uninsured in 2026 if the mandate is repealed.
Senate littered with tax reform land mines:::::The fanfare surrounding the House GOP tax plan on Thursday masked a brewing storm in the other chamber.Senate Republicans will have to sway a host of GOP swing votes as they try to jam through their own tax overhaul with almost no margin for error.Fiscal hawks are squawking about how tax legislation could balloon the deficit.Moderates like Sen. Susan Collins of Maine are worried tax cuts will disproportionately favor the rich.Even an Obamacare-related row could bubble up and trip up passage.Story Continued Below While a small handful of Democrats might get on board, its more likely Republicans will have to go it alone meaning they can lose just two GOP votes before their tax bill tanks.Heres a look at the groups of Republican senators that Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and the Senates chief tax writers will have to satisfy to get a bill through their chamber: The deficit hawks: Bob Corker, John McCain, Jeff Flake Of this trio of deficit hawks, only Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee has flatly declared that he would reject a tax bill if it added even a cent to the deficit.But Sens.John McCain and Jeff Flake two independent-minded Arizonans unafraid to buck their party are starting to make more noise about the tax bills red ink.McCain voted against the Bush tax cuts in 2001 and 2003 in part because of their impact on the deficit.The deficit went up, McCain now notes.Guess what?I was right.(McCain, to be sure, is typically less deficit-minded when it comes to the Pentagons budget.)Morning Tax Sign up for our tax policy newsletter and stay informed weekday mornings, in your inbox.Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.You can unsubscribe at any time.Newly unencumbered by reelection concerns, Flake has been increasingly warning against simply passing tax cuts though hes not prepared to reject any deficit-boosting bill just yet.He recalled how he was inundated with a flood of pushback from the alpaca lobby when he pointed out in a recent report that some taxpayers can claim alpaca as livestock for tax breaks.There is a reason for every credit, deduction, loophole in the code, Flake said.Theres a reason we havent done meaningful reform in over 30 years.And its gonna be tough, but weve got to do reform, not just tax cuts.Everything ought to be on the table."Indeed, these arent the senators who are privately lobbying the Senate Finance Committee to keep certain pet deductions.Corker stresses that tax writers need to find $4 trillion in loophole closings and make the new tax rates permanent to make a tax reform truly substantive.To do it right, you gotta cut out so many provisions that are there, Corker said.I dont want to be one of those people, like so many people who come to see us and say, 'Im all for tax reform, but this is one provision that I dont want changed,' which is everybody in the world.The moderates: Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski The death of Obamacare repeal was largely due to two moderate, vocal GOP women Collins and Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska who had also teamed up this year to oppose controversial Cabinet picks and funding for Planned Parenthood.They could prove equally influential in the coming tax fight.Collins wants any tax overhaul bill to keep the top 39.6 percent tax rate for individuals making more than $1 million a year, and she sees no need to dump the estate tax that has long been a target of other Republicans.The elimination of the state and local tax deduction, which has proved to be a big obstacle in the House, is also a concern for Collins, who called it a double taxation.Im not drawing lines in the sand, Collins said in an interview.Im trying to shape the package that comes out of the Finance Committee.The House plan released Thursday would eventually repeal the estate tax and implement lower limits for the state and local tax break.It would keep the top 39.6 percent level for individuals.For now, leadership is less concerned about Murkowski, who secured a major perk in the budget measure that set up a tax overhaul: A chance to raise cash by opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling.But Murkowskis independent streak and less-than-devout allegiance to Republican leaders they declined to back her 2010 reelection bid as a write-in after she lost the GOP primary always makes her one to watch.The perennial leadership headaches: Rand Paul and Ron Johnson Much like in the doomed Obamacare repeal debate, top Senate Republicans believe Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky is the likeliest senator to reject any iteration of tax reform because it doesnt go far enough.Indeed, Paul is throwing out aggressive proposals that are likely to complicate the delicate overhaul efforts such as enacting spending cuts to pay for lower taxes, rather than closing loopholes in the tax code.As part of the tax fight, he has also called for repealing Obamacares individual mandate an idea that has since spread to Trumps Twitter-happy fingers, but is not popular with the Senates chief tax-writers.I would prefer to stay out of the health care process because its tough enough to do a tax bill, Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch of Utah said in an interview.You add health care to it and ... it could just make it more difficult to pass the bill.Paul is also calling for a 15 percent corporate tax rate vs. the 20 percent rate in the House plan.Though to a lesser extent than Paul, Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin has shown he could be a thorn in the side of leadership, especially during the health care fight, and senior Republicans are watching him closely.In an interview, Johnson laid out simple, broad priorities for a tax plan that will grow our economy and recognizes we have to make our business tax competitive with the rest of the world.The demanding conservatives: Mike Lee, Tom Cotton, Ted Cruz Several other conservatives besides Paul aren't shy about making demands in high-profile policy fights.The Obamacare individual mandate idea is also being pushed by Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas, who has the presidents ear on a wide range of issues, including immigration and foreign policy.When asked whether he will insist that a health mandate repeal be included in a Senate tax bill, Cotton responded with a grin.Well see what the final package looks like, he said.Sen. Mike Lee of Utah is lobbying hard for an expansion in the child tax credit with Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, and has a powerful ally in Ivanka Trump.Lee and Rubio said in a statement that the House did not go far enough with that tax credit: We look forward to working with our colleagues to make sure working families are moved to the front of the line in the Senate bill.Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas has been less of a hassle for leadership lately, though he can't be ignored, either.But top Republicans seem less concerned about him mucking up their tax efforts.I believe our focus should be front and center on jobs creating jobs, creating economic growth and cutting taxes for everybody, Cruz said in an interview.I think the key objectives should be economic growth, simplicity and fairness.
House tax bill falls short of Ivanka Trump's ask on child tax credit:::::The child tax credit was strongly championed by Ivanka Trump.| Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP Photo House tax bill falls short of Ivanka Trump's ask on child tax credit Ivanka Trump doesnt always get what she wants.The House Republican tax plan unveiled on Thursday includes one of Trumps pet issues the child tax credit but expands it less generously than the White House senior adviser and first daughter had hoped.Story Continued Below Recently, Trump has been lobbying lawmakers on expanding the credit, hosting both Republicans and Democrats for private dinners at her Kalorama home and visiting a handful of Republicans on Capitol Hill.Shes wooed social conservatives to the cause by finding common ground with stalwarts like Ralph Reed and Grover Norquist in their quest to support families, and she even partnered with Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) to hammer out the policy details.Indeed, much of her thinking on the expansion of the credit was informed by a proposal that Sens.Rubio and Mike Lee (R-Utah) put forth in 2015.Yet all of this activity wasnt enough to inspire House Republican tax-writers to take up the policy details that Trump favored and expand the credit to over $2,000, as she had advocated for in private meetings.Instead, House lawmakers stuck to a plan that more closely mirrors the House Republican tax blueprint of 2016 unveiled under House Speaker Paul Ryans leadership.The most reliable politics newsletter.Sign up for POLITICO Playbook and get the latest news, every morning in your inbox.Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.You can unsubscribe at any time.The Senate has yet to unveil its tax bill, which may include the version of the child tax credit expansion Trump has been pushing.Trump had been advocating for doubling the child tax credit to at least $2,000.The Rubio and Lee version, from which she got much of her inspiration, would have increased it to $2,500 per child and made it partially refundable.It also would have delivered a more generous credit on a more frequent basis by reducing the amount of payroll taxes paid by eligible parents effectively giving them more money in each paycheck instead of simply delivering the credit once a year at tax time.A White House official said the administration was heartened by the inclusion of a child tax credit expansion and optimistic about passing a tax overhaul.We are excited that this bill is a real middle class tax cut, are encouraged by the expansion of the child tax credit, the preservation of the child independent care credit, respect the process and as the President said: We are just getting started, and there is much work left to do, the official said.Cabinet members and senior officials from the administration including Ivanka will be hitting the road in the coming weeks to continue to highlight how comprehensive tax reform will help working families.Sens.Rubio and Lee issued a joint statement, saying that they continued to hope for a more generous version of the credit.The best way to provide real relief to working families is through a straightforward, significant, and permanent expansion of the child tax credit, the statement said.We wish the House draft had done more on this frontpreferably doubling the credit to $2,000 per child and expanding its applicability to payroll taxes.We look forward to working with our colleagues to make sure working families are moved to the front of the line in the Senate bill."Under the new House tax bill, the credit would increase from $1,000 to $1,600 per child with the first $1,000 refundable.That $1,000 amount would be indexed for inflation, and a greater swath of Americans could take advantage of it because the bill raises the income thresholds.Right now, families with children under 17 can take advantage of the credit though it phases out for couples who earn more than $110,000 and single parents who earn more than $75,000.Expanding the child tax credit has historically earned bipartisan support.It was first introduced by President Bill Clinton and then last expanded under President George W. Bush.
Senate Democrats want to grill Sessions again after Papadopoulos plea deal:::::Democratic Senators like Patrick Leahy (left) and Al Franken are now scrutinizing statements by Jeff Sessions that he didn't know of any Trump campaign surrogates who communicated with individuals connected to the Russian government.| Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Senate Democrats want to grill Sessions again after Papadopoulos plea deal Sessions has not addressed the plea agreement since it was made public on Monday.Senate Democrats said Thursday they want to again grill Attorney General Jeff Sessions after new twists in the federal probe of alleged Russian ties to President Donald Trump's campaign, but a person familiar with his interactions said the former Republican senator didn't know the extent of ex-campaign adviser George Papadopoulos' conversations with Kremlin-linked individuals.Sessions faces mounting calls to clarify his testimony before the Senate since the unveiling Monday of Papadopoulas' plea deal with special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation of Russia's interference in the 2016 election.Story Continued Below Democrats are now scrutinizing the attorney general's repeated statements that he didn't know of any Trump campaign surrogates who communicated with individuals connected to the Russian government.The court documents made public on Monday revealed that Papadopoulos, a member of the campaign's national security advisory group, raised the prospect of a confab between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin during a March 2016 advisory group meeting that Sessions reportedly attended.Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) called on Sessions to return to the Senate Judiciary Committee for testimony "under oath, to explain why he cannot seem to provide truthful, complete answers to these important and relevant questions" regarding the Trump campaign's interactions with Russia.Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) issued his own request for Sessions' return, noting that Papadopoulos had told "his superiors in the campaign" about his interactions with the Russians.Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.), a Judiciary panel member who challenged Sessions on the Trump camp's Russia ties in January and again last month, fired off an eight-page letter to the attorney general on Thursday raising new questions and warning that he fears "the Senate and the American public cannot trust your word."Playbook Power Briefing Sign up for our must-read newsletter on what's driving the afternoon in Washington.Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.You can unsubscribe at any time.Sessions has not addressed the plea agreement since it was made public on Monday.But on Thursday, the person familiar with Sessions' interactions with Papadopoulos, who declined to be named, sought to clarify the attorney general's memories of the events.Regarding the March 2016 meeting, which Trump also attended, the person said: "It seems clear that the people who remember the conversation believed that Papadopoulos was proposing a prospective idea of using his 'Russian contacts' to try to set up a meeting between Trump and Putin, which was immediately rejected by then-Senator Sessions."Sessions "was unaware of any surrogates from the campaign communicating with the Russians," the source said."Not only did he not know of any such activities, but when even the idea of such a future meeting surfaced, he personally rejected it."Although Papadopoulos reportedly sat to Sessions' left at a subsequent dinner, according to The Washington Post, the source said Sessions didn't remember any further interactions.Some of the Trump campaign aides with whom Papadopoulos communicated about Russia have been identified, including Sam Clovis, who was described in the court filings by Mueller's team as a "campaign supervisor."Others, including a "senior policy adviser" to the campaign whom Papadopoulos emailed about his Russia contacts in April 2016, have not yet been named publicly.Any attempts at clarification that don't come from Sessions in person are unlikely to quiet Democratic fury over the carefully parsed phrasing of the attorney general's previous statements before the Senate."The Attorney General was already given an opportunity to correct his earlier misleading answers to me and Senator Franken in January through written, supplemental testimony," Leahy said in a statement Thursday."Yet he only continued to mislead."
Lamar Smith wont seek reelection to House:::::Rep. Lamar Smith said he will not seek reelection in 2018.| Getty Images Lamar Smith wont seek reelection to House Smiths congressional district has been solidly Republican in the past.Rep. Lamar Smith, the controversial chairman of the House Science Committee, announced Thursday that he will leave Congress when his term ends in 2018.The 16-term Texas Republican is one of the longest-serving members of the states congressional delegation, and has often tussled with academics, scientific organizations and government regulators since become Science chairman in 2013.In a letter to constituents, Smith said there were several reasons he is choosing not to seek reelection next year, including that he will complete his term as chairman of the House Science Committee.Smith said he is looking forward to spending more time with his grandchildren, and "I hope to find other ways to stay involved in politics."Story Continued Below This year, Smith has been instrumental in resurfacing old allegations about Russian efforts to fund activists opposed to oil and gas drilling, an effort critics say is designed to distract from controversy over whether any members of President Donald Trump's campaign were involved with Russia's efforts to disrupt last year's election.On Tuesday, he wrote to executives at Facebook, Twitter and Alphabet requesting information about Russian purchases of anti-fracking ads on social media platforms.Smith said he looks forward to staying busy."With over a year remaining in my term, there is still much to do," he wrote in the letter Thursday."There is legislation to enact, dozens of hearings to hold, and hundreds of votes to cast."Sign up here for POLITICO Huddle A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.You can unsubscribe at any time.During the Obama administration, officials at the National Science Foundation, the Environmental Protection Agency and the Energy Department all found themselves in Smiths cross-hairs.The 69-year-old lawmaker, who previously chaired the House Judiciary Committee, also made regular attempts to expand his committees jurisdiction over cybersecurity to launch far-reaching probes targeting the New York Federal Reserve, Healthcare.gov and the companies that provided software to Hillary Clintons email server.He antagonized the broader science community when he touted a number of NSF grants as frivolous and sought to restructure how different areas of science were funded by the federal government.Smith has also used his perch on the Science panel to undermine the Obama administrations efforts to address climate change, elevating several global warming skeptics to question the agreement among the vast majority of climate scientists that humans are the main driver of the phenomenon.Smiths 21st District, which takes in parts of Austin and San Antonio as well as rural counties to the west, has been solidly Republican in the past.Mitt Romney won nearly 60 percent of the vote there in 2012.But Trump got 52 percent to Hillary Clintons 42 percent in the district in 2016, and several Democrats saw an opportunity to challenge Smith before he announced his retirement.One Democrat, veteran Joseph Kopser, outraised Smith in the third quarter and has over $219,000 in his campaign account.The people of Texas are losing a dedicated public servant and skilled legislator, but we are confident they will select another conservative Republican like Chairman Smith who shares their values, said National Republican Congressional Committee Chairman Steve Stivers (R-Ohio).Smith' relationship with Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson, the top Democrat on the Science Committee and a fellow Texan, has been rocky for years.Both lawmakers are soft-spoken and have served together in Congress for more than two decades.But Johnson has accused Smith of bringing disrepute to our institution and turning his panel into little more than an arm of the Republican National Committee, particularly when he started issuing subpoenas in 2013, the first in 21 years.Smith has subpoenaed the EPA for health data used for clean air regulations, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration under the suspicion that a scientific paper on climate change was mishandled.Scott Bland and John Bresnahan contributed to this report.
Graham seeks 9/11-style commission on social media vulnerabilities:::::Sen. Lindsey Graham said Thursday that "were going to need legislation" in response to the Kremlin's disruption of the 2016 election, but he stopped short of endorsing a bipartisan bill in support of more disclosure of online political advertising.| Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Graham seeks 9/11-style commission on social media vulnerabilities 'It's got to be about the exposure we have as a nation.Because its the Russians today it could be somebody else tomorrow.'Sen. Lindsey Graham is courting Democratic support for a proposal to set up an independent commission that would recommend new rules for reining in the social-media presence of foreign entities in response to Russian electoral meddling.Graham said Thursday his still-nascent independent commission proposal would be modeled after the bipartisan panel created after the 9/11 terrorist attacks and would convene "experts in national security and technology to sit down and advise Congress: What kind of legal infrastructure do we need that balances privacy and national security interests?Because I think it's going to be really hard for us to come up with a consensus."Story Continued Below The South Carolina Republican's comments come after a Tuesday hearing of the Judiciary Committee subpanel he chairs at which representatives from Google, Facebook and Twitter testified that Russian-backed ad buyers continued their disruptive online efforts after President Donald Trump's election.Graham said Thursday that "were going to need legislation" in response to the Kremlin's disruption of the 2016 election, but he stopped short of endorsing a bipartisan bill from Sens.Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Mark Warner (D-Va.), and John McCain (R-Ariz.) that would set requirements for more disclosure of online political advertising, which he called "just the tip of the iceberg."Graham added that he already has reached out to Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) about the idea.Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) said in an interview that he also has talked to Graham and would be receptive to the commission proposal.Electoral cybersecurity is best tackled separately from a strictly social-media-focused commission looking at the impact of foreign and extremist entities, he said."It cant be just about the Russian hacking," Graham told reporters."It's got to be about the exposure we have as a nation.Because its the Russians today it could be somebody else tomorrow."Playbook Power Briefing Sign up for our must-read newsletter on what's driving the afternoon in Washington.Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.You can unsubscribe at any time.Gillibrand's office did not immediately return a request for comment on whether the senator is considering backing the commission idea.
House Democrats file lawsuit over access to Trump hotel documents:::::The complaint notes that President Donald Trump has refused to divest his ownership interest in the Trump Old Post Office LLC and alleges that his refusal to divest ownership interest in a company that contracts with the federal government raises numerous issues requiring congressional oversight.| Getty House Democrats file lawsuit over access to Trump hotel documents Democrats on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee on Thursday filed a lawsuit against the General Services Administration over access to documents related to President Donald Trumps Washington, D.C., hotel.Seventeen Democrats filed a complaint Thursday in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia over GSA's failure to comply with the so-called seven-member statute, which mandates federal agencies produce documents requested by any seven members of the House Oversight Committee.Story Continued Below They will say at a news conference later on Thursday that the documents they seek are necessary to determine whether Trump is using his office for private gain, the extent that the Trump International Hotel receives payments from foreign governments or officials, and information on GSA's interpretation of the lease, which bars any elected official of the U.S. government from benefiting from it.This hotel is not just a building with Donald Trumps name on it.It is a glaring symbol of the Trump administrations lack of accountability and a daily reminder of the refusal by Republicans in Congress to do their job, Elijah Cummings of Maryland, the top Democrat on the panel, will say, according to prepared remarks shared with POLITICO.This may be standard operating procedure in foreign countries but not here.Not in America.The complaint notes that Trump has refused to divest his ownership interest in the Trump Old Post Office LLC and alleges that his refusal to divest ownership interest in a company that contracts with the federal government raises numerous issues requiring congressional oversight.Democrats say GSA under the Obama administration complied with their requests for unredacted documents such as amendments to the lease, the 2017 budget estimate and monthly income statements.The most reliable politics newsletter.Sign up for POLITICO Playbook and get the latest news, every morning in your inbox.Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.You can unsubscribe at any time.The Trump White House, however, told federal agencies this summer to ignore Democrats oversight requests, a policy backed by a May 1 opinion drafted by the Justice Departments Office of Legal Counsel.Following the inauguration of President Trump, GSAs practice of honoring Seven Member Rule requests changed, but the rationale for the change has been shifting and contradictory, the complaint alleges.GSAs refusal to comply following the Presidents inauguration was a drastic departure from its position taken on January 3, 2017, and illustrates the need for Congress to conduct oversight of GSAs ability to manage a lease with the President.Cummings plans to say that only one thing has changed since GSA stopped complying: President Trump is now sitting in the Oval Office.The suit, according to his planned remarks, is not about the hotel but about the president defying a federal statute and denying our ability as members of Congress to fulfill our constitutional duty to act as a check on the executive branch.We regret that we have to go to court to obtain these basic documents, which are clearly within our committees jurisdiction, Cummings will say, blaming Republicans, including House Oversight Committee Chairman Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.), for aiding and abetting what he called Trumps ongoing abuses.Republicans are essentially walling off President Trump from credible congressional oversight.The Trump administration has 60 days to respond to the Democrats suit.Democrats say the court could order GSA to produce the documents theyve requested, hold GSA in contempt if it refuses or impose penalties against acting GSA Administrator Timothy Horne.
McCain: 'We are going through a period of turmoil politically':::::McCain: 'We are going through a period of turmoil politically' The senator adds: 'Theres no reason to attack Republicans.Weve got enough people to attack them.'The current social and political climate in the U.S. is akin to the 1930s, Sen. John McCain said in an interview broadcast Thursday morning, likening the nations current status to that of the years leading up to World War II.We are going through a period of turmoil politically, obviously.We are seeing in many ways, the 1930s: the isolationism, the America-firsters, McCain (R-Ariz.) told NBCs Tom Brokaw on the networks Today show.Now, maybe some of the causes are different, but the fact is we are seeing the United States become much more insular and inward.Story Continued Below While the two men are both Republicans, the policies advocated by McCain have often clashed with those backed by President Donald Trump, who won the White House on an America first platform that has translated into a dramatic shift of the U.S. presence on the world stage.McCain, the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, has long been considered one of the Senates top hawks and has long advocated for the U.S. to be a major player in world affairs.McCain told Brokaw that the role of the press is more important than ever before, a seeming rebuke of the presidents regular attacks against the media, which he believes covers him unfairly.I hate the press, OK?But the fact is, without a free press in this country, a pillar of democracy is destroyed, the senator said.The conflict between Trump and McCain has at times become personal, with the Arizona senator suggesting during last years campaign that the president had encouraged the crazies of his state and Trump retorting that McCain was not a war hero because he had been a POW during the Vietnam War, and I like people who werent captured.Asked what advice he would give the president, McCain reiterated that Trump should stop tweeting but added that he would also tell the president, look, theres no reason to attack Republicans.Weve got enough people to attack them.

Vanity Fair: Trump blaming Kushner for Mueller investigation:::::President Trump is reportedly blaming White House adviser Jared Kushner for his role in decisions that led to the appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller, according to a new report by Vanity Fair.In a call Tuesday to former White House chief strategist Stephen Bannon, Trump put blame on Kushner for the part he took in choices to fire former national security adviser Michael Flynn and former FBI director James Comey, Vanity Fair reported.Roger Stone, a longtime Trump ally, also recently said Kushner wasn't giving Trump good advice a sentiment which Trump reportedly agreed with, according to someone familiar with the conversation.ADVERTISEMENT Sam Nunberg, a former campaign aide to President Trump who was fired, echoed the statement.Jared is the worst political adviser in the White House in modern history, Nunberg said.Im only saying publicly what everyone says behind the scenes at Fox News, in conservative media, and the Senate and Congress."Trump has also reportedly complained about Mueller's investigation being allowed to continue.Trump has repeatedly lashed out on Twitter over the appointment of a special counsel to probe Russia's election meddling and the possibility that Trump campaign staff colluded with the Kremlin.On Monday, his former campaign chairman Paul Manafort was charged with nine counts, including conspiracy against the United States and money laundering relating to his work for a pro-Russia political party in Ukraine.His longtime deputy, Richard Gates, was charged as well.Both pleaded not guilty.Trump on Monday insisted his team did not collude with Russia, adding that alleged crimes committed by Manafort occurred "years ago."
Impeachment calls grow louder:::::The Democratic effort to impeach President Trump is set to expand but not everyone in the party is cheering.A group of Democrats will file new articles of impeachment against the president this month, according to Rep. Luis Gutirrez (D-Ill.), whos supporting the push.But the campaign is sure to prove a headache for Democratic leaders, who have ventured all year to tamp down rank-and-file attempts to oust the president amid concerns that theyll undermine efforts to win back the House.The Democrats had hinged their 2016 elections strategy on attacking Trump, which proved unsuccessful, and leaders are hoping to focus their 2018 message on the economy rather than the turmoil surrounding the White House.ADVERTISEMENT But not all Democrats are on board.And Gutirrez said the latest set of impeachment articles will arrive before Thanksgiving.It is clear to us that he is unfit to be president of the United States of America, Gutirrez said.Gutirrez, one of Trumps sharpest critics, declined to specify what grounds the articles will cite, saying only that the Democrats are working with constitutional scholars to solidify their case.I assure you we will not leave you lacking for reason, he said.Its also unclear which Democrats will join Gutirrez in the effort, though Rep. Steve Cohen Stephen (Steve) Ira CohenDem lawmaker: One Republican is considering articles of impeachment against Trump Dems seek to establish flight legroom minimums GOP forms task force to challenge Obama's 'executive overreach' MORE (D-Tenn.) has been named as one possibility.Cohen in August announced his intent to introduce impeachment articles, citing Trumps defense of the white supremacists who participated in a deadly rally in Charlottesville, Va., that month.Cohens office declined to comment Wednesday.Democratic leaders have sought throughout the year to discourage impeachment efforts against Trump, fearing it could politicize the investigations into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election, including possible collusion between Moscow and the Trump campaign.Behind House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), top Democrats are awaiting the outcome of those probes, particularly the one being conducted by Robert Mueller, the special prosecutor appointed by the Justice Department in May.It is not, obviously, off the table at some time in the future, but is premature at this point in time, Rep.

The DNC owes Bernie Sanders and all Dems an apology:::::It turns out, according to a shocking new book by former Democratic National Committee interim Chairwoman Donna Brazile, that the fix was in all along.The DNC had a secret deal with the Clinton campaign that made a mockery of the notion that the national party organization should be neutral in presidential primaries.It also turns out that from the day that Donald Trump Donald John TrumpIntel Dem: Whats in dossier more important than who paid for it Overnight Tech: Twitter bans ads from Russian media | Dem says she was targeted by Russian bot | House Judiciary to hold hearing on net neutrality Democrats dig for Russian connection and uncover environmentalists MORE was elected until now, the DNC has been guilty of gross negligence and incompetence that has shortchanged Democrats in every state and left the DNC lagging pathetically behind the Republican National Committee at one of the most important political moments in decades.The DNC owes Bernie Sanders Bernard (Bernie) SandersGOP seizes on new Clinton revelation Overnight Health Care: Judge won't force Trump to make ObamaCare payments | CBO says bipartisan health bill would reduce deficit by B | Trump won't set ObamaCare sign-up goal Frustrated with Trump, Dems introduce drug pricing bill MORE and his supporters an apology if it signed a secret deal in 2015 that sought to fix the 2016 nominating process.ADVERTISEMENT The DNC owes every Democrat and party candidates in every state an apology for failing to mobilize Democrats and better support Democratic candidates during an epic political struggle that will have gigantic impact on the nation after the 2018 midterm elections.Whatever the DNC does in the coming months, a wave of small progressive donors and large donors from Hollywood who support enlightened candidates and causes should engage in massive fundraising and organizing to elect Democrats especially the highly regarded Democratic nominee to win the open Senate seat in Alabama, Doug Jones, against the horrifically far-right extremist, GOP nominee Roy Moore.The DNC should bring in a major new player with a proven record of party building, such as former DNC Chairman Howard Dean, to lead a powerful march to the 2018 midterms.It is immaterial whether anyone currently at the DNC stays or leaves.What matters is that someone like Dean, who was a superb chair of the DNC committed to party building in all 50 states, essentially becomes the DNC czar and is tasked with winning control of the House and Senate in the 2018 midterms.According to the new book by Brazile, excerpted in Politico, President Obama and his campaign had left the DNC with massive debt after the 2012 campaign, and in August 2015, almost a year before the 2016 Democratic National Convention, the DNC signed a secret deal with the Clinton campaign that gave Clinton virtual ownership over the DNC in return for raising money to pay off the debt.In other words, regarding the Democratic National Committee that should represent all Democrats equally and treat all candidates equally throughout presidential primaries, the fix was in before the 2016 primaries had even begun.Two points are key: First, the DNC has for some time been so incompetent and ineffective that any DNC-Clinton deal probably did not make much difference in the 2016 primaries.Second, and more importantly, this DNC-Clinton deal, if it happened as Brazile suggests, was a disgraceful and unethical venture that violated a core principle of the DNC: that it should be neutral in presidential primaries between competing candidates.The fiasco surrounding the inept DNC continues today.After Trump was elected, there has been a national wave of opposition and resistance that should have yielded a bonanza of fundraising by the DNC, helping Democratic initiatives across the land.It did not.Instead, throughout 2017, the DNC has lagged light years behind the Republican National Committee in fundraising, in cash on hand and in impact on national politics.By contrast, the Sanders-affiliated group, Our Revolution, has been mobilizing grass-roots workers and small-donor fundraising behind progressive causes and candidates.Our Revolution is focused, principled and fighting trim, while the DNC is backward, incompetent and largely irrelevant in the great battle unfolding in the U.S. between the dark politics of President Trump and Americans working to bring about a post-Trump nation.For this, the DNC owes every Democrat across the nation a sweeping, comprehensive and humble apology.Democrats must no longer tolerate the ineptitude and irrelevance of the DNC and must demand dramatic changes, including and especially bringing in a major player such as Howard Dean to spearhead a national party campaign to end the one-party Republican control of the House and Senate.Regardless of the shenanigans of Washington-based Democrats at the DNC, the vast and powerful progressive base should move in overdrive, as it has already begun to do, in support of candidates such as Doug Jones in Alabama and Rep.

Winners and losers in the Republican tax bill:::::Not everyone benefits equally from the tax legislation that House Republicans unveiled Thursday.GOP leaders toiled for weeks to decide what deductions and tax breaks should be axed to pay for the tax cuts.That means the bill creates some winners and some losers.Republicans say their plan will simplify the code and provide tax relief to middle-class families.Speaker Paul Ryan Paul RyanBudget vote raises red flag for GOP on tax reform Dems yearn for days of GOP deficit hawks Ryan: FBI will hand over documents related to Trump-Russia dossier MORE (R-Wis.) repeatedly touted an example on Thursday of how a family of four earning the median American household income of $59,000 would save $1,182 a year on their taxes, using the proposed doubled standard deduction, reduced tax rate and expanded child tax credits.But Democrats argue that most of the benefits of the GOP tax proposal will flow to the ultra-wealthy and corporations.Heres a look at who stands to gain and who stands to lose out.Winners Corporations Corporations would get a big tax cut from the GOPs proposal.The corporate tax rate would go down from the current rate of 35 percent to 20 percent.Republicans say its imperative to lower the U.S. corporate tax rate, the highest among other advanced countries, to attract more businesses.Companies would also be allowed to deduct the full costs of buying new equipment for five years.And businesses that had been keeping profits overseas to avoid the 35 percent tax rate would be able to bring the money back, or repatriate, to the U.S., and pay only a 12 percent tax for cash assets.The Business Roundtable, a group of CEOs, threw its support behind the tax plan.While the tax-reform bill released today deserves close analysis, it is significant progress toward achieving these goals, said Jamie Dimon, chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase & Co. and chairman of Business Roundtable.Major business groups Leaders in the business community have been pushing tax reform for years, and they generally liked what they saw.Key players, such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers, spoke positively of the bill.They back provisions to lower rates for businesses, to move to a territorial tax system that exempts dividends from companies foreign subsidiaries, and to enhance expensing of capital investments.This is absolutely a positive first step, said Caroline Harris, vice president of tax policy at the Chamber.While most large business groups praised the bill, there was a notable exception.The National Federation of Independent Business said it couldnt support the bill in its current form because it doesnt help small businesses enough.Super-wealthy individuals Republicans kept the top tax rate in place, but the country's wealthiest individuals have a lot to gain from the bill.First off, the income tax bracket thresholds increase, which will accrue savings at the top.Second, the bill would double the limit on the estate tax, and then phase it out altogether.Currently, the estate tax only applies to estates of $5.5 million or more, and twice that for couples.The bill would immediately double that, giving tax shelter to anyone with an estate between $5.5 million and $11 million (or, again, double those amounts for couples).After a few years, the tax would be eliminated altogether, meaning that the very wealthiest in the country could receive their inheritances tax-free.Third, the plan would lower the taxation rates of pass-through corporations, or S-corps, to 25 percent, allowing certain business owners to claim part of their income at the lower rate.Fourth, it would eliminate the alternative minimum tax, which was intended to create a floor on tax exemptions.Retirement savings stakeholders A number of businesses and groups in the financial industry were nervous ahead of the bills release because they had heard that lawmakers were considering significantly reducing the amount of money people could put into 401(k) retirement accounts on a pre-tax basis.However, the bill did not end up reducing the 401(k) annual contribution limits.President Trump advocated for keeping 401(k)s as they are.The proposal released today is good news for millions of middle-class families across the nation, said the Save Our Savings Coalition, which includes AARP, Financial Services Roundtable and TIAA.Under this plan, American workers, families, and retirees will continue to have the freedom to choose the savings vehicle that best suits their needs.Advocates of repealing the Johnson Amendment Many conservatives have been pushing for repeal of the Johnson Amendment a 1954 measure that prohibits houses of worship and other tax-exempt 501(c)(3) organizations from endorsing or opposing political candidates.Opponents of the amendment believe it infringes on churches First Amendment rights and has a chilling effect on religious leaders who might fear retribution from the IRS.The bill would allow religious institutions to engage in political activity as long as the speech is in the entitys ordinary course of business and the expenses are minimal.Losers Blue states Americans in urban and typically Democratic-leaning areas would end up helping foot the bill for the GOPs proposed tax cuts.The GOP plan would eliminate the state and local tax deduction, which is taken by many people in high-tax, populous states to avoid double taxation.The bill would allow people to still deduct up to $10,000 on local property taxes, but Republicans from states like New York and New Jersey say thats not enough to win their votes.Then theres the bills proposal to cap the mortgage home interest deduction for loans up to $500,000, down from the current limit of $1 million.The new rule would only apply to new mortgages taken out after the bills enactment.While $500,000 might seem high, it wont get taxpayers very far in expensive cities like New York, San Francisco or Washington, D.C., and their surrounding suburbs.The median home value in Washington, for example, is $538,700, according to real estate tracker Zillow.In San Francisco, its $1.2 million.When you get into states like New Jersey and New York, it doesnt take that much to get into a home of that cost, said Rep. Tom MacArthur (R-N.J.), who wants the cap to be higher than $500,000.The bill would also eliminate the ability to issue several types of tax-advantaged bonds, including some types of bonds that help finance low-income housing and infrastructure.Budget deficit Debt watchdogs were not happy with the proposal, which can add up to $1.5 trillion to the debt over a decade."Passing a bill to our kids is not the right way to pass a bill.This legislation is an example of fiscal irresponsibility, said Peterson Foundation President Michael A. Peterson.The bill, he argued, included arbitrary phase-ins and expirations designed to mask the bills true costs.The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budgets President Maya MacGuineas noted that the additional debt amounted to almost $12,000 per household.Given the huge unpaid-for gap remaining, this plan does not constitute true comprehensive, revenue-neutral and pro-growth reform, she said.Homeowners Homebuilders and real estate agents said the tax reform plan would probably lead to a drop in home values and a tax increase on middle-class homeowners.The proposed legislation would cap the deduction at $500,000 for new home purchases, a drop from $1 million in current law.The tax deduction is viewed as a key incentive to encourage home buying.The bill eviscerates existing housing tax benefits by drastically reducing the number of homeowners who can take advantage of mortgage interest and property tax incentives, said Granger MacDonald, chairman of the National Association of Home Builders.Homes sold before implementation of any new tax law will keep the higher deduction.Homebuilder stock took a hit after the release of the bill Thursday.And realtors said they would oppose the plan because of the provisions.Tax hikes and falling home prices are a one-two punch that homeowners simply cant afford, said William E. Brown, president of the National Association of Realtors.Nonprofits The bill maintains the deduction for charitable contributions.However, the number of people who would claim the deduction would be reduced, since the measure also nearly doubles the standard deduction.Many nonprofits also oppose scaling back the Johnson Amendment, arguing that doing so would politicize charitable organizations.The tax reform bill unveiled today by the House Ways and Means Committee would tragically undermine the ability of certain charitable nonprofits to serve our countrys people and communities, said Tim Delaney, president and CEO of the National Council of Nonprofits.Universities The tax bill would add a new tax on universities with big endowments.Colleges and universities that have endowments equivalent to $100,000 per student or more will have to pay a new 1.4 percent tax on endowment income.Universities build their endowments from donations that are tax deductible.The plan would also put limitations on certain donations, such as those attached to sporting events.Imposing an excise tax on nonprofit private university endowments is a short-sighted move that will only harm students and their families, said Association of American Universities President Mary Sue Coleman.The bill would also eliminate the interest deduction on student loans, which affects about a third of Americans with student debt.Eliminating employer-provided educational assistance, the student loan interest deduction, and other critical higher education tax provisions is counterproductive as it undermines the very workforce Congress seeks to support, Coleman said.

Uranium One deal led to some exports to Europe, memos show:::::After the Obama administration approved the sale of a Canadian mining company with significant U.S. uranium reserves to a firm owned by Russias government, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission assured Congress and the public the new owners couldnt export any raw nuclear fuel from Americas shores.No uranium produced at either facility may be exported, the NRC declared in a November 2010 press release that announced that ARMZ, a subsidiary of the Russian state-owned Rosatom, had been approved to take ownership of the Uranium One mining firm and its American assets.A year later, the nuclear regulator repeated the assurance in a letter to Sen. John Barrasso John Anthony BarrassoGOP senators ask Trump for meeting on biofuels mandate Senate panel advances Trump's controversial EPA chemical pick Bannon: Our movement will defeat you in primaries or force you to retire MORE, a Wyoming Republican in whose state Uranium One operated mines.ADVERTISEMENT Neither Uranium One Inc. nor AMRZ holds a specific NRC export license.In order to export uranium from the United States, Uranium One Inc. or ARMZ would need to apply for and obtain a specific NRC license authorizing the exports of uranium for use in reactor fuel, then-NRC Chairman Gregory Jaczko wrote to Barrasso.The NRC never issued an export license to the Russian firm, a fact so engrained in the narrative of the Uranium One controversy that it showed up in The Washington Posts official fact-checker site this week.We have noted repeatedly that extracted uranium could not be exported by Russia without a license, which Rosatom does not have, the Post reported on Monday, linking to the 2011 Barrasso letter.Yet NRC memos reviewed by The Hill show that it did approve the shipment of yellowcake uranium the raw material used to make nuclear fuel and weapons from the Russian-owned mines in the United States to Canada in 2012 through a third party.Later, the Obama administration approved some of that uranium going all the way to Europe, government documents show.NRC officials said they could not disclose the total amount of uranium that Uranium One exported because the information is proprietary.They did, however, say that the shipments only lasted from 2012 to 2014 and that they are unaware of any exports since then.NRC officials told The Hill that Uranium One exports flowed from Wyoming to Canada and on to Europe between 2012 and 2014, and the approval involved a process with multiple agencies.Rather than give Rosatom a direct export license which would have raised red flags inside a Congress already suspicious of the deal the NRC in 2012 authorized an amendment to an existing export license for a Paducah, Ky.-based trucking firm called RSB Logistics Services Inc. to simply add Uranium One to the list of clients whose uranium it could move to Canada.The license, reviewed by The Hill, is dated March 16, 2012, and it increased the amount of uranium ore concentrate that RSB Logistics could ship to the Cameco Corp. plant in Ontario from 7,500,000 kilograms to 12,000,000 kilograms and added Uranium One to the other parties to Export.The move escaped notice in Congress.Officials at RSB, Cameco and Rosatom did not return repeated phone calls or emails seeking comment.Uranium One's American arm, however, emailed a statement to The Hill on Wednesday evening confirming it did export uranium to Canada through the trucking firm and that 25 percent of that nuclear fuel eventually made its way outside North America to Europe and Asia, stressing all the exports complied with federal law.None of the US U308 product produced to date has been sold to non-US customers except for approximately 25% which was sold via book transfer at the conversion facilities to customers from Western Europe and Asia," executive Donna Wickers said.Any physical export of the product from conversion facilities to non-US destinations is under the control of such customers and subject to NRC regulation.The United States actually imports the majority of the uranium it uses as fuel.In 2016, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, 24 percent of the imports came from Kazakhstan and 14 percent came from Russia.The sale of Uranium One to a Russian state-owned firm, however, has created political waves that have led to multiple congressional investigations.Republicans say they want to learn how the sale could have been approved and whether there was political interference.The more that surfaces about this deal, the more questions it raises," Sen. Chuck Grassley Charles (Chuck) Ernest GrassleyTrump talks NAFTA withdrawal with GOP senators Fractures emerging on Senate panel's Russia probe The Hill's 12:30 Report MORE (R-Iowa) said in a statement released after this story was published.Grassley, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, has launched an investigation into Uranium One."It now appears that despite pledges to the contrary, U.S. uranium made its way overseas as a part of the Uranium One deal," Grassley said in the statement."Whats more disturbing, those transactions were apparently made possible by various Obama Administration agencies while the Democrat-controlled Congress turned a blind eye.Americans deserve assurances that political influence was not a factor in all this.Im increasingly convinced that a special counsel someone with no prior involvement in any of these deals should shine a light on this ordeal and get answers for the American people.Government officials told The Hill that the NRC was able to amend the export license affecting Uranium One because of two other decisions previously made by the Obama administration as part of a Russian reset in President Obamas first term.First, Obama reinstated a U.S.-Russia civilian nuclear energy cooperation agreement.President George W. Bush had signed the agreement in 2008, but withdrew from it before it could take effect after Russia became involved in a military conflict with the former Soviet republic of Georgia, a U.S. ally, and after new concerns surfaced that Moscow was secretly aiding Irans nuclear weapons ambitions.Obama re-submitted the agreement for approval by the Democrat-controlled Congress in May 2010, declaring Russia should be viewed as a friendly partner under Section 123 the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 after agreeing to a new nuclear weapons reduction deal and helping the U.S. with Iran.I have concluded: (1) that the situation in Georgia need no longer be considered an obstacle to proceeding with the proposed Agreement; and (2) that the level and scope of U.S.-Russia cooperation on Iran are sufficient to justify resubmitting the proposed agreement to the Congress, Obama said in a statement sent to Congress.Congress took no action, which allowed the deal to become effective 90 days later.The other step that allowed uranium from the Russian-controlled mines in the United States to be exported came in 2011, when the Commerce Department removed Rosatom, Uranium Ones owner, from a list of restricted companies that could not export nuclear or other sensitive materials or technologies without special approval under the Export Administration Regulations.This final rule removes the Federal Atomic Power of Russia (Rusatom) now known as the Russian State Corporation of Atomic Energy (Rosatom), the Commerce Departments Bureau of Industry and Security declared in a May 24, 2011, notice in the Federal Register that created few waves.Rosatom had been on the list for a long time, so long in fact that it was still listed in the federal database under its old name, Rusatom.Officials said the effort to remove the Russian nuclear firm was a policy decision driven by the State Department, Energy Department, Commerce Department and other agencies with Russia portfolios designed to recognize that bilateral relations between Russia and the United States had improved slightly.Nine months after Rosatom was removed from the export restrictions list, the NRC issued its license amendment to the trucking firm in March 2012 that cleared the way for Uranium One exports, making it effective for nearly five years, to the end of 2017.But the NRC also stipulated that Uranium Ones uranium should be returned to the United States.The uranium authorized for export is to be returned to the United States, the NRC instructed in the export license amendment.But that, too, didnt happen.Officials told The Hill that the Energy Department subsequently gave approval for some of the American fuel to depart Canada and be exported to European enrichment centers, according to a 2015 letter the NRC sent to Rep. Pete Visclosky (D-Ind.).The NRC explained to Visclosky that it had originally stipulated that after the American uranium was treated in Canada, it had to then return the uranium to the U.S. for further processing.That license stated that the Canadian Government needed to obtain prior approval before any of the U.S. material could be transferred to any country other than the U.S., the letter added.Subsequently the U.S. Department of Energy granted approval for some re-transfers of U.S. uranium from the Canadian conversion facilities to European enrichment plants.The NRC added, however, it did not believe any of the American uranium made its way directly to Russia.And it added that the whole supply chain scenario was made possible by the resubmission of Obamas Section 123 agreement in 2010.The transfer of the U.S.-supplied uranium from Canada to Europe noted above also was subject to applicable Section 123 agreements, the NRC noted.Section 123 is the part of the Atomic Energy Act that allows for the U.S. to share civilian nuclear technology and goods with allies.The Uranium One deal has been controversial since at least 2015, when The New York Times reported former President Bill Clinton Bill ClintonJohn Lewis to Clinton: 'Happy Birthday, Madame President' Bill Clinton: NJ GOP nominee trying to scare voters into going to the polls The Hill's 12:30 Report MORE received a $500,000 speech fee from a Russian bank and millions in donations to his charitable foundation from sources interested in the deal around the time the Uranium One sale was being reviewed by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonBlumenthal: Trump-tied data firm reaching out to WikiLeaks significant Tillerson eliminates key State Department sanctions office: report Intel Dem: Whats in dossier more important than who paid for it MOREs State Department and eight other federal agencies.Hillary Clinton has said she delegated the approval decision to a deputy on the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) and did not apply any pressure.Bill Clinton has said the monies he received had no bearing on his wifes policymaking decisions.The 2015 Times article included a single reference to Uranium One officials saying they believed some of its American uranium made its way to Europe and Japan without any reference to how that occurred.NRC officials said the multiple decisions documented in the memos, including the 2012 amendment of the third-party export license, provide the most complete description to date of how Russian-owned uranium ended up getting exported from the United States.The entire Uranium One episode is getting a fresh look after The Hill disclosed late last month that the FBI had gathered extensive evidence in 2009 before the mine sale was approved that Rosatoms main executive in the United States was engaged in a racketeering scheme that included bribery, kickbacks, extortion and money laundering.The probe was enabled by an undercover informant working for the FBI inside the Russian nuclear industry, court records show.But the Justice Department did not make that evidence public until 2014, long after Rosatom benefited from multiple favorable decisions from the Obama administration.The Senate Judiciary, House Intelligence and House Oversight committees have all announced plans to investigate the new revelation, and the Justice Department has given approval for the undercover informant to testify for the first time about what he witnessed the Russians doing to influence Obama administration decisions favorable to Rosatom between 2009 and 2014.Hillary Clinton and other Democrats have described the renewed focus on the Uranium One deal as simply a distraction from the current investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, in which Donald Trump Donald John TrumpIntel Dem: Whats in dossier more important than who paid for it Overnight Tech: Twitter bans ads from Russian media | Dem says she was targeted by Russian bot | House Judiciary to hold hearing on net neutrality Democrats dig for Russian connection and uncover environmentalists MORE became the 45th president.She also says that concerns about the Uranium One sale have long ago been debunked.But its not just Republicans who have said that the revelation the FBI had evidence that Rosatom was engaged in criminality during the time it was receiving favorable decisions from the U.S. government deserves fresh scrutiny.Sen.

Sanders supporters see vindication in Brazile's DNC revelations:::::Former Democratic National Committee (DNC) chairwoman Donna Braziles accusations that the party favored Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonBlumenthal: Trump-tied data firm reaching out to WikiLeaks significant Tillerson eliminates key State Department sanctions office: report Intel Dem: Whats in dossier more important than who paid for it MORE during the presidential primary have reopened old divisions, frustrating supporters of Sen.

Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Fla.) to the point that it had no choice but to rely on the Hillary Clinton presidential campaigns extensive fundraising apparatus to stay afloat.Braziles allegations that the DNC was dependent on Clinton offer further proof to Sanders supporters who believe the DNC was biased against their candidate.We all knew this was happening and the denials were just ludicrous the entire Democratic Party establishment was united and aligned to do everything possible to deliver the election to Hillary Clinton, even if that meant taking unethical and corrupt steps, Jonathan Tasini, a Sanders campaign surrogate who ran against Clinton for Senate in 2006, told The Hill.Braziles most serious allegations centered on the stipulations in the Clinton campaigns joint fundraising agreement with the DNC, an August 2015 deal that allowed the campaign to combine its fundraising efforts with the broader Democratic apparatus.The existence of the agreement is not new news outlets reported on both Clinton and Sanders signing the agreements with the DNC back in 2015.Only Clinton chose to fundraise through that partnership, which opened her campaign up to allegations last year that money raised to benefit state parties was being used in ways that benefited her campaign.But Brazile claimed in the excerpt that Clintons agreement itself represented an uneven playing field.She said that the terms turned over the partys finances, strategy and staffing decisions to the candidates campaign while promising Clintons team input on other party decisions as well, months before the first primary votes were cast and almost a year before the partys convention The funding arrangement with [Clintons campaign] and the victory fund agreement was not illegal, but it sure looked unethical, Brazile wrote.If the fight had been fair, one campaign would not have control of the party before the voters had decided which one they wanted to lead.This was not a criminal act, but as I saw it, it compromised the partys integrity, she wrote.Its unclear whether Sanderss joint fundraising agreement included any language offering it a say in those internal party debates.Sanders political aides did not respond to a request for comment.The excerpt has set off yet another firestorm in the party, which has struggled to move on from the brutal primary.Even as the party seeks to move on from the divisive primary, where hacked internal party emails showed DNC aides openly lobbying for Clintons victory, repeated flare-ups have stoked the divide over the months since Election Day.Adam Green, the co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, argued in a statement that the revelations up the pressure on the partys Unity Reform Commission, a group created at last years convention to issue recommendations to help bring the party together."When it comes to fostering trust in the DNC, the entire ballgame is the Unity Reform Commission's forthcoming proposals and whether they are strong and adopted by DNC leadership, he said.After recent news, reforms should also include barring Joint Fundraising Agreements that give an advantage to one candidate over another during a primary and addressing the conflicts of interest that arise when the DNC and presidential campaigns use the same law firm," he said.Braziles allegations about Clintons sway over the party arent the only revelation in the book thats stirring up Democrats.Her depiction of a bloated DNC that struggled to stay afloat during the election cycle has given new rise to calls to investigate the partys finances.Recounting a July conversation with Clinton campaign chief financial officer Gary Gensler just days after the Democratic National Convention, Brazile said she found out that the party was $2 million in debt and that the Clinton campaign had placed the party on an allowance.Pointing to Braziles characterization of a DNC bloated with consultant salaries, prominent Sanders supporters have upped their calls for a full-scale re-evaluation of party spending.I have personally not just called for an autopsy, but an audit.We need real primary reforms ... but also accountability, Nomiki Konst, a Sanders delegate to the Unity Reform Commission, tweeted Thursday.States will not win legislatures if the DNC doesnt understand where they blew all the money in the last 9 years.Also wont raise [the money] back.Xochitl Hinojosa, the current DNC communications director, issued a statement on Thursday that emphasized the partys push to ensure everyone feels like they receive a fair shake in elections.The DNC must remain neutral in the presidential primary process, and there shouldnt even be a perception that the DNC is interfering in that process, she said.Under the new leadership, the DNC has signed a joint fundraising agreement with all 50 states and D.C. well ahead of the presidential primary process in order to support our state parties and win at the state, local and national level in 2017, 2018 and beyond.This is unprecedented.We are no longer a party that is only focused on electing Democrats every four years.Were a party that elects Democrats every year and in every single zip code.As the party marches toward the next presidential cycle, Tasini warned that leadership has to abide by that promise of neutrality.If they try this again, the Democratic Party will be done.There are plenty of people, like me, who have held back from leaving the party to try to fix it, he said.But if theres a repeat of this, its over.People will stream out of the party, the party will collapse, and Donald Trump will be reelected.--This story was updated on Nov. 3.
President Trump Doesn't 'Remember Much' About Meeting With George Papadopoulos:::::President Trump said he doesnt remember much about meeting with a campaign adviser who pleaded guilty to lying to federal agents.Speaking to reporters on the White House lawn before leaving for a 12-day trip to Asia, Trump downplayed a meeting his campaign had which featured foreign policy advisor George Papadopoulos in March of 2016.Trump posted an image of the meeting on Instagram and Twitter at the time, noting that he was meeting with my national security team.But speaking Friday, Trump downplayed the meeting.It was a very unimportant meeting, he said, according to pool reports.It took place a long time ago.Dont remember much about it.In recent days, Trump has dismissed Papadopoulos as a low-level volunteer and a liar, while White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders has argued that the one-time advisers contacts with Russians, which got him in trouble when he lied about them to investigators with special counsel Robert Muellers probe, were outside the scope of the campaign.
Trump Wakes Up And Tweets About Hillary Clinton's Corruption:::::President Donald Trump woke up Friday morning and continued tweeting about the alleged corruption of Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party.These tweets come a day after Politico published a fiery book excerpt by Donna Brazile, former interim chair of the Democratic National Committee, in which she wrote that Hillary Clintons 2016 presidential campaign and the national party struck a deal that would in effect grant the campaign control of the partys finances and strategy.Everybody is asking why the Justice Department (and FBI) isnt looking into all of the dishonesty going on with Crooked Hillary & the Dems, Trump wrote on Twitter.New Donna B book says she paid for and stole the Dem Primary.What about the deleted E-mails, Uranium, Podesta, the Server[?]He continued: Plus, plus People are angry.At some point the Justice Department, and the FBI, must do what is right and proper.The American public deserves it!According to the Brazile story, in August of 2015, a deeply indebted Democratic National Committee took a loan from the Clinton campaign, and in exchange by and large granted the campaign the rights to dictate how the party would operate in the lead-up to the 2016 presidential election.Brazile writes that the deal brings evidential heft to the argument that the Democratic primary was rigged against Sen. Bernie Sanders, a frequent rallying point for his supporters and also for Trump, who has cited the primary as yet another example of Crooked Hs supposed malfeasance.This was not a criminal act, but as I saw it, it compromised the partys integrity, Brazile writes.Trumps Friday morning comments on the election followed his tweet about his own Twitter account, which briefly disappeared from the site late Thursday night something Twitter had first chalked up to human error by a Twitter employee.Twitter later said that after an investigation, it determined the account was deactivated by a customer support employee who did this on the employees last day.
Female Lawmakers Speak Up About Sexual Harassment:::::(WASHINGTON) For years, Republican Rep. Mary Bono endured the increasingly suggestive comments from a fellow lawmaker in the House.But when the congressman approached her on the House floor and told her hed been thinking about her in the shower, shed had enough.She confronted the man, who she said still serves in Congress, telling him his comments were demeaning and wrong.And he backed off.Bono, who served 15 years before being defeated in 2012, is not alone.As reports flow almost daily of harassment or worse by men in entertainment, business and the media, one current and three former female lawmakers tell The Associated Press that they, too, have been harassed or subjected to hostile sexual comments by fellow members of Congress.The incidents occurred years or even decades ago, usually when the women were young newcomers to Congress.They range from isolated comments at one hearing, to repeated unwanted come-ons, to lewd remarks and even groping on the House floor.Coming amid an intensifying national focus on sexual harassment and gender hostility in the workplace, the revelations underscore that no woman is immune, even at the highest reaches of government.This is about power, said former California Sen. Barbara Boxer, after describing an incident at a hearing in the 1980s where a male colleague made a sexually suggestive comment.The colleague, using the traditional congressional parlance, said he wanted to associate himself with her remarks adding afterward that he also wanted to associate with the gentle lady.Boxer said the comment was met with general laughter and an approving second from the committee chairman.She said she later asked that it be removed from the record.That was an example of the way I think we were thought of, a lot of us.Its hostile and embarrasses, and therefore could take away a persons power, she said.Boxer and the other female lawmakers spoke on the record to tell their stories in the wake of revelations about Hollywood producer Harvey Weinsteins serial attacks on women, as well as disclosures from current and former Capitol Hill staffers about harassment by lawmakers and aides.Those accounts, published in The Washington Post and elsewhere, revealed that Congress has few training or reporting requirements in place to deal with sexual harassment.Largely untold before now is that some female lawmakers themselves say they have been harassed by male colleagues.While rare, the accounts raise troubling questions about the boys club environment in Congress where male lawmakers can feel empowered to target not only staffers but even their own peers.The lawmakers declined to identify the perpetrators by name, but at least two of the men continue to serve in the House.None of the female lawmakers interviewed reported what happened, and some noted it was not clear where they would lodge such a complaint.At least three of the four told friends or aides about the incidents, which in some cases were witnessed by other lawmakers.When I was a very new member of Congress in my early 30s, there was a more senior member who outright propositioned me, who was married, and despite trying to laugh it off and brush it aside it, would repeat.And I would avoid that member, said Rep. Linda Sanchez, D-Calif. She added that she would warn other new female members about the lawmaker in question, but she declined to identify him, while saying he remains in Congress.I just dont think it would be helpful to call the lawmaker out by name, Sanchez said.The problem is, as a member theres no HR department you can go to, theres nobody you can turn to.Ultimately theyre employed by their constituents.Sanchez also said that a different male colleague repeatedly ogled her, and at one point touched her inappropriately on the House floor, while trying to make it appear accidental.She declined to identify the lawmaker but said he was no longer in Congress.Bono said she ultimately confronted her colleague on the House floor after hed made repeated harassing comments.Bono, who arrived in the House at age 36 to replace her husband Sonny Bono after he died in a skiing accident, said it seemed like the lawmaker didnt know how to talk to a woman as an equal.Instead of being hows the weather, hows your career, hows your bill, it was I thought about you while I was in the shower.So it was a matter of saying to him Thats not cool, thats just not cool.'Bono declined to identify the lawmaker, saying the behavior stopped after she finally challenged him.He still serves in Congress, she said.It is a mans world, its still a mans world, Bono said.Not being a flirt and not being a bitch.That was my rule, to try to walk that fine line.Former Rep. Hilda Solis, now a Los Angeles County supervisor, recalls repeated unwanted harassing overtures from one lawmaker, though she declined to name him or go into detail.I dont think Im the only one.What I tried to do was ignore it, turn away, walk away.Obviously its offensive.Are you supposed to be flattered?No, were adults.Not appropriate, said Solis, who left Congress in 2009 to join the Obama administration as labor secretary.Its humiliating, even though they may have thought they were being cute.No, its not.Its not appropriate.Im your colleague, but he doesnt see me that way, and thats a problem, Solis said.The experiences occurred against the backdrop of broader gender inequities in Congress, where women remain a distinct minority, making up only about 20 percent of members in the House and Senate.Thats up from fewer than 10 percent in the quarter-century since politics Year of the Woman in 1992.That election season, large numbers of women sought office following hearings by the then-all-male Senate Judiciary Committee over Anita Hills testimony about alleged sexual harassment by Clarence Thomas, who was subsequently confirmed to the Supreme Court, albeit by a narrow margin.The increase in numbers and the prominence of a few individual women, such as House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, has not resulted in parity in all measures, nor eliminated the potential for male members to demean or even harass their femalecounterparts.Nonetheless, a few former female lawmakers contacted by The AP expressed surprise and even disbelief at the notion that lawmakers themselves could be victims of harassment.Rep. Jackie Speier of California has recently gone public with an account of being sexually assaulted by a male chief of staff while she was a congressional staffer.She has criticized the vague rules in place on the issue and is preparing legislation to mandate sexual harassment training for congressional offices, among other changes.In a video posted to Twitter last week, she called Congress a breeding ground for a hostile work environment and encouraged others to come forward.Yet when it comes to lawmakers themselves, Speier said: I think the women in Congress are big girls.The equalizer that exists in Congress that doesnt exist in other settings is that we all get paid the same amount and we all have a vote, the same vote.So if you have members that are demeaning you its because youre letting them.Former Rep. Ellen Tauscher of California flatly argued that harassment cant take place between members of Congress.Female members and male members are equals, they dont sexually harass each other, Tauscher said.In fact, the law specifies that harassment can occur between equals, said Jennifer Drobac, a professor at the Indiana University Robert H. McKinney School of Law, who teaches a course in sexual harassment law.Formally, two members of Congress may have the same status.That doesnt change the fact that sexual harassment can occur between peers, Drobac said, noting that numerous other factors can come into play, including the difference in age and length of service between the members, and the mere fact that men have more power in society than women.Indeed the harassment or hostile incidents experienced by current and former lawmakersoccurred when they were young newcomers to Congress, with less seniority than the men who targeted them.Yet the fact that some dispute whether harassment could even occur between members of Congress underscores the complexity of the issue and the fraught questions surrounding it.Bono said she found power in confronting her harasser, and that after she did so it never happened again.She emphasized that she understood her experience was different than those of young staffers who may face harassment from someone they rely on for a job, and that she was fortunate because as an equal elected by her constituents, she would not fear retaliation.But Bono strongly disputed any suggestion that she or any other female lawmaker could not be harassed by their peers.My career didnt suffer, I didnt suffer, Bono said.But it did happen.
President Trump's Asia Tour: What You Need to Know:::::On Nov. 3, Donald Trump embarks on a 12-day trip to five different Asian nations.North Korea and trade are expected to top his agenda as he tours Japan, South Korea, China, Vietnam and the Philippines, where leaders will be keen to ingratiate themselves to the mercurial geopolitical neophyte.Its the longest official trip by a sitting U.S. President since 1992, when George H.W.Bush also spent 12 days in Asia, and famously suffered a bout of flu that led him to vomit into the lap of then Japanese Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa during a state dinner.Trump will hope to avoid similar faux pas while moving the news agenda away from the recent indictments of senior former aides relating to Russian meddling in last years election.He travels with a phalanx of CEOs so expect a flurry of neatly tweetable trade deals.Heres what we can expect out of each leg: Japan Following a brief pit stop in Hawaii, Trump is due to touchdown in Tokyo on Nov. 5 to be welcomed by newly reelected Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who during a trip to Washington in February bonded with his American host over multiple rounds of golf.Abe will double-down on that clubhouse camaraderie by booking Trump in for a round with world No.4 golfer Hideki Matsuyama, as well as the more dubious honor of a performance by Pen-Pineapple-Apple-Pen (PPAP) viral singer Pikotaro.But the real substance will be North Korea.Abe is most closely aligned with Trumps zero-tolerance approach for Kim Jong Uns escalating nuclear and missile tests, especially after two missiles were launched over Japans northern island of Hokkaido late September and early October.Both leaders say the problem is Chinas to fix, given 90% of North Korean trade occurs over their shared border, and believe talks are futile without firm steps towards denuclearization.But Japan lies on the frontline of any conflict, and Abe will be keen to avoid defiance veering into antagonism, especially as Trump has given to belittling the North Korean despot as Little Rocket Man and is in need of distractions.Theres a worry here that Trump might escalate tensions, issue provocative tweets, do things generally counterproductive to stoke up anxieties, says Prof. Jeffery Kingston, a director of Asian Studies at Temple University in Japan.The chances of him doing something counterproductive have risen precisely because of his domestic political woes.What Trump wants: a distraction; a bilateral free-trade agreement.What his host wants: That distraction not to be nuclear war; a pass for Japans $68.9 billion trade surplus with the U.S. South Korea Trump makes the short hop to South Korea on Nov. 7, but he wont be visiting the DMZ, after an aide dismissed the seemingly requisite trip to the heavy fortifications that have divided the Korean peninsula for more than six decades as a clich.But the regime of Kim Jong Un will dominate discussions as Trump visits Camp Humphreys, a U.S. military base about 40 miles south of Seoul, and has meetings with President Moon Jae-in.He is also due to address parliament.Moon clashes with Trump and Abe on North Korea.While all agree costs must be imposed for the regimes belligerence, he also wants to open dialogue and offer inducements.South Korea hosts the U.S. THAAD anti-missile batteries, whose advanced surveillance capacities China deems a security risk.However, Beijing and Seoul recently reconciled over THAAD, in what analysts are saying is a sign that both are rounding on Washington and Tokyo regarding the need for a softer approach on Pyongyang.Read more: The Negotiator: South Korean President Moon Jae In Trump will attempt to push back on that suggestion while reaffirming the U.S. East Asian alliances.However, Because hes transactional the feeling is you cant really trust him, says Kingston.The worry [in East Asia] is that Trump could throw them under the bus.Trade is also very much on the table, as Trump has made moves to withdraw from the Korea-U.S. free trade agreement, or KORUS, unless it is renegotiated.Seoul has tentatively agreed.What Trump wants: A united front on North Korea; perhaps the sale of some military hardware.What his host wants: No provocations against the North; KORUS left intact.China The crest of Trumps trip begins Nov. 8 in Beijing, where the leaders of the worlds established and ascendant superpower will knuckle down to discuss myriad issues including trade such as U.S. firms being denied access to parts of the Chinese economy, particularly financial services and North Korea.Regarding the latter, Trump may ask China to turn off the oil spigot that helps keep its historic ally afloat, send packing all North Korean workers based in China, clamp down on cross-border smuggling cartels, and enforce sanctions on Chinese banks doing business with Pyongyang.Expect Chinese President Xi Jinping to make the right noises but with the usual gaps in enforcement.Also expect a lot of flashy deals announced but little progress on substantive trade issues.In April, Trump and Xi agreed at Mar-a-Lago for a four-track comprehensive dialogue mechanism, including a 100-day action plan for economic cooperation, but that hasnt really gone anywhere.The Chinese offer on steel overcapacity is basically the same as the previous administration received, with tepid progress on U.S. credit cards and U.S. beef.Trump may attempt to act tough; this week, the U.S. slapped anti-dumping duties on Chinese aluminum foil.Xi will try to distract him with gifts.Read more: Ports, Pipelines, and Geopolitics: Chinas New Silk Road Is a Challenge for Washington Chinas willing to sign trade deals all day long, as long it stays away from industrial policy and the sort of market access issues that theyre seeking to avoid, says Christopher K. Johnson, a China specialist at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told a recent panel discussion.Normal practice would be a tour of the Great Wall, though word is this is being skipped, probably to avoid any awkward outbursts given Trumps own version at the Mexican border remains stalled.What Trump wants: Access for U.S. firms to restricted markets; a tougher stance on North Korea.What his host wants: None of the above.Vietnam Trump vociferously abhors multilateral bodies in favor of bilateral, usually very transactional, relationships, though is adopting normal U.S diplomacy by attending two summit meetings during his trip.The first begins Nov. 10 in Da Nang at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Economic Leaders Meeting, where more than half the 21 members are also part of the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) free trade pact.But Trump nixed American involvement in TPP on his first workday in office, and his speech on a free and open Indo-Pacific is also a curious choice considering India is not an APEC member.Trumps speech echoes tested American policy toward Asia: to champion India as a large, pluralistic democracy that anchors the region with the U.S. on the other side of the Pacific, in a not-so-subtle counterweight to authoritarian China.When U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson spoke about U.S.-India relations Oct. 18 before a visit to New Delhi, he praised the two nations as the two bookends of stability, which is similar to the message Defense Secretary Mattis preached at Singapores Shangri-la Dialogue in June.Expect Trump to express support for freedom of navigation and political expression.But difficulties arise regarding the Presidents divergence with his hosts over free trade.The message will be that perhaps America First doesnt run contrary to these principles that they can coexist, says Elizabeth Economy, a China expert with the Council on Foreign Relations.What Trump wants: The U.S. to be treated as a leader without bearing any costs.What his host wants: An acknowledgement that a free Asia-Pacific must mean free trade.Philippines The second of Trumps summit appearances starts Nov. 12 in Manila, where the Philippines own populist president, Rodrigo Duterte, welcomes his U.S. counterpart alongside the other nine leaders of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN): Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.Duterte, whose bloody war on drugs has so far clocked up more than 7,000 extrajudicial killings, is chair of ASEAN during the blocs 50th birthday bash.In an April 29 phone call Trump praised Duterte for his unbelievable job on the drug problem, so dont expect human-rights to be front and center of their bilateral meeting.The gun-toting former Davao Mayor has also irked ASEAN members by agreeing to put aside a favorable ruling at the Permanent Court of Arbitration at the Hague regarding Chinese claims over disputed islands in the South China Sea and settle the dispute bilaterally with Beijing.Trump will likely push for a joint communiqu on freedom of navigation in the strategic waterway, though hopes are gossamer thin owing to the veto power of Cambodia and Laos, which are increasingly vassal states of Beijing.Trump is also controversially due to skip the East Asia Summit (EAS) to return to Washington.This is an act of political vandalism, writes Carlyle Thayer, emeritus professor at the Australian Defence Force Academy, in a briefing paper.Xi Jinping can now stand up and address the EAS with his arm resting on Trumps empty seat.What Trump wants: Affirmation of Freedom of Navigation.What his host wants: Affirmation for multilateralism and free trade.
Elizabeth Warren Thinks the DNC System Was Rigged to Help Hillary Clinton:::::Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren said on Thursday that she does think the Democratic National Committee rigged its 2016 presidential primary nomination in favor of Hillary Clinton.Her comments came during an interview with CNNs Jake Tapper on Thursday after an explosive book excerpt from former DNC chairwoman Donna Brazile revealed that the DNC entered into an agreement with Clintons campaign that effectively gave the campaign control over the partys finances, strategy and operations before Clinton received the nomination.This is a real problem, Warren said Thursday.But what weve got to do as Democrats now is weve got to hold this party accountable.When Tapper asked Warren whether she thought the DNC was rigged in 2016, the Senator simply responded: Yes.The liberal Democrat said she spoke with Tom Perez, the DNCs new chairman, when he was elected to the position earlier this year, and told him he needed to make the Democratic Party into a place where people from both the liberal and more centrist wings feel comfortable.Warren has been seen as a potential candidate to lead the party in 2020 and has continued to be outspoken about what she believes Democrats must do under President Donald Trump.This is a test for Tom Perez.Either hes going to succeed by bringing Bernie Sanders and Bernie Sanders representatives into this process, Warren said, or hes going to fail.And I very much hope he succeeds.
Donald Trump's Twitter Account Briefly Vanished:::::President Donald Trumps Twitter account appeared to disappear for several minutes on Thursday night before returning to normal.Throughout his candidacy and since he was elected president, Trump has used Twitter as a frequent means of communication, tweeting everything from jokes to criticisms to important policy announcements.Some of his tweets have attacked individuals and caused some to argue that the messages violate the social media platforms rules about abuse.Later Thursday evening, Twitter posted a message from its Government and Elections team saying that the presidents account had been deleted due to human error by a Twitter employee.The tweet said @realDonaldTrump was down for 11 minutes before being restored.Twitter later said that the error was made by a customer support employee on their last day of work, and that a full internal review is under way.On Friday morning, Trump responded on Twitter, saying a rogue employee took his account down.As Twitter users tried to figure out what was happening to Trumps account before the company clarified on Thursday, many piled on in making jokes about the presidents being banned from the platform.The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Former DNC Chair Donna Brazile Calls Clinton Fundraising Deal a 'Cancer':::::Former Democratic National Committee Chair Donna Brazile called Hillary Clintons fundraising practices the cancer of the Democratic Party in a fiery book excerpt published Thursday on Politico.Brazile, who served as interim DNC chair leading up to the 2016 election, had promised former presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders (D-Vt.) that she would investigate whether Clintons campaign rigged the nomination process ahead of the election.In the course of her research, she writes, she learned about a joint fundraising agreement among the DNC, Clintons campaign and the campaigns fundraising arm.Under the agreement, Brazile explained, Clintons campaign provided a $2 million loan to the debt-ridden DNC, and took advantage of a loophole in campaign finance law to use the party as a fund-raising clearinghouse.In essence, the deal allowed the Clinton campaign to control the party, and its finances, well before securing the Democratic nomination, or even officially entering the presidential race.Brazile, by her account, was in agony when she dialed Sanders to tell him what she had found.Hello, senator, she remembered saying.Ive completed my review of the DNC and I did find the cancer.But I will not kill the patient.You can read the full excerpt from Braziles book Hacks: The Inside Story of the Break-ins and Breakdowns that Put Donald Trump in the White House, here.
President Trump Nominates Jerome Powell for Next Fed Chair:::::(WASHINGTON) President Donald Trump tapped Jerome Powell on Thursday to replace Janet Yellen as Fed chair when her term ends in February, choosing a moderate member of the Feds board who has backed Yellens cautious approach to interest rate hikes.Powell, 64, is seen as a safe pick whose selection will likely assure investors hoping for continuity at the central bank.Some analysts see Powell, though, as more inclined than Yellen to ease financial regulations and possibly to favor a faster pace of rate increases.Trump made the announcement in a Rose Garden ceremony with Powell standing beside him.He said Powell had earned the respect and admiration of his colleagues in his five years on the Feds board.The president also praised Yellen, the first woman to lead the Fed, whom he decided not to nominate for a second term.He called her a wonderful woman who has done a terrific job.In a departure from previous announcements of new Fed chairs, Yellen was not in attendance Thursday.Powell himself said it had been a privilege to serve under Yellen and her predecessor, Ben Bernanke, and said hed do all he could to meet the Feds dual mandates of stable prices and maximum employment.Sung Won Sohn, an economics professor at California State University-Channel Islands, suggested that the new chair would likely deviate little from Yellens policy leadership if the economy performs as expected.Mr. Powell could be considered a clone of Janet Yellen in a positive sense, Sohn said.He will continue the same cautious, gradualist policy in setting interest rates that she did.If confirmed by the Senate, Powell would become chairman when Yellens term ends Feb. 3.Unlike the past three Fed leaders, Powell lacks a Ph.D. in economics and spent years working at investment firms.In choosing him, Trump decided against offering another term to Yellen despite widespread approval for her performance.The Yellen Fed and its go-slow approach to rate hikes have been credited with helping nurture the continued recovery from the Great Recession.Now, she will become the first Fed leader in decades not to be offered a second term after completing a first.Trump acknowledged in a recent TV interview that his decision on a Fed chair might have less to do with Yellens performance than with wanting to impose his own stamp on the Fed.Powell has built a reputation as a collegial centrist on the Feds board.Like the current and recent board members, Powell never dissented from the Yellen Feds moves to embrace low rates and to adopt other unorthodox policies to help sustain the economys recovery from the 2008 financial crisis and the worst downturn since the Great Depression.In a book about his years at the Fed, former Chairman Ben Bernanke praised Powell as a moderate and a consensus builder.His background makes Powell something of an outlier in a Fed long defined by distinguished research economists like Yellen, whose work has examined the relationship between inflation and wages, and Bernanke, a scholar of the Great Depression.But Aaron Klein, a fellow at the Brookings Institution who worked in the Obama administrations Treasury Department, suggested that the absence of a scholarly background in economics should not impede Powells ability to lead the central bank.I do not believe you need a Ph.D. in economics to chair the Fed, Klein said.Whats needed is judgment, confidence and the ability to know when the models and data and the best minds of the Fed staff may have missed something.While Powell is expected to generally stick with Yellens blueprint, no one can be certain that he will.With unemployment at a 16-year low and the economy on firm footing, Powell might want to step up the pace of the Feds rate increases, which make loans costlier for companies and individuals over time.For any Fed, the risk in doing so would be in potentially miscalculating the proper pace of rate increases and inadvertently triggering a recession.Corporate profits would suffer, and stock prices would likely tumble.Nor can anyone know how well Powell would manage an unforeseen economic crisis that might arise over the next four years whether a recession, a credit crunch or a global financial crisis.Powell, known as Jay, has maintained a low profile on the Fed board refraining, for example, from giving speeches on interest rate policy.Instead, he has chosen to focus more on the regulation of banks and on overseeing such obscure but vital Fed functions as the U.S. payments system.Yet by the accounts of many Fed watchers, Powell has demonstrated a firm grasp of the nuances of interest rate policy.He supported rules the Fed adopted to implement the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act which tightened regulations for financial firms after the 2008 crisis.But Powell has expressed concern that some of the stricter restrictions might have gone too far, especially as they relate to smaller banks.A graduate of Princeton University with a law degree from Georgetown, Powell worked at the venerable Wall Street investment bank Dillon, Read & Co. before serving as a senior Treasury official under President George H.W.Bush.Later, he was a partner in the Carlyle Group, a giant in the private equity business, from 1997 through 2005.Powells years in investment management have made him one of the wealthiest members of the Feds board.According to his latest financial disclosure form, his assets were valued at a range between $19.7 million and $54.9 million.Powell was chosen for the Fed board by President Barack Obama in 2011 in an arrangement that paired Powell, a Republican, with Jeremy Stein, a Harvard professor who is a Democrat.Obama believed that pairing a Democrat and a Republican would ease Senate passage of the nominations.
Trump Administration Says It Doesnt Want to 'Yell About' Human Rights:::::President Trumps national security advisor defended his approach to human rights in countries with authoritarian leaders, arguing that it doesnt help to yell.How much does it help to yell about these problems?National Security Advisor H.R.McMaster told journalists at the daily White House briefing.What the President is doing is being effective.McMasters comments, which come ahead of President Trumps 11-day trip to the Asia Pacific region, came in response to a question about the reluctance of the White House to engage countries such as Turkey and the Philippines on human rights abuses.While Trump has aggressively criticized authoritarian regimes in Venezuela, North Korea and elsewhere he has remained silent on other leaders with poor human rights records such as Russias Vladimir Putin and Turkeys Recep Tayyip Erdogan.McMaster suggested that the U.S. may be engaging in these discussions behind closed doors.I dont think you should assume anything, he said.Trumps trip, which will include stops in Japan, South Korea, China, Vietnam and the Philippines, had been billed as an opportunity to engage Asian countries on the ongoing conflict with North Korea over its nuclear weapons program.McMaster suggested Thursday that the U.S. might consider adding North Korea to its list of state sponsors of terror, citing specifically the assassination of the brother of the countrys leader earlier this year in Malaysia.
Half of Americans Think Trump Committed a Crime Related to Russia, Poll Finds:::::Roughly half of Americans think President Donald Trump may have committed a crime related to Russian interference with the 2016 election, according to a new poll from the Washington Post and ABC News.Forty-nine percent of respondents said the president likely committed a crime, though the majority of those individuals said they based their answer on suspicion only.Forty-four percent said its unlikely that Trump committed a crime, and 7% had no opinion.The poll, which was released Thursday, also revealed that more than half of Americans 58% of survey respondents approve of the way Robert Mueller, who is overseeing the investigation into possible collaboration between the Trump campaign and the Russian government, is handling the case.Thats higher than Trumps third-quarter job approval rate (almost 37%), the Supreme Courts approval rate (42%) and Congress approval rate (just under 14%).Conversely, only 37% of the survey population felt that Trump is cooperating with Muellers investigation roughly the same proportion that approves of his recent job performance.Thirty-one percent of the polls respondents self-identified as Democrats, 23% identified as Republicans and 38% identified as independents.

Warren Hits Trump in Twitter Storm:::::Sen. Elizabeth Warren attacked President Donald Trump in a series of rapid-fire tweets Friday, rebuking him for trying to distract attention from the indictments of campaign aides and warning that his tweets won't keep his people out of jail.I understand your desperation to change the subject, @realDonaldTrump.Your campaign mgr was just indicted for conspiracy against the US.https://t.co/Bazcx4IbX2 Elizabeth Warren (@elizabethforma) November 3, 2017 You might think your tweets are cute, @realDonaldTrump, but they won't stop Mueller's investigation or keep your people out of jail.Elizabeth Warren (@elizabethforma) November 3, 2017 The DNC shouldn't play favorites.But that's a whole lot different from illegally conspiring with Russia.The FBI knows the difference.Elizabeth Warren (@elizabethforma) November 3, 2017 Slurs, lies & trash talk won't stop the FBI from doing its job.This isn't a dictatorship.It's our democracy.And it's stronger than you.Elizabeth Warren (@elizabethforma) November 3, 2017 The fiery Massachusetts Democrats has been in war of words with Trump since the president started mocking the senator for claiming she has American-Indian heritage.He regularly calls her "Pocahontas" in his own tweets.Trump's former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, and another ex-campaign aide were indicted this week by the special counsel investigating Russia interference in last year's presidential election.A third campaign aide has pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI and is cooperating with the probe.
Nunes: Media's Excuses for Clinton Make Her Look Guilty:::::The media's excuses for former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton are making her look guilty in the case of the deal for Uranium One, but the House Intelligence Committee has asked for further information mainly because it wants to know if the FBI already had an open investigation before the transaction, Chairman Devin Nunes said Friday."I think a lot of people are getting this conflated," the California Republican told Fox News' "Fox & Friends" program."What happened was that we found out reportedly that there was an open FBI investigation at the same time that this transaction was made.So we now have permission to interview this witness who has come forward and brought us information.We will take that information, and then we'll see where it goes."But the press is making excuses for Clinton, while the committee wants to know about the FBI, Nunes said, making the issue "a little overblown."The committee is trying to determine, now that it's known that the Democratic National Committee and Clinton's campaign paid for research leading to a salacious dossier about then-candidate Donald Trump, and whether the report was used to start an investigation into collusion between the Trump campaign and Russians.Meanwhile, the CIA has declassified a trove of documents found in late terror leader Osama bin Laden's compound, and Nunes said that one of the challenges his committee has faced is that the information involved has been locked up for years."As you know, our intelligence agencies comb through it, but it has not been available for historians," said Nunes."One of the things we already found out just in the last 24 hours is that there was a pipeline in Iran" where members of al-Qaida were hiding."At the same time we were doing and making a nuclear agreement with the Iranians, they were harboring al-Qaida," said Nunes."Now we know that they had been harboring al-Qaida for a long period of time.So this is unacceptable from our intelligence agencies."Congress had asked for the documents to be disclosed about four years ago, and it was "unfortunate" that they were withheld, said Nunes."It's unfortunate to take them this long to get out but this is, you know, one of the reasons why is we have a new administration," he added.
Trump Touts Tax Reform, Cracks Dems in Interview With Howie Carr:::::President Donald Trump touted his new tax reform legislation, telling conservative radio host Howie Carr that the "middle class is the biggest beneficiary of all" during an interview at the White House on Thursday.During a 10-minute interview in the East Room, Trump and the king of New England radio's "The Howie Carr Show" covered a wide array of issues, starting with tax reform."We have to do what's right," Trump told Carr, whose show also airs daily on Newsmax TV."You have states that have done a fantastic job.Then you have states that haven't done so well.It's something at some point somebody had to do," Trump told Carr."The middle class is the biggest beneficiary of all."In fact a certain newspaper that's not exactly kind to me (The Washington Post) said that they gave (Democratic Sen. Chuck) Schumer four Pinocchios today because he was trying to say it's for the wealthy.And it's really not for the wealthy, it's for the middle class and it's for jobs," Trump said."I was surprised to see it," Trump said.Trump also addressed the country's immigration perils chain migration and the lottery program in the aftermath of the terrorist attack earlier this week in New York City that killed eight and injured about a dozen more."That's especially bad when you have a character like this," Trump said of the alleged attacker, Sayfullo Saipov, who came into the country in 2010 via the diversity visa lottery program, started by Democrats."Chuck Schumer's taking this one on the chin and he should," Trump told Carr."This was something that was bad when it started.It made no sense when it started.Now it's turning out to be a disaster," Trump said."And this guy came in here and just killed all of these people.And what about the wounded?I'm hearing how gravely wounded people are."It's just disgraceful and he came through the lottery system and other people came in with him, his family, it's a disgrace," Trump told Carr."We have to end chain migration, we will end chain migration, it's gonna be over.And actually there's a whole big thing in Congress right now, a lot of even Democrats saying it has to end," Trump told Carr."And also we have to end the lottery system," Trump told Carr."They're not putting their finest people in those lotteries.They're not putting their best, their brightest and their finest.So we end up with guys like this, who is just an animal.What he did is just a horrible thing."Then Trump and Carr covered off on a greatest hits, as it were, of burrs in the president's saddle.On NFL protests: "I think what they've been doing with the NFL and the flag and the respect for our country has been disgraceful.And that could have been handled very easily by leadership saying to Kaepernick when he first knelt, 'One more time and you're fined one game.You do it again and it's two games, and you do it again, it's a season.'That would have ended very easily at the beginning."On Kaepernick himself: "His skills went down quite a bit.Something happened to him but he doesn't seem to be the same quarterback."On Russia collusion allegations: "Zero collusion.Democrats say, 'There is no collusion but we will continue to look.There's smoke but there is no collusion.'Republicans say there's no collusion, but it's a disgrace that it can continue to go on.To be honest, it's a disgrace and it's bad for our country."On fake news: "The biggest collusion is the fake media.Because you look at the way media treats conservative Republicans, in particular, me.And you look at CNN fake news; look at NBC, it's terrible.It's just dishonest reporting; ABC and CBS too it's just very dishonest reporting.To me that really is the collusion it's at a level nobody has seen before."On Democrats: "They defrauded Bernie Sanders.And I've sort of been saying that without having the facts but they virtually defrauded Bernie Sanders and all of the Sanders people.I think it's a disgrace.And hopefully something is going to come of it."On the dossier of him: "It's made up.It's fabricated.It's false.Most people have said that, or most of it's false they'll say, but it's a disgrace they can do that."Carr then asked Trump about whether the FBI used that dossier as the basis to obtain Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrants to obtain permission to monitor members of Trump's campaign team, including former adviser Carter Page."I think they did.When (former FBI Director James) Comey came up to see me, what he did is he showed me the dossier.The thing he showed me was the dossier.So I think they did use it and I think they shouldn't have been allowed to," Trump told Carr."As president, you're not supposed to be allowed to become involved with like Justice (Department) and the FBI," Trump told Carr."You're supposed to be hoping everyone's doing their job.You're not supposed to become involved.But I will tell you, I think if they did use that, that's a serious problem for them, and I think all of that's going to be found out."
Trump Considered Keeping Yellen at Fed, Until Mnuchin Spoke Up:::::Jerome Powell wasnt a lock to be President Donald Trumps pick to lead the Federal Reserve.As Trump watched the stock market reach new highs day after day since his election and claimed personal credit for the strength of the U.S. economy, he kept coming back to the idea of renominating the woman most responsible, people close to him said: Fed Chair Janet Yellen.Then his Treasury secretary got his ear.Steven Mnuchin wielded outsized influence as Trump deliberated on the Fed, people familiar with the matter said, and Mnuchin favored Powell.His argument bested that of Vice President Mike Pence, who urged Trump to make a more dramatic change of direction at the Fed by nominating Stanford University economist John Taylor, a favorite of conservatives across Washington.Taylor, too, got a serious look from Trump, these people said.But in the end, Trump decided that Powell had the best judgment and collective experience of the five people he considered for the Fed job, and he is the person the president is most comfortable with, according to four White House officials who briefed reporters before Trumps announcement on condition of anonymity.Jay will bring extensive private-sector experience and real-world perspective to our government, Trump said Thursday in the White House Rose Garden.As a result, he understands what it takes for our economy to grow.And just as importantly, he understands what truly drives American success.Mnuchin preferred Powell because his selection wouldnt disrupt financial markets while still allowing Trump to put his personal stamp on the Fed, a person familiar with the matter said.The Treasury secretary regarded the Fed governor as a safe pair of hands who would raise interest rates at a pace that wouldnt scupper growth, the person said.This account of Trumps decision to nominate Powell to lead the most important central bank in the world is based on interviews with about a half-dozen current and former administration officials and people close to the president, in addition to information from the White House briefing.Trumps choice, aptly enough for the former showman, began with a head-fake.In an interview with the Wall Street Journal published on July 25, Trump said that Janet Yellen was in the running to keep her job.But he also mentioned someone else he had in mind for Fed chair: his chief economic adviser, Gary Cohn, who was sitting next to him.He doesnt know this, but yes he is, Trump said after the Journal asked if Cohn was a candidate.Yellen v. Cohn Fed chair wasnt a priority for Trump or the White House at the time.At one point in the summer, Trump thought he had until the fall of 2018 to choose a chairman to replace Yellen, whose term actually expires in February.Cohn, who up until the Journal interview had been managing the nascent Fed search, felt obliged to recuse himself from the decision after Trump publicly named him a candidate, people familiar with the matter said.To the extent Trump engaged in the decision during the summer, the names he floated were Yellen and Cohn, according to one person familiar with the matter.Cohn did not advocate for himself in front of other White House staff, the person said.And though his top aides didnt take him seriously, Trump seemed to be gravitating toward Yellen as his pick, both for market stability and because new presidents traditionally reappoint the incumbent Fed chairman, the person said.Then came Charlottesville.On Aug. 12, a mob of white supremacists and Nazi sympathizers marched into the Virginia college town to protest the removal of a statue of Robert E. Lee.The protesters instigated violence against a large gathering of counter-protesters; a woman was killed.Trump said that both sides were responsible and that there were very fine people among the protesters, engendering criticism -- including from Cohn.This administration can and must do better in consistently and unequivocally condemning these groups and do everything we can to heal the deep divisions that exist in our communities, Cohn said in an Aug. 25 interview with the Financial Times widely interpreted as a rebuke of his boss.He said he had felt enormous pressure to resign over the affair.It wasnt the only reason Trump steered away from nominating Cohn for the Fed job -- the four White House officials, in fact, denied that the interview led to Trump dropping Cohn from consideration.The president was also frustrated with the pace of a tax overhaul, legislation Cohn was in charge of shepherding that would be Trumps last, best shot this year at a signature domestic achievement after the failure to repeal Obamacare, people familiar with the matter said.One of the officials said there was concern that Cohn, a Democrat, would have trouble winning Senate confirmation.I think the president made a great selection yesterday in Jay Powell, Cohn said on Bloomberg Television on Friday.He said he and Trump will meet with the Fed chair nominee soon to discuss candidates for vice chairman, which the president also must appoint.Organized Search Meanwhile, three key White House aides -- personnel director Johnny DeStefano and two Cohn deputies, Andrew Olmem and Jeremy Katz -- were organizing a systematic job search.The names they would eventually present to Trump reflected dueling constituencies within the White House and the Republican Party.Their shortlist included Yellen -- but her only proponent within the Trump administration appeared to be the president himself.Many of Trumps top advisers, regardless of who they favored, agreed that Trump should dump former President Barack Obamas Fed chair, despite her considerable success in the job.Unemployment was at 4.2 percent in September, a 16-year low, and the economy is in its ninth year of expansion.Inflation and interest rates are low and Yellen is gradually backing off crisis-era policies and unwinding the Feds $4.5 trillion balance sheet.Mnuchins favorite, Powell isnt that distinguishable from Yellen on monetary policy.He has never dissented with her on Fed votes.He is a Republican, however, and, unlike Yellen, didnt spend many years of his career in the Federal Reserve system.Pence and his chief economist, Mark Calabria, favored Taylor, beloved by conservatives for his criticism of the Fed.The fifth name on the DeStefano, Olmem and Katz shortlist was Kevin Warsh, a former Fed governor.Rates and an Enemy The knock against Taylor, for a president who had grown to enjoy low interest rates, was his namesake Taylor Rule: an equation he devised that would dictate higher rates than under Yellen.Trump, once critical of Yellens policies as a presidential candidate, had a change of heart after he entered office and the stock market boomed -- a phenomenon he frequently observed at his @realdonaldtrump Twitter account.Trump never talked about rates or the direction they should go with his Fed candidates, according to the officials who briefed reporters.Warsh, meanwhile, had made a key enemy in his previous stint on the Fed board: Randal Quarles, whom Trump had nominated for both a governors seat and to be vice chairman of bank supervision.Quarles, who was confirmed to both posts in October, told people that he might not remain on the board if Warsh were named chairman.Mnuchin was aware of his concerns.Interviews Begin The deliberations gained urgency in late September, soon after Trump resolved looming crises over the debt limit and the governments budget by striking a controversial deal with Democratic leaders in Congress.He, Mnuchin and Pence interviewed Warsh and Powell on Sept. 27 and 28, respectively, according to people familiar with the matter.Pence and Trump interviewed Taylor on Oct. 11, and Trump was said to be impressed by the economist.Finally, Trump interviewed Yellen on Oct. 19.Again, he was impressed, he said.Five days later, he added to the drama by asking Republican senators in a closed-door meeting at the Capitol for a show of hands on Yellen, Powell and Taylor.He left out Cohn and Warsh, suggesting they had faded from consideration.Taylor appeared to win the presidents straw poll, South Carolina Senator Tim Scott said.One of the White House officials said Trump indeed had by then narrowed his shortlist to Yellen, Powell and Taylor.Yellen v. Powell In an Oct. 25 interview, Trump again told Fox Business Network anchor Lou Dobbs -- who recommended Yellens reappointment -- that she was very impressive.But he added: you like to make your own mark.Bloomberg News reported that Cohn was out of the running the same day, and on Oct. 27 reported that Powell was the front-runner.The four officials said it is unclear when Trump made up his mind.He was still asking his aides questions about multiple candidates as of Oct. 27, they said.Trump offered Powell the job on Tuesday and he accepted, the four officials said.Trump called Yellen, the first woman to lead the Fed, on Thursday morning to tell her she would be replaced, they said.(Updates with Cohn remarks in 17th paragraph.)--With assistance from Saleha Mohsin and Craig Torres To contact the reporters on this story: Jennifer Jacobs in Washington at jjacobs68@bloomberg.net, Margaret Talev in Washington at mtalev@bloomberg.net, Toluse Olorunnipa in Washington at tolorunnipa@bloomberg.net.To contact the editors responsible for this story: Alex Wayne at awayne3@bloomberg.net, Laurie Asso 2017 Bloomberg L.P.
Trump: Bernie Voters Right to Be Angry:::::President Donald Trump, in back-to-back tweets Friday morning, blasted Hillary Clinton for trying to shut Bernie Sanders out of the Democratic presidential nomination, a reaction to explosive charges from a former Democratic Party leader.Bernie Sanders supporters have every right to be apoplectic of the complete theft of the Dem primary by Crooked Hillary!Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 3, 2017 I always felt I would be running and winning against Bernie Sanders, not Crooked H, without cheating, I was right.Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 3, 2017 Trump was responding to accusations from Donna Brazile, a former interim chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee.In a new book, she accused Clinton of trying to take over a party left nearly bankrupt by former President Barack Obama and to shut the Vermont senator out of the race for the party's presidential nomination last year.
Senate Democrats Turning Against Political Allies in Tech Industry:::::Senate Democrats appear to be turning against some of their longtime political allies in the tech industry, Axios reported.The website noted Democrats are outraged over how Russia exploited Google, Twitter and Facebook during the presidential election.And it comes at a time when there are questions being raised about the tech giants' power and lack of accountability, according to Axios.While many Democrats have in the past aligned themselves with the tech companies, testimony this week on Capitol Hill showed their frustrations are growing, Axios said.Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va. was critical of the companies for not heeding earlier concerns by lawmakers about Russian meddling, Forbes reported."Our claims were frankly blown off by your companies," Warner told executives.He characterized the companies' response as "nothing like this happened.Nothing to see here."And Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., added: "What we're talking about is a cataclysmic change, what we're talking about is cyber warfare."She also criticized the companies for offering "vague answers," Forbes reported."I went home last night with profound disappointment," Feinstein said."You have a huge problem.You bear this responsibility, and you have to be the one to do something about it."Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., noted: " It is self-evident that in relation to the power your platforms now have, in the past election, you failed."Meanwhile, Axios noted in some cases, GOP lawmakers, who generally are not politically connected to tech firms, went much easier on the company officials.
NYT: Court Documents Refute Trump, Sessions on Russia Contacts:::::President Donald Trump and Attorney General Jeff Sessions both denied any knowledge of members of the Trump campaign meeting with Russians, but newly unsealed court documents appear to refute those statements, The New York Times reports.Former campaign aide George Papadopoulos said in a meeting with Trump and the foreign policy team, "that he had connections that could help arrange a meeting between then-candidate Trump and [Russian] President [Vladimir] Putin," according to court records."He went into the pitch right away," said J. D. Gordon, a campaign adviser who was at the meeting, according to the Times."He said he had a friend in London, the Russian ambassador, who could help set up a meeting with Putin."Although Trump listened to Papadopoulos' idea, Sessions reportedly opposed it, and "said that no one should talk about it," according to Gordon.Sessions testified under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee in January that he was unaware of any contacts between the campaign and Russia.Sessions repeated this claim in his testimony last month, after his own meetings with the Russian ambassador to the U.S. came to light.Sessions "now needs to come back before the committee, in person, under oath, to explain why he cannot seem to provide truthful, complete answers to these important and relevant questions," Sen. Patrick J. Leahy, D-Vt., a member of the Judiciary Committee, told the paper."The media's willingness to inflate Papadopoulos, a young unpaid volunteer and supposed energy expert, into an important thought leader in the campaign or Russian operative is ludicrous," White House lawyer Ty Cobb told The Times."The evidence so far suggests he attended one meeting, said something about Russia and was immediately shut down by everyone in the room.It's very important to remember that he is not a criminal now because of anything he did for the campaign he is a criminal because he initially lied to the FBI."
Trump 'Disappointed' in Justice Department:::::President Donald Trump on Friday called for the Justice Department to investigate Democrats, after Donna Brazile, a former interim chairwoman for the Democratic National Committee, said in a book the party helped Hillary Clinton win the presidential primary."I'm really not involved with the Justice Department, I'd like to let it run itself, but honestly, they should be looking at the Democrats," Trump said to reporters Friday, The Hill reported."They should be looking at a lot of things, and a lot of people are disappointed in the Justice Department, including me," Trump said, according to The Hill.In Brazile's book, she wrote that a deal between the DNC and Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign was not illegal, but "sure looked unethical," The Hill reported.Also on Friday, the president tweeted a number of comments about Hillary Clinton."At some point, the FBI and the Justice Department must do what is right and proper" and investigate the former Democratic presidential candidate.
Cohn: Tax Cuts Would Not Be Retroactive:::::Republicans' tax plan would not make adjustments retroactive, White House economic adviser Gary Cohn said on Friday, despite calls from U.S. lawmakers who want cuts to apply to 2017 as the party aims to pass the bill by year's end."We're trying to deliver great tax reform to the American public.We can't get it retroactive to this year.We're trying to do a tax plan that starts on Jan. 1 of next year," Cohn said in an interview with Fox Business Network.
Dems Sue Trump Admin. Over the Release of Trump Hotel Documents:::::House Democrats are suing the General Services Administration, which controls a large number off federal properties including the building that houses the Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C.The lawsuit filed Thursday says that the GSA did not comply with a rule that allows seven members of the oversight panel to request documents from a federal government agency, according to HuffPost.Seven Democratic members of the committee sent a request to the GSA on Feb. 8 seeking documents regarding the hotel's finances, with the goal being to check on whether President Donald Trump was profiting from his position through the D.C. hotel.After the election, the hotel's profits increased.The GSA's inspector general and the Government Accountability Office are investigating the propriety of the hotel's lease, HuffPost reported."The hotel is not just a building with Donald Trump's name on it," Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., said, according to HuffPost."It is a glaring symbol of the Trump administration's lack of accountability and a daily reminder of the refusal by Republicans in Congress to do their job.This may be standard operating procedure in foreign countries but not here.Not in America," said Cummings, the ranking Democrat on the oversight committee.The seven members used the Seven Member Rule statute in the February request.They had used it in December with then-president Barack Obama's administration, which complied with the request.The Trump administration, however, has said the Seven Member Rule did not apply.It said materials could only be requested through the committee chairman, which is now Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C. "We regret that we have to go to court to obtain these basic documents, which are clearly within our Committee's jurisdiction.We would not be here today if Chairman Gowdy and his Republican colleagues would do their jobs," Cummings said, according to HuffPost."In my opinion, House Republicans are aiding and abetting President Trump's ongoing abuses," Cummings added.In 2013, Trump signed a 60-year lease to open the hotel in the Old Post Office Pavilion, which is owned by the federal government.Trump and daughter Ivanka retained their stakes in the property, although legal and contracting experts expected that the lease would be voided because of a clause that forbid any elected official from benefiting from the deal, according to The Washington Post.
Justice Dept. Says it Was Misled by Pregnant Immigrant Teen's Lawyers:::::Lawyers for a pregnant immigrant teenager, who successfully fought a legal battle to have an abortion, misled the Justice Department over the timing of the procedure, the government alleged in a court filing Friday.In a petition filed at the U.S. Supreme Court, the Justice Department said it was about to appeal a lower court decision in the 17-year-old girl's favor when it emerged on Oct. 25 that she had already had the abortion early that morning.The Justice Department said "disciplinary action may therefore be warranted" against the teen's lawyers at the American Civil Liberties Union, who had told the government the girl was scheduled to have the abortion a day later.The government is asking for the original lawsuit filed by the ACLU on behalf of the girl and other pregnant teens who may be in immigration detention to be thrown out.By quickly having the abortion, the girl, known in court papers as "Jane Doe," prevented the administration from potentially continuing the legal fight at the conservative-leaning U.S. Supreme Court.The ACLU said in a statement that the government was seeking to deflect blame for its failure to appeal in time."Our lawyers acted in the best interest of our client and in full compliance with the court orders and federal and Texas law, said the group's legal director, David Cole.The case involves the intersection of two divisive social issues on which President Donald Trump has taken a hard line: abortion and immigration.Among the issues the dispute raises is whether illegal immigrant women have the same rights to an abortion as U.S. residents.The Trump administration argued previously that while the girl from an unidentified country was in federal custody, she was subject to its policy of refusing to facilitate abortions.The girl entered the United States without any family in September and was immediately detained by U.S. authorities and placed in a shelter in Texas for unaccompanied illegal immigrant minors.She had sought and received a Texas court order to approve the abortion because she is under 18, and had scheduled a sonogram and consultation with a physician, as required by Texas law.But the Trump administration had refused to let her leave the detention center to carry out those steps.At the time of the abortion, she was around 15 weeks pregnant.Under Texas law, abortions after 20 weeks are illegal.
Meadows: GOP Tax Plan Alone Won't Balance Government's Fiscal Woes:::::Congressional Republicans will likely tackle entitlement reforms early next year, as the GOP's plan to cut taxes won't be enough to stabilize the government's fiscal status, House Freedom Caucus chairman Mark Meadows said Friday."Quite frankly, not enough is being done," the North Carolina Republican told MSNBC's "Morning Joe" program."I can tell you, members of the Freedom Caucus have not only put forth a bill that looks at defining and reforming Medicare, but also other entitlement programs."The need to reform such programs as Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid is the "top fiscal thing that we have to worry about," said Meadows.He believes some initiatives will start during the first quarter of 2018, even if they don't focus specifically on Social Security and Medicare."We've got to get serious about it, and if we don't, all the pro-growth tax reform in the world is not going to ultimately balance out where we need to go as a nation fiscally," said Meadows.Meanwhile, during President Donald Trump's campaign, he railed against hedge fund managers being allowed to enjoy a carried interest loophole, but the GOP tax plan unveiled this week still contains that provision.Meadows said he thinks that will change."I think that actually will end up being one of those things that comes out whether it's in the markup going through the House or over in the Senate," said Meadows."I was in the Oval Office with the president when this very subject came up.And he was very emphatic that like he was consistent on the campaign trail about the hedge fund managers and the carried interest provisions that he felt like it needed to be done away with."Meadows said he's already spoken out against the loophole, and said if it's removed, the money can be used to benefit middle income, hard-working taxpayers.The proposed GOP bill, though, will increase the national debt by about $1.5 trillion over the next 10 years, noted economist Steve Rattner, asking Meadows if, with his record as a deficit hawk, if he'll oppose it."There are two issues working against each other," he said, adding that many of his colleagues are not looking at reducing spending, whether for defense or other expenses, and that must be addressed."Either you can cut back on those areas, or you can hopefully grow the economy," said Meadows."This pro-growth tax reform is designed to not only grow the economy, [but] he initial numbers are exciting in terms of what we will see."I believe that a short-term deficit will end up over a 15-year period paying for itself as long as we get the kind of GDP growth that it appears we're going to get, and so it's one of those things that you take what you've got on a particular issue."
GOP Creates Hidden 46 Percent Tax Bracket:::::The Republican Party included a surcharge for Americans who earn more than $1 million in taxable income in their recent tax reform plan, creating an effecting tax rate of about 46 percent, Politico reports.The GOP plan for every American pays a rate of 12 percent on their first $45,000 in taxable income, but individuals who earn more than $1 million will see an additional 6 percent tax "on every dollar earned, until it made up for the tax benefits that the rich receive from the low tax rate on that first $45,000," according to Politico's Danny Vinik."That surcharge remains until the government has clawed back the full $12,420, which would occur at about $1.2 million in taxable income.At that point, the surcharge disappears and the top tax rate drops back to 39.6 percent."Vinik describes this as "a 'bubble tax,' because the marginal tax rate effectively bubbles up for a brief period before falling back to a lower level."A spokesperson for the House Ways and Means Committee told Politico that the bubble tax is "the phase-out of a tax benefit" for the rich, not a surcharge, though they didn't dispute their calculations."The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act provides tax relief at every income level," the spokesperson added."I was just in a briefing with the White House on this," said Steve Moore, a tax expert with The Heritage Foundation, to Politico."They didn't mention that.It seems kind of bizarre to me."Moore, after Politico explained the plan for a bubble tax, said it's a "stupid policy" that flies in the face of supply side economics."All the benefits from rate reductions are from cutting the highest rate not the lowest rates," he said.
Sanders' Campaign Chief: Brazile Bombshell a 'Shocking Revelation':::::The former chairman of Sen. Bernie Sanders' primary campaign said it was "clear" from the jump that the Democratic National Committee favored Hillary Clinton, but that nobody "imagined" the "formal arrangement" bombshell dropped by Donna Brazile.In an interview with CNN's "New Day" morning program, Jeff Weaver said it was a "shocking revelation.""It was obviously a shocking revelation although it was pretty clear from the get-go that the DNC was in the Clinton camp, with a rigged debate schedule and a host of other interventions, including them taking away access to our voter file data in December 2015," Weaver told CNN."I don't think any of us imagined that there was actually a formal arrangement giving the Clinton campaign control of the DNC, that's for sure," Weaver said.Brazile, former interim chairwoman of the DNC, torches Clinton and former chairwoman, Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, in a new book coming out next week.In an excerpt published Thursday, Brazile dropped the damning news that Clinton's campaign and the DNC entered into a secret yet formal arrangement for her to run the DNC in August of 2015 because the committee was millions in debt under the haphazard leadership of Wasserman Schultz.The move essentially froze Sanders out of any support from the DNC.

GOP Tax Plan Expands Child Tax Credit Less Than Ivanka Hoped:::::The Republican tax plan released Thursday included an expansion of the child tax credit that Ivanka Trump has promoted, but to a lesser extent than she had hoped, according to Politico.The president's oldest daughter has been lobbying both Republicans and Democrats in private dinners and meetings, and partnered with Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., to work on the policy details, informed by a 2015 proposal by Rubio and Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, Politico reported.Trump had advocated for doubling the tax credit to at least $2,000, but instead House legislators stuck to a plan similar to the House Republican tax blueprint of 2016 that increases the credit from $1,000 to $1,600 per child with the first $1,000 refundable.That refundable amount would be tied to inflation, Politico's report said.A White House official said the administration was "encouraged" by the expansion of the child tax credit in the legislation."Cabinet members and senior officials from the administration including Ivanka will be hitting the road in the coming weeks to continue to highlight how comprehensive tax reform will help working families," the official told Politico.Rubio and Lee issued a statement calling for "straightforward, significant, and permanent" expansion of the child tax credit."We wish the House draft had done more on this front," their statement said, according to Politico.The senators have been proponents of increasing the credit beyond the House legislation's level.In Rubio and Lee's 2016 version, the child tax credit was $2,500 and partially refundable, Politico's report said.The Senate's tax legislation has not been released and it could include the child tax credit expansion that Trump wanted."We look forward to working with our colleagues to make sure working families are moved to the front of the line in the Senate bill," Rubio and Lee's statement said, according to Politico.Rubio told reporters last month that increasing the credit to $1,800 would only result in middle class families breaking even, Axios reported.
WashPost: GOP Lawmakers Betray Promise on Tax Reform:::::Republican lawmakers betrayed their promise to give Americans a tax reform package that would simplify the code without adding to the debt, The Washington Post said in an editorial.The bill released by House Republicans "also betrays the nations children, and their children, who would eventually have to pay for this big unpaid-for tax cut that the country does not need," the newspaper said.The Post claimed the bill has a "fatal flaw.""It would cut far more by lowering tax rates than it would raise by closing loopholes," the paper said."It is far out of balance."How far?The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budgets Maya MacGuineas warned Thursday that the House plan would cost $1.5 trillion over 10 years, and, because of the way it is written, the price could end up being even higher."The Post noted that if the U.S. was in the middle of a recession, GOP lawmakers could argue in favor of a deficit-financed stimulus."But the economy is growing and does not need a short-term boost," the newspaper said."In fact, with the economy expanding, this should be the time to reduce the nations already alarmingly large debt.That is a principle Republicans passionately embraced when they were in the minority."It maintained the price for the package is just way too high."The plans core provision, a $1.5 trillion cut in corporate taxes, slashing the rate from 35 percent to 20 percent, could be defensible if it were paid for," the newspaper said."Alas, it is not.The nation needs tax reform, but it would be better off with no change than with this."
Rep. Kevin Brady: Tax Reform Pays for Itself by Eliminating Loopholes:::::Republican tax reform efforts will pay for themselves by growing the economy while eliminating special deductions in the current tax codes through a proposed House tax reform bill, Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady said Friday."We know it will grow the economy in a big way," the Texas Republican told MSNBC's Morning Joe" program."[It] doesn't just grow revenues in Washington.It does it at the state and local levels, but that's not enough."The reason we're going with the simple postcard style approach and eliminating a lot of special provisions on the business side to to get back to a balanced budget over time.You can't do one or the other.We do both."The only way to deliver lower tax rates is to get rid of loopholes and deductions in the tax code, he added, noting that "you have to do growth and streamline simplify the code."USA Today senior political correspondent Heidi Przybyla, however, pointed out that the Joint Committee on Taxation's economic model assumes that the tax cuts proposed could drag down economic growth."That's not what this bill does," she argued."These are unfunded.You're taking out some loopholes, but still blowing a big hole in the budget.That's not like they did in 1986.""There are a number of models on growth," Brady responded."You make a great point.Tax reform alone won't get us to a balanced budget.We have to have spending constraints along with that, and as I know, House Republicans, we are turning toward on welfare reform and tackling the entitlements in a way to save them."Economist Steve Rattner, after the Brady interview, argued that the winners in the tax plan are "business and wealthy people," not the middle class," and said the much-publicized end of the estate tax will not benefit anyone but the wealthy."Only people who have more than $11 million, die with more than that, pay that estate tax," said Rattner."When he talks about family farms and small business guys and all that stuff, it's ridiculous.It's an illusion that these are the people who benefit.They don't benefit.They don't pay estate tax."Further, said Rattner, when it comes to the middle class, under the proposed House bill, it depends on a family's circumstances about whether they will benefit."If you're a family of fewer than three kids, you get a little bit of money," Rattner said."If you're a family of three kids or more, you lose a little bit of money.The high tax states, if you're a high tax state, and 40 percent of the people in places like New York and Connecticut itemize deductions, they'll be losers."In the middle class, the best you do is get a few hundred dollars and the worst is lose money.This is not a bill about the middle class taxpayer the way they say it is on every Sunday talk show I watch."Meanwhile, Brady told Fox News' "Fox & Friends" that the proposed bill is called the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act because it seeks growth, not just lower taxes."We really go after all the incentives that are shipping our jobs overseas," the Texas Republican said."Our goal is not just to stop that, but bring them back."The tax cuts on the family level and the simplicity of the tax postcard are also important, said Brady, but "we go all in on Main Street, paycheck growth, because we have just fallen so far behind China and Europe and Canada and Mexico.It's killing our local jobs, and the paychecks that go with it."Brady said he doesn't "believe" anyone's taxes will go up, "mainly because we double the standard deduction, so that preserves more of the first dollars every family earns."Brady said he also believes taxes will go down even in high-income states, where state and local taxes are now deductible."We have been working very closely with those lawmakers," said Brady."That's why here recently, at the end, working with them, we restored the state and local property tax deduction."
This is the week Russia got very real for Donald Trump:::::(CNN) Up until this week, Donald Trump could say, with some veracity, that the special counsel investigation into Russia's attempted meddling in the 2016 election and potential collusion with his campaign hadn't produced a single tangible result.After this week, Trump can't make that claim.Or anything close to it.When we look back at the long arc of Russia's interference in last year's election, the past four days will stand out as the week that the special counsel investigation led by Robert Mueller got very real for President Trump and his political inner circle.This will be the week that this all went from a theoretical discussion of who did what wrong when and who knew what when to a deadly serious endeavor with potentially long-running impacts not just on Trump's administration but the nation more broadly.From the indictment of former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort on Monday to the forgetfulness of Attorney General Jeff Sessions revealed on Thursday, this week was a seminal one.
Wait, I thought Trump had 'one of the greatest memories of all time'?:::::(CNN) Just before jetting off on a 12-day trip to Asia Friday, reporters asked President Donald Trump what he remembered about a late March meeting in which, according to court documents, former foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos broached the idea of a meeting with Russian president Vladimir Putin, "I don't remember much about that meeting," Trump responded."It was a very unimportant meeting, took place a long time [ago], don't remember much about it."Well, OK. A president has lots and lots of meeting with lots and lots of people.It's understandable that you'd forget some every once in a while.And, while Papadopoulos reportedly broached the idea of a Trump-Putin meeting -- and Attorney General Jeff Sessions shot it down -- "unimportant" is sort of in the eye of the beholder.Unless, of course, you bragged that you had "one of the great memories of all time" a week ago.Which Trump did.Before heading to a Dallas fundraiser, Trump spoke to the press about a wide variety of subjects including his own intellect ."People don't understand, I went to an Ivy League college.I was a nice student," Trump said."I did very well.I'm a very intelligent person."Read More
DC swamp creatures lie in wait for Trump's tax bill:::::Washington (CNN) It's Donald Trump and the Republicans versus the Washington swamp's most devious predators in the legislative duel of a generation.By plunging into a majority-defining fight for tax reform, the White House and GOP leaders are pitting their wits against the most resourceful, well-funded, and experienced players of the inside Washington game.There's a reason that there's been no genuine tax reform bill passed for three decades.It's the same reason why many insiders believe that this attempt will be doomed, and eventually shrivel to the mere doling out of tax cuts.Tax reform sets up the ultimate duel between power brokers in the White House and Capitol Hill leaders, and lobbyists, special interests, industry groups, liberal campaigners, conservative think tanks, deficit hawks and any other pressure group that fears seeing a treasured tax break wither."Great Tax Cut rollout today.The lobbyists are storming Capital Hill, but the Republicans will hold strong and do what is right for America!"Trump tweeted Thursday night.Great Tax Cut rollout today.The lobbyists are storming Capital Hill, but the Republicans will hold strong and do what is right for America!"Look, tax policy today is very swampy," said Rep. Tom MacArthur, a Republican who is not sold on the bill, owing to worries about mortgage interests and property tax deductions.Within hours of the long-awaited bill being released on Thursday , some members were already feeling the heat, which will build day-by-day until the first crucial votes in the House and the Senate."Look, my phone's ringing," said Rep. Jeff Fortenberry, R-Nebraska.By Thursday evening, a collection of powerful industry groups had already lined up in an attempt to gut the legislation."Some of my best supporters, associations and stuff, don't like provisions in this tax cut," said Rep. Mike Simpson, a Republican from Idaho who has already heard opposition to the bill."Every association that I know of has come into my office and said 'you know this tax reform is really important, we got to get this done except this one provision here.'"The National Association of Home Builders did not even wait for the bill to be published, after declaring war at the weekend after learning its pet credit was under fire.The bill would cap mortgage interest deduction $500,000, down from $1 million."The House Republican tax reform plan abandons middle-class taxpayers in favor of high-income Americans and wealthy corporations," said NAHB's Granger MacDonald.The National Federation of Independent Business and National Association of Realtors also swiftly registered their displeasure."Tax hikes and falling home prices are a one-two punch that homeowners simply can't afford," said the group's William E. Brown."The nation's 1.3 million realtors cannot support a bill that takes homeownership off the table for millions of middle-class families."But another lobby was declaring victory after the pensions sector killed off a bid to limit the amount of tax free cash Americans salt away in 401K plans, that angered Trump and caused industry outrage.The contrasting fortunes of the two sectors exemplified the essential truth that every tax reform bill causes winners and losers.Sometimes the fight becomes so intense that legislative efforts simply get swamped and suffocate.Republican leaders acknowledge the fight ahead, but insist that, overall, this is a plan that will give a generational lift to the middle class, despite Democratic claims it is just another disguised giveaway to the GOP's rich friends.And if is passes it will mean more than a win for Trump.Will it may not count as draining the swamp -- his core campaign promise will certainly qualify as a win over its most dangerous inhabitants.The President played Santa for Americans as he touted the bill that represents the best remaining chance he has to wrack up a genuine legislative victory this holiday season."We are giving them a big beautiful Christmas present in the form of a tremendous tax cut," Trump said at the White House on Thursday.JUST WATCHED Tax plan name doesn't make the 'cut, cut, cut' Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Tax plan name doesn't make the 'cut, cut, cut' 01:56 Win or lose the House?But Christmas cheer for Republicans will only come if lawmakers resolve to make difficult choices and tough votes that could put careers on the line.They face a daunting choice: defend the interests of donors and interest groups or actually pass a major bill they can campaign on.Many are arguing that in a year in which Congress has yet to send the President a major accomplishment, they are going to have to grit out the K street howls or face a grim reality: the return of Democrat Nancy Pelosi as House speaker."We feel our mortality in holding office really weighing on this vote," said Rep. Tom Rooney, a Republican from Florida."Put it this way: If we don't pass this, we go into an election season without having a major piece of legislation passed with a majority in the House, the Senate and the White House.How do you go home and say 'vote for me for re-election?'We didn't do anything."The barren 10 months for the GOP majority has not just dismayed the GOP's conservative base -- it has also dampened energy from an even more vital group -- the big dollar donors who bankroll campaigns.But here again, it's the winners and losers equation that puts so much pressure on House Speaker Paul Ryan's rank-and-file.JUST WATCHED Trump kisses GOP tax postcard Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Trump kisses GOP tax postcard 00:38 Winners and losers Tax legislation is always about difficult choices.This bill clocks in at 429 pages, and while it drops the corporate rate from 35% to 20% and doubles the standard deduction for individuals -- targets of some lobbyists for years, it has to also offset the cost by closing various loopholes.That includes doing away with deductions for items like medical expenses or dozens of obscure breaks like one that allows pharmaceutical companies to write off research on rare diseases."As Congress debates and refines this important legislation, we look forward to working with lawmakers to ensure that our nation's tax code most effectively encourages innovation, investment and American entrepreneurship," the Biotechnology Innovation Organization said in a statement."This would include maintaining the Orphan Drug Tax Credit, and the inclusion of incentives for pre-revenue innovation and for the development of advanced biofuels, renewable chemicals and bio-based products."Mark Meadows, a Republican from North Carolina and chairman of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, said that members must take a 30,000-foot view.He said for example that the bill would crush the mortgage interest deduction on second homes, and his district includes parts of Asheville, and the Nantahala National Forest, a popular tourist area.As an aside, noted that the lithium battery industry was also a loser because deductions for electric cars were cut out of the bill -- another sign of the compromises a tax reform bill requires."When you look at some of those things, there will be people who will be strongly advocating and I think you have to look at it from a more holistic point of view," Meadows said.But such is the imperative for Republicans to get something, anything passed, after the debacle of their Obamacare repeal effort -- the price of failure, this time, could be higher than the price of standing up to special interests."I don't think you are going to see lobbyists win the day here where they're getting back a bunch of little carve outs for industries," said MacArthur."I don't think so."
Trump political woes to track him to Asia:::::Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump is headed to Asia.His political troubles are coming along for the ride.Trump leaves Friday on his most crucial foreign trip yet, to confront rising fears of a US war with North Korea, an increasingly bullish China and perceptions that US power has ebbed in the region since he took office.But he will struggle to escape problems haunting his presidency back home, including Robert Mueller's special counsel probe , his low approval ratings , and his failure so far to enact major legislation.On the eve of his departure, the pressures now bearing down on Trump's inner circle intensified, when it emerged that Mueller has now begun asking about his son in law Jared Kushner's role in the firing of former FBI chief James Comey -- one possible avenue of an obstruction of justice investigation.The controversy and chaos that has rocked Trump's Washington is being closely watched around the world and could influence not just how the President is perceived by foreigners, but could affect his leverage in summit talks.If there are more indictments or breaks in the Mueller inquiry in the 12 days he is away, they will be sure to overshadow the critical goals of his trip, and paint a picture of a beleaguered President shadowed by scandal.Still, if there is a silver lining for Trump, it is that expectations are low, and a strong performance overseas might just, for a while at least offer him a break from the cascade of criticism he has been facing at home.Given boiling tensions with North Korea -- and genuine fears that the US is preparing for war in Asia -- the trip would be a challenge even a president with soaring approval ratings and a wealth of experience.Worries JUST WATCHED Trump to face APEC leaders on trade Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Trump to face APEC leaders on trade 01:26 Trump's own team has expressed worries that the fallout from the Russia investigation is taking so much of his time."It is very distracting to the President as it would be to any citizen, to be investigated for something while at the same time trying to carry the weight of what being president of the United States means on his shoulders," Trump's chief of staff John Kelly told Fox News this week.It will be difficult for the President to insulate himself from any blockbuster developments that take place in the Russia probe when he is abroad, since White House reporters and foreign journalists will use press availabilities to cross examine him.That's one reason why the White House may schedule fewer news conferences than is normal for a President abroad.Most US leaders out of the country for a prolonged period look for ways to inject themselves into news programs back home.The greatest danger that Trump faces from his diminished political standing is the possibility that foreign leaders could see him as weak, and therefore susceptible to pressure.Asian leaders, especially in US-allied nations like Japan are highly attuned to the optics of the way Washington chooses to use its power in the region and to changes from one administration to another.That is one reason why it is vital for Trump to project strong imagery that might counteract worries about his political viability."The Japanese are paying very close attention to what's happening here in the United States.And in large part, of course, they're going to want the United States president to be strong and able to concentrate on what's happening in the region," said Sheila Smith, senior fellow for Japan at the Council on Foreign Relations."Anything that takes away from the strength of the US president, and for especially one like President Trump, who has embraced the US-Japan alliance so firmly, they're going to be a little bit anxious about his future."Given Trump's inexperience with regional policy, and his tendency to exacerbate controversies with his off the cuff rhetoric -- in person or on Twitter -- his temperament and behavior will be closely watched in Asia.Comforts of home JUST WATCHED What Trump has said about North Korea Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH What Trump has said about North Korea 02:05 Another complication is the length of the journey, which will challenge a man who aides say likes to sleep in his own bed and enjoys the comforts of home.The longer Trump is away, and the more tired he gets, the higher are the risks of gaffes or explosive remarks.CNN has reported that White House aides have asked for familiar food to be on hand for Trump's meals, r ather than the region's exotic cuisine, that could knock the President off balance.But there is one advantage for Trump being across the other side of the world: He will have far less exposure to the cable news coverage which appears to watch at all hours and which drives his most controversial tweets.As Trump travels between Japan, South Korea, China, Vietnam and the Philippines, he must ensure that his compromised political standing does not underscore concerns about his temperament and Asia strategy.Trump's decision to pull out of the vast Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal was widely seen as eroding US power in the region and leaving a power vacuum for China to fill.There is a sense that Washington is facing decisions that could dictate its standing in the region for decades to come and questions about whether the President appreciates the gravity of the challenge."With a rising set of players on the West Coast of the Pacific, where does America want to go?Do you want to be engaged, do you want to participate more, do you want to deepen your economic relations?"Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong asked during a trip to Washington last month "Or do you want to find some other balance, which really will leave the determination of affairs to other participants in the region?"he said at a speech at the Council on Foreign Relations.Trump is not solely to blame for the tumult in Washington, but the political paralysis and endless controversy is also raising doubts in Asia about US consistency and staying power -- anxieties that a strong performance by the President in Asia could help suppress."We have got a long way to go to fully reassure a region that is experiencing a great deal of uncertainty over US-China relations, North Korea and the ability of the US political system over the long term to deliver reliable foreign policy outcomes," said Ambassador David Shear, former assistant secretary of defense for Asia and the Pacific.
Carter Page testifies he told Sessions about Russia trip:::::(CNN) Former Trump foreign policy adviser Carter Page privately testified Thursday that he mentioned to Jeff Sessions he was traveling to Russia during the 2016 presidential campaign as new questions emerge about the attorney general's comments to Congress about Russia and the Trump campaign.During more than six hours of closed-door testimony, Page said that he informed Sessions about his coming July 2016 trip to Russia, which Page told CNN was unconnected to his campaign role.Page described the conversation to CNN after he finished talking to the House intelligence committee.Sessions' discussion with Page will fuel further scrutiny about what the attorney general knew about connections between the Trump campaign and Russia and communications about Russia that he did not disclose despite a persistent line of questioning in three separate hearings this year.Page's testimony was one of the more highly anticipated events in the congressional Russia investigations, given the scrutiny he's faced because of his connections to Russia and his visible role pushing back about his Russia ties in nationally televised interviews.Rep. Mike Conaway , the Texas Republican who is leading the House intelligence committees Russia probe, confirmed to CNN that Page told the committee he had informed Sessions about his trip, though Conaway downplayed its significance."I don't make anything sinister out of it.He said Sessions did not react or comment one way or the other," Conaway said in an interview."If I were Sessions, I wouldn't have recalled it either.It was just in passing.He was walking out of the room.A guy he had never met before, grabs him, 'Hey, I'm out on the team.I changed my travel plans to go to Russia.'"Page told CNN after the interview that he informed Sessions about the trip during a group dinner in Washington, and that he mentioned it in passing."Back in June 2016, I mentioned in passing that I happened to be planning to give a speech at a university in Moscow," Page told CNN."Completely unrelated to my limited volunteer role with the campaign and as I've done dozens of times throughout my life.Understandably, it was as irrelevant then as it is now.If it weren't for the dodgy dossier and all the chaos that those complete lies had created, my passing comment's complete lack of relevance should go without saying."Page said it was the only time he met Sessions.A source familiar with the meeting told CNN that the encounter occurred at a dinner at the Capitol Hill Club, attended by members of the Trump national security team, including Sessions.Near the end of the dinner, Page approached Sessions to say hello and thanked the then-senator for the dinner, and Page also mentioned he was headed to Russia.Sessions didn't respond and moved on to the next person waiting to shake his hand, this source said.A Justice spokesperson declined to comment.Several lawmakers from both parties described the session as meandering, at-times confusing and contradictory.Page did not have a lawyer present, which is highly unusual, lawmakers said.Conaway said that Page was "fulsome" in his answers and he answered all of the questions the committee asked.Moreover, Page reached a rare agreement to allow the committee to release a transcript of his testimony, something that will happen early next week.Some members said his testimony will help move the investigation forward, though Page told the committee that the Trump campaign made him sign a non-disclosure agreement."It was terrific to have the opportunity to help clear the record as to the falsehoods from the dodgy dossier, which started this whole thing against me in the final two months before the election," Page told reporters after his marathon session, referring to the Trump-Russia dossier produced by former British agent Christopher Steele."I'm glad the truth is finally becoming known."Page interacted with Sessions because the then-Alabama senator was leading the national security team for the Trump campaign.Sessions is already facing new questions over his testimony on Capitol Hill about Russia and the Trump campaign following the revelations this week that he rejected a meeting between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin proposed by foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos.Papadopoulos has pleaded guilty for making a false statement to the FBI about contacts with people connected with the Russian government.At a June Senate intelligence committee hearing, Sessions testified that he wasn't aware of any conversations between "anyone connected to the Trump campaign" and Russians about "any type of interference with any campaign or election in the United States."In another exchange with Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, Sessions was asked if Page met with Russian officials "at any point during the campaign.""I don't know," Sessions responded.Asked at a Senate hearing last month whether he believed Trump campaign surrogates had communications with Russians, Sessions replied, "I did not and I'm not aware of anyone else that did, and I don't believe it happened."Democrats on the Senate intelligence and judiciary committees are interested in formally asking Sessions to clarify his testimony, according to a Senate aide.Page traveled to Moscow for a few days in early July 2016, where he gave a lecture critical of US foreign policy and later met with Russians whom he described as academic scholars and business leaders.He has said that the topic of sanctions might have come up in his conversations but that he was not there as an emissary of the Trump campaign.After the trip, the FBI grew concerned that he had been compromised by Russian operatives, US officials previously told CNN The committee has asked Page to produce more documents, according to members, to comply with the subpoena they previously issued.
Bowe Bergdahl receives dishonorable discharge, avoids jail time:::::US Army Sgt.Bowe Bergdahl has received a dishonorable discharge but will avoid prison time for desertion and misbehavior before the enemy after abandoning his outpost in 2009, a military judge ruled Friday.The judge also ruled that Bergdahl's rank be reduced from sergeant to E1.Additionally, Bergdahl will be required to pay a $1,000 fine from his salary for the next 10 months.[Previous story, posted at 11:09 a.m.] A military judge has come to a decision in Sgt.Bowe Bergdahl's sentencing hearing.Journalists have been asked to return to the courtroom at Fort Bragg in North Carolina where the trial and hearings have been held.The Army soldier, who was held captive by the Taliban for five years after he deserted his Afghanistan outpost in 2009, pleaded guilty last month to charges of desertion and misbehavior before the enemy.Bergdahl was released in May 2014 in a controversial exchange for five Guantanamo Bay detainees.He originally faced the possibility of life in prison, but the prosecution asked the judge, Army Col. Jeffery R. Nance, for a 14-year sentence.Bergdahl's attorneys asked Col. Nance for a punishment of dishonorable discharge.Bergdahl previously chose to be tried by a military judge instead of a jury.Defense: Bergdahl 'should not have been in the Army' "Hypothetically, he probably should not have been in the Army," said Capt.Nina Banks, one of Bergdahl's military defense attorneys, in her closing argument.Bergdahl suffered from numerous mental illnesses, including schizotypal personality disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder, according to Dr. Charles Morgan, a forensic psychiatrist and professor at the University of New Haven and Yale University, who testified for the defense Wednesday.Morgan said Bergdahl was raised in a tense and sometimes scary household that contributed to social anxiety and cognitive defects that he was suffering from before he enlisted in the Army.The defense also argued that the information Bergdahl was able to provide upon his return -- and his willingness to share that information and cooperate with investigators -- warranted a more lenient sentence.Prosecution: Bergdahl put soldiers in danger But government prosecutors said Bergdahl was aware of the risks when he deserted, and that doing so put his fellow soldiers in danger.Soldiers who searched for Bergdahl after he deserted were called to testify by the prosecution and shared stories of the grueling conditions they endured while looking for him.One of the witnesses, Capt.John Billings, was Bergdahl's platoon leader in Afghanistan.Billings said the platoon searched for the then-private first class for 19 days, going without food or water.Retired Navy SEAL Chief Petty Officer James Hatch testified last Wednesday that he and his dog came under fire while looking for Bergdahl.He was shot in the leg, and his K-9 partner, Remco, was shot in the face and killed."I thought I was dead," said Hatch, who now walks with a heavy limp after 18 surgeries.He said he was concerned because there was little time to plan the search for Bergdahl, and other soldiers knew he had willfully walked away.JUST WATCHED Report: Bergdahl diagnosed with personality disorder Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Report: Bergdahl diagnosed with personality disorder 01:28 When asked why he would go searching for Bergdahl, Hatch said, "He is an American.""He had a mom," he added.Bergdahl tearfully apologized this week to the service members who searched for him after he deserted."My words can't take away what people have been through," he said."I am admitting I made a horrible mistake."Investigator said jail time would be 'inappropriate' Since his return home to the United States , the 31-year-old from Idaho has been the subject of scrutiny while the US military investigated his decision to leave his post.Bergdahl has said he abandoned his post because he wanted to travel to a larger base to report "a critical problem in my chain of command," though he did not specify what the problem was.He was charged with desertion and misbehavior before the enemy in March 2015.

This deduction could be a sticking point in the tax debate:::::(CNN) A cap on mortgage interest deductions proposed in the tax reform bill unveiled Thursday seemed like the one thing Republicans and Democrats could agree on.Robert Reich, who served as secretary of labor during the Clinton administration, has said the current deduction "is not fair" and "we ought to limit it," which is exactly what the new GOP plan does.The American Enterprise Institute called the policy "the best part" of a tax plan proposed by former House Ways and Means chairman Rep. David Camp that was central to previous tax reform conversations But the deduction reduction is not rainbows and sunshine to all.Disagreement over capping the mortgage interest deduction could play a central role in whether the today's Republican tax bill, the "Tax Cuts and Jobs Act," is passed as is or needs to be amended.The tax burden shifts from lowering the deduction cap could be felt disproportionately in states where Republicans are looking for support to pass a final bill.Prominent real estate agent and homebuilder trade groups are rankled and have come out with strong statements criticizing the bill.Homebuilder stocks were falling Thursday in response.Currently, Americans can deduct interest payments on their first $1 million of debt.The bill, which applies to new mortgages, sets a lower cap.Interest payments can only be deducted on the first $500,000 in loans.Analysts have pointed out that these debates may not matter nearly as much as they might have in past tax reform debates, like Camp's 2014 bill.Other changes in the bill released Thursday, such as doubling the standardized deduction most families can take and elimination of other deductions, could greatly lower the number of people who take the mortgage deduction and reduce its value.Instead, they estimate, many more tax filers will take that standard deduction, which increases under the proposal from $6,350 today to $12,000.An earlier analysis of the framework released in September that laid the groundwork for today's bill made by the Tax Policy Center found that only 4% of households would claim the mortgage interest deduction, down from 21% under current law.The House GOP proposal keeps a $10,000 deduction on property taxes In a statement , The National Association of Realtors said today's proposal appears to put "home values and middle class homeowners at risk."The National Association of Home Builders made a similar statement, saying the change "strips the tax code of its most vital homeownership tax benefit."Homebuilder stocks fell over 2% on Thursday's news.A larger issue for passing a final bill may be that the deduction is larger in coastal states, where home values are higher.Jared Walczak, a senior policy analyst at the Tax Foundation, said that those who will be affected by the mortgage deduction change will "likely reside in high-income states, and particularly coastal states."The "Tax Cuts and Jobs Act" released by the House GOP makes a concession to moderate members' states but stops from giving them everything they asked for.Members from these states wanted to restore the state and local tax deduction (SALT) in its entirety.That cut is removed from today's bill.As compromise, today's bill restores an itemized property tax deduction for up to $10,000 in taxes.Just six states -- California, New York, New Jersey, Texas, Illinois, and Florida -- claim more than 50% of the property tax deduction, according to the Tax Foundation Members from New York and New Jersey have been holdovers throughout the tax reform debate.Today's change also works to address the issue of whether the bill truly benefits the middle class more than high earners.As CNN Money's Jeanne Sahidi wrote , the majority of the SALT deductions claimed by those who make less than $50,000 come from property taxes.By contrast more than 70% of the SALT deductions from those making more than $200,000 are due to income.
Trump admin asks SCOTUS to review immigrant abortion case:::::Washington (CNN) The Trump administration on Friday asked the Supreme Court to wipe away a lower court opinion from last week that cleared the way for an undocumented 17-year-old immigrant, who is currently in US custody, to get an abortion.The Justice Department also says that the teen's lawyers at the ACLU misled the government about the timing of the abortion.Although the teen has already gotten the procedure, the Justice Department says it is concerned that the ruling by a federal appeals court based in Washington might be used for similarly situated women.The filing marks the first time the Trump administration has gone to the Supreme Court on an abortion-related case, and the briefs outline in dramatic fashion the government's take on the events that lead to the teen -- "identified as Jane Doe or J.D."-- to obtaining the procedure.The issue is not directly whether a woman has a right to an abortion.Instead, the Justice Department argues that it does not have to facilitate access to an abortion of an unaccompanied minor who was apprehended when she was unlawfully seeking to enter the United States.Read More
U.S. unemployment drops to lowest in 17 years:::::America's job market got back on its feet in October.The U.S. economy rebounded from the hurricanes and added 261,000 jobs, the best performance of the Trump administration.Unemployment inched down to 4.1%, the lowest since December 2000."This labor market is still really firing on all cylinders," says Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West in San Francisco.But wages took a step back.They grew only 2.4% in October compared with a year earlier, behind September's number.The absence of better wage growth and inflation is one of the biggest mysteries in the economy.Related: Trump nominates Jerome Powell to lead Federal Reserve The United States has added jobs for 85 straight months, the longest streak on record.The government first estimated that the economy lost 33,000 jobs in September because of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma.Revised figures show a gain of 18,000 instead.The job gains for October were across the board.Restaurants reopened after the storms, adding 89,000 jobs after losing roughly the same amount in September.Business services gained 50,000 positions.Health care firms hired 22,000 employees.Manufacturing kept growing.The industry gained 24,000 positions in October.Since the U.S. presidential election last year, manufacturing has gained a strong 156,000 jobs.Economists attribute those gains to the renewed strength of the global economy and a weak U.S. dollar, which makes American exports more affordable for foreigners to buy.Manufacturing firms rely heavily on shipping and selling abroad.Related: Trump passes over America's most powerful woman Improved technology is persuading some U.S. companies to stay local, too, experts add."The cost differences are starting to make more sense for companies to produce more goods in America," says Cathy Barrera, chief economist at ZipRecruiter.There were some concerning figures in the report.More than 700,000 Americans left the labor market in October.Although the Labor Department didn't give a reason, that could be because Baby Boomers keep retiring.So the unemployment rate dropped for what economists think of as the wrong reason -- a shrinking labor force, not just more hiring.Some industries also registered minor job losses, such as mining, which lost 2,000 workers, and retail stores, which lost 8,000.Still, the overall picture is very good -- although getting to this point after the financial crisis has been a crawl, economists point out."You can look it at as a marathon or a sprint.Other expansions were more like a sprint.This is a marathon," says Robert Frick, chief economist at the Navy Federal Credit Union.Another way to put it: "The party can go on for a lot longer.It's just not a wild party."
The race for Virginia governor: Counties you need to watch:::::Washington (CNN) An early referendum on President Donald Trump's agenda.A recently red state that has rapidly turned purple.And a potential harbinger for the 2018 midterm elections.The race for the governor's mansion in Virginia on Tuesday likely marks the most consequential race of the year: Democrat Ralph Northam and Republican Ed Gillespie are squaring off in a battle that will provide an early look at how the first 10 months of the Trump presidency have reshaped American politics.Northam, a pediatric neurologist, has served as the state's lieutenant governor the past four years under Democratic Gov.Terry McAuliffe, who can't run for another term.Gillespie is a one-time chairman of the RNC and counselor to former President George W. Bush who nearly stole Mark Warner's Senate seat in 2014 in a race few expected would be close.But Republicans will face an uphill climb: Democrats have won seven of the last eight statewide contests in Virginia, boosted by the party's overwhelming success in the Northern Virginia suburbs outside Washington.The last Republican to win statewide was Bob McDonnell, who trounced Democrat Creigh Deeds by 17 points in the 2009 gubernatorial race.Since then, Democrats have won five consecutive races all by single digits.One potential bright spot for the GOP?When McAuliffe claimed victory in the Virginia gubernatorial contest four years ago it ended a streak of nine governor's races dating back more than three decades in which Virginians elected a governor from the party opposite the one that won the White House the previous year.The race in Virginia is the only competitive gubernatorial contest this fall, barring a major turn of events in New Jersey, where polls show Democrat Phil Murphy comfortably ahead of Republican Kim Guadagno.So will voters in the commonwealth revert to form and select Northam who called President Donald Trump a "narcissistic maniac" on his way to winning the Democratic primary in June?Or will Gillespie, who has been reluctant to fully embrace the President despite echoing some of Trump's campaign themes, start a new trend by taking the governor's mansion in Richmond a year after Trump won the White House?Taken together, these past results and how they were determined provide a roadmap for looking at this year's race.Beltway Blues: Alexandria, Arlington and Fairfax It is here in voter-rich Northern Virginia the densely-populated, affluent and highly-educated suburbs a stone's throw from the nation's capital where Northam will likely need victory margins as long as the commutes in these parts if he is going to become the state's 73rd governor.The area has proved key in carrying Democrats in presidential races: Hillary Clinton outperformed Barack Obama's 2012 showing in Alexandria, Arlington and Fairfax, surpassing 75% in the first two and winning nearly 65% of the vote in Fairfax.(In 2012, Obama won roughly 70% of the vote in Alexandria and Arlington and just shy of 60% in Fairfax.)Statewide Democrats have charted a similar course to victory.McAuliffe cleared 70% in Alexandria and Arlington while falling just short of 60% in Fairfax in his 2013 defeat of Republican Ken Cuccinelli.Warner did the same in his 2014 win over Gillespie.But one big potential factor here is how much opposition to Trump might motivate Democrats to show up to the polls for Northam in an off-year race when the electorate is typically more conservative.Most previous special elections in congressional districts across the country so far this year have shown Democrats tightening margins in typical-GOP areas.In terms of raw numbers, Democrats' totals here often far surpass their statewide raw margins.McAuliffe bested Cuccinelli by more than 68,000 votes while Warner netted more than 53,000 votes against Gillespie in Fairfax alone both more than their overall statewide margins.Trump Country: Washington, Pittsylvania and Virginia Beach To offset the wide Democratic margins in Northern Virginia, Gillespie will need to run up the score in the more rural parts of of the commonwealth, particularly in the southwest and Southside regions.The southwest part of Virginia is just 300 miles from Northern Virginia as the crow flies, but culturally, it's light years away.Home to bluegrass music and spectacular views of the Blue Ridge Mountains, gospel hymns and coal mines, this economically-depressed region has shown overwhelming support for Republicans in recent elections especially Trump.The question looming here is whether voters who turned out for Trump will show up for Gillespie, a candidate with decades-long ties to the GOP establishment.Despite his need for a big showing in these counties, Gillespie has kept his distance from the President.His campaign did not retweet a Trump endorsement when he delivered it on Twitter in early October.But Gillespie is still wooing Trump voters, campaigning with Vice President Mike Pence at a rally in Abingdon, located in the southwest county of Washington.Trump won Washington County by more than 50 points with nearly 75% of the vote.McDonnell posted similar numbers in his successful 2009 run, while Mitt Romney and Cuccinelli received roughly 70% of the vote in the county with margins of more than 40 points.During his 2014 Senate run, Gillespie took 67% of the vote to defeat Warner by 35 points in the county.These small counties in the southwest don't hold as many votes as those in Northern Virginia, but there are more of them.And with margins so wide, those votes can add up for Republicans.Taking the 19 counties and four cities that make up the southwest region (using the list from the Southwest Virginia Cultural Heritage Commission) as a whole, Gillespie received about 36,000 more votes there than Warner in 2014.But, keep in mind, that is about 17,000 votes less than Warner cleared just in Fairfax.That means Gillespie will also need to build up his margins in Southside counties like Pittsylvania.He won it with 62% of the vote in 2014, but that lagged behind other Republican candidates, including McDonnell, who topped 71% in the county.Another reliably Republican piece of the Virginia map is Virginia Beach.The area doesn't provide the overwhelming margins that are found in the southwest and Southside, but there are lots of votes to be had there.With the exception of McDonnell, the other four Republican candidates Trump, Gillespie, Cuccinelli and Romney all won it by single digits.McDonnell, meanwhile, claimed the city by more than 27 points over Deeds in his big 2009 win.Swing Suburbs: Henrico, Loudoun and Prince William As is often the case in statewide races, the battle for Virginia governor this year will likely be handled in a handful of key suburbs.The two that get an outsized amount of attention in Virginia are the DC exurbs of Loudoun and Prince William and rightfully so.Both contain a large number of votes and have a fairly reliable record in predicting the winner of the race.Prince William has gone to the winner in all five races we are looking at and Loudoun has sided with the winner in four of the five.The one outlier?When Gillespie eked out a win in Loudoun by 458 votes out of more than 90,000 cast but lost the state by a hair.Clinton and McDonnell both won these counties by double digits in their wins, while McAuliffe beat Cuccinelli by single digits on his way to more narrow victory in 2013.Gillespie will likely need to keep things close here as he did in 2014 if he is going to end up with a different result.Northam, meanwhile, doesn't need a blowout here like in the Clinton-Trump matchup a year ago.But results more along the lines of Obama in 2012 or McAuliffe in 2013 instead of Warner in 2014 would be a welcome sight for the Northam campaign on Election Night.Another county to keep an eye on is Henrico, near the capital city of Richmond.Unlike in Loudoun and Prince William, Gillespie failed to keep it close there, losing by 13 points to Warner, a margin similar to the losses by Romney and Cuccinelli in the county.Trump was blown out by Clinton in Henrico by 20 points.Gillespie's double-digit defeat in 2014 translated to a gap of nearly 13,000 votes making up a good chunk of his 18,000-vote losing margin.Gillespie might not need to do as well as McDonnell in Henrico, but a stronger showing than his previous run could be consequential, especially if he is able to replicate his performance in some of the other battleground areas of Virginia.
Donald Trump laments he's 'not supposed' to influence DOJ, FBI:::::Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump said Thursday he wishes he could get involved with the Justice Department and direct it toward Hillary Clinton."The saddest thing is that because I'm the President of the United States, I am not supposed to be involved with the Justice Department," Trump said."I am not supposed to be involved with the FBI."Trump's comments on the radio program "The Larry O'Connor Show" about the Justice Department and FBI came the same week the Justice Department's special counsel investigation handed down indictments to his former campaign hands.The President responded to a suggestion from the host that his listeners want the Justice Department to go after Clinton by saying that he'd like those entities to focus on his 2016 opponent as well."I look at what's happening with the Justice Department.Well, why aren't they going after Hillary Clinton with her emails and with her, the dossier?"Trump said, referring to the law firm Perkins Coie saying it had paid Fusion GPS to compile a dossier of information on Trump and Russia on behalf of Clinton's presidential campaign and the Democratic National Committee.Read More
Campaign adviser says Trump listened to Papadopoulos and 'heard him out':::::Washington (CNN) A former Trump campaign adviser says Donald Trump listened to George Papadopoulos when he presented the idea of a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin."He heard him out," JD Gordon, a campaign national security adviser who attended the March 31, 2016 meeting, told CNN Thursday.Asked about the meeting on Friday, Trump told reporters at the White House, "it was a very unimportant meeting, took place a long time, don't remember much about it."CNN reported Wednesday that Trump did not dismiss the idea of arranging a meeting with Russia's president when it was suggested in a meeting with his campaign foreign policy advisers last year.But the chairman of Trump's national security team, then Alabama senator and now attorney general Jeff Sessions, shut down the idea of a Putin meeting at the March 31, 2016, gathering, according to a person in the room.His reaction was confirmed with another source who had discussed Sessions' role.Read More
Trump says he doesn't 'remember much' from Papadopoulos meeting:::::Story highlights "I don't remember much about that meeting," Trump said Trump told reporters last month that he had "one of the greatest memories of all time" Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump said Friday that he didn't "remember much" about the now controversial March 2016 meeting with his foreign policy advisers, including George Papadopoulos.In the clearest connection between the campaign and Russian efforts to meddle in the 2016 election, Papadopoulos pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about interactions with foreign officials close to the Russian government, according to court documents unsealed this week."I don't remember much about that meeting," Trump said on the South Lawn before leaving for his five-country, 12-day trip in Asia."It was a very unimportant meeting, took place a long time, don't remember much about it."The comment is the latest example of Trump claiming not to remember certain moments or meetings from his 2016 campaign and time in the White House, despite telling reporters last month that he had "one of the greatest memories of all time."During the meeting, according to the court documents, Papadopoulos said that "he had connections that could help arrange a meeting between then-candidate Trump and (Russia President Vladimir Putin)."Read More
Warren says DNC system was rigged in Hillary Clinton's favor:::::Washington (CNN) Sen. Elizabeth Warren said she believes that the Democratic National Committee was "rigged" in favor of former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton during the 2016 primary.Asked Thursday by CNN's Jake Tapper whether she believes that the Democratic campaign organization was tipped in favor of Clinton over her primary opponent, independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, Warren responded without hesitation: "Yes.""We learned today from the former Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Donna Brazile that the Clinton campaign, in her view, did rig the presidential nominating process by entering into an agreement to control day-to-day operations at the DNC," Tapper said, continuing on to describe specific arms of the DNC the Clinton camp had a say over, including strategy and staffing, noting that the agreement was "entered into in August of 2015," months before Clinton won the nomination.Warren called that "a real problem.""But what we've got to do as Democrats now is we've got to hold this party accountable," Warren said.Read More
Jeff Sessions keeps forgetting and forgetting and forgetting about Russia and the 2016 election:::::(CNN) Jeff Sessions' memory isn't exactly stellar.Particularly when it comes to what he knew about interactions between President Donald Trump's campaign and Russia.That's a problem -- especially when you are the nation's top law enforcement official.Here are threeoccasions -- collected by the one and only Marshall Cohe n -- in which Sessions either forgot or misremembered important details about contacts between Russia and Trumpworld.1.January 10, 2017 In his confirmation hearing in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Sessions is asked this by Minnesota's Al Franken: "If there is any evidence that anyone affiliated with the Trump campaign communicated with the Russian government in the course of this campaign, what will you do?"Sessions responds: "I'm not aware of any of those activities.I have been called a surrogate at a time or two in that campaign and I did not have communications with the Russians, and I'm unable to comment on it."2.January 17, 2017 In response to a written questionnaire Sessions submitted as part of the confirmation process, he responded "no" to this question from Vermont Sen. Patrick Leahy (D): "Have you been in contact with anyone connected to any part of the Russian government about the 2016 election, either before or after election day?"Why this is wrong : We know that on at least two occasions Sessions met with then-Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak during the campaign.The first came on July 20, 2016 at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland -- when the two men (plus Carter Page!)met at a diplomacy and foreign affairs event.Then on September 8, 2016, Sessions met with Kislyak in his Senate office.Sessions said that meeting was in his formal capacity as a senator as opposed to his role as a Trump surrogate and, therefore, he didn't perjure himself.(Side note: On his forms applying for a security clearance in November 2016, Sessions also did not disclose any interactions with Kislyak.)3.October 18, 2017 Sessions again testifies before the Senate Judiciary Committee.Franken, again, asks him a tough question: "You don't believe that surrogates from the Trump campaign had communications with the Russians?Is that what you're saying?"Sessions responds: "I did not and I'm not aware of anyone else that did, and I don't believe it happened."Why this is wrong : Page says he told Sessions that he was going to Russia in July 2016.And Sessions intervened when Papadopoulos bragged that he could set up a meeting with Russian officials as far back as the end of March 2016.The Sessions defense goes something like this: He forgot about his meetings with Kislyak because they were either brief or not related to his role as a surrogate for the Trump campaign.Page told him he was going to Russia in an unofficial capacity.And so on and so forth.(Side note: I can't figure out a smart Sessions defense of the Papadopoulos meeting and suggestion of a Russia trip.)The point is that if you look at all of these things in just the right light, Sessions is being totally honest and transparent -- in both his public and private statements.But, if you don't see them in just that light, there's a WHOLE lot of smoke swirling around the attorney general right now."I forgot" might work once.Maybe even twice.Three times?Eh, no.Think of it this way.Your sixth grader forgets his homework at school one time.Chances are, you are willing to chalk it up to being an honest mistake.When he forgets his homework the second time, you are less convinced it's just by chance.When he forgets it the third time, you are totally sure that he is forgetting his homework on purpose.'This is at least Sessions' third time forgetting his homework.And the likes of Franken aren't going to simply accept the "whoops" excuse.
Jared Kushner's team turned over documents to special counsel in Russia investigation:::::(CNN) Jared Kushner has turned over documents in recent weeks to special counsel Robert Mueller as investigators have begun asking in witness interviews about Kushner's role in the firing of FBI Director James Comey, CNN has learned.Mueller's investigators have expressed interest in Kushner, President Donald Trump's son-in-law and a White House senior adviser, as part of its probe into Russian meddling, including potential obstruction of justice in Comey's firing, sources familiar with the matter said.Their questions about Kushner signal that Mueller's investigators are reaching the President's inner circle and have extended beyond the 2016 campaign to actions taken at the White House by high-level officials.It is not clear how Kushner's advice to the President might relate to the overall Russia investigation or potential obstruction of justice.Sources close to the White House say that based on their knowledge, Kushner is not a target of the investigation.Kushner voluntarily turned over documents he had from the campaign and the transition, and these related to any contacts with Russia, according to a source familiar with the matter.The documents are similar to the ones Kushner gave to congressional investigators.Read More
How one word from Elizabeth Warren exposed the massive split in the Democratic Party:::::That was Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren's response to a simple question asked by CNN's Jake Tapper Thursday night : "Senator, do you agree with the notion that (the 2016 Democratic primary) was rigged?"And with that single word, a largely behind-the-scenes feud -- over not just how the 2016 election was lost but also where the Democratic Party needs to go before 2020 -- broke out into the public eye in a major way.First, some context.Warren was responding to book excerpts published in Politico Thursday by Donna Brazile, the chair of the Democratic National Committee, detailing the final months of the 2016 campaign.In the essay, Brazile alleges that the DNC was wholly owned by Hillary Clinton and her campaign prior to the party's presidential nomination being decided -- the result of a fundraising agreement cut between the party committee and Clinton's team.Writes Brazile: "The funding arrangement with [Hillary For America] and the victory fund agreement was not illegal, but it sure looked unethical.If the fight had been fair, one campaign would not have control of the party before the voters had decided which one they wanted to lead.This was not a criminal act, but as I saw it, it compromised the party's integrity."In essence, Brazile is saying that because Clinton helped raised massive amounts of money through state parties for the DNC, the candidate and her team were given operational control over the party committee before Clinton was the actual nominee.The Brazile allegations confirm the long-held suspicions of Sanders supporters who were convinced during the campaign that the party establishment's thumb was always on the scale for Clinton.And that the party apparatus worked to keep Sanders from having a fair chance at winning the Democratic nomination because, well, they didn't like him.The forces aligned with Clinton and those aligned with Sanders have been sniping at one another ever since the 2016 primary ended that June.While they have found a common enemy in Trump, the ill will has never really gone away.The Clinton people -- up to and including the candidate herself -- believe Sanders' attacks on her during the primary hurt her chances against Trump in the general election.In her account of the 2016 campaign "What Happened," Clinton wrote that Sanders "had to resort to innuendo and impugning my character" because they largely agreed on the issues.She also wrote that Sanders' attacks inflicted "lasting damage" on her campaign and opened the door for Trump's "Crooked Hillary" label.The Sanders crowd, on the other hand, thinks Clinton won only because the system was rigged against him.The leak of hacked emails from top officials at the DNC on the eve of the Democratic convention in July 2016 seemed to confirm some of those suspicions.The staffers questioned Sanders' religiosity, attacked Sanders' campaign manager Jeff Weaver and leaned in favor of big-dollar donors rather than the small-dollar army Sanders had built.DNC chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz was forced to leave her post as a result.But in the midst of the general election campaign, Sanders, Weaver and most of the other top staff on Sanders' campaign urged the party to move on."This happened, we knew it happened then, now is the time to go forward," Weaver said on CNN at the time ."Now is the time to elect Hillary Clinton and defeat Donald Trump."To have Warren -- someone that liberals pleaded with to enter the 2016 race and who remains a folk hero in the progressive community -- confirm in no uncertain terms that she believes the whole Democratic primary fight was rigged is stunning.Sanders hasn't even said that!This all matters hugely because Sanders and Warren are two of the favorites to be the Democratic nominee in 2020.Both are voices insisting that the party needs to confront Trump and Trumpism at every turn, back things like single-payer health insurance and generally embrace the word "liberal."Brazile's book -- and Warren's "yes" -- amounts to spraying a can of lighter fluid onto a bonfire burning between liberals and the establishment.And it's only going to get hotter from here on out.
US tries to block entry request for Russian lawyer at Trump Tower meeting:::::(CNN) US prosecutors have objected to an entry request for Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya, who became known for attending the June 2016 meeting with Donald Trump Jr. at Trump Tower.Veselnitskaya, an attorney for Cyprus-based company Prevezon Holdings and its Russian owner, Denis Katsyv, asked for immigration parole, an alternative to the visa process, to attend a hearing to finalize a $5.9 million civil forfeiture settlement reached with the US attorney's office for the Southern District of New York.US authorities have accused Prevezon as being a front for a money-laundering operation that moved cash out of Russia and washed the money through Manhattan real estate."The government's position here -- that immigration parole is unwarranted in the absence of a concrete and imminent need for testimony -- is thus consistent with the regulations and its previous positions in this case," a lawyer for the government wrote in a letter to the judge overseeing the case Thursday.The government lawyers said they previously denied visa requests in the case, including one made in spring 2016.The lawyers learned from news reports that Veselnitskaya later received a visa from the State Department.The same day she attended oral arguments in an appeal relating to the Prevezon case, she also went to Trump Tower to meet top Trump campaign officials.Attending the Trump Tower meeting was Trump Jr., then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort and Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner.British music publicist Rob Goldstone, Veselnitskaya, Russian-American lobbyist Rinat Akhmetshin, translator Anatoli Samochornov and Ike Kaveladze, who works for the Russian oligarch who initiated the meeting, were also there.The June meeting is now an area of inquiry in Justice Department special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into whether anyone from the Trump campaign colluded with Russians to influence the election.Multiple committees on Capitol Hill are also investigating the meeting and interviewing key players.In a footnote to the letter, the government attorneys signaled the June meeting may be grounds for denying future visa requests."The government may not, however, again admit Veselnitskaya into the country to assist in witness preparation if she is not herself a witness.Although the government did so previously, Veselnitskaya's reported meeting with presidential campaign officials in June of 2016 (of which this Office was not aware prior to its public reporting) or other factors may alter this assessment."Prevezon was accused of stealing $1.9 million from the Russian Treasury through $230 million tax refund fraud scheme that was laundered through real estate.The alleged scheme was uncovered by Sergei Magnitsky, a Russian lawyer hired by Bill Browder's Hermitage Capital Management.Magnitsky was later jailed by the Russian government and later died in a Moscow prison under suspicious circumstances.The US passed the Magnitsky Act in 2012, which imposed sanctions Russians accused of violating human rights.Russia responded by banning adoptions by Americans.Kaveladze is scheduled to appear before the House intelligence committee Thursday.Veselnitskaya previously told CNN in a text that she would appear before the Senate committee conducting its own investigation."Yes, I'm ready, if I will be provided with guarantees for my safety.I do not intend to say anything more, on the advice of my lawyers," she texted CNN.She previously told The Wall Street Journal that she has a relationship with Russian Prosecutor General Yuri Chaika and that they exchanged information during her lobbying efforts against the Magnitsky Act.Veselnitskaya's talking points for the meeting obtained by CNN show her focus was on the sanctions -- a matter of significant interest to the Kremlin -- with only a passing mention to the Clinton campaign.Emails leading up to the meeting indicated that the "crown prosecutor of Russia" wanted to get information about Hillary Clinton to Trump's team.Trump Jr. has downplayed the meeting, telling the Senate judiciary committee, "To the extent they had information concerning the fitness, character or qualifications of a presidential candidate, I believed that I should at least hear them out."Veselnitskaya denies that she has ever worked for the Russian government, and a Kremlin spokesman said the notion was "absurd."Prevezon had a Monday deadline to pay $5.9 million as part of the settlement but notified the court that its recently unfrozen assets were frozen again by the government of the Netherlands as part of a separate investigation.Prevezon did not admit to any wrongdoing as part of the settlement.
Trump to be Trump in Asia, says adviser, won't moderate rhetoric on North Korea:::::Story highlights "The President will use whatever language he wants to use, obviously," McMaster said He also told reporters that Trump is considering putting North Korea back on the list of state sponsors of terrorism (CNN) Ahead of President Donald Trump's five-country, 12-day trip to Asia, his top national security adviser is making one thing clear: The President won't be moderating his language in the region.National Security Adviser H.R.McMaster told reporters on Thursday, less than 24 hours before the President departs for his trip, that Trump doesn't plan to change his bellicose rhetoric on North Korea even though he will be nearby when he visits Japan, South Korea and China."The President will use whatever language he wants to use, obviously," McMaster said."I don't think the President really modulates his language.I mean, have you noticed him do that?He has been very clear about that."Trump has reacted to North Korea's saber-rattling and missile tests with combative rhetoric and pledges to respond with "fire and fury."The rhetoric has not alleviated tensions in the region and has left some critics questioning whether the President underestimated North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.McMaster noted that while he has seen the criticism of Trump's rhetoric, he countered that it is only North Korea's activities that are inflammatory.Read More

Trump claims increased military action after NYC attack:::::Story highlights Trump did not explain the nature of what he said was the increased military action ISIS claimed some responsibility Thursday for the attack Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump claimed Friday morning that the United States military is hitting ISIS "much harder" after an alleged ISIS-inspired attacker drove a truck down a bike lane in New York, killing eight, though he didn't provide any evidence.Trump, in a series of tweets ahead of his five-country, 12-day trip to Asia, labeled the accused attacker, 29-year-old Uzbek national Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov, a "Degenerate Animal.""ISIS just claimed the Degenerate Animal who killed, and so badly wounded, the wonderful people on the West Side, was 'their soldier,'" Trump wrote on Twitter."Based on that, the Military has hit ISIS 'much harder' over the last two days.They will pay a big price for every attack on us!"Trump did not explain the nature of what he said was the increased military action.He doubled down on those comments while speaking to reporters at the White House Friday morning, saying his administration will hit ISIS "10 times harder" every time ISIS attacks the United States.He said the military action "took place yesterday" but did not provide further explanation.Read More
Trump touts relationship with 'warrior nation' Japan ahead of Asia trip:::::Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump reiterated his support for Japan, which he called a "warrior nation," in an interview ahead of his five-country, 12-day trip to Asia.He added that he understands the US ally's concerns over North Korea's nuclear ambitions."I think this is one of the more important trips a President has made," Trump said.Despite an escalating war of words with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in recent months, the US President on Thursday struck an optimistic tone on a potential solution for the ongoing crisis in an interview with Fox News' Laura Ingraham, saying that it is "a thing that I think we will solve.""They should be worried," Trump said, citing Japan's close proximity to North Korea."I tell China, and I tell everyone else that listens, I mean, you're going to have yourself a big problem with Japan pretty soon if you allow this to continue with North Korea."The United States has maintained a significant military presence near the Korean peninsula ahead of Trump's visit to the region next week.The Pentagon has also flexed its muscles in North Korea's backyard in recent weeks.Read More
Trump nominee for top Agriculture post withdraws amid Russia probe:::::Story highlights Trump had picked Clovis for the position despite him not having a background in science Sources told CNN that Clovis' nomination was imperiled over his connections to the ongoing Russia probe (CNN) Sam Clovis, President Donald Trump's nominee to be the Department of Agriculture's chief scientist, withdrew himself from consideration Thursday, the White House announced."We respect Mr. Clovis' decision to withdraw his nomination," White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said in a statement to pool reporters.Trump had picked Clovis for the position despite him not having a background in science, and that lack of experience, alongside a history of racially charged and homophobic comments, made his nomination particularly controversial.But sources told CNN earlier Thursday that Clovis' nomination was imperiled over his connections to the ongoing Russia probe.The development is the latest sign that Justice Department special counsel Robert Mueller's probe into the Trump campaign and Russian collusion is impacting the day-to-day of Trump's administration, despite top White House aides -- including Trump himself -- claiming that the indictments of former top Trump campaign advisers Paul Manafort and Rick Gates had nothing to do with the administration or the campaign."The political climate inside Washington has made it impossible for me to receive balanced and fair consideration for this position," Clovis wrote in a letter addressed to Trump that was dated Wednesday."The relentless assaults on you and your team seem to be a blood sport that only increases in intensity each day.As I am focused on your success and the success of this administration, I do not want to be a distraction or negative influence, particularly with so much important work left to do for the American people."Read More
Trump reignites long-simmering Guantanamo debate:::::Washington (CNN) More than 15 years after it accepted its first war on terror detainees, Guantanamo Bay is once again at the center of a political firestorm, as President Donald Trump is learning, like his predecessor, that making big changes in US detention policy is harder than it looks.Even within the administration, there are mixed messages about whether there is trust in criminal courts to handle terrorism.In the wake of a deadly terrorist attack in New York earlier this week, Trump on Wednesday suggested he'd be open to holding the suspect, a 29-year-old Uzbek national who has lived in the United States since 2010, as an enemy combatant at the Cuba facility nicknamed Gitmo."Send him to Gitmo.I would certainly consider that," Trump said at a Cabinet meeting on Wednesday."We need quick justice and we need strong justice -- much quicker and much stronger than we have right now.Because what we have right now is a joke, and it's a laughingstock."The suspect, Sayfullo Saipov, was later charged in federal courts in New York, and Trump backtracked on Thursday, saying he recognized that Guantanamo may actually mean a slower process."Would love to send the NYC terrorist to Guantanamo but statistically that process takes much longer than going through the Federal system..." Trump tweeted, adding: "...There is also something appropriate about keeping him in the home of the horrible crime he committed.Should move fast.DEATH PENALTY!"Would love to send the NYC terrorist to Guantanamo but statistically that process takes much longer than going through the Federal system... Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 2, 2017 Even so, Trump's attorney general, Jeff Sessions, on Thursday left open the possibility that Guantanamo detention could remain an option."Terrorists should know: This administration will use all lawful tools at our disposal, including prosecution in Article III courts and at Guantanamo Bay," Sessions' prepared speech in New York said."If anyone has any doubt about that, they can ask the more than 500 criminals whom the Department of Justice has convicted of terrorism-related offenses since 9/11.And they can ask the dozens of enemy combatants in Guantanamo Bay."South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, a noted hawk, originally praised the President for considering detaining Saipov, then harshly criticized the change of heart and decision to charge him in federal courts."If there was ever a candidate to be held as an enemy combatant for intelligence gathering purposes, it is Sayfullo Saipov -- a self-declared 'Soldier of the Caliphate,'" Graham said in a statement.But in further evidence of the internal struggle of the administration, Sessions was introduced by Joon Kim, acting US attorney for the Southern District of New York who on Wednesday, after the "laughingstock" comments, forcefully defended the success of the civilian courts."The folks in that unit working with the (New York Police Department) and the (Joint Terrorism Task Force) have a long and unblemished track record of successfully investigating and prosecuting domestic and international terrorists," Kim said.The battle echoes a fight by Trump's predecessor, President Barack Obama, in trying to transform US policy on Guantanamo.Coming into office with a promise to close the detention facility, Obama never succeeded, and ended up having to continue to operate and legally defend practices there.Obama did wind down use of the facility and transferred many prisoners out of it, and didn't send any further detainees to Guantanamo.There were 41 detainees at Guantnamo Bay as of August 2017.Murky legal battle Experts say Trump pursuing Guantanamo detention in this case, where a US resident was arrested on US soil, would open a potentially unwise legal battle for the administration, and that it might only expose the ongoing challenges of the military commissions hearing cases there."There are three layers here," said Steve Vladeck, University of Texas School of Law professor and CNN legal contributor."I think the first is, is it legal?The second is, is it necessary?And the third is, it is wise?And I think we're 0 for 3."Courts have not ruled on whether the current Authorization of Military Force would apply to ISIS or whether a person arrested on US soil could be held at Guantanamo, both major legal challenges such a detention would face, Vladeck said.Additionally, civilian courts are able to handle terror trials and waive Miranda rights in exigent circumstances, undercutting the necessity, he added.And, as Trump acknowledged Thursday, the Guantanamo process tends to be slow."If your goal is to actually get justice for the victims, Guantanamo is a black hole, whereas the civilian courts are there, they're fast, their legitimacy is not regularly questioned," Vladeck said.More controversy at Gitmo Columbia Law professor Matthew Waxman served in the Bush administration and specifically worked on Guantanamo Bay detention, and largely agreed with Vladeck that detaining Saipov would probably accomplish more harm than good.He also noted that this week is a particularly controversial time to advocate for expanding Guantanamo's use.The Marine Corps general who oversees war court defense teams at the station was found guilty this week of contempt for disobeying orders by a military judge and sentenced to 21 days confinement "(Trump) seems totally oblivious to the fact that the military commission system, which has already faced many delays, is just this week suffering another meltdown, so the idea that Guantanamo -- military commissions at Guantanamo -- a form of swift justice, is badly mistaken," Waxman said.Both Trump and Obama, Waxman said, may have overestimated political support for their desired goal with Gitmo."I think they're both going to face realities that they weren't anticipating," he said.In the meantime, the Guantanamo Bay limbo is likely to carry on."I expect Guantanamo to continue looking a lot like it does now," Waxman said."Especially absent a new Authorization of the Use of Military Force from Congress, I don't expect many new detainees to be sent to Guantanamo, I don't expect military commissions to run smoothly in prosecuting detainees who are there, (and) I don't expect many detainees to be transferred from Guantanamo.I think for the foreseeable future, Guantanamo will look like it does now."
Trump signs bill into law honoring Frederick Douglass:::::Story highlights The law would honor Douglass' life with events and programs next year "Frederick Douglass is an example of somebody who's done an amazing job and is being recognized more and more, I notice," Trump said in February Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump on Thursday signed a bill into law setting up a commission to honor the 200th anniversary of Frederick Douglass' birth next year.The law commends the 19th Century abolitionist leader for a life dedicated to fighting injustice, and states, "all Americans could benefit from studying the life of Frederick Douglass, for Douglass dedicated his own life to ensuring freedom and equality for future generations of Americans."It sets up a commission to execute programs to honor Douglass next year, marking the bicentennial of his birth in 2018.The White House issued a statement by Trump anticipating the "valuable work" of that commission."I look forward to working with the commission to celebrate the achievements of this great man," the President's statement said.Read More
Melania Trump to be protected by special all-female Japanese police squad:::::Story highlights Squad goals: Melania Trump and female dignitaries protected on Japan trip by all-woman police team Expert: It's not uncommon for foreign countries to assist with protection while president is overseas Japan's female unit wearing sleek black suits instead of uniforms (CNN) The Japanese police department in Tokyo has put together an all-female squad of officers for specific assignment to first lady Melania Trump and other visiting female dignitaries, including presidential adviser Ivanka Trump, according to a report.The first lady arrives in Japan on Sunday for a two-day visit with President Donald Trump; Ivanka Trump landed in Tokyo on Thursday.The female police unit, dressed in smart black suits with white button-down shirts, practiced their moves in front of Tokyo's Imperial Palace for the media on Wednesday, brushing up on defensive maneuvers and drills.Female police officers wearing suits take part in a training on November 1 in Tokyo."Typically, by providing this sort of unit, law enforcement is trying to be respectful and not too intrusive," explained CNN law enforcement analyst Jonathan Wackrow, a former agent with United States Secret Service who was assigned to the presidential protection unit."They think it's more welcoming to have an all-female crew, and it's not uncommon."Wackrow recalls visits to Asian countries during his time on then-first lady Michelle Obama's detail where all-female units were also deployed.The Japanese unit used for this trip was initially put together as part of preparation and training for the 2020 Summer Olympic games, which will be held in Tokyo."Operationally, these support forces are minimal to the actual security program of the United States Secret Service," Wackrow said."They aren't relied on for any emergency action."In other words, should anything happen to a principle protectee, such as the first lady, the Secret Service detail assigned to her is the primary line of defense.Wackrow, however, notes that local law enforcement on the ground does a great service for large travel operations such as the one Trump is undertaking next week in Asia."They provide an essential role in helping gain access, for help with language barriers and for general support," Wackrow said.

'Sorry, That Page Doesn't Exist': Twitter Employee Shut Down Trump Account on Last Day of Work:::::For a short time Thursday evening, Twitter appeared to lose one of its most avid users: The page for the @realDonaldTrump account displayed an error message.Twitter's standard error message, "Sorry, that page doesn't exist!"appeared in place of President Donald Trump's personal Twitter feed.A short time later, the account page reappeared and seemed to be functioning as normal.According to the company's @TwitterGov account, @realDonaldTrump was deactivated by "a Twitter customer support employee who did this on the employees last day.""We are conducting a full internal review," Twitter tweeted.The account was down for 11 minutes, Twitter said, and that the company is investigating and taking steps to prevent it from happening again.The White House had no immediate comment, but Trump tweeted about it Friday morning: "I guess the word must finally be getting out-and having an impact."In May 2009, Trump, then a private businessman, sent his first tweet promoting a forthcoming appearance on the Late Show with David Letterman, the BBC reported.
Ex-Illinois Gov. Blagojevich Again Appeals Conviction:::::Former Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich is making one more attempt to get out of prison early.Thursday his lawyers filed a petition with the US Supreme Court.NBC 5 Investigates' Phil Rogers has the details on his pleas for freedom.(Published Thursday, Nov. 2, 2017) Former Illinois Gov.Rod Blagojevich filed a petition Thursday with the United States Supreme Court, challenging the conviction on which he is currently serving a 14-year sentence in federal prison.The Blagojevich appeal rests on two main pillars: that he never violated campaign laws as defined in a previous landmark Supreme Court case, and that his sentence was especially harsh compared with other politicians who have been jailed on corruption charges.Indeed, Blagojevich maintains that his sentence is more than twice as long as the penalties levied on others found guilty of the same, or even more egregious, conduct.And he insists under the Courts decision in a case known as McCormick v. the United States, none of his fundraising activities should have been considered illegal.The McCormick case said that in order to have committed a corrupt act, a politician must have made an explicit promise that he would commit to an official act in exchange for the donors campaign money.Another decision, Evans v. the United States, permits conviction based on an implied promise of an official act.In asking the Supreme Court to take the former governors case, Blagojevich attorney Leonard Goodman argues the time is right for the court to clear up the rules once and for all.The majority of circuits to have considered the question, treat McCormick as setting the standard for campaign contribution cases, Goodman writes, arguing that the looser Evans standard applies to bribes or favors offered for non-campaign related payments.The location of the line between lawful campaign solicitation and felony extortion is a question of undeniable practical importance to candidates throughout the country, Goodman argues.The present uncertainty also implicates constitutional concerns of the highest order.From the prison where he has served more than five years of his sentence, Blagojevich still maintains he did nothing wrong.I was always careful in fundraising, to stay on the right side of the line, the former governor told NBC5 in July, his first interview since entering federal custody.Its a very simple rule---you cant promise anything in exchange for a campaign contribution, and I didnt!Blagojevich has long insisted that his jury received improper instructions, and that the governing McCormick standard was never properly applied in his case.The prosecutors listened to all the tapes, they knew there were no specific promises, he said.So instead, what they did was they moved the line on me, they convicted meon a lesser standard that moved the McCormick line.The petition marks Blagojevichs second trip to the Supreme Court.After his first petition, prosecutors successfully argued that the appellate process had not been fully exhausted.Our petition lays out a compelling case that the Supreme Court needs to settle the confusion among federal courts about the dividing line between campaign fundraising, something all elected officials are required to do (unless they are billionaires), and the federal crimes of extortion and bribery, Goodman told NBC5.The prosecutors in this case took advantage of this confusion to impose one of the most severe sentences ever handed out in a political corruption case to a governor who never sought a bribe or a kickback and never took a penny from his campaign fund for his personal use.Failing at the high court, the former governors only avenue to freedom would be a petition for commutation of his sentence, currently pending before President Donald Trump.

Sessions Rejected Russian Proposal by Campaign Adviser, Source Says:::::Attorney General Jeff Sessions is sworn in to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Capitol Hill in Washington, Oct. 18, 2017.Attorney General Jeff Sessions rejected a proposal by a junior campaign aide who offered to use his "Russian contacts" to try to set up a meeting between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin, a source familiar with the matter told NBC News.Former Trump campaign aide George Papadapoulos, has pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI, and documents released Monday show he was in contact with Russians who offered him "dirt" including thousands of emails on Hillary Clinton, NBC News reported.This revelation is a significant one, because Sessions told Congress under oath in June that he had "no knowledge" of any conversations by anyone connected to the Trump campaign about "any type of interference with any campaign" by Russians.In a letter to Sessions on Thursday, Sen.

'Let's Get to Work': Inaugural Obama Summit Wraps in Chicago:::::The two-day Obama Foundation Summit wrapped up Wednesday night inside the new Wintrust Arena in the South Loop 500 people came here from 60 countries to get inspired to make positive changes in their communities.Patrick Fazio reports.(Published Thursday, Nov. 2, 2017) 'Let's Get to Work': Obama Summit Wraps Up in Chicago The inaugural, two-day Obama Foundation Summit wrapped up Wednesday night inside Chicago's new Wintrust Arena in the South Loop, with 500 people coming from 60 countries to be inspired to make positive changes in their communities."If nothing else, take from this summit the sense that you are able to transform the world," former President Barack Obama told the audience.Obama told the crowd to believe in themselves but limit their time online."Constantly checking, seeing whats next, its tough to sustain things," he cautioned.The grand finale of the summit included music from Chicago natives Common and Chance the Rapper.Gloria Estefan and "Hamilton" creator Lin-Manuel Miranda also made appearances.Miranda spoke on the continuing crisis in Puerto Rico and shared the stage with Common.Former first lady Michelle Obama warned against over-sharing on social media."You don't tweet every thought, she said, explaining that "first initial thoughts are not worthy of the light of day."However, she clarified that she wasn't "talking about anybody in particular."Michelle Obama also gave advice on raising daughters and sexual harassment."If we don't teach our young girls to speak at an early age, that doesn't just happen, it takes practice to have a voice," she said.Former Vice President Joe Biden came to Chicago as well to encourage people to speak up against neo-Nazis who marched in Charlottesville."The same anti-semetic bile that brought down Europe ... silence is complicity," he said.Sharing these ideas with others is the goal of the Obama Summit."Let's get to work," Barack Obama said before leaving the stage.Obama added that "this is just the beginning," but there were no official announcements of future summits.
Hillary Clinton on Trump's Lack of Empathy, the Steele Dossier, and Misogyny in America:::::President Donald Trump responded to a week's worth of political criticisms and controversies as he made his way from Washington, D.C., to Texas.He called Hillary Clinton and the DNC's link to the infamous Trump Dossier "a disgrace," claimed Jeff Flake had no chance at reelection and told reporters that he was "really nice" to Gold Star widow Myeshia Johnson during a consolation call despite contrary claims.(Published Wednesday, Oct. 25, 2017) Hillary Clinton on Wednesday night defended her campaign's funding of the Steele dossier that alleged ties between Donald Trump and the Kremlin, and also said the American people should have known the FBI was investigating the Trump campaign before the presidential election.Clinton appeared on "The Daily Show" to promote her book, "What Happened," and she was asked by host Trevor Noah if she thinks there is a difference between the Democratic National Committee and her campaign lawyer's funding of the research that led to the dossier and members of Trump's campaign working with the Russians to influence the election."Of course there is, and I think most serious people understand that," Clinton said."This was research started by a Republican donor during the Republican primary and then when Trump got the nomination for the Republican party the people doing it came to my campaign lawyer and said, 'Would you like us to continue it?'And he said yes," Clinton said."He's an experienced lawyer, he knows what the law is, he knows what opposition research is."The Washington Free Beacon, a conservative website, first paid political research firm Fusion GPS for opposition research into Trump in 2015 and ended its relationship after Trump secured the GOP nomination the following year, The Associated Press reported.Clinton campaign lawyer Marc Elias then retained the firm, which later hired former British spy Christopher Steele for its research.Trump has called it a "disgrace" that Democrats paid for the research.The bigger problem according to Clinton, which she writes about in her book, is that the American people were not aware of the FBI's investigation of ties between the Trump campaign and Russia until after the election."I know that voters should have had that information, that's something that may have influenced some people.And its part of what happens in a campaign, where you get information that may or may not be useful and you try to make sure anything you put out into the public arena is accurate.So this thing didnt come out until after the election and its still being evaluated.But the fact of the FBI investigation into the Trump campaign and Russia should have come out.Clinton also criticized how Trump responds in difficult situations, the latest being the New York City terror attack on Tuesday that left eight people dead and a dozen injured."He just doesn't have any empathy," she said of Trump, adding, "You can disagree with someone over all kinds of partisan issues but you want a president who can try to put himself into the shoes, the feelings of someone else, and he has not been able to do that."Clinton's appearance comes nearly one month after news broke about sexual assault allegations against film producer Harvey Weinstein.Noah lamented that misogyny and sexism undoubtedly cost Clinton some votes.Clinton agreed."Sexism and misogyny are endemic in our society, not just politics," she said."The only way to get sexism out of politics is to get more women into politics."

Kelly's Civil War Comments Blasted as 'Absurd' and 'Dangerous':::::White House chief of staff John Kelly made some controversial comments about the Civil War during a recent interview with Fox News.White House chief of staff John Kelly's comments on the Civil War have prompted an uproar among prominent figures such as Ta-Nehisi Coates and Bernice King, as well as Civil War historians, who say that Kellys comments are dangerous and not based on historical evidence.The outcry came after Kellys response to Fox News host Laura Ingraham, who asked him about a Virginia churchs decision to remove plaques honoring President George Washington and Confederate General Robert E. Lee."I would tell you that Robert E. Lee was an honorable man.He was a man that gave up his country to fight for his state, which 150 years ago was more important than country," Kelly, who is from Boston, said."It was always loyalty to state first back in those days.Now it's different today," he said."But the lack of an ability to compromise led to the Civil War, and men and women of good faith on both sides made their stand where their conscience had them make their stand."Many historians specializing in Civil War research refuted Kellys claims.Eric Foner, a historian at Columbia University, told NBC that compromise was actually attempted several times before the Civil War.While he didnt expect Kelly to be an expert in American history, he did expect a better understanding of history from someone who attended the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, Foner said.The Missouri Compromise of 1820 allowed Missouri into the Union as a slave state as long as Maine entered as a free state.The Compromise of 1850 outlawed the slave trade in Washington, D.C., but at the same time said Northerners were obligated to help return fugitive slaves to their owners.The Three-Fifths Compromise written into the Constitution counted slaves as three-fifths of a person for congressional districting purposes.Its not that nobody compromised, but that the issues were uncompromisable in the end, having to do with the future of slavery, Foner said.Foner said it was understandable to want to speculate about what might have avoided a bloody war.But the fact is that slavery was also a horrific thing, he said.War is a terrible thing, but sometimes war has positive consequences and this is one of those instances.Other historians said that Kelly, as a White House official, should be held to a higher standard.Joseph Glatthart, a professor at the University of North Carolina, said he found it "deeply disturbing that a retired four-star general does not know the cause of the war that claimed the most American lives in our nations history."Another professor, David Blight of Yale University, agreed that the comments, coming from Kelly, were surprising.He called Kellys remarks sad and absurd and said his perspective was outdated, rooted in a 1950s view of the war that has been significantly altered by modern studies.People who are ignorant in high places are ignorant by choice, Blight told NBC.It is, in effect, to deny and denigrate what hundreds of thousands of Union soldiers died for.Kelly's words were harmful and dangerous because they portray both sides as being in the right, he said."Its not unlike what Trump said about the monuments issue and the protests in Charlottesville," he said."If both sides were right in the Civil War, then why did it happen?"Kelly's comments have been compared to the Lost Cause movement, an intellectual theory that describes both sides as fighting for honorable reasons.The view was that the Confederacy was dedicated to the heroic cause of preserving a certain way of life and fighting for local rights while the North was fighting to preserve the Union.Critics say it minimizes the role of slavery in the Civil War."Historically speaking, the elimination of slavery from its role as the fundamental cause of the Civil War went along with a justification of the racial system of the south in the Jim Crow era," Foner said.Watch Live Trump Nominates Jerome Powell for Federal Reserve Chairman Kevin M. Levin, an historian and educator based in Boston, said it struck him that in Kelly's comments about the Civil War, he did not mention the word slavery.Kelly's failure to acknowledge the centrality of slavery to most of the pre-war compromises makes it impossible to understand why the Civil War occurred, Levin told NBC in an email.It also obscures the outcome of the war in 1865 and the end of slavery for four million people.Senator and former vice presidential candidate Tim Kaine said Tuesday that he strongly disagreed with Kelly's comments.The Civil War wasnt because of a lack of compromise, Kaine of Virginia said on MSNBC.The Civil War was because of an immoral compromise.He said the war was about a nation that put a Constitution in place that enshrined the institution of slavery and said that a slave is equal to three-fifths of a person.Rep. Cedric L. Richmond, the chair of the Congressional Black Caucus in Washington, D.C., said Kelly needs a history lesson.The Civil War was not a disagreement between men and women of good faith on both sides, Richmond said in a statement.It was a struggle for the soul of this country.Thankfully, the right side won the war and slavery is no longer the law of the land.Richmond said that the caucus is not surprised by the White Houses repeated attempts to whitewash history and that Kelly is starting to sound a lot like his boss.Bernice King, the daughter of Rev.Martin Luther King Jr., said on Twitter that its irresponsible and dangerous, especially when white supremacists feel emboldened, to make fighting to maintain slavery sound courageous.Writer Ta-Nehisi Coates responded to Kellys claims in a series of Tweets.[The] notion that Civil War resulted from a lack of compromise is belied by all the compromises made on enslavement from America's founding, he said, adding: It's called The Three-Fifths compromise for a reason.But it doesn't stand alone.Missouri Compromise.Kansas-Nebraska Act.Coates said that Lincoln's own platform was a compromise.Lincoln was not an abolitionist, he said.He proposed to limit slavery's expansion, not end it.When asked about Kelly's comments during the White House press briefing Tuesday, Press Secretary Sarah Sanders defended the president's chief of staff.She said that many historians believe that if some people had been able to compromise in ways she did not specify, the war might not have occurred, an idea expressed by late historian Shelby Foote in the 1990 Ken Burns documentary "The Civil War."It was because we failed to do the thing we really have a genius for, which was compromise, Foote said.Americans like to think of themselves as uncompromising.Our true genius is for compromise.Our whole government's founded on it.And it failed.Burns himself tweeted on Tuesday: Many factors contributed to the Civil War.One caused it: slavery.Sanders criticized the media for pushing to create something that doesnt exist and for portraying the White House as racially charged and divided.General Kelly was simply making the point that just because history isnt perfect doesnt mean that its not our history, Sanders said.

The Note: Will Trump be Santa or the Grinch with Christmas tax cut?:::::The TAKE with Rick Klein "A giant tax cut for Christmas," President Donald Trump promised the American people.What's not clear yet is whether the public wants this gift as much as Republican representatives.The latest ABC News/Washington Post poll, conducted Sunday through Wednesday, hints at the sales job ahead.Sixty percent of Americans think the tax plan will primarily benefit the wealthy, with only 13 percent buying the argument that it mainly helps the middle class; 17 percent say they think the bill would treat everyone equally.Fifty percent oppose the plan, amid indications that it's not being helped by associations with Trump.Slightly more than half of independents say they oppose the bill ... and this was before the details were unveiled today.The tax push was squeezed by a week bookended by investigative bombshells and now a high-profile presidential trip to Asia.In between came a terrorist attack that drove the president to engage in a new wave of policy declarations and Twitter battles.Meanwhile, the GOP is still divided, with the president's political goals running squarely up against congressional policy plans.With a distracted salesman-in-chief set to spend a dozen days several time zones away, Republicans will need to focus on finding a constituency for their new bill.The RUNDOWN with MaryAlice Parks The giant mea culpa from former Democratic National Committee chairwoman Donna Brazile on Thursday was met with everything from a shrug, to applause, to fury from fellow Democrats.Brazile admitted that a widely publicized funding agreement between the Hillary Clinton campaign and the DNC went further than previously disclosed and in fact allowed the Clinton team to control messaging and major spending decisions.The takeaway from Brazile -- that the party actively worked to rig the presidential primary against Sen. Bernie Sanders was a cathartic but unsurprising revelation for many of the independent lawmaker's former aides and current backers.Party loyalists accused Brazile of self-aggrandizing and trying to save face -- the longtime Democratic adviser has a new book out this month too.One former DNC staffer told ABC News the party should be thanking the Clinton team for funding the organization.But the fact is few party loyalists remain.Many on the left are trying to reinvent the Democratic Party in the wake of bruising general election losses.For them, Brazile being honest about the past means more healing going forward.Writ large, there is also concern among Democrats that re-litigating last year's election distracts from the opportunity to capitalize on GOP missteps -- Brazile's story landed as Republicans unveiled a new tax plan that is raising eyebrows and days after an indictment against former Trump campaign staffers and their associated.Senator Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., called the moment a test for the new party chairman, Tom Perez.The TIP with David Caplan The Twittersphere lit up Thursday night when President Donald Trump's Twitter account was briefly deactivated by a Twitter employee.It was the individual's last day with the company."Through our investigation we have learned that this was done by a Twitter customer support employee who did this on the employee's last day.We are conducting a full internal review," Twitter said in a statement late Thursday night.For eleven minutes around 7 p.m.ET Thursday, visitors to the president's @RealDonaldTrump Twitter page were greeted with, "Sorry, that page doesn't exist!"WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW TODAY: President Trump visits Hawaii to receive a briefing from the U.S. Pacific Command before he embarks on his Asia trip.He visits Pearl Harbor and the USS Arizona Memorial.President Trump named Jay Powell as his pick to lead the Federal Reserve Thursday.The president says Powell will be a key component for the nation's continuing economic growth."The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act" bill was unveiled on Thursday.The bill is roughly 400 pages and lowers individual tax rates for low- and middle-income Americans to zero, 12%, 25% and 35%.White House officials confirm Sam Clovis has withdrawn his nomination as chief scientist of the USDA amid the controversy of his encouraging George Papadopoulos to connect with the Russian government during his time as a campaign supervisor for Trump.President Trump says a tax reform bill will be ready by Christmas after meeting with House GOP leaders and members of the House Ways and Means committee on Thursday.Democratic members of the House Oversight Committee are suing the Trump administration seeking records from the president's DC hotel.President Donald Trump called on Congress Thursday to terminate the diversity lottery program for national security purposes.Texas Rep.

ANALYSIS: The Republican tax plan is a hard sell:::::Republicans finally have an actual tax reform bill, and after disagreements over what to call it, the legislation has a name too.But if the debacle over health care this summer was any lesson for the party, having a bill and a title does not mean Republicans have a messaging strategy.In a lot of ways, Republicans seem to be playing from behind today.A rollout that should have been about putting more money in the pockets of average Americans (who doesnt love that?)was shadowed by headlines about tough legislative battles ahead and continued intra-party disagreements.The pitch from Republicans is that the average middle class American will take home almost $1,200 dollars more, but it is unclear if the average middle class American is on board.The discussion over the last few days has centered around ways average Americans may pay more in taxes, not less.Though it seems this bill leaves 401(k) retirement plans untouched, the back and forth about whether the cap for pre-tax savings would be changed brought close attention to how exactly Republicans would be trying to make up some revenue and lower the costs of this plan in the fine print.Some of the so-called pay fors that did make it in - changes to the tax code designed to bring in cash to the federal government to make up for other cuts -- are going to be hard political sells.Scrapping the popular student loan interest deduction plays right into Democrats' hands.They have been messaging that the federal government needs to do more to offer relief from student loan debt, not less.Reducing the available mortgage interest deduction down to $500,000 is another serious change to a widely used deduction.The Republican bill does double the standard deduction, so it is possible for many people the loss of these specific itemizations may come out in the wash. That said, the messaging could still be hard.The fact that major lobbying groups in the estate realtor and home construction space are already opposing this version does not help Republicans, who normally work closely with those folks.The bulk of this bill, in terms of numbers and costs, is the slash to the corporate tax rate.Polling shows that it is also widely unpopular.While there is a sentiment among voters that Republicans and President Trump understand business and should be trusted to spur growth, polls show many Americans think corporations right now pay too little in taxes, not too much.For example, according to an ABC News/Washington Post poll this fall, 65 percent of Americans say large business corporations pay too little in taxes.A CBS poll out this week found that a majority of Americans want to see tax increases for large corporations (56 percent) and for the wealthy (58 percent).More than half of respondents think cutting taxes in general would help the economy, but most Americans are skeptical of the idea that corporate tax cuts would create jobs.About two-thirds of Republicans (63 percent) say corporations would use any money from potential tax cuts to create jobs, while most Americans (57 percent) overall disagree, the poll goes on.The corporate tax cut and elimination of the estate tax makes this bill expensive and some fiscal hawks, especially those not seeking re-election, may put their foot down and keep this bill from moving in the Senate.But perhaps the most glaring potential political pitfall, for the GOP, is the big man in the White House who still has not released his own tax returns.Democrats are already pouncing on this low-hanging fruit.How will Americans know if the president is not backing a tax break for himself?
60 percent of Americans say Trump tax plan will benefit wealthy:::::Americans oppose Donald Trumps emerging tax plan by broad a 17-point margin, with 60 percent saying it favors the wealthy - including six in 10 of the wealthy themselves.As details - albeit still scarce - have emerged, support and opposition have grown essentially in tandem.Fifty percent in this ABC News/Washington Post poll oppose the plan, up 6 percentage points from September; 33 percent support it, up 5 points.The rest, 17 percent, are undecided.See PDF with full results here.Criticism of the plan goes hand-in-hand with negative views of Trumps efforts to improve the federal tax system overall: 56 percent rate him negatively on this issue, versus 34 percent positively.A key criticism is the sense that the plan would mostly benefit the rich; 60 percent say so, versus 17 percent who think it will treat all people equally and 13 percent who think the middle class mainly will benefit.Even among those with incomes of $100,000 or more, 61 percent think the plan chiefly will benefit the wealthy.Thats a major impediment to public support: Among those who think it will chiefly benefit the rich, support for the Trump tax plan plummets to 10 percent, versus 79 percent among those who think others, or all, mainly will benefit.Details of the plan were released yesterday and responses could shift as its components become better known.The favor the rich criticism is comparable to that leveled at George W. Bushs 2003 tax plan, which passed nonetheless on nearly a party-line vote; anywhere from 56 to 61 percent in ABC/Post polls at the time thought it favored the rich.That said, as many as 26 percent thought the Bush cuts were equitable across groups, 9 points higher than now.Support for the Trump plan peaks at 75 percent among Republicans and those who approve of his job performance overall in this poll, produced for ABC by Langer Research Associates.Opposition hits 79 percent among Democrats and 78 percent among Trump disapprovers; its 52 percent among independents, with 29 percent in support.Largely explaining these stark differences, 65 percent of Republicans and 56 percent of conservatives think the plan would treat all people equally.A mere 9 percent of Democrats and 10 percent of liberals agree.Among other groups, opposition peaks at 66 percent among nonwhites, 64 percent among young adults and urban residents and 60 percent among those with advanced degrees and Northeasterners.Support, while lower, peaks at 43 percent among those living in rural areas and about four in 10 older Americans, whites, middle and higher income-earners, and men.Methodology This ABC News/Washington Post poll was conducted by landline and cellular telephone Oct. 29-Nov. 1, 2017, in English and Spanish, among a random national sample of 1,005 adults.Results have a margin of sampling error of 3.5 points, including the design effect.Partisan divisions are 31-23-38 percent, Democrats-Republicans-independents.The survey was produced for ABC News by Langer Research Associates of New York, N.Y., with sampling, data collection and tabulation by Abt Associates of Cambridge, Massachusetts.See details on the surveys methodology here.
Democrats sue Trump administration for records from president's DC hotel:::::The battle over records about the Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C. is headed to federal court, with Democratic members of the House Oversight Committee announcing a lawsuit against the Trump administration on Thursday.This lawsuit is not just about a hotel in Washington D.C., said Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md, said.This is about the President defying a federal statute and denying our ability as Members of Congress to fulfill our constitutional duty to act as a check on the Executive Branch.The legal argument underpinning the suit is a 90-year-old federal statute that requires the executive branch to respond to requests from the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, which has historically served as an important check on the Executive Branch.But at the heart of the case is the glitzy hotel property the Trump Organization opened shortly before Trump took office.The business, now overseen by the presidents two adult sons, Don Jr., and Eric, signed a 60-year lease with the federal government to occupy the Old Post Office Pavilion on Pennsylvania Avenue.With Trumps election, critics argued the President had in essence become both the propertys landlord and tenant.Moreover, Cummings has noted, a special provision in the lease prohibits federal elected officials from being a party to the agreement.A copy of the complaint can be read below.In March, the agency that oversees the lease agreement, the General Services Administration (GSA), ruled that the Trump Organization was in full compliance with the lease because the President resigned his position with the real estate firm and transferred control of the company to his sons.In other words, during his term in office, the president will not receive any distributions from the trust that would have been generated from the hotel, said Kevin M. Terry, the official who issued the decision.Cummings said investigators from his committee have sought a range of records about the lease agreement, and that the administration has refused all Democratic requests for documents about the Trump Hotel for the better part of this year.They have refused to provide basic documents about the hotels ongoing operations, foreign payments to the hotel, or the reversal of GSAs legal position that President Trump could not be a party to the lease, Cummings said.The lawsuit argues that the administration is duty bound to provide documents to congressional overseers, citing a federal statute dating to 1928 that requires a federal agency response to any request from seven or more members of the Oversight Committee.But in a July 17 letter to Cummings, the acting GSA administrator said the White House Counsel had provided an opinion stating that agencies would only accept oversight from the committee not from a group of individual members of the committee who lacked the blessing of the Republican chairman.The Executive Branchs longstanding policy has been to engage in the established process for accommodating responses to congressional requests for information only when those requests come from a committee, subcommittee, or chairman authorized to conduct oversight, the White House counsels office said.Any response to an individual member, it says, would come at the discretion of the agency.House Oversight Committee Chairman Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., declined to comment.
What's in Republicans' tax plan and what it means for you:::::Republicans in the House of Representatives released an ambitious and long-awaited tax bill Thursday that seeks to simplify the tax code and reduce corporate rates, the latest step as the party works toward passing a major item on its agenda.ABC News The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act would reduce the number of tax brackets from seven to four, maintaining the top marginal rate at 39.6 percent, and almost double the standard deduction, the amount that can be removed from one's income before taxes.Under the bill, the country's corporate tax rate would be permanently reduced from 35 percent to 20 percent.The bill was originally scheduled to be released Wednesday but was pushed back a day as Republicans fine-tuned the text.GOP members of the Ways and Means Committee, which is primarily responsible for tax writing, worked into the evening Tuesday and throughout the day Wednesday to address some of the sticking points dividing party members, including state and local tax (SALT) deductions.Changes to state and local property and income tax deductions After early proposals called for a wholesale elimination of deductions for amounts paid in some state and local taxes, it was partially maintained in the final bill.Taxpayers would continue to deduct property taxes under the bill though the amount is capped at $10,000 while income tax deductions would be eliminated.401(k)s rules go unaltered On 401(k)s, the text released Thursday appears to maintain the current maximum that individuals may contribute on a tax-free basis at $18,000, following through on a pledge made by President Donald Trump that the plans would not be affected.ABC News "There will be NO change to your 401(k)," Trump tweeted less than two weeks ago."This has always been a great and popular middle class tax break that works, and it stays!"Mortgage-interest deduction cap lowered Other proposed changes include lowering the cap on the mortgage-interest deduction, which subtracts from taxable income the interest payments that taxpayers make toward mortgages.The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act would halt the deductions at interest paid on the first $500,000 in loans; the current cap is $1 million.Critics believe the move would disproportionately affect residents of areas with high home ownership costs.One-time tax on overseas profits The plan would further institute a new, one-time tax on overseas profits set at 12 percent for cash holdings and 5 percent for illiquid holdings, a provision seemingly intended to force companies to repatriate overseas profits.Some large corporations have said they would be inclined to bring cash back to the U.S., if possible.Reaction from Capitol Hill, the White House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady, R-Texas, said the plan which he labeled a "complete redesign of the code" adheres to budget rules requiring the measure to add no more than $1.5 trillion to the federal deficit over 10 years.He expressed his excitement at a press conference unveiling the plan Thursday."Real relief from today's complex, costly and unfair tax code is on the way.With this bill, there's relief for real American families," he said."There's relief for American workers, and there's tax relief for hard-working job creators of all sizes."He added that the legislation has Trump's "full support."The White House released a statement shortly after that, in which Trump applauded the release of the bill, calling it "another important step toward providing massive tax relief for the American people.""We are just getting started, and there is much work left to do," the statement continued.Speaking from the Oval Office later in the day, Trump expressed his belief that Republicans would be able to pass the legislation by the end of the year."I really believe we'll have it done before Christmas.I consider that to be one of the great Christmas presents, Trump said.Speaker of the House Paul Ryan of Wisconsin said that the bill would save "the typical family of four" $1,182 per year in taxes.In recent weeks, some White House officials promoted a potential $4,000 in savings for the average family, through criteria set forth by the administration.He further pointed to reduction of loopholes and simplification of the code as added benefits.Evan Vucci/AP, FILE "We're making things so simple, you can do your taxes on the form the size of a postcard," he said, holding a sample card.Democrats slammed the bill Thursday afternoon, portraying it as a scheme against the American public that will ransack many of the middle-class benefits that millions depend on."In short, the bill's like a fish: If it stays out in the sunlight too long, it stinks," Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said at a press conference.House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., called the bill a "Ponzi scheme" that corporate America is perpetrating on the American people.Schumer vowed to fight the bill "tooth and nail" to prevent it from reaching Trump's desk and expressed optimism about his party's planned efforts."I believe we will prevail," he said.ABC News' Zunaira Zaki, Mariam Khan, Trish Turner, John Parkinson, Alexander Mallin and Adam Kelsey contributed to this report.
White House was unaware top adviser testified before grand jury:::::The White House first learned one of its senior staffers met with the grand jury hearing the case presented by the special counsel into alleged Russian meddling into the 2016 election not from the staffer but from media reports, sources with knowledge of the investigation tell ABC News.Former Trump campaign co-chairman Sam Clovis recently testified before that grand jury into his role on President Donald Trumps campaign.Clovis currently serves as the senior White House adviser to the Department of Agriculture.Clovis testimony comes on the heels of another Trump campaign adviser, George Papadopoulos, pleading guilty to lying to federal authorities.As part of Papadopoulos admission of guilt, details of emails were disclosed that showed him describing to top Trump campaign officials communications he had with contacts in Russia.The correspondence between Papadopoulos and a group of foreign nationals detail that within weeks of being described by Trump as an important part of his national security team, Papadopoulos was in London meeting with people who said they could deliver dirt on rival candidate Hillary Clinton, including thousands of emails.The emails indicate multiple top level campaign officials that Papadopoulos communicated with including one listed as a campaign supervisor.Sources familiar with the emails tell ABC News the campaign supervisor was Sam Clovis.Clovis appeared to encourage Papadopoulos to engage with Russian contacts; in one instance Clovis responded directly to Papadopoulos, hailing him for his great work and saying I would encourage you to make the trip, if it is feasible, referring to a trip the young campaign adviser pitched to go abroad.An attorney for Clovis confirmed his role in the communications to ABC News, adding that he has not spoken to Papadopoulos since the 2016 election and any trip he would have taken would not have been authorized by the campaign and would have been done on his own personal time and money.A White House source familiar with the investigation tells ABC News the White House was surprised to learn Mr. Clovis had been contacted by the Special Counsels office as part of their separate probe of Mr. Papadopoulos activities.Clovis lawyer, Victoria Toensing, told ABC News he is not under investigation.The special counsels office has been calling witnesses for the last several months for both interviews at their Department of Justice offices in addition to testifying before a newly impaneled grand jury.White House staffers who have been called to meet with Mueller have usually kept the Presidents legal team in the loop.Clovis was the presidents pick to serve as undersecretary at the Department of Agriculture and was scheduled to face a Senate confirmation hearing next week.However, as scrutiny mounted into his testimony and qualifications for the post Clovis wrote President Trump on Thursday asking his name be withdrawn from consideration.ABC News' Justin Fishel and Tara Palmeri contributed to this report
Trump nominates Jerome Powell for Federal Reserve chair:::::In an address from the Rose Garden at the White House Thursday, President Donald Trump has announced his nomination of Jerome H. Powell as the next chair of the Federal Reserve.Powell is known as a centrist Republican who is not expected to lead any sharp change of direction for the Fed at a time when the stock market is strong and unemployment is at a 16-year low.As a member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve since 2012, Powell has supported the Fed's ongoing strategy of gradually raising interest rates and may be friendly to the Trump administration's plan to roll back regulations on financial firms.Senior Economist at UCLA Anderson Forecast David Shulman told ABC News that interest rates are currently much lower than normal and described the Fed's current strategy of bringing them back up as "normalization.""His policies will be consistent with [current chairwoman Janet] Yellen on the monetary policy side," said Shulman."And he's probably less hawkish on regulation."Economists generally refer to those who favor stricter regulations and higher interest rates as "hawks" and those against as "doves."Brooks Kraft/Getty Images Powell has deep roots in the Republican establishment as an assistant secretary and as undersecretary of the Treasury under President George H.W.Bush.Though Powell is known as a Republican, President Barack Obama appointed him for his first Fed position in 2012 and he was reappointed in 2014.In addition to his government service, the native Washingtonian is also no stranger to Wall Street.Powell was a partner at private equity firm The Carlyle Group for eight years before leaving for the Bipartisan Policy Center as a visiting scholar until his appointment by Obama.The nomination brings to a close a very public selection process by Trump.Big announcement next week!Together, we will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!#USA A post shared by President Donald J. Trump (@realdonaldtrump) on Oct 27, 2017 at 1:42pm PDT In July, Trump announced he was considering a replacement to Yellen, a Democrat, after her four-year term ends in February -- potentially marking the first time since 1979 a chairman has not served at least eight years.However, despite pressure from Republicans to nominate their own leader of the central banking system, Trump has praised Yellen's service.According to The Associated Press, Trump said in an interview with the Fox Business Network that Yellen was "very impressive.I like her a lot."But the president added, "You like to make your own mark, which is maybe one of the things she's got a little bit against her, but I think she is terrific."The Federal Reserve, among other things, controls the economy's interest rates.Higher interest rates mean a higher price to borrow money, but they also mean savings accounts earn higher interest.This is the Fed's most effective tool in steering the economy.The board and its chairman serve independently of the White House, so once a nominee is sworn in, Trump will have minimal influence over his or her decisions.Shulman told ABC News the chairman not only serves as the central banker for the United States, but also as the spokesperson for the country's monetary policy and "for all practical purposes, is close to being the central banker for the world."According to the senior economist, the most important nomination a president can make is to the Supreme Court, followed by "probably the chairman of the Federal Reserve."
Infamous fake Twitter account prompted social media giant to re-evaluate policies:::::A Russian-backed Twitter account now infamous for luring voters and Trump campaign officials into spreading divisive messages prompted the social media giant to re-evaluate its broader response to suspected Russian election interference, Twitters acting general counsel Sean Edgett told lawmakers this week.The Tennessee Republican Party saw volumes of traffic on Twitter siphoned off to an impostor.The authentic Tennessee GOP Twitter feed is @TNGOP, while a Russian-backed effort shared content via @TEN_GOP.At its peak, the fake account had amassed more than 154,000 followers, while the real account collected just 13,000.Officials from the real Tennessee Republican Party reported the fake account to Twitter multiple times, but as first reported by Buzzfeed, it took 11 months for the company to shut the fake account down.Asked by Rep. Jackie Speier, D-Calif., whether Twitter had acted swiftly enough to remove the account after being notified of the fraud, Edgett acknowledged the companys sluggish reaction."Absolutely and that example alone caused us to re-look at our policies and procedures and I can say today that had we been reached out on that account today by the real Tennessee GOP, we wouldve taken it down much, much faster, Edgett said.Congressional hearings this week aired out scores of examples of fake Russian posts that found their way onto Twitter, Facebook and Google.One ad reportedly targeted African American women, telling them to vote from home on Election Day and providing numbers where they could text their choice.Others pushed anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim messages.Edgett told lawmakers that Twitter has traced 2,752 accounts to the Russia-based troll factory, the Internet Research Agency, and found that Russian accounts tweeted 1.4 million times in a span of just over two months.Asked if he had addressed the full scope of the problem, Edgett told senators Wednesday, Were still working on it.We want to catch bad activity all over Twitter, Edgett said.Having automatic account and malicious actors on Twitter is a bad experience for our users.The challenge is, as we get better, these actors get better.So its a constant game of one-ups-manship.But we are committed that every single day we are removing those actors from our platform.The true authorship behind the imposter Tennessee Twitter handle was first revealed by the Russian publication RBC last week, but according to Candace Dawkins, a Tennessee GOP spokeswoman, constituents knew something was amiss for much longer than that.We would get a lot of complaints about things this fake account was tweeting, Dawkins told ABC News.It was very frustrating.Sen. Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat, said in an interview that he was stunned to see the hard evidence of how the bogus Tennessee GOP accounts managed to draw in unsuspecting followers in droves.Warner told ABC News he found it particularly disturbing that Twitter failed to discover or remove the fraudulent account for so long, even after real Tennessee party officials reported it.Dawkins confirmed her office notified Twitter three times of the problem.We reported the account as brand infringement, Dawkins said, adding that the trolls created several back-up accounts to try and grab the attention of its followers when the fake site was first removed.Democrats at this weeks hearings said they had seen evidence that several top Trump campaign officials re-tweeted divisive messages from the false Tennessee account.Senator Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) said the troll account was retweeted by Kellyanne Conway and Donald Trump Jr. A Daily Beast report found repeated examples of Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn re-tweeting the Russian version of the Tennessee feed.And as recently reported by ThinkProgress, dozens of major media outlets, including ABC News, cited the account in their reporting or embedded tweets in their articles.ABC News updated the story that cited the fraudulent account and removed the tweet.Dawkins, meanwhile, said she hopes to see her partys followers migrating back to the genuine account.We took a lot of time to make sure we had good, quality content, she said.
Trump calls for death penalty for NYC terror suspect, considers him an 'enemy combatant':::::President Donald Trump called for the New York City terror suspect to get the death penalty in a late-night tweet Wednesday just hours after Sayfullo Saipov was charged with providing support to ISIS and violence and destruction of motor vehicles.Trump referenced Saipov's request to hang an ISIS flag in his hospital room, an anecdote relayed by authorities Wednesday afternoon, and said he "SHOULD GET DEATH PENALTY!"in all capital letters.NYC terrorist was happy as he asked to hang ISIS flag in his hospital room.He killed 8 people, badly injured 12.SHOULD GET DEATH PENALTY!Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 2, 2017 Earlier in the afternoon, Trump raised the possibility of sending the alleged perpetrator to Guantanamo Bay prison.The White House press secretary said the administration considers him to be an "enemy combatant.""I believe we would consider this person to be an enemy combatant," Sarah Sanders said in response to questioning at Wednesday's White House press briefing.As an "enemy combatant," Saipov, the suspect in the attack, could face an altered interrogation and prosecution process.Trump earlier condemned the United States criminal justice system and labeled Saipov an "animal.""We have to come up with punishment that's far quicker and far greater than the punishment these animals are getting right now," Trump said.He added: "What we have right now is a joke" before responding affirmatively when asked if he wanted the alleged assailant to be sent to the Cuban prison notorious for housing alleged terrorists and enemy combatants."I would certainly consider it.Send him to Gitmo," he said, using a nickname for Guantanamo Bay."I would certainly consider it."The president further signaled his intention to "terminate the diversity lottery program," the visa lottery under which Saipov was admitted from Uzbekistan seven years ago.The Department of Homeland Security confirmed Saipov utilized the program Wednesday.Trump said he would be asking Congress to "get rid of" the policy in favor of a "merit-based program."Earlier in the day, Trump pointed a finger at Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., for the immigration policies he claims are connected to the attack that left eight people dead and many more injured."The terrorist came into our country through what is called the 'Diversity Visa Lottery Program,' a Chuck Schumer beauty," Trump said on Twitter Wednesday.Trump also promoted the suggested "merit-based" immigration system.The terrorist came into our country through what is called the "Diversity Visa Lottery Program," a Chuck Schumer beauty.I want merit based.Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 1, 2017 We are fighting hard for Merit Based immigration, no more Democrat Lottery Systems.We must get MUCH tougher (and smarter).@foxandfriends Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 1, 2017 The president's attack against Schumer follows a trend of directly blaming elected officials in cities and states hit by terrorist attacks.Trump made similar remarks about London's mayor, Sadiq Khan, following the attacks near the London Bridge in June.Sebastian Sobczak/BeautifulGoal.Org via AP "The president's tweets, I think, were not helpful," said New York Gov.Andrew Cuomo at a press conference Wednesday morning."I don't think they were factual.I think they tended to point fingers and politicize the situation.""His tweet wasn't even accurate, as far as I'm concerned," he added.Both Cuomo and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio noted that they had not received phone calls from the president on the matter, but had spoken with acting Secretary of Homeland Security Elaine Duke and White House homeland security adviser Tom Bossert, who offered their assistance to the city.PacificCoastNews Cuomo and de Blasio each said they were "not bothered" to have not been contacted by Trump and downplayed any politicization of the situation.On Tuesday, Saipov allegedly drove a rental truck onto a bike path in lower Manhattan near One World Trade Center in what de Blasio called a "cowardly act of terror."Saipov entered the United States in 2010 through the Diversity Immigrant Visa Program.According to the State Department, the program issues about 55,000 visas per year to applicants, most of them from countries that don't send many migrs to the United States.The Diversity Immigrant Visa Program was included in the broader immigration reform package passed in 1990 and was signed by then-president George H.W.Bush.The first visa lottery took place in 1995.Susan Walsh/AP Saipov has since become a legal permanent resident and has lived in Cincinnati, Tampa, and, most recently, Paterson, New Jersey, according to a law enforcement official.Schumer, a member of the House of Representatives at the time, is known to have played a key role in pushing for the program to be included in the comprehensive immigration bill.The New York senator tweeted Wednesday, "I guess it's not too soon to politicize a tragedy."I guess it's not too soon to politicize a tragedy.Chuck Schumer (@SenSchumer) November 1, 2017 I have always believed and continue to believe that immigration is good for America.President Trump, instead of politicizing and dividing America, which he always seems to do at times of national tragedy, should be focusing on the real solution -- anti-terrorism funding -- which he proposed cutting in his most recent budget," Schumer said in a statement.Im calling on the president to immediately rescind his proposed cuts to this vital anti-terrorism funding.Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., also weighed in on Twitter, correcting Trump and pointing out that he and Schumer were both part of the group of lawmakers that "did away with the Diversity Visa Program as part of broader reforms."Actually, the Gang of 8, including @SenSchumer, did away with the Diversity Visa Program as part of broader reforms.I know, I was there https://t.co/QQFJzPyRzC Jeff Flake (@JeffFlake) November 1, 2017 At the Wednesday press briefing, Sanders defended the president against the claims of politicization, saying that because his calls for immigration reforms weren't "new policy or conversation," the label can't apply."The president has been talking about extreme vetting and the need for that for the purpose of protecting the citizens of this country long before he was a president," Sanders said."This isn't a new argument or position.And this wasn't new for the president to speak about it.The press secretary further clarified that Trump was not blaming Schumer for the attack.Overnight, conservative media outlet Breitbart News and former Trump aide Sebastian Gorka joined a vocal chorus of ring wing critics in targeting Schumer.Many on the right said the New York senator's role in passing the measure is a sign hes directly responsible for the attack in New York City.ABC News' Jordyn Phelps contributed to this report.

'The Cut Cut Cut Act': Trump, Hill leaders differ on tax overhaul bill's name:::::House Republicans have settled on a name for their tax overhaul bill: "the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act," multiple sources confirmed to ABC News.President Donald Trump had told senior congressional leaders that he wants to name the bill the Cut Cut Cut Act, two senior administration officials told ABC News.The bill will be unveiled today.There was still dispute over the name as of Wednesday, according to a senior congressional aide and a senior White House official.The sources said the Ways and Means Committee would have the final say.Still, behind closed doors, there was back-and-forth between House Speaker Paul Ryan and House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady about the name of the bill, including multiple phone calls in the past week.Ryan's office initially asked the White House for input because of the president's knack for branding, according to a senior Hill aide.Trump has been insistent that the bill be called "the Cut Cut Cut Act," according to the administration officials.Ryan and Brady have pushed back on the name of the bill.Trump, however, has held firm.Internal White House polling showed that Americans respond more favorably to language that highlights tax cuts over tax reform, according to a senior White House official.At the end of the day, this will be known as the Trump tax cuts, the senior Hill aide said.Bradys office declined to comment.After the White House did not respond to ABC News' request for comment, press secretary Sarah Sanders joked about the potential name of the bill at Wednesday's press briefing."If it's called 'cut cut cut' and it includes massive tax cuts like this president is proposing, I think we would be perfectly fine with that name," Sanders said.AshLee Strong, Ryan's national press secretary, called the branding of the bill a total nonissue.Asked whether its unusual for the White House to take a role in the branding of legislation, she explained that with a Republican president, it seems youd want to have involvement.The fact that he wanted to name the bill, that is hilarious and perfectly illustrates how in things both large and small the Hill cant quite figure out Trump, said a person with direct knowledge of the dispute.Congress is set to reveal its much anticipated tax overhaul plan on Thursday, even though many details are still being ironed out, such as the threshold for curbing state and local tax deductions, limits on tax-exempt contributions to retirement plans like 401(k)s, child tax credits and property tax deductions.ABC News Jonathan Karl and John Parkinson contributed to this report.

Trump takes on Clinton, DNC Video:::::Transcript for Trump takes on Clinton, DNC A lot does depend on the president.Let's bring in Jon Karl for more on that.The president out there selling it yesterday even though our new poll shows a majority of Americans don't like the plan so far and some skittishness on capitol hill about how the president will lead this fight given what happened during the health care fight.Reporter: There is constant fear that the president is going to change his mind, change policy in response to criticism or cut some kind of side deal and the Republicans will learn about it on Twitter but I have to say overall I sense confidence on the part of Republicans and spoke to speaker of the house Paul Ryan here yesterday after his meeting with the president and he says he really does believe they can get it done by Christmas.Meantime, Jon, the democratic party rocked by this revelation by Donna Brazile that the Clinton campaign had effectively taken control over the DNC before she got the nomination.President trump now weighing in on that this morning.Reporter: He's got a double-barreled attack on this.He's going after the DNC, of course, but he's also in an odd twist going after his own justice department.Overnight the president jumped on revelations that Hillary Clinton had control over the DNC even before she won her party's nomination.Tweeting, Donna Brazile just stated the DNC rigged the system to illegal steal the primary from Bernie Sanders.Bought and paid for by crooked H. This is real collusion and dishonesty, major violation of campaign finance laws and money laundering.Where is our justice department?He's referring to revelations in a new book by former DNC chair Donna Brazile who reveals that the DNC entered into an agreement back in 2015 that gave the Clinton team a degree of control over the party long before the first votes were cast in the democratic primary.Trump continued the attack last night in an interview on fox News.But I want to tell you that is a big story, what she's saying.It's illegal, number one, and it's really unfair to Bernie Sanders.I'm not a Bernie Sanders fan but I must say I got a lot of his votes when he was thrown out.Reporter: In another interview the president expressed frustration that he doesn't have more control over his own justice department.I'm very frustrated by it.I look at what's happening with the justice department.Why aren't they going after Hillary Clinton with her e-mails and her -- the dossier and the kind of money -- I don't know.Is it possible they paid $12.4 million for the dossier and how was -- which is total phony, fake.And how is it used?Reporter: And the president just minutes ago went after his own justice department yet again on Twitter tweeting, everybody is asking why the justice department and the FBI isn't looking into all of the dishonesty going on with crooked Hillary and the DEMs.By the way, George, Democrats are raising questions about this, as well.Elizabeth Warren was asked point blank if she believes the primary was rigged and she said, yes.A lot of Democrats angry about this and don't like what Hillary Clinton did during the campaign.The more they've learned about it from Donna Brazile but to clarify a couple of points here.There's no indication there was any illegal activity going on in the DNC despite the president's claims and I guess if he really wanted the justice department to investigate this, he could ask them.Reporter: Absolutely.No allegation of illegal activity coming really from anybody except for the president.But it is quite something to see him effectively go after his own attorney general instead of simply maybe asking had him to look into it.Jon Karl, thanks very much.This transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.

Trump names Jay Powell to replace Janet Yellen as Fed chair Video:::::Transcript for Trump names Jay Powell to replace Janet Yellen as Fed chair Thank you everybody thank you very much.Who.We'll probably make certain hot water and Apollo.It's not immigrant terrorism quite as in Vegas.And they see presidents from leaving the podium and win his she asked to name his nominee.To be the new chairman of the Federal Reserve Jay Powell ignoring some questions from reporters there but focusing on the issue at hand for him which was this key.Appointment that is crucial to the US economy for so many reasons take and mom and about life here.With Rebecca Jarvis ABC's chief business correspondent radio and an area I'm good at that Rick Klein Dan in DC has been away and it just a second to bid jump us off here we're back at this appointment we knew was coming to some degree.Jay palace considered the safe choice the continuity candidate for a number reasons why is that thome back.Am well first off he's already on the Fed's board of directors so he's already a member of the Federal Reserve appointed in 2012.By then President Obama he's a Republican President Obama made two appointments to the fad.At that time one Republican and one Democrat Jay Powell was the Republican.He served in that George HW Bush's administration at the time was the assistant secretary and undersecretary of the treasury.And the perception of Jed Powell is that he will very much continue on the tradition of the current Federal Reserve under chair yelling which has banned one.Moderates slow paced interest rate hikes right now interest rates are between one and one point 25%.The Fed's view of the economy we just got another report from the bag yesterday is that the economy is strong and continuing to improve student and the idea would be that essentially everything that is happening right now at the Federal Reserve the chances for example one more fed interest rate hike by the end of the year.Very likely.Three more interest rate hikes by next year also likely to the mandate for this man is kill method.Yes keep fish shaped steady if Ben's mandate the fat has the Fed basically has a mandate to make sure that.Employment is maximizing in this country right now the unemployment rate in this country is near.Near record low that's four point 2% right now in the country.Big a job well the Fed is to make sure to keep unemployment.As low as it can be so can maximize employment make as many create as many jobs as possible and at the same time make sure that prices inflation.Don't get cell out of hand all of a sudden we can't afford to buy.So Rick Klein here at.I think I'm pretty economy right the unemployment rate is at a sixteen year low.Economic expansion is in this nineteen year now all things going really really well for Jay Powell they think time.President trump didn't have to tune name him he couldn't just reappoint head.Janney gallon which is actually been the common practice in modern history if the chairman is there and has only done one term in the economy's doing well they get reappointed to why do you think the president at that.You write that has been produced at the tradition recently Ben Bernanke was named by George W. Bush reappointed by Barack Obama of course before that you had Alan Greenspan.First of what about Ronald Reagan he served all the way up and threw the Obama years reappointed by Republicans and Democrats.I was struck by a bite something though in this is that president trump could have gone far outside the box and if you listen to -- seven the campaign trail the criticism he had for Janet Yellen even suggesting at one point that she was trying to change the economy's trajectory.To help Hillary Clinton.You don't hear any of that from the present anymore and it seems like they have developed a real relationship and you saw president trump.Heaping praise on Janet Yellen today if she is he has been destructive how has been described as kind of the Republican version.Of Janet Yellen so I actually think he could have gone.Far far afield from where he did and this is the safer.Choice of continuity is a got has won a lot of things up he didn't blow this up today.So we had a little bit the heads up that this would be the name that we are all going to learn today I'm seeing any kind of reaction so far to the name.Little prickly as far as Wall Street is concerned and I haven't looked at price action in the last second meanwhile street can literally.Wall Street is essentially where it was prior to the announcements prices started out a little bit lower today but that's nothing to write home about it's a pretty muted limited reaction from Wall Street I think.There's one other portion of what the Fed.Can view and this might have something to do with.Of the banks the Fed has.A few more powers given Dodd-Frank any regulations under dot freight view to set deeper regulations when it comes to banks and Jay Powell has been an advocate for fewer in simpler rules on small and regional banks.One of the big.Criticisms.Among some analysts had out coming out of Dodd-Frank is that it was a blink it's set of rules that applied to banks across the board.And smaller and regional banks would say well we can't adhere to the exact same practices that for example JPMorgan Chase or Bank of America can hear Q my work much smaller we don't of the budgets.That could be an area that he could actually flex some muscle in and have some say in as fed chair.So here's the other thing where that might become conversations on the line if he gets confirm it to cal Thomas and if he gets confirmed.Rick Klein let me ask you this is it Rebecca says this is the safe choice for a lot of reasons he is a cautious approach.Two economic growth in the same tradition as Janet Yellen.That's not the president's approach that is not what he has been pushing for and we've seen unprecedented.Two straight quarters at 3% GDP that the president says he wants to see more of fat.Could be a problem.I think it's a question is gonna come up in the confirmation hearings as it has for most anyone the president.Has a point the particularly after he told director call me FBI director.Roughly similar position of of a quasi independent eight agency.He wanted loyalty I think you're gonna hear a lot of questions about.What kind of conversations half between the president and his advisors in Jay Powell they're looking for any kind of assurances or kind of coordination and communication you get in that position is supposed to be.At least extensively removed from politics but look I think he takes over time of the economy's humming the president doesn't wanna screw that up he's got some legislative priorities that moving that direction.He wants to see growth because it's good for him politically and it's good for the country that's one area that's almost undeniable at this point.That they they did the countries are moving in the right direction when it comes the economy with employment and with the stock market it people's formally gays feel better these days he wants to see that trend continue.I am curious if he would ever kind of exert influence.On a fed chair that he fell it wasn't doing the right thing we know that he's a Clinton attacked as about anyway on Twitter I and I do expect it to be an issue that the senate that brings up during the confirmation hearing.Cents worth noting an act your New York Rebecca we're talking about this on the day that the GOP house leadership unveiled their tax plan.It's on to huge economic.Repercussions for that as well how is all of this sort of fitting together in the puzzle how are you looking to approach this as a landscape of where we might be over the next few years.Why I think first of all it's that if you have a nomination and you have a plan that's on the table that could change numbers I'm import data the president started the tax plan is concerned a lot can change.I eat them from from Wall Street's standpoint there were so much expectation.Put on this administration.Around the tax plan around infrastructure spending and around what would happen with regulations.And it when you look at this tax plan when you look at.What's happening as far as regulations are concerned.Most of these things are moving in the direction that Wall Street had anticipated now.Obviously there are so much that subject to change here.And I think that once people start to take a closer look at the tax plan.That's where and this is where Rick Klein can jump in that's where where the people are gonna have their say about whether or not they feel this is fair whether or not they feel this is just and whether or not they feel like this is what they truly voted for the Rick Klein jumping here when he sank.I'm struck so far that there isn't a constituency out there are so far for this tax plan it that its grassroots up we're seeing a lot of big business groups and not some of the biggest.Political organizations jumping in on this and and and champion this they have not yet made the case to the middle class and I think.They've been strained in trying to describe this tax cut as a middle class tax cut president today saying it's a big Christmas gift for the American people.I'm not sure that the people have demonstrated they want this particular gift yet that's going to be the challenge here to tie this back to be economy to make an affirmative case for this tax cut.I think is one of the defining moments of the trump presidency quite honestly because he made that case based on an appeal to help the little guy to help the middle class to grow the economy in ways that lifted.All boats that's hard to deal because the wealthy frankly pay the most taxes when you do a tax cut.They're gonna get the bulk of it is a big corporate tax cut in here that only now only when it trickles down as the start of to reach the so called little lies the middle class.So I think there's a lot of salesmanship that -- that happened to make this something that the American people want as much as right now the Republican representatives there.Well and already you've heard from a couple interest groups in the business world who are actually saying no we're not into this plan you've heard from the small business council you've heard from.Homebuilders in particular who with that mortgage interest deduction rate with old the rate on that lowered.You're actually seeing one of the groups that selling off today on Wall Street for example are the home builders because.Ultimately they lose if people art in the mood to know Latin spend money on home building because they're not getting that mortgage interest deduction.So break gimme a prediction here this is that he's had time to think you're paid to the fire is there any reason that we don't see Jay Powell confirmed here.Oh I don't see any reason that he's not confirmed I think I think.I think when both Democrats and Republicans look at this they realize that the president's.Rhetoric is a campaign are needed as president could have led in some some wild directions this is not a wild direction of the choice this seems to be an area where he's listening to his economic team.Other some talk about him appointing Gary Cohen I think the markets would have been fine with that probably congressman had.A few more questions about that but he seems to in the in the areas of business the stuff that Rebecca.Covers he's taken the advice of the of the Smart people around him it would seem and he's not going in in any directions that I think would doubt overly alarmed people so.I would seek I would guess unless something major comes up in confirmation hearing summing totally unexpected is to be pretty smooth sailing by the standards of Washington and when he seventeen.Smooth sailing at that that's something we can all get behind right now in these untroubled times hey Rick Klein at Downey gave the air political director

Labour activist 'felt isolated' over complaint made against MP:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Ava Etemadzadeh: "It made me feel extremely uncomfortable and it was a revolting act."A Labour activist who accused an MP of sexual harassment has told the BBC she feels disillusioned by how the party handled it.Ava Etemadzadeh, 27, said she was left feeling "very powerless and isolated" after Kelvin Hopkins was promoted the year after she complained about him.The MP has now been suspended by Labour while it investigates the allegations.The party says it takes such complaints "extremely seriously".Mr Hopkins has not commented on the allegations.Ms Etemadzadeh claims the Luton North MP made inappropriate physical contact while hugging her, after she had invited him to speak at a university event in 2014, which "made me feel extremely uncomfortable".'Shocked' "The second incident was in Parliament when I went to have a conversation and he told me that 'let's not talk about politics, do you have a boyfriend?'," she told BBC News."And he also said that if nobody was in his office he would've taken me there.I was absolutely shocked and I wasn't really expecting that."After refusing to respond to his phone calls, she claimed he sent her a message "saying that I'm an attractive, lovely young woman and a man would be lucky to have me as a lover and if he was young ... but he's not".Some months later she raised concerns about Mr Hopkins' conduct with another Labour MP and her complaint was passed to the party's then chief whip Dame Rosie Winterton, who responded to it.Reprimanded But Ms Etemadzadeh said she was told she would have to waive her anonymity for action to be taken and the prospect of this "scared" her.It is understood Mr Hopkins, 76, was verbally reprimanded about his alleged behaviour.But he went on to be promoted, albeit briefly, to Labour's front bench in June 2016 - shortly after leader Jeremy Corbyn faced mass resignations following the EU referendum.Image copyright PA Image caption Mr Hopkins has been MP for Luton North since 1997 Ms Etemadzadeh told the BBC she believed that the Labour leader's office had been contacted about the complaint "and it was ignored"."I'm very disillusioned because just a few months later I realised that Jeremy Corbyn promoted Kelvin Hopkins to the shadow cabinet, despite the fact that the leader's office was aware of this and they refused to act and that made me feel very powerless and isolated and alone."Formal procedure She said she had gone back to the party this week and raised it again but was told she would have to make a complaint through a formal procedure, via its National Executive Committee.Then she was contacted by a party official and asked to detail her complaints in writing but was warned the procedure would take a few days.She says that within hours the party contacted to her to say that they were suspending Mr Hopkins, shortly before the Telegraph published her allegations.Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn declined to answer questions from reporters about Mr Hopkins's promotion on Friday morning.BBC political correspondent Iain Watson said he understood that Mr Corbyn was aware that a complaint had been made against Mr Hopkins when he promoted him but was not aware of the full details and was told the matter had been closed.Who is Kelvin Hopkins?Labour MP for Luton North since 1997 Spent most of 20-year political career on backbenches Briefly promoted to front bench from July to October 2016 Long history of involvement with trade union movement One of 36 MPs to nominate Jeremy Corbyn for his 2015 leadership bid One of the few Labour MPs to campaign for Leave in the EU referendum Married to Patricia.The couple have two grown up children Mr Corbyn's office has denied claims that Labour whips advised them not to promote Mr Hopkins because of what happened.In a statement announcing the decision to suspend Mr Hopkins on Thursday, the Labour Party said: "On the basis of allegations received by the Labour Party today, Kelvin Hopkins has been suspended from party membership, and therefore the Labour whip, while an investigation takes place."The Labour Party takes all such complaints extremely seriously and has robust procedures in place to deal with them."Asked about the story, Shadow Commons leader Valerie Vaz told BBC Radio 4's World at One: "The issue has come to light and and the matter is being thoroughly investigated by the party."Last week Mr Corbyn said he would encourage any woman who had been abused or harassed by MPs to speak out, adding that the party's National Executive Committee (NEC) had adopted new "robust" procedures to deal with the issue in July.But one NEC member, Jasmin Beckett, said an independent external investigator was needed: "The new sexual harassment policy is still insufficient and makes no attempt to look at the possibility of an independent body to deal with sensitive complaints."
Priti Patel held undisclosed meetings in Israel:::::Image copyright EPA The International Development Secretary held undisclosed meetings in Israel without telling the Foreign Office while accompanied by an influential pro-Israeli Conservative lobbyist, the BBC has learned.Priti Patel met the leader of one of Israel's main political parties and made visits to several organisations where official departmental business was reportedly discussed.According to one source, at least one of the meetings was held at the suggestion of the Israeli ambassador to London.In contrast, British diplomats in Israel were not informed about Ms Patel's plans.Ministers are by convention supposed to tell the Foreign Office when they are conducting official business overseas.Downing Street said Ms Patel was on a private holiday she had paid for herself, during which she took the opportunity to meet people.But Labour have called for an investigation to examine whether Ms Patel breached the ministerial code and rules on lobbying.The meetings took place over two days in August while Ms Patel was on holiday in Israel.'Freelance foreign policy' No civil servants were present but Ms Patel was accompanied by Lord Polak, honorary president of Conservative Friends of Israel (CFI), an influential lobbying organisation that has access to wealthy party donors.Some ministers and MPs accused Ms Patel of trying to win favour with wealthy pro-Israeli Conservative donors who could fund a potential future leadership campaign.Others accused her of conducting her own "freelance foreign policy" on Israel.Ms Patel is a long-standing supporter of Israel and a former vice-chairman of CFI.Ministers also said there was a potential risk that the meetings could have broken the ministerial code of conduct which states that "ministers must ensure that no conflict arises, or could reasonably be perceived to arise, between their public duties and their private interests, financial or otherwise".Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu has been in London this week One minister said: "This is outrageous.She is a Cabinet minister.She just cannot do this.This is about donors and influence."One former minister said: "What does it say to the rest of the Middle East if a senior Cabinet minister in charge of Britain's huge aid budget disappears for 48 hours from a family holiday in Israel and is under the wing of a pro-Israeli lobbyist?"The revelations risk embarrassing the government while the Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, is in London to mark the centenary of the Balfour Declaration, when Britain first gave its support for a national home for the Jewish people.A senior Downing Street source denied Ms Patel had done anything wrong.And a source at the Department for International Development said it was a private holiday paid for by the Secretary of State herself.'Blindsided' Foreign Office sources in London - and diplomatic sources in the region - confirmed that Ms Patel had not given them any warning of her visit.One minister said: "Yes, we did not know about the trip.We were unsighted on it."Another source said the British consulate in Jerusalem was "blindsided" and felt "slightly bruised".A third Foreign Office source said: "We didn't know and would have expected to know, given the meetings she had."Ms Patel took time out from her family holiday on 24 August to meet Yair Lapid, the leader of Israel's centrist Yesh Atid party, a former finance minister in Mr Netanyahu's coalition government.Mr Lapid tweeted a picture of the meeting, saying it was "great to meet Priti Patel" whom he described as "a true friend of Israel."Mr Lapid's spokesman confirmed that he had met Ms Patel but refused to say what they discussed.Ms Patel was accompanied by the Tory peer, Lord Polak.He is now honorary president of Conservative Friends of Israel but for more than 25 years, he was the director of the lobby group.And in that role he had a huge influence on Conservative thinking on the Middle East, including writing speeches for Tory party leaders.Lord Polak told the BBC that he just happened to be on holiday at the same time as Ms Patel."We met up for one or two things," he said."It was the summer holidays.I just joined her for a couple of days, some drinks, some dinner, that kind of thing."That included the meeting with Mr Lapid: "He is just an old friend of mine, a personal friend.He is more a journalist than a politician.We just had coffee with him.It wasn't anything formal.It is all very innocent."'Fruitful partnership' Conservative Friends of Israel regularly pays for MPs and peers to visit Israel.But Lord Polak said that Ms Patel paid for the holiday herself and the trip had nothing to do with CFI.The peer said he organised for Ms Patel to visit Israeli firms and charities creating technologies that could be interesting to a Secretary of State for Development.Ms Patel visited Beit Issie Shapiro (BIS), a leading Israeli disability charity and campaign group, where she reportedly discussed the possibility of her department forming a long-term partnership with the organisation.Skip Twitter post by @pablokaplan2008 Hon Priti Patel MP -

UK Department for International Development, Ms Patel expressed interest in a long-term relationship with Beit Issie Shapiro, harnessing Israeli innovation to advance assistive technology for the benefit of people with disabilities in underdeveloped countries."We look forward to a strong, fruitful partnership with the DFID to enhance the quality of life of people with disabilities worldwide."'We reached out' Mrs Judes told the BBC that the Israeli embassy in London had been involved in setting up the visit: "We reached out."We met with the Israeli ambassador in London and he said this is something we should bring to the attention of Priti Patel."The Israeli embassy in London declined to respond to questions.Lord Polak said Ms Patel also visited Innovation: Africa, an Israeli not-for-profit organisation developing new solar and water technologies for remote African communities.The fear among some Tory MPs is that Ms Patel also used the trip to discuss reducing her department's support for Palestinian groups.Palestinian funding The UK currently sends about 68m a year to support the Palestinian territories, most of it from DFID's budget.Some of the money is given directly to the Palestinian Authority, the rest through the local UN agency or individual groups.Critics claim that instead of just supporting Palestinian refugees and institutions, the money has also been used to pay salaries to Palestinians jailed for terrorism-related offences.Ms Patel has long been a critic of this funding.She tightened up the guidelines on Palestinian spending last year, focusing more on health and education, but one Foreign Office source said that she had recently tried to go further, presenting a paper to the prime minister and the foreign secretary for yet more restrictions on the funding."But they were not particularly impressed by her arguments," said one Foreign Office source.Another said: "She has been trying this for some time.She has been pushing to get her hands on the PA aid budget and we have been pushing back."Others suggested Ms Patel was getting close to CFI in preparation for a future leadership contest.One Whitehall source said: "I have always understood it to be part of her leadership ambitions, if she has got people from CFI who are prepared to put money into her."The BBC sent Ms Patel's office a list of questions concerning the visit to Israel which it declined to answer.
Conservatives publish new code of conduct for MPs:::::Image copyright PA The Conservatives have published a new code of conduct for their MPs and other elected representatives in the wake of sexual harassment allegations.The party is immediately adopting a new complaints procedure with a hotline for reporting potential breaches and a more detailed investigatory process.For the first time, there will be an independent figure on the body looking into grievances, the party said.It pledged to deal with all complaints in a "timely and confidential manner".The code of conduct obliges all MPs and elected representatives to "act with probity and honesty" and uphold the party's "values and reputation".
Andrea Leadsom did not call for Fallon's sacking says No 10:::::Image copyright Reuters/BBC Image caption Reports claim Sir Michael Fallon made "lewd" remarks to Andrea Leadsom when they served on a Commons committee together.No 10 has insisted Andrea Leadsom did not call for Sir Michael Fallon to be sacked from the cabinet amid reports she complained about his conduct.The Sun and Daily Mail said the Commons leader complained about the ex-defence secretary making "lewd" remarks to her.Sir Michael, who quit office on Wednesday saying his general conduct fell short of expected standards, has "categorically denied" the allegations.Mrs Leadsom has led ministers' response to the Westminster misconduct claims.In a statement to Parliament on Monday, she said Commons procedures for handling complaints about MPs needed to be overhauled as women working in Parliament had a right to feel safe.Sir Michael became the first minister to resign since allegations of inappropriate behaviour by MPs from different parties first surfaced ten days ago.The latest newspaper claims involving the veteran Tory date back to between 2010 and 2012 when he and Mrs Leadsom were members of the Treasury Select Committee.According to the Sun and the Daily Mail, Mrs Leadsom remarked to Sir Michael - who was not a minister at the time but was deputy chair of the Conservatives - that she had cold hands and he allegedly replied: "I know where you can put them to warm them up".The newspapers claim Sir Michael was forced to quit as defence secretary after Mrs Leadsom complained to Prime Minister Theresa May about the alleged incident.A source close to Sir Michael said he "categorically denies" the newspapers' claims.Mrs Leadsom has not commented on them.But No 10 issued a statement, saying: "The Leader of the House did not, and has not, asked the prime minister to consider the position of Sir Michael Fallon when he was defence secretary."Image copyright PA Image caption The prime minister sat beside Andrea Leadsom as she gave her speech to Parliament Sir Michael confirmed on Tuesday that he was once rebuked by a journalist, Julia Hartley-Brewer, for putting his hand on her knee during a dinner in 2002, and he apologised at the time.A day later, he resigned as defence secretary, telling the BBC: "The culture has changed over the years, what might have been acceptable 15, 10 years ago is clearly not acceptable now."Parliament now has to look at itself and the prime minister has made very clear that conduct needs to be improved and we need to protect the staff of Westminster against any particular allegations of harassment."He was replaced on Thursday by Chief Whip Gavin Williamson.Ms Hartley-Brewer said that if he had gone because of her knee, it would be "the most absurd reason for anyone to have lost their job in the history of the universe".Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Sir Michael Fallon: "Not right for me to go on as defence secretary".Labour is also facing new claims of sexual harassment and has suspended an MP whilst it carries out an investigation.Kelvin Hopkins, who has represented Luton North for 20 years, has been accused of sexually harassing a party activist.A spokesman said Labour "takes all such complaints extremely seriously and has robust procedures in place".

Northampton Town loan: David Mackintosh's election fund took secret payments:::::Image copyright Twitter/David Mackintosh Image caption Mr Mackintosh, on the left, recently tweeted this picture with Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson A Conservative MP's general election fund took hidden payments from a developer as a multimillion-pound loan he personally oversaw paid out.More than 37,000 was channelled to David Mackintosh's 2015 campaign from 1st Land Ltd, while he was leader of Northampton Borough Council.Most of a 10.25m loan he signed off to redevelop Northampton Town FC has vanished and police are investigating.Howard Grossman, of 1st Land Ltd, and Mr Mackintosh deny any wrong-doing.Documents obtained by the BBC show eight people linked to the developer made donations to the Northampton South Conservative Association between April and September 2014.During this time Mr Mackintosh was the Conservatives' candidate to contest Northampton South at the 2015 general election - a seat he went on to win.At least four of the donors received money from 1st Land Ltd shortly before making their payments.Mr Grossman was the sole director of 1st Land Ltd, which received the bulk of the 10.25m loaned by Northampton Borough Council.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Work on the East Stand at Northampton's Sixfields Stadium remains incomplete Image caption David Mackintosh, the former MP for Northampton South, did not stand for re-election in the 2017 general election It was during a time when the council was negotiating millions in extra loan money to build a hotel and homes next to the Sixfields stadium.Two of the donors told the BBC they were Labour supporters and another said they did not vote at the general election.One donation was titled: "David Mack Campaign".Mr Mackintosh, then leader of Northampton Borough Council, had been given delegated powers, along with senior council officials, to push through a series of loans to the football club.Only a small percentage of the money passed to Mr Grossman's company made its way to the stadium builders, who walked out over unpaid bills.The League One club defaulted on the loan and faced a winding up order by HMRC.It almost went under before a takeover in 2015.A police inquiry into the missing public money is looking into allegations of theft and fraud, bribery, misconduct in public office and electoral offences.Mr Mackintosh stood down as an MP in June after a campaign to deselect him over his role in the affair.Image caption A hotel and conference centre were also due to be built on land surrounding Sixfields An audit report into the way the loan was dealt with said it had been rushed because of "political and management pressure" and "fell seriously short" of expected standards.The payments to Mr Mackintosh's fund were made in the months before planning permission for housing and a hotel by the stadium was granted by the borough council.The BBC previously revealed Mr Grossman channelled 30,000 in three 10,000 payments to Mr Mackintosh's election campaign fund via three proxy donors using money from 1st Land.Most of 1st Land's funds came from the loan, although a fraction originated from another source.One of those donations was initially not declared to the Electoral Commission, which carries out automatic audit checks on payments exceeding 25,000 a year.When asked about the failure to declare the donation, Mr Mackintosh's office blamed an "admin error".The BBC has now discovered five more donations where businesses each paid 1,500 to the campaign over a six-month period - the maximum sum which can be donated without being publicly registered.In June 2014, Sharad Bhimjiyani, from Middlesex, a business associate of Mr Grossman who was financial controller at his County Group, donated 1,500 a week after 1st Land Ltd paid 16,500 to his company, NSB Accountancy Ltd.The payment was marked "David Mack Campaign" On the same day, his wife Nutan Bhimjiyani also donated 1,500 through her company RSB Accountancy Ltd Another Middlesex company, Javee Trading Ltd, donated 1,500.One of its directors is linked to Mrs Bhimjiyani via another company Brij Parekh, also from Middlesex, donated 1,500.Companies House and Land Registry records show his company, Aquarius Airfreight Services Ltd, was registered at a property owned by the Bhimjiyani family Another businessman, Nilesh Gosai, also from Middlesex, gave 1,500 in June 2014 Mr Bhimjiyani did not respond to repeated BBC requests.Mrs Bhimjiyani said: "I don't know anything, I would like to make no comment."Javee Trading also did not respond and the other donors would not comment on the record when contacted.One of the other donors told the BBC privately he had "got in over his head" after doing a favour.Image copyright FACEBOOK Image caption Cash given to David Mackintosh's election campaign originated from developer Howard Grossman, pictured with his wife "I have not done anything wrong, knowingly," he said."I would not donate money to a political party.I don't even vote.I am not a political person.There is no way I would give money to a political party."In a statement, Mr Mackintosh said: "To the best of my knowledge, all donations over the legal required amount were accepted, declared and published by Northampton South Conservative Association in accordance with the processes laid out by the Conservative Party and in accordance with the Representation of the People Act."I had no reason to question this until I was contacted by the BBC on 23 November 2015 regarding donations made to Northampton South Conservative Association with allegations that a donation had not been properly declared to the Electoral Commission."This was the first I was aware of this.I contacted Suresh Patel, the then Chairman of the Association, who confirmed this to be correct.He told me this was due to an admin error.I have no further knowledge of this admin error as the party's rules and processes ensure that candidates are not in a position to process or declare donations but Suresh Patel told me he was taking steps to rectify this with the Electoral Commission."'Genuine donations' Mr Patel, Mr Mackintosh's agent at the 2015 general election, said all the donations had been approved by the Conservative Party in London."When these donations came in we asked David Mackintosh, who told us these were all genuine donations," he said."He has sent us all the names and addresses and we have to submit to Conservative Central Office, which we did to the compliance team and it was all perfectly accepted."At that time there was no real concern.They were all accepted by the compliance team."Since leaving Parliament, Mr Mackintosh has continued in his role as vice president of the Conservative Friends of Bangladesh.He has also been appointed a Franco-British Young Leader.Kevin McKeever, the defeated Labour candidate at the 2015 general election in Northampton South, said he had run his election campaign on a shoe-string and had been comprehensively out-spent by his Conservative rival in the marginal constituency."The fact it wasn't a level playing field in the 12 months up to polling day calls into question the legitimacy of the result," he said.Northamptonshire Police is following 700 lines of inquiry in an investigation which has so far lasted almost two years.Ten people have been interviewed under caution and seven arrested.
Gavin Williamson replaces Michael Fallon as defence secretary:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption New Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson arrives at the MoD Chief Whip Gavin Williamson has been appointed as the new defence secretary after Sir Michael Fallon's resignation.Sir Michael quit on Wednesday saying his past behaviour may have "fallen short" of the standards expected by the UK military.He became the first politician to quit following recently revealed claims of sexual harassment in Parliament.South Staffordshire MP Mr Williamson, 41, said he was "both honoured and excited" by the promotion.He has been replaced as chief whip by his former deputy, Julian Smith, who will now be in charge of enforcing party discipline in the Commons.Mr Smith's deputy will be Tatton MP - and former GMTV presenter - Esther McVey.In a statement, Mr Williamson said he was "determined to ensure that the armed forces receive the recognition they deserve for the great work they do, including through the Armed Forces Covenant, and that they evolve both to meet the changing threats that we face and to ensure that they properly represent the modern society that they defend".He told reporters it was an "immense privilege" to be able to work with Britain's armed forces.He said his priority would be to continue to focus on "countering" Daesh, or so-called Islamic State, and "making sure national security is at the forefront of everything we do".BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said that while Mr Williamson was seen as an effective operator some Conservatives were furious that an MP with no ministerial experience had been promoted to the cabinet.One senior Conservative told her: "MPs are deeply unhappy he has used the position of chief whip to benefit himself and has deserted his post at such a crucial time".Asked about claims he lacks ministerial experience, Mr Williamson said: "I've been a minister as chief whip, but it was a little bit quieter when you're chief whip, not so much publicity."Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Some MPs 'furious' at Gavin Williamson appointment One Tory MP, Sarah Wollaston, told BBC Radio 4's World at One that Penny Mordaunt and Tobias Ellwood had been possible alternatives adding: "These are decisions that are made through patronage.Part of the role of the chief whip is to advise the prime minister about the suitability of the candidate."But Conservative MP Bob Stewart - a former Army colonel - described Mr Williamson as a "decent, calm man... he's also a very thoughtful man"."He won't know much about defence but I believe the civil service in the Ministry of Defence, the generals and the Armed Forces themselves won't mind that too much because he's the sort of person that will listen carefully, take advice but then make his own decision."Battles ahead for Williamson BBC defence correspondent Jonathan Beale Gavin Williamson has no military background and has never been a secretary of state.But he is youthful, a rising star and trusted by Number 10.He arrives at the Ministry of Defence at a difficult time.His first challenge will be to try to stave off more defence cuts.The Cabinet Office is currently carrying out a defence and security review which is due to report by the end of the year.All three services have been asked to put forward options for cuts.Although there has been a modest rise in the MoD's budget, it has still got to make more than 20bn of efficiency savings.There's also pressure to fund an increase in pay for the armed forces.They've been struggling with both recruitment and retention.That also hasn't been helped by a political reluctance to put troops in harm's way - something they train for.There is still unfinished business against so-called Islamic State and Gavin Williamson will be the man who now oversees the RAF airstrikes.Few inside the military or the MoD will know much about him - even fewer on the international stage.The prime minister's official spokesman said Mr Williamson was not involved in reshuffle discussions, and said he was "an excellent and hard-working chief whip and the prime minister thinks he will make an excellent defence secretary"."The PM is confident in the operation of the whips' office during her premiership."In his resignation letter, Sir Michael Fallon said a number of allegations that had surfaced about MPs, including himself, had been false, but added: "I accept that in the past I have fallen below the high standards that we require of the Armed Forces that I have the honour to represent."Who is Gavin Williamson?Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Gavin Williamson keeps a tarantula -

MPs told of school rape and sexual harassment:::::Image copyright PA Children as young as six suffer sexual violence in school, MPs heard during a debate on the issue in Parliament.Tory MP Maria Miller said one mother had told her that her six-year-old was raped by a classmate but her teachers dismissed it as "playful activity".Another parent told her his daughter had been raped at school.Minister for Women Anne Milton said parents who felt their child was unsafe should go to children's social care and there remained "much more to do".The government also said it would issue more guidance to schools on dealing with sexual harassment.Thursday's debate followed a report published last year which suggested sexual harassment among pupils had become "normalised".Ms Miller, chairman of the Women and Equalities Committee, said the incident involving the six-year-old was not recorded centrally because the child was under the age of criminal responsibility.She said the second parent had said girls as young as 12 were encouraging each other to send sexual images of themselves to their peer group and were encouraged to have anal sex by their classmates.'Epidemic of abusive photos' Labour MP John Mann described an "epidemic of abusive sexual photographs of girls being circulated on a daily basis around schools" and suggested "schools and teachers have no idea what to do about the problem".He said: "I get very depressed by the numbers of people - usually of women - who come to see me and I find out what happened to them at school."Their parents do not know, they have no idea whatever.These women will not have reported to the police the fact that they have been raped.The volume is so incredibly profound that we have an epidemic in this country."The debate follows a Women and Equalities Committee hearing last month where schools minister Nick Gibb admitted current guidance does not stop children who sexually abuse other pupils being put back in the same classroom as their victim.However Mr Gibb said this situation should not happen and said the Keeping Children Safe in Education guidance could include this when it is revised this year.In September 2015, a BBC investigation revealed there were 5,500 sexual offences recorded in UK schools between 2011 and 2014.Image copyright Getty Creative Stock Among these were nearly 4,000 alleged physical sexual assaults and more than 600 rapes, figures from Freedom of Information requests showed.At least a fifth of offences were carried out by children on children, but details of the rest of the assaults are not known.Since last year's report, the Children and Social Work Act (2017) has made relationships education for all primary school children and relationships and sex education for all secondary school children compulsory.Ms Miller called for more "urgency" from government to tackle the issue.Even when statutory guidance is issued to schools, it will still take a full academic year to come into force, she said.'Not sufficient' Minister for Women Anne Milton said she hoped new draft regulations and guidance on relationships and sex education would be published in 2018.However she said this alone was "not sufficient" and "all schools have a legislative duty to safeguard and protect children".She added: "In a serious situation - a number of serious and harrowing situations have been raised today - if parents or carers do not think that a child is safe, they should go to children's social care."Alternatively, if a parent or carer feels that a school is not fulfilling its duty because either it is not following its policies or it has inadequate policies, there is a whistleblowing line with Ofsted and the NSPCC."
UK interest rates rise for first time in 10 years:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The Bank of England may lift rates twice more over three years For the first time in more than 10 years, the Bank of England has raised interest rates.The official bank rate has been lifted from 0.25% to 0.5%, the first increase since July 2007.It is likely to rise twice more over the next three years, according to Bank of England governor Mark Carney.The move reverses the cut in August of last year, which was made in the wake of the vote to leave the European Union.Almost four million households face higher mortgage interest payments after the rise, but it should give savers a modest lift in their returns.As well as many of the country's 45 million savers, anyone considering buying an annuity for their pension will also see better deals.The main losers will be households with a variable rate mortgage.Mr Carney expects banks to pass on the rate rise to savers, but said many mortgages, loans and credit cards would not see an immediate impact.He said that British households have been "savvy" with their finances and have mostly taken out fixed-rate mortgages, which means it will take some time before the rise has an impact on them.The Bank estimates that almost two million mortgage holders have not experienced an interest rate rise since taking out a mortgage.Of the 8.1 million households with a mortgage, 3.7 million - or 46% - are on either a standard variable rate or a tracker rate - which generally move with the official bank rate.The average outstanding balance is 89,000 which would see payments increase by about 12 a month, according to UK Finance.The panel which sets interest rates, called the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), justified the rate increase by pointing to record-low unemployment, rising inflation and stronger global economic growth.Seven out of the nine members voted in favour of higher rates.Mr Carney told the BBC that the Bank expected the UK economy to grow at about 1.7% for the next few years, which he said would require "about two more interest rate increases over the next three years".Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption We challenged some ten year olds to explain a system that baffles many adults The pound fell about 1% against the dollar and euro, as some investors had hoped to see hints of more rate rises.Sterling dropped more than a cent against the two currencies to $1.3130 and 1.1280 respectively.Brexit impact The financial markets are indicating two more interest rate increases over the next three years, taking the official rate to 1%.Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club consultancy, said: "The Bank of England seemingly sees the hike to 0.50% as more likely to be a case of 'one and a little more to come' rather than 'one and done'."The MPC also said that the decision to leave the European Union is having a "noticeable impact" on the economic outlook.Mr Carney said "Brexit-related constraints" on investment and workers appeared to be holding back the potential growth of the economy.Looking ahead, he said: "The biggest determinate of our outlook is going to be those negotiations ongoing on Brexit - both a transition deal to a new arrangement and what is the longer form arrangement with the European Union."The Bank of England is tasked with keeping consumer price inflation at around 2%.However, inflation has been running higher than that since February, and in September it hit 3% - the highest rate since April 2012.Mr Carney said inflation was unlikely to return to 2% without raising rates, because the economy was growing at levels "above its speed limit".Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Where were you when interest rates last went up?Business bodies said the rise was expected, but warned that companies could be hit if further increases came too soon.The Federation of Small Businesses said some would struggle to "absorb more hikes in the short term", while the CBI said "what's important is the pace of any future rises".Economists said the rise was unlikely to have a big effect on the economy, because rates are still at the lows seen since the financial crisis.Lucy O'Carroll, chief economist at Aberdeen Standard Investments, said: "The symbolism of this hike is more significant than its economic impact."Price pressures The Bank has been reluctant to raise interest rates until now, arguing that inflation had been boosted by the fall in the value of the pound since the Brexit vote in June of last year.That weaker pound has driven up the costs of imported food, fuel and other goods.The Bank says this effect is probably at its peak at the moment.The other issue holding back the Bank has been the weakness in wage growth.While inflation hit 3% in September, wage growth was only 2.1%.However, the Bank sees wage growth "gradually" increasing over the 2018 and says there are signs of that happening already.In its Quarterly Inflation Report, released with the announcement on rates, the Bank estimated inflation was likely to peak this month at 3.2%.Do you have a question about the interest rate change?What do you need to know about the change?E-mail us at haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk.You can also contact us in the following ways:
Prisoner voting changes 'will affect up to 100 inmates':::::Up to 100 day-release prisoners at any one time will affected by plans to ease the blanket ban on giving prisoners voting rights, MPs have been told.Justice Secretary David Lidington said guidance needed to be amended to address an "anomaly" in the system around prisoners on temporary licence.Currently, those wearing an electronic tag in the community can vote, but those out on temporary licence cannot.However, one Tory MP said giving the vote to any prisoners was "idiotic".Addressing the Commons, Mr Lidington said no offenders would be released in order to vote.He also said that no inmates will be able to vote from prison or be able to register a prison as their home address.The decision follows a long legal battle with the European Court of Human Rights, which has repeatedly ruled the UK's blanket ban on prisoner voting breaches prisoners' human rights.Mr Lidington said the government continued to believe that convicted offenders "detained in prison should not vote".But he said giving the right to vote was consistent with the approach of preparing prisoners for their return to society.Tory MP and former attorney general Dominic Grieve and ex-cabinet minister Cheryl Gillan both welcomed the announcement.However, othwr spoke out about the plans.Tory MP Philip Davies said: "I think giving the vote to any prisoners is idiotic, unjustifiable and is about as popular with the general public as finding a rattlesnake in a lucky dip."Conservative MP Philip Hollobone, told the Commons that ex-prime minister David Cameron had said the thought of giving prisoners the vote made him feel physically sick."Many of us on these benches feel the same nausea and many of our constituents as well.I congratulate (Mr Lidington) on overcoming his nausea," he added.
Brexit studies details 'will be published':::::Image copyright EPA The government has said it will release information from Brexit impact studies, after Labour won a vote effectively forcing their hand.Ministers had argued that releasing the economic impact studies would undermine their Brexit negotiating position.But Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom agreed that Wednesday's vote was "binding" and told MPs: "The information will be forthcoming."Brexit Secretary David Davis said ministers would be "as open as we can".He said he was already talking to Hilary Benn, the Labour chairman of the Committee for Exiting the European Union, about "how we handle the confidentiality of the documentation we'll hand over".The government has been under pressure to release the studies, which show the potential impact of leaving the EU on 58 economic sectors.On Monday it published the list of sectors that have been looked at, ranging from aerospace and aviation to tourism and legal services.But it had argued that releasing them would undermine its negotiating position.But on Wednesday Labour used an arcane parliamentary procedure to get the documents released.Image copyright EPA It involved tabling a motion that "an humble address be presented to Her Majesty" requiring that the reports "be laid before this House and that the impact assessments arising from those analyses be provided to the Committee on Exiting the European Union".The government chose not to oppose the motion and it was not initially clear whether it would be binding.Speaker John Bercow told MPs on Wednesday that this type of motion had "traditionally been regarded as binding or effective" and made clear that the government should respond quickly to the vote.Brexit Secretary Mr Davis told MPs that discussions were under way with Mr Benn about releasing the the documents but added: "These documents are not some sort of grand plan, they're data about the regulations and the markets of individual sectors which inform our negotiation."Of course we will be as open as we can be with the select committee, I fully intend to."'Conflicting obligation' In a letter to Mr Davis, Mr Benn asked him to confirm in writing what arrangements he was making to provide his committee with the impact assessments.He added that he hoped it would be done "much sooner" than the 12 weeks the government had previously indicated it would take to respond to opposition day debate motions.Earlier Commons Leader Ms Leadsom was asked when the studies would be released.She replied: "It is absolutely accepted that the motion passed by the House yesterday is binding and that the information will be forthcoming."But, as I think as has been made very clear, it is the case that it is difficult to balance the conflicting obligation to protect the public interest through not disclosing information that could harm the national interest and the public interest whilst at the same time ensuring that the resolution of the House passed yesterday is adhered to."
The UK's race to get its own nuclear inspectors:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Hinkley Point in Somerset is to be the site of a new nuclear power station The government cannot guarantee Britain will have enough nuclear inspectors when it leaves the EU, MPs on the business committee were told.The Office of Nuclear Regulation has recruited four new safeguards inspectors but says it needs more time to fill the specialised roles.Nuclear minister Richard Harrington said there was "plenty of time" to recruit the staff needed.But he stopped short of offering a firm guarantee.The government has stressed that nuclear safeguards - the processes by which the UK shows its civil nuclear material is not diverted into weapons programmes - are different from nuclear safety - the prevention of nuclear accidents.Mr Harrington said the UK was committed to leaving Euratom, the agency which has regulated the nuclear industry across Europe since 1957, at the same time as it left the EU in March 2019.Industry figures have warned about significant disruption to energy production in the UK if there is not a new inspection regime ready to go to, to replace the one currently overseen by Euratom.The four senior figures who gave evidence to the business committee on Wednesday said there was no benefit to the UK from leaving Euratom.Image copyright Science Photo Library Image caption Nuclear waste facility at Drigg, in Cumbria Mr Harrington agreed that Euratom had done a good job but said there was no question of remaining in it, as some have demanded, or of having "associate membership".He said a new UK regime would be set up to be as "close as possible" to the one operated by Euratom.Mina Golshan, deputy chief inspector at the Office for Nuclear Regulation, whose job it is to set up the new regime said she was confident Britain would continue to meet its international safeguarding obligations after March 2019.But she said the agency would need a further two years to set up a bespoke UK regime and even this timescale was a "tall order".The biggest problem was recruiting new safeguards inspectors from a "limited pool of expertise"."To get to a point where we can deliver a regime by 2019 we need 10 to 12 additional inspectors and for us to be able to be up and running by two years after that probably around 20 to 25 inspectors," she told the committee.Labour shortages The Office for Nuclear Regulation has said it will be very difficult to find enough British scientists, who can earn up to 99,000 a year as inspectors, to fill the gap.Mr Harrington said he was confident the Office for Nuclear Regulation recruitment drive, which has been put on hold until the Nuclear Safeguarding Bill gets its second reading, would succeed and there was "plenty of time" to fill the vacancies.But pressed on whether he could guarantee that, he said: "When recruiting it depends who replies in response to an advert."Image copyright Science Photo Library Image caption The Culham Centre for Fusion Energy in Oxfordshire Mr Harrington was also quizzed by the MPs about feared shortages of less skilled workers needed to build new nuclear plants, such as steel workers and welders.Brexit visas need for new nuclear plant Ben Russell, of Horizon Nuclear, the Japanese-owned firm planning to build a new nuclear reactor at Wylfa Newydd, on Anglesey, called for a special visa for infrastructure workers post-Brexit so they could continue to be recruited from EU countries.He said projects like HS2 and the third runway at Heathrow meant the demand for staff would outstrip supply and there was not enough time to train up British workers.David Wagstaff, the civil servant leading talks for the UK on the withdrawal from Euratom, said it would be up to the British government to decide on a post-Brexit visa regime.'No relationship' There was also concern about the future of the world-leading nuclear fusion laboratory based in Oxfordshire, the Joint European Torus (JET), which is mostly funded by the EU.Mr Wagstaff said: "We are confident that the EU will want Britain to participate in this research and development programme."But, as with the other concerns raised by the MPs and industry figures, he said it was not possible to give any guarantees because substantive talks had not yet started in Brussels.Mr Wagstaff said: "The way in which the EU 27 side are proceeding is to basically try and pin down all the things that are being pulled apart before we then get to the conversation about how much we can be put back together again."He said EU negotiators were doing this because they were not sure what kind of relationship the UK would have with UK post-Brexit and wanted to prepare for every eventuality, including the "eventuality of there not being such a relationship".
Theresa May under fire for Stormont talks 'absence':::::Image copyright AFP Image caption Owen Smith said Theresa May has not attended 'a single substantive session' of the Stormont talks Theresa May should "get stuck in" to the talks process to restore power-sharing at Stormont, the shadow Northern Ireland secretary has said.Owen Smith said it was "completely inexplicable" that the prime minister had visited the region just once since its executive collapsed in January.Talks between the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and Sinn Fin to resolve the crisis broke down on Wednesday.As a result, the government said it had to step in to set a Stormont budget.Northern Ireland Secretary James Brokenshire laid out his plans for a budget to MPs on Thursday, but was adamant that it did not mean a return to direct rule from Westminster for Northern Ireland.If and when a budget is presented, it will not mean an end to any chance of a return to devolution, he said.It will not "set out any spending decisions by me or the government", he added, but will incorporate figures from Northern Ireland's civil service.Image caption Owen Smith said Theresa May could 'at least give it a go' to end the Northern Ireland stalemate Mrs May and Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Leo Varadkar discussed the situation in a phone call on Wednesday night and agreed that the gap between the parties was "narrow".The DUP and Sinn Fin have failed to reach an agreement in spite of numerous rounds of discussions since March's Northern Ireland Assembly election.That vote was called after the Northern Ireland Executive collapsed amid a bitter split over the handling of a botched renewable energy scheme in January.Sinn Fin's demand for legislation to give official status to the Irish language has become one of the main stumbling blocks in negotiations to restore the executive.'Odd phone call' The Labour Party's Mr Smith said he wanted to see Mrs May make more effort towards finding a solution to the political stalemate."She has not attended a single substantive session of the talks in Belfast and she has not made a single substantive intervention to try and move things along," he told MPs."I know things have been difficult recently, but frankly the odd phone call to the taoiseach just isn't good enough."It may be true that the days of a prime minister or president flying into Belfast to fix things are past and overstated, but they could at least give it a go."Image copyright Reuters Image caption James Brokenshire said Theresa May has been actively involved in the talks However, Mr Brokenshire said the prime minister has had meetings with the Stormont parties at Downing Street."She does remain actively involved, including continued discussions with the taoiseach, on the right way that we can work together," he added.'Not tenable' He also said he would "reflect carefully" on the salaries of Stormont's assembly members (MLAs), amid calls for them to be docked until a power-sharing deal is reached.Mr Brokenshire said he would take independent advice on the issue because allowing the existing pay arrangements to continue was "not tenable"."This is a devolved matter and I cannot intervene without primary legislation in Westminster," he said.On Wednesday, Mr Brokenshire said government intervention had become necessary because Northern Ireland's public service would begin to run out of resources by the end of this month.Sinn Fin said the latest talks had "ended in failure", while the DUP said progress towards a deal had been held up by Sinn Fin's "narrow political agenda".They have both said they were prepared to take part in more negotiations but none have been planned.Speaking in the House of Commons on Thursday, DUP MP Jeffrey Donaldson outlined a key demand his party had made.He said the party was seeking the implementation of the Armed Forces Covenant, a promise to look after military veterans though priority medical treatment, help to find housing and other measures.
Nicola Sturgeon sets out Scottish income tax options:::::Image copyright Scottish Government The Scottish government has set out a range of options for future income tax rates ahead of budget negotiations.First Minister Nicola Sturgeon published a discussion paper on rates, posing "tough questions" about rises.The paper details the potential impact of tax plans advanced by the SNP and by opposition parties, and sets out tests by which these can be judged.Finance Secretary Derek Mackay will now open talks with other parties in a bid to build a majority for his budget.Launching the paper, Ms Sturgeon said "we must consider if the time has come for those who earn the most to pay a modest amount more".It lays out a series of tests by which future policy should be judged, including the amount of money that would be raised, whether or not policies would protect low earners and help tackle inequality, and the potential impact on business and the economy.'Responsible and progressive' Holyrood took control over income tax rates and thresholds in 2016.Ministers have so far opted not to change the basic rate of tax, but varied the threshold at which the higher 40p rate kicks in.MSPs voted in favour of the principle of raising taxes to raise funds for public services in September, although SNP members abstained from that vote.Ms Sturgeon said the discussion paper would "aid and inform" a discussion between parties on tax rates ahead of budget negotiations - stressing that all parties would need to compromise in order to strike a deal.Image copyright Scottish Government Image caption Finance Secretary Derek Mackay will open talks with other parties Each party has put forward a range of proposals, with all barring the Greens currently suggesting maintaining the current three-band system, but with changes to rates and thresholds.However, few of these plans satisfy the four tests set out by Ms Sturgeon, and while her paper analyses the various party proposals it also sets out four "alternative approaches" which could instead be pursued.These include having anything up to six bands, an approach that the first minister said could potentially be "more progressive".Three of the four include a 50p top rate, and incremental changes to others.The SNP has previously backed a 50p top rate of tax UK-wide, but at that point rejected doing so north of the border alone unless powers over tax avoidance were also strengthened.The party's manifesto for the 2016 Holyrood elections proposed freezing the basic rate of income tax for the duration of the current parliament, but ministers have accepted they will have to make concessions in order to pass a budget.Ms Sturgeon did highlight, however, that the SNP's manifesto proposals won more support than any others, saying that if her party was ready to compromise then others could not stick "rigidly" to their previous proposals either.What has been the reaction to the proposals?The options paper featured heavily at First Minister's Questions later on Thursday, with Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson challenging Ms Sturgeon to commit to an independent economic assessment of her tax proposals.And she raised concerns that any increase in taxation would slow economic growth.Ms Davidson said: "We don't think it's right that any Scot earning more than 24,000 should have to pay more."The bottom line here is about getting growth and we are lagging behind.Scotland's economy is currently growing a third of the rate of the UK."But the first minister stressed the need for balance, saying: "We need to look at this from the point of view of what kind of country do we want to be, what kind of economy do we want to have and what kind of society do we want?"Scottish Labour's Jackie Baillie said she welcomed a focus on progressive taxation, but said the government's tax options would not be enough to end austerity.She said: "To end austerity you need to raise more than 800m in revenue over the next two years, that's before we consider additional commitments."Yet the government's proposals published today in the tax paper raises a maximum of 290m."Greens co-convener Patrick Harvie, whose party backs an overhaul of income tax rates and bands, said his party's proposals for a "fairer range of rates and bands is the only serious option left standing".The Scottish Lib Dems have also backed rises, calling for a 1p increase in income tax to raise funds for education.The Federation of Small Businesses said it "seems obvious" that Ms Sturgeon was "softening the ground for an increase", and that it was "as yet unconvinced that taking more through income tax is the right move for the country".
Balfour Declaration: Theresa May hosts Israeli PM for centenary:::::Image copyright PA Image caption Theresa May has spoken of her pride at Britain's role in the emergence of Israel UK PM Theresa May and her Israeli counterpart have jointly marked the centenary of a British pledge that paved the way for Israel's creation.Mrs May and Benjamin Netanyahu attended dinner in London honouring the Balfour Declaration of British support for a Jewish national home in Palestine.Israel and Jewish communities view the pledge as momentous, while Palestinians regard it as a historical injustice.The UK has rejected calls to apologise and has said it is proud of its role.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, a long-time critic of Israeli policy towards the Palestinians, declined an invitation to attend the dinner.Shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry went in his place.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The Balfour Declaration: 100 years of conflict In a speech at the dinner at Lancaster House, Mrs May warned against using criticism of Israel as a cover for anti-Semitism."There is today a new and pernicious form of anti-Semitism which uses criticism of the actions of the Israeli government as a despicable justification for questioning the very right of Israel to exist," she said."This is abhorrent, and we will not stand for it."Earlier Mr Netanyahu held talks with Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson.Analysis: Competing narratives By Jonathan Marcus, BBC diplomatic correspondent There is a huge amount of fuss being made about the centenary of the Balfour Declaration, in part misguided.For Balfour, and indeed Britain, did not create a Jewish state.In fact in the years leading up to Israel's independence in 1948, Britain, as the mandatory power, did a good deal to thwart Jewish statehood, torn between the competing claims of Jewish and Palestinian nationalism.Much of the current focus on the Balfour Declaration is due to the fact that it supports the competing narratives of the Israeli government and the Palestinian leadership.For the Israelis it highlights the legitimacy of the Jewish national enterprise, while for Palestinians, it underscores the role of the major powers in helping to create Israel, while - in their view - the legitimate Palestinian aspirations to statehood were ignored or side-lined.Thus both sides have a very different interpretation of the declaration's significance - one that serves today's arguments about one of the region's longest unresolved struggles.Black flags In the Palestinian territories, thousands of Palestinians held protest marches in the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem, denouncing what they say is a betrayal which left them dispossessed.Palestinians regard the Balfour Declaration as having robbed them of their land and have demanded that Britain apologises.Some held black flags and called for Palestinian refugees to be allowed to return to land which became Israel.About 400 protesters from a fringe group of Jewish anti-Zionists marched from Downing Street to the Houses of Parliament, calling on "God to dismantle the Israeli State".After meeting Mrs May, Mr Netanyahu said it was time for Palestinians to come to terms with the past."A hundred years after Balfour, the Palestinians should finally accept the Jewish national home and finally accept the Jewish state."And when they do, the road to peace will be infinitely closer.In my opinion, peace will be achievable," he said.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Palestinians ask British diplomats in Jerusalem to apologise for the Balfour Declaration.However, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said the Balfour Declaration was "not something to be celebrated".Writing in the Guardian, Mr Abbas said the past was still "something that can be made right", and called on the UK to recognise a Palestinian state in territory occupied by Israel since the 1967 Middle East war, with East Jerusalem as its capital.Britain's pledge, on 2 November 1917, was made in a letter by the then-Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour to Lord Walter Rothschild, a leader of the British Jewish community.The letter said the government viewed "with favour the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people", so long as it did not "prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities".The Balfour Declaration was the first international recognition by a world power of the right of the Jewish people to a national home in their ancestral land and formed the basis of Britain's Mandate for Palestine in 1920.The British Mandate terminated on 14 May 1948 and the Jewish leadership in Palestine declared an independent Israeli state.In the Arab-Israeli war that followed, hundreds of thousands of Palestinian Arabs fled or were forced from their homes.
EU nurses 'turning their backs on UK':::::Image copyright SPL The decline in EU nurses and midwives wanting to work in the UK since the referendum is continuing, figures show.The trend was first noticed earlier this year, and now a new batch of figures released by the Nursing and Midwifery Council have reinforced the idea that Brexit is having an impact.In September the register showed just over 36,200 EU nurses and midwives - over 2,700 less than a year before.But ministers said a rise in training places would compensate for the drop.That will take some time to start having an impact though, and union leaders believe the government in England may struggle to fill these places as they have removed bursaries for nursing degrees and introduced fees.What do these figures show?The data released by the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) cover the number of nurses and midwives registered to work in the UK, not the numbers actually working.Rises in the numbers of nurses and midwives leaving the register was seen among all types of staff - those trained in the UK, in the EU and in the rest of the world.Search for a health trust or postcode Search for your nearest health trusts Can't find your health trust?Browse the full list Browse the full list Go Rather search by typing?Back to search If you can't see the NHS Tracker, click or tap here.But what marked the EU trend out was the rate of change being seen.There was a 67% rise in the number of EU nurses and midwives leaving the register in the 12 months up to September compared to the same period the year before.By comparison the number of UK-trained staff leaving the register rose by less than 10%.That rise in leavers was off-set by just over 1,000 new joiners from the EU, but that in itself was an 89% drop in the numbers who signed up the year before.The NMC pointed out this change in new joiners was also likely to have been influenced by the introduction of English language testing around the same time as the Brexit vote in the summer of 2016.Overall, the number of nurses and midwives on the register has started to drop for the first time in a decade.There were just under 690,000 nurses and midwives registered to work in the UK in September - over 1,600 less than there were the year before.This comes at a time when unions report there are significant shortages in the number of nurses employed by the NHS.Research by the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) said there were over 40,000 unfilled vacancies - one in nine posts.Trend causing concern The NMC said the rising numbers leaving the profession across the board was "worrying" and needed to be responded to.An ageing workforce, which is seeing growing numbers reach retirement age, and the pressures of working in the health service have been cited as factors for UK-trained nurses leaving the register.RCN general secretary Janet Davies said it was "no surprise" EU nurses were also turning their backs on the UK given what was happening with Brexit."These alarming new figures represent a double whammy for the NHS and patients."But the Department of Health played down the significance of the overall drop, pointing out it represented a "mere" 0.2% fall in the numbers registered to work.A spokeswoman said the number of training places would increase by 25% in the coming years and that ministers had been "very clear" that EU nationals would remain a valued part of the workforce after Brexit.Are you an EU nurse or midwife who has stopped working in the UK?Are you considering leaving?Let us know about your experiences.Email haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk with your stories.Please include a contact number if you are willing to speak to a BBC journalist.You can also contact us in the following ways:
Home Office monitoring of missing foreign offenders criticised:::::Not enough is being done to find almost 56,000 absconded foreign nationals due to be deported, a report has said.The Chief Inspector of Borders and Immigration said efforts to monitor a further 80,000 foreign offenders and illegal immigrants was being "seriously compromised" by Home Office failings.David Bolt said the number of people being monitored had created "practical difficulties" for officials involved.The Home Office said work was already under way to address issues.The 80,000 foreign nationals being monitored are required to report to the immigration authorities as they await possible deportation.They include foreign offenders, people who entered Britain illegally and those who have overstayed their visas.The 56,000 missing people includes cases dating back to 2009.Mr Bolt's report said there were problems of "poor communication and co-ordination" between different units inside the Home Office.This "seriously compromised" the process of monitoring them, he added.In one instance, the inspection found that action to locate a foreign offender was only taken after 19 appointments with immigration staff had been missed.It noted that in September 2016, about half of the "reporting population" - about 40,000 individuals - had been told to report at one of three London centres.High numbers meant staff at the busiest centre, Becket House, had an average of two to three minutes per interview.It resulted in limited opportunities for "meaningful interactions", the report said.The inspector has published to two reports - one on the Home Office's reporting and offender management processes and the other on its management of non-detained foreign national offenders (FNOs).'People under strain' Mr Bolt said: "In both cases, I found people and processes under strain."The numbers required to report routinely mean that it is extremely difficult for staff at reporting centres to ensure that reporting events... are meaningful, in terms of encouraging voluntary departures or resolving barriers to removal."He said the removal of FNOs is "regularly frustrated" often by last minute legal challenges."Monitoring non-detained FNOs effectively is a challenge and one that raises obvious public protection concerns," he added.The report made 14 recommendations in total, with the Home Office accepting all but two.Image copyright PA Image caption About 80,000 foreign nationals being monitored are required to report to the immigration authorities In response, the Home Office said it recognised the inspectors' "observations of inconsistencies in our operation" adding that it was "taking action to address this issue".There is an ongoing review of "how we establish and maintain contact with those who have not complied with restrictions placed on their stay in the UK" the Home Office added.The review is due to be completed by April 2018.Immigration minister Brandon Lewis said 38,600 foreign offenders had been removed from the UK since 2010, but admitted the reports made for "difficult reading"."People who have no right to live in this country should be in no doubt of our determination to remove them," he said."Our priority is to progress cases towards voluntary and, if necessary, enforced departures."Labour MP Yvette Cooper, chairwoman of the Commons Home Affairs Committee, said the findings were "extremely concerning" and undermined the credibility of "the whole immigration system".She said: "For the Home Office to have simply lost track of thousands of foreign national offenders and people here illegally is just not good enough."
Pressure on ministers over Brexit papers:::::Image copyright AFP/Getty Ministers have come under fresh pressure to release a series of Brexit impact studies, in a Commons debate.Some Conservative MPs joined Labour in calling for the 58 documents, which focus on different sectors of the economy, to be published.Labour is seeking to use an arcane parliamentary procedure to force the government's hand.The government did not contest the motion and earlier said there was an "obligation" not to publish the papers.After the motion was carried unanimously, Commons Speaker John Bercow said: "It is sensible for us, the House, to wait for the government's response and if I receive a representation I will reflect upon it" He said MPs should not expect the response on Wednesday but, when pressed by Conservative Sarah Wollaston, he indicated that he would not expect the House to have to wait "for a period of several days".On Monday the government published the list of sectors that have been looked at, ranging from aerospace and aviation to tourism and legal services, but has argued that releasing them would undermine its negotiating position with the EU.During the Commons debate, former Conservative minister Anna Soubry said the documents should be published and could be redacted if necessary.Another Conservative MP, Sarah Wollaston, said they should be sent to "all relevant select committees".Labour, which organised the debate, sought to make use of what it called an "ancient, but still effective" parliamentary tool to secure the documents' publication.This involved tabling a motion that "an humble address be presented to Her Majesty" requiring that the reports "be laid before this House and that the impact assessments arising from those analyses be provided to the Committee on Exiting the European Union".The unusual tactic won the support of Tory Eurosceptic backbencher Jacob Rees-Mogg, who said the motion should be binding on the government, and during the debate MPs appealed to the Speaker's chair for clarity.Deputy Speaker Eleanor Laing said it would be for the government to respond, adding: "It is not for the chair to decide how the minister should answer the question."Brexit Minister Robin Walker argued there was a "clear obligation" not to release the information.Labour's Brexit spokesman Sir Keir Starmer said it was a "victory for Parliament and for democracy"."Ministers cannot keep withholding vital information from Parliament about the impact of Brexit on jobs and the economy," he said."[Brexit Secretary] David Davis must now respond to Parliament's ruling and urgently set a date for when he will share these papers."Brexit negotiations are set to resume on 9 and 10 November with the UK seeking to make enough progress to persuade the EU to move talks onto future issues like trade.

money by the end of November if a budget is not in place, he added."No government could simply stand by and allow that to happen," he said.He would be ready to withdraw the budget bill if an executive is formed before December, added Mr Brokenshire.The budget will only deal with 2017-18 financial year, he said, adding that it did not mean a return to direct rule from Westminster for Northern Ireland.'Drift and delay' But the Labour Party questioned whether the government had done enough to encourage an agreement at Stormont.Its shadow Northern Ireland secretary Owen Smith said: "The prime minister has not even tried to feign an interest in the affairs of Northern Ireland, only visiting once."Drift, delay and the endless setting and re-setting of Plasticine deadlines has contributed to the impasse."Image copyright AFP Analysis: Stephen Walker, BBC News NI political correspondent Questions are being asked by both parties about whether their rival negotiators are interested in striking a deal.Sinn Fin president Gerry Adams thinks the DUP has not engaged in a serious way about his party's desire to see an Irish language act and provision for same-sex marriage.For its part, the DUP has always insisted Sinn Fein has put too many barriers in place and introduced too many red lines.Some think Mr Adams is more interested in matters south of the Irish border than in a restoration of devolution at Stormont.Unless the atmosphere changes, there is little sign the discussions can be fruitful.The DUP and Sinn Fin have failed to reach an agreement in spite of numerous rounds of discussions since March's assembly elections.The vote was called after the Northern Ireland Executive collapsed amid a bitter split over the handling of a botched renewable energy scheme in January.Sinn Fin's demand for legislation to give official status to the Irish language has become one of the main stumbling blocks in negotiations to restore the executive.Mr Campbell said the DUP would not be party to an agreement that "elevates" the Irish language "above health, education and other vital public services".Sinn Fin said the confidence and supply arrangement between the DUP and the Conservative Party had "compounded" the problems the parties faced.The prime minister made the 1bn deal with the DUP after losing her majority in Parliament in June's general election.'Latest possible juncture' The United States government said "shared political responsibility and pragmatism" was needed from the DUP and Sinn Fin to find an end to their differences."Northern Ireland's future will be best served by the establishment and running of an effective, accountable, and responsive government," said its spokeswoman Heather Nauert."This is especially true in light of the challenges that Brexit presents for the region."The Northern Ireland secretary has said he will seek independent advice on what steps should be taken to "reflect the current circumstances in MLA pay".Mr Brokenshire had previously said he would examine the issue of assembly members' salaries in the absence of devolution, amid calls for their payments to be docked.Image copyright Pacemaker Image caption The UUP will not oppose a reduction in MLAs' pay, said its leader Robin Swann Irish Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney said Mr Brokenshire had taken the budget decision with the "utmost reluctance and at the latest possible juncture".Both the UK and Irish government had "spared no effort" in supporting the talks between the DUP and Sinn Fin, he added."The issues under discussion - particularly those on language and culture - go to the heart of the divisions in society here in Northern Ireland."SDLP leader Colum Eastwood insisted that the government's budget move amounts to direct rule.He said it is a step backwards from the Good Friday peace agreement and he criticised Sinn Fin for its role in the deadlock.Northern Ireland is "coming slowly and deliberately to direct rule at the hands of Sinn Fin and the DUP", according to Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader Robin Swann.He added that Mr Brokenshire would "get no opposition" from the UUP if he decides to reduce MLAs' salaries.
Theresa May: Take sex abuse claims to police:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The prime minister said all staff at Westminster should be "treated with respect".Theresa May said any allegations about serious sexual abuse in Parliament should go to the police, as she promised a new "independent" process to handle complaints.The PM said she was "deeply concerned" by recent reports about alleged harassment and abuse at Westminster.She invited Labour's Jeremy Corbyn and other party leaders to a meeting to agree a new grievance procedure.Mr Corbyn said trade unions should be involved to support staff.Two ministers, meanwhile, have denied claims on a list, thought to have been drawn up by Westminster staff and researchers, detailing a range of mostly unproven allegations about 40 Conservative MPs.Following a range of recent allegations, including claims of a lack of support for those making complaints, Mrs May has written to party leaders calling for the "serious, swift, cross-party response this issue demands".The PM said a "common, transparent independent grievance procedure" for all those who work in Parliament was needed and that it "cannot be right" for policies to vary between parties.A dedicated support team should be available to all staff, she said, and it should recommend all criminal allegations be reported to the police.Speaking at Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Corbyn said he was happy to meet the PM to discuss it, with a meeting scheduled for Monday evening.The SNP's Ian Blackford said his party would also work with the government "to ensure that we have a system we can be proud of".Whips' offices During PMQs, Labour's Lisa Nandy said that three years ago she had raised concerns with Mrs May that party whips' offices - whose job is to keep the party's MPs in line and voting a certain way - had used sexual abuse allegations to demand loyalty from MPs.She later tweeted the exchange in question, which related to events in the 1970s and was raised at the time the inquiry into historical child abuse was being launched.Responding at the time in 2014 Mrs May, who was home secretary, said political parties would be included in the inquiry and that "every area where it is possible that people have been guilty of abuse" would be looked at.Responding to Ms Nandy in PMQs, she said she would look back at the questions raised, adding: "I will say to her that I am very clear, that the whips' office - I hope this goes for all whips' offices across this House - should make clear to people that where there are any sexual abuse allegations that could be of a criminal nature that people should go to the police."It is not appropriate for those to be dealt with by whips' offices; those should go to the police - that continues to be the case."Allegations denied Ahead of PMQs, Mrs May's deputy, Damian Green, said allegations of inappropriate behaviour towards a female activist were "completely false" and he said he had instructed libel lawyers.Tory activist Kate Maltby had written in the Times that he "fleetingly" touched her knee in a pub in 2015, and in 2016 sent her a "suggestive" text message.Former Conservative minister Anna Soubry said Mr Green should stand down while the allegations are investigated, but Small Business Minister Margot James told BBC 5 live: "I've read the article in the Times today, and I certainly don't think that it warrants anyone's resignation, temporary or otherwise, in my opinion."Two other ministers, Dominic Raab and Rory Stewart, hit out at the list of unproven allegations about Tory MPs.Justice minister Mr Raab said he had sought legal advice over the "false allegations", which he described as a "form of harassment".In an article on his website, he added: "I appreciate the Westminster list will encourage a further media feeding frenzy against MPs.I also recognise that there are undoubtedly some very disturbing allegations out there, which need to be taken seriously."At the same time, for anonymous individuals to compile and publish, or allow to be published, a list of vague, unsubstantiated and - in my case - false allegations is wrong."It is also a form of harassment and intimidation, although of course I am not suggesting it is the same or equivalent.Still, accountability should mean properly investigating any reports of abuse, without irresponsibly smearing those who have done nothing wrong."Mr Stewart said claims about his behaviour towards a female member of staff were "completely untrue".The researcher publicly backed this up, saying the aid minister was "never anything other than completely professional and an excellent employer".Labour, meanwhile, has launched an independent investigation into an activist's claim that she was discouraged by a party official from reporting an alleged rape at a party event in 2011.
Former MP assaulted me in 2012 says ex-Commons intern:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption James Greenhalgh speaks to the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg.A former parliamentary intern has told the BBC that he was sexually assaulted by a former MP in 2012.James Greenhalgh, who didn't know the MP, said he felt violated.He said when he tried to report the assault a couple of months later, he was told by the MP's party that he couldn't make a complaint anonymously so did not proceed.The party concerned said it took "any allegation of this nature extremely seriously".Mr Greenhalgh told the BBC he was approached outside one of the bars in the House of Commons by the man who put his arm around him and then went on to assault him."He literally put his arm around me, very close, stinking of alcohol I remember and pointing out different things on the canvas [painting]," he said."I was interested to hear what he had to say, but I was thinking, 'This is very, this is very touchy-feely here - what's he doing?'"And suddenly his arm slipped down towards my buttocks, and he had a good feel round there and went a bit further in between my legs."It wasn't very pleasant at all.I just didn't know what to do, I didn't know what to do at all."'Deeply concerned' The disclosure follows a range of recent allegations in Westminster, including claims of a lack of support for those making complaints.Earlier, at Prime Minister's Questions, Theresa May said any allegations about serious sexual abuse in Parliament should go to the police, as she promised a new "independent" process to handle complaints.The PM said she was "deeply concerned" by recent reports about alleged harassment and abuse at Westminster.Labour's Jeremy Corbyn said trade unions should be involved to support staff.Mr Corbyn said he was happy to meet the PM to discuss it, with a meeting scheduled for Monday evening.The PM said a "common, transparent independent grievance procedure" for all those who work in Parliament was needed and that it "cannot be right" for policies to vary between parties.A dedicated support team should be available to all staff, she said, and it should recommend all criminal allegations be reported to the police.
In defence of joke diplomacy - Boris Johnson:::::Video Boris Johnson has told MPs jokes can be a "very effective way of getting your diplomatic message across".He spoke about the role of humour in diplomacy during a meeting of the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee after its chair Tom Tugendhat referred to sales of prosecco - the subject of a Brexit-related joke by the foreign secretary earlier this year.
Arron Banks faces EU referendum finance investigation:::::Image copyright PA The Electoral Commission says it is investigating whether ex-UKIP donor Arron Banks broke donation rules during the EU referendum.The probe will look at whether the Leave.EU chairman broke the rules over donations or loans made to campaigners.It will also look at Better for the Country Ltd, a company of which Mr Banks is a registered director.Mr Banks said that a judge-led inquiry was needed "to clear this nonsense up once and for all".The commission said it launched investigations where there were "reasonable grounds" to believe offences had been committed.It is already carrying out separate probes into the spending returns submitted by the official Remain and Leave campaigns.Announcing the latest investigation, the commission said Better for the Country Ltd (BFTC) had made donations totalling 2.3m to campaigners in June 2016's referendum, while Mr Banks had given Leave.EU loans totalling 6m.The commission said its investigation would look at: Whether BFTC was the "true source of donations made to referendum campaigners in its name, or if it was acting as an agent".Whether recipients of the donations were given the required information about the donor What steps the recipients took to verify BFTC's "identity and permissibility" Whether or not Mr Banks was the "true source" of loans reported in his name Whether the recipients of the loans acted within the rules Whether any individual "facilitated a transaction with a non-qualifying person" Bob Posner of the Electoral Commission said: "Interest in the funding of the EU referendum campaigns remains widespread."Questions over the legitimacy of funding provided to campaigners at the referendum risks causing harm to voters' confidence."It is therefore in the public interest that the Electoral Commission seeks to ascertain whether or not impermissible donations were given to referendum campaigners and if any other related offences have taken place."In a statement issued by Leave.EU, Mr Banks said: "We believe that a judge-led inquiry reporting to Parliament that investigates the main campaign groups, Vote Leave, Britain Stronger In Europe and Leave.EU would be the best way to clear this nonsense up once and for all."He said it should also cover why the Electoral Commission allowed a leaflet to be sent by the government to each home in the UK just before the referendum spending cut-off date.Mr Banks added: "The 'Remain' Electoral Commission isn't up to the job and consists of political placemen from all main parties."This is the Remain establishment once again trying to discredit the result and it's all starting to get rather boring."
Profile: Who is Gavin Williamson, the new defence secretary?:::::Image copyright Getty Images He's the Tory enforcer who kept a tarantula on his desk and joked about using a "sharpened carrot" to get his way.Now Gavin Williamson has been propelled into his first cabinet role in the wake of Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon's sudden resignation.So what more do we know about a politician seen as rising star but whose rapid elevation has apparently upset some of his colleagues?Theresa May's chief whip, first elected to Parliament in 2010, wasn't among the bookmakers' favourites for the Ministry of Defence vacancy.The South Staffordshire MP has no military background and had little opportunity to build up a public profile because his role in the whips office meant he did not speak in Parliament.Raised near Scarborough by Labour-supporting parents, he ran a Staffordshire pottery firm, making and selling ceramic tableware, before becoming an MP.After entering Parliament, Mr Williamson was given a role in the Northern Ireland Office in 2011, and then became David Cameron's backbench aide.He was appointed a CBE in the ex-PM's controversial resignation honours list, telling the Stourbridge News he was "extremely honoured and humbled" at the award.And he didn't fall out of favour as Theresa May took over in July 2016 - "literally walking out with one prime minister and in with the next" in the words of friend and fellow Tory MP James Wharton.Factfile Date of birth: 25 June 1976 (aged 41) Job: MP for South Staffordshire, since 2010.Chief whip from June 2016, now defence secretary Education: Went to to Raincliffe Comprehensive School and Scarborough Sixth Form College; studied social sciences at the University of Bradford Family: Married with two children.His father worked at the local council, his mother at a job centre.Both were Labour voters Married with two children.His father worked at the local council, his mother at a job centre.Both were Labour voters Honours: Awarded a CBE in 2016 in David Cameron's resignation honours for political and public service After a disappointing general election for the Conservatives, he played a key role in brokering the 1bn deal with the DUP to prop up their minority government.But until now, that tarantula might have been the most commonly-cited fact about the 41-year-old - whose successor as chief whip tweeted a picture of his desk on taking over.He has described the creature, known as Cronus, as "a perfect example of an incredibly clean, ruthless killer" - who reportedly fell foul of the strict rules about animals on the Parliamentary estate.Kate Moody, who sold it to him at his local garden centre, told BBC Radio 4 the MP had thought it would be a "great addition" to his office.She recalls Mr Williamson joking that he was having a "mid-life" crisis when he bought the red-legged Mexican tarantula, saying "it was a sports car or a tarantula and the tarantula won".Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Gavin Williamson (right) shakes hands with the DUP's Jeffrey Donaldson And spiders aren't the only animals close to his heart - he's also a patron of the World Owl Trust and has built a house for hedgehogs in his garden.He might be kind to animals, but there was a hint of a less accommodating approach in his speech to the Conservative Party conference as he described his methods in the whips office."We take a carrot and stick approach," he told delegates."Personally I don't much like the stick, but it is amazing what can be achieved with a sharpened carrot."In his own words Image copyright AFP On being appointed as chief whip: "I was absolutely flabbergasted, but I accepted immediately."On his pet tarantula: "You have to look at all different ways to persuade people to vote with the government and it's great to have Cronus as part of the team" In the Commons: "It's very important to use our gardens which are a specific habitat for hedgehogs.Just recently in my own garden I built a hedgehog house.Sadly I have no residents in it but hopefully it will encourage them and the growth of hedgehogs in South Staffordshire."What others say
Balfour Declaration: The divisive legacy of 67 words:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The Balfour Declaration: 100 years of conflict The British peer Arthur Balfour barely makes an appearance in UK schoolbooks, but many Israeli and Palestinian students could tell you about him.His Balfour Declaration, made on 2 November 1917, is taught in their respective history classes and forms a key chapter in their two very different, national narratives.It can be seen as a starting point for the Arab-Israeli conflict.The declaration by the then foreign secretary was included in a letter to Lord Walter Rothschild, a leading proponent of Zionism, a movement advocating self-determination for the Jewish people in their historical homeland - from the Mediterranean to the eastern flank of the River Jordan, an area which came to be known as Palestine.It stated that the British government supported "the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people".Image caption The key 67 words of Balfour's letter At the same time, it said that nothing should "prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities".Palestinians see this as a great betrayal, particularly given a separate promise made to enlist the political and military support of the Arabs - then ruled by the Ottoman Turks - in World War One.This suggested Britain would back their struggle for independence in most of the lands of the Ottoman Empire, which consisted of much of the Middle East.The Arabs understood this to include Palestine, though it had not been specifically mentioned."Do you think Britain committed a crime against the Palestinian people?"asks a teacher during a lesson in a Palestinian school in the West Bank city of Ramallah.Image caption Palestinians regard the declaration as an historical injustice Everyone puts up a hand."Yes," a 15-year-old girl answers."This declaration was illegitimate because Palestine was still part of the Ottoman Empire and Britain did not control it.""Britain considered the Arabs as a minority while they formed over 90% of the population."'Huge hope' Israeli children, inevitably, tend to see British involvement more positively when they study the Balfour Declaration in a lesson towards the end of their high-school years.In Balfouria, a village in northern Israel, nine-year-old Noga Yehezekeli is already proudly able to recite a Hebrew version of the text off by heart."In the moment it was given, the declaration gave huge hope and a huge push for the Zionist movement," says her father, Neve."People saw that if the British government gave such a declaration there was a chance that one day the Jewish nation would be established, which really happened later in '48" - the year the State of Israel was formed.Image caption The declaration gave Zionists huge hope, says Neve Yehezekeli (right) Residents of Balfouria - including Neve's grandfather - were part of a growing Jewish community in Palestine when Lord Balfour visited in 1925.They gave him a hero's welcome.By that time, the area was under British administration.The Balfour Declaration had been formally enshrined in the British Mandate for Palestine, which had been endorsed by the League of Nations.During the first half of the Mandate period, Britain allowed waves of Jewish immigration.But amid an Arab backlash and rising violence, Israelis remember how it later blocked many fleeing persecution, particularly during the Holocaust.Hard to deliver At the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, inaugurated by Balfour, Professor Ruth Lapidoth has studied the 67-word document.An expert on international law, Prof Lapidoth argues it was a legally binding declaration, but says Britain found it hard to deliver on its pledge.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Lord Balfour was given a hero's welcome by the Jewish community in Jerusalem in 1925 "The political situation was very bad when the Nazis came to power and then England needed the help, the friendship of the Arab countries," she says."Then they had to limit the implementation of the declaration, which is a pity."Prof Lapidoth left Germany in 1938, a year before the start of World War Two, and so has a personal interest in the pronouncement."I'm still very grateful for it," she says."It was really the source of our right to come back to Palestine, including my own."'Long-due promise' Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, describes the Balfour Declaration as "a central milestone" in the process of establishing his country.The British government has invited him to London for events to mark the centenary on Thursday.That decision, at a time of dimming hopes for Israeli-Palestinian peace, has infuriated Palestinians, who plan a day of protests.Image copyright EPA Image caption Palestinians say Britain's declaration deprived them of a state They want Britain to apologise for the Balfour Declaration."As the time passes, I think British people are forgetting about the lessons of history," says Palestinian Education Minister Sabri Saidam.He points out that Palestinians still seek the creation of a state of their own - which alongside Israel would form the basis of the so-called two-state solution to the conflict, a formula supported by the international community."The time has come for Palestine to be independent and for that long-due promise to be fulfilled," he says.
The case for the voting age to be lowered to 16:::::At the moment, 1.5 million 16 and 17-year-olds are too young to vote.They pay taxes, but aren't old enough to elect the men and women who decide how to spend them.Yet after a General Election where younger people turned out in numbers not seen for decades, the question of whether it's undemocratic to continue to deny 16-year-olds the vote is being asked again.Leading the teenage charge this time around is Jim McMahon, Labour MP for Oldham West and Royton.His proposal not only calls for the voting age to be lowered, but for political education to be taught in schools."The young people that I come in to contact with understand issues and they get behind campaigns," he told Newsbeat.Seventeen-year-olds Nathan Randles, Samah Khalil and Jess Consterdine, from Oldham's youth council, are a case in point."I pay tax as an apprentice and I have no say on where it goes," says Nathan."I want a say in how much my education costs," Jess chimes in."There's no test you take at 18 which means you are informed," argues Samah.And their case is backed by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn.The Scottish National Party, the Lib Dems and Green Party are all on board too - but crucially the Conservatives aren't.Speaking just before this year's General Election, Prime Minister Theresa May said: "You have to pick a point at which you think it is right for the voting age to be."I continue to think it is right for it to be 18."Some claim that position is based on a fear that not enough younger voters would vote for the Conservatives.But the PM is not alone in her thinking.Austria is the only country in the EU where 16-year-olds can vote in general elections.And although supporters for lowering the electoral age say you can get married, join the Army and work full-time at 16 - that's not entirely true.You can now vote in the Scottish parliamentary and local elections at 16.The Welsh Assembly is looking at doing the same for local elections there.Labour MP Jim McMahon believes the momentum is with his campaign to push forward a bill proposing votes at 16."If you are giving 16-year-olds the right to vote in Scotland and Wales, you ought to be doing the same for 16-year-olds in England too," he says.Find us on Instagram at BBCNewsbeat and follow us on Snapchat, search for bbc_newsbeat
Profile: Sir Michael Fallon:::::Image copyright PA Image caption Sir Michael, with a reputation for being unflappable, earned the title of Minister for the Today programme.He was considered Mr Reliable, surviving three decades on the political frontline and serving under four Conservative prime ministers.But it was a hand on the knee 15 years ago that proved to be the beginning of the end for Sir Michael Fallon.Amid a flurry of revelations of sexual harassment and inappropriate behaviour in the political world - themselves prompted by the Harvey Weinstein allegations - he confirmed he was rebuked by journalist Julia Hartley-Brewer for touching her knee during a dinner in 2002.A day later he became the first politician to resign in a scandal that looks set to dog Westminster, acknowledging "what might have been acceptable 15, 10 years ago is clearly not acceptable now".The Conservative MP entered office when Margaret Thatcher was prime minister in 1983, and for more than 30 years he worked his way up the ranks of the party.His time as defence secretary was characterised by his role overseeing UK military efforts against the so-called Islamic State in the Middle East.With a reputation for being unflappable, he earned the title of Minister of the Today programme.Who is Michael Fallon?Image copyright PA Image caption Michael Fallon campaigning during the 1983 Darlington by-election Date of birth: 14 May 1952 (aged 65) Job: MP for Sevenoaks, Kent, since 1997.Defence secretary from July 2014 to 1 November 2017 Education: Privately educated at Epsom College, in Surrey; Studied classics and ancient history at the University of St Andrews Family: Married to Wendy Payne.The couple have two sons Honours: Knighted in 2016 in David Cameron's resignation honours Like many of his peers, he came to Parliament first as a researcher in the late 1970s.In 1983 he unsuccessfully fought a by-election in Darlington, only to win it 77 days later after Mrs Thatcher called a general election.Four years later, he was serving as private parliament secretary to Energy Secretary Cecil Parkinson, before becoming a minister in the education department in July 1990.That autumn, when pressure was mounting on Mrs Thatcher to resign, Sir Michael was among a group of supporters, alongside Michael Portillo, who tried to persuade the long-serving prime minister to stay on.John Major took over as prime minister and kept Sir Michael in his government.Sir Michael in his own words Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Sir Michael Fallon: "Not right for me to go on as defence secretary"."I accept that in the past I have fallen below the high standards that we require of the Armed Forces that I have the honour to represent," written in his resignation letter."This election shows that Labour is now a serious risk to our national security, to our economic security and to the security of your family," speaking in September 2015."It is through the EU that you exchange criminal records and passenger records and work together on counter-terrorism... We need the collective weight of the EU when you are dealing with Russian aggression or terrorism.You need to be part of these big partnerships," making his case in February 2016 to remain in the European Union."We must always be ready to answer the call from further away, from fragile democracies, from the very poorest, from the hardest hit.That means deploying our ships, our planes, and yes, our troops on the ground where we and our allies are asked to help."In his 2017 Conservative Party conference speech.But his political career stalled when he lost his Darlington seat to Labour's Alan Milburn in the 1992 General Election.After leaving the House of Commons, he founded a group of children's nurseries called Just Learning.But he bounced back in 1997 as MP for Sevenoaks, although his party were now out of power with Tony Blair's Labour Party running the country.It was another 13 years before the Conservatives returned to power - Sir Michael was one of a limited number of ministers from the Major years to return to the front benches.He was made deputy chairman and given a number of ministerial posts before being handed the defence brief in 2014.Sir Michael was seen by his party as a good media performer, and was often the person trusted to appear on TV and radio at difficult times.Amid the turmoil of two difficult general elections and the EU referendum - and the changes of prime minister that followed - he remained as defence secretary.That was, until he decided to resign on Wednesday evening.What others say Image copyright Alamy/Getty Image caption Julia Hartley-Brewer says she has a good, friendly, bantery relationship with Sir Michael "I like Sir Michael Fallon, I have always got on very well with him and I have always had a good, friendly, bantery relationship [with him], which is why I didn't take the issue seriously at the time and haven't since."Julia Hartley-Brewer "You have championed our brave armed forces.You should take particular pride in the way the United Kingdom has risen to the challenge of tackling the barbaric threat of Daesh."Theresa May, in a written reply to his resignation letter "Michael Fallon is a decent man.But today I think he has demeaned himself and he has demeaned his office."Former Labour leader Ed Miliband, who Sir Michael accused of stabbing his brother in the back and suggested he was also willing to stab the UK in the back."Michael Fallon stood up and promised he would not cut our Army below 82,000.Now he's been left red-faced as that promise lies in tatters."Lib Dem peer Lord Paddy Ashdown, a former Royal Marine, in June 2017."Defence is a complicated portfolio to master and spending a bit of time in that appointment is really, really important to be able to understand the detail, the personality and the needs of the Army, Navy and the Air Force, and he'd got that."Lord Dannatt, chief of the general staff - the head of the Army - from 2006 to 2009.
Tackling the 'boys' club' of political cartoons:::::Image copyright Ella Bucknall / WHIP Why do the UK's national newspapers' full-time cartoonists never seem to be women?Out of nearly 180 cartoons featured in last year's edition of Britain's Best Political Cartoons not one was drawn by a woman.It was flicking through a copy of the book that first highlighted the gender imbalance in the industry for Ella Bucknall, an illustrator currently studying at Camberwell College of Arts in London.This realisation prompted her to start Whip, a magazine of political cartoons by women, to give them a platform that didn't exist elsewhere."Particularly at the moment when there are so many aspects of politics affecting women's lives, from Trump to the DUP, we need to be able to have our own voice.We need to be able to argue back," she said.Image copyright Rosie O'Driscoll / WHIP The "boys' club" is a common complaint of women working as cartoonists.Nicola Jennings, whose work has been published in the Guardian, said: "Political cartoons are a sort of running joke between the boys.I wonder whether men find it too difficult to be lampooned by a woman?"Men lampooning each other is like an in-joke and they're just slapping each other on the back, whereas if it's a woman it's seen as much stronger criticism."The editorial cartoons of the national newspapers remain a distinctly male affair.Tim Benson, editor of Britain's Best Political Cartoons, defended his selection as simply a reflection of the state of the industry."My criteria is that the cartoon has to be published in a national newspaper.There are lots of female cartoonists who publish their work online or draw for the Morning Star but they are unpaid," he said, "If you want to be able to call yourself a political cartoonist you have to be able to earn your living as one.I can only pick cartoons from what is available."My view is that anyone with the perseverance and the skills will rise to the top, whatever their gender is.Personally I don't think there's a woman out there at the moment who can compete with the very best."I've got Nicola Jennings in this year's book but only because she's been published in national newspapers.I would love to have more work by female cartoonists but I'm not going to include them in my book if I don't think they're good enough.I never decide on gender lines.As far as my book is concerned there is absolutely no gender bias at all."Image copyright Ella Bucknall / WHIP To find female political cartoonists at the moment, it is necessary to look beyond the national newspapers.Nicola Streeten, an illustrator and comics scholar, has researched the history of British feminist cartoons and comics from the 1970s.What she found was that outside the national media there were a host of women drawing political cartoons, from the Suffragettes to 1960s feminist magazine Spare Rib.She is currently co-editing a collection of 250 years of female cartoonists in Britain, The Inking Woman, following an exhibition of the same name at the Cartoon Museum."The more we looked the more women we found.You just have to take the trouble to look.Some people are against having a women's-only publication or exhibition but at the moment there just aren't the platforms for women," she said.There are only six full-time political cartoonists working for national newspapers.As far as we can tell there has never been a woman among them and most of the men have held their positions for years."There was a tradition of editorial cartoonists having a job for life.Those jobs were already taken by men 50 years ago so there haven't been any open doors for women," explained Martha Richler, otherwise known as Marf, one of the few women to have worked as a political cartoonist on Fleet Street, for London's Evening Standard.Image copyright Martha Richler Ms Richler, who was made redundant from the Standard in 2008 after the recession hit, said: "As budgets were cut, cartoonists were considered a luxury.But the story's not over if you look online."She admits she misses her salary but prefers the freedom of working online."There were times at the Standard when I wasn't allowed to do a darker cartoon.Online I have total freedom and there are no prejudices about what women can draw.We can self-publish.There are amazing opportunities if only we can crack the problem of monetising it."Ms Richler also said she faced sexism in Fleet Street.In 2004 the Daily Telegraph claimed her jokes were "regularly rewritten by backbench executives".The paper later published an apology.Ms Richler said the attack suggested there was an assumption women simply couldn't be good political cartoonists.Image copyright Alice Skinner / WHIP So how do things look now?Emma Allen was recently appointed as the New Yorker's cartoon editor.The work of Ms Jennings and Kate Evans has been featured in the Guardian.Political blog The Canary has recently launched an

Countdown to Brexit: How to divide food sold to the EU:::::Image copyright Getty Images Here's a Brexit recipe: lamb with grapes and lemon.I haven't tried it, but the recipe does exist and it looks delicious in the pictures I've seen.It also gives us the ingredients for looking at one of the food issues that comes up as the UK prepares to leave the European Union.All of them are covered by a trade arrangement that most people have spent their lives blissfully unaware of.It goes by the name of "tariff rate quotas".Now what on Earth does that mean?When countries import goods, including foods, they often impose a tariff, a tax that is applied only to traded goods.The UK does not currently have its own national tariffs.They are set by the EU for all member nations.Countries and blocs of countries such as the EU, that are members of the World Trade Organization, have made commitments to the others that the tariffs will not exceed certain levels.Many countries have agreed to import a certain quantity of some goods at a lower or even zero tariff, as a negotiated compromise between the interests of: overseas exporters domestic producers concerned about exposure to foreign competition consumers That quantity of goods that gets in on the lower tax rate is called a tariff rate quota.It is a bread and butter dish on the trade negotiating menu, routine enough to have its own acronym, which is TRQ.TRQs are often used for farm products.The EU has about 100, negotiated at the WTO on behalf of all member states, which currently have an impact on the UK.All three of our ingredients have a TRQ for imports into the EU.Image copyright Getty Images In the case of lamb, 280,340 tonnes a year can be imported at a reduced tariff.There's a quota for table grapes of 1,500 tonnes, and for lemons it's 10,000 tonnes.So how does Brexit come into this picture?The UK and the remainder of the EU have to work out how to divide the existing TRQs.The EU doesn't want to take the existing TRQs for the 28 states and use them for the remaining 27, because each EU country may end up importing more food on the low tariffs, therefore creating tougher competition for EU farmers.Image copyright Getty Images Unlike on many other Brexit issues the UK and the EU actually agreed, and told the other WTO members, in a letter, that they wanted to divide the TRQs in line with recent trade flows.That would mean, for example, the UK taking a large share of the quota for lamb because comparatively the UK has been importing more lamb than the other EU countries.But the proposal was met with a raspberry by several countries, including the United States, Canada and New Zealand.Although the UK-EU proposal would give the same total TRQs as today, they would lose flexibility.As things stand, if the price of lamb fell in the UK, they could divert some or all of it to other parts of the EU.After Brexit, that would not be possible.Image copyright Getty Images The other WTO countries feel they should be compensated with a higher combined TRQ in order to maintain the same commercial benefit they currently enjoy.In other words, they see Brexit as an opportunity to negotiate better access for their goods to Europe.There is another option.In some cases, the UK could decide to remove the tariffs altogether.Now, some economists think we should do that anyway with all tariffs, that Brexit is a glorious opportunity for unilateral free trade.This seems politically unlikely for products where there are UK producers.In our recipe, lamb is a case in point.Unrestricted tariff free access for lamb from anywhere in the world would be a problem for many British lamb producers.With lemons, that is not an issue.We are not citrus producers.There are British table grapes.It's not a big industry, but it is a new one so that might need some consultation with producer and consumer groups too.There's another complication: cross-Channel trade.British farmers can now automatically sell, for example, their lamb to France tariff free.The same applies to French cheese sold in the UK.Depending on what sort of deal there is, that might not be true after Brexit.So will the UK and the EU get some share of each other's TRQs?That's another thing to be negotiated.Read more from Reality Check Follow us on Twitter
A pint of view: What do farmers think about Brexit?:::::What do the farmers out in the field, in the dairy and in the milking parlour think about Brexit?No-one knows what's around the corner for the dairy industry.Specific negotiations over a future trade deal haven't even started.Some experts predict oblivion; others see opportunity.So let's start with what we do know: the state of the industry 20 years ago, and what it's like today.Image caption Currently the EU is UK dairy's biggest trading partner, with 80 per cent of exports going there.The number of dairy farmers has shrunk dramatically: In 1996 there were around 35,000.Now there are around 13,000 - a drop of almost two-thirds.Farms are getting bigger: The average herd size was 75 cows and now it's 140.And as for the cost of a pint: back in 1996 it was 36 pence, now it's 43 pence - and many farmers say it's too low.So how do those working in the industry feel about what the next 20 years may hold?Image caption James and Rhiannan feel that Brexit has given them - and their son Ethan - the chance of a more secure future.James and Rhiannan Lomas have a dairy farm of around 200 cows in Cheshire.They almost went out of business two years ago because of the collapse in the milk price.But now they are part of a small number of farms starting to export liquid milk (as opposed to powdered or products such as cheese) to Qatar.The Middle East nation was left without milk almost overnight after a blockade imposed by Saudi Arabia and its allies.Mr Lomas says: "It's amazing.Every day we thought of giving it all up.But hopefully now Brexit will improve our outlook and open up a lot of markets - if the politicians get it right."He adds that there have definitely been some dark times."Hopefully it will give us a chance to make us a more of a secure and better future.Certainly the fluctuation of the dairy business will always be there, but the ability to change markets might give us the chance to go elsewhere."Ms Lomas explains: "It makes you feel a lot more positive for us."Looking down at her son Ethan, she adds: "And for him."China exports Andrew Henderson is the man who secured the deal with a hypermarket chain in Qatar.He runs a dairy called Nemi, also based in Cheshire.It bottles milk from farmers in the surrounding counties and could soon be the first in the UK to export fresh milk to China.These cows are given an enriched feed so they produce milk high in selenium, which can be in short supply in the Chinese diet.A supermarket there has just placed an order.Image caption Brand GB: A prototype of the bottle that could carry the first British fresh milk to China.Note the gold Houses of Parliament and British flag."Brexit is having a very positive effect - we have farmers who are getting a much better milk price and we also have more interest from countries inside Europe and outside Europe for fresh British milk.We are trying to supply that need."He says the Chinese are interested in British milk because they see it as "pure".They also want to know exactly which farm the product is coming from."We were in China in June and we were sitting with some highly decorated officials from the Chinese government and they made a point of saying it's very easy to do a deal with one country - but very difficult to do a deal with 27."Would this be happening without the Brexit vote?"I believe not.There was no will from the major European cooperatives and organisations to deliver our fresh milk to China as they are already within those markets with dried milk and other products from Europe," says Mr Henderson.His business partner is Mark Langslow, from County Milk Products."Regarding Brexit, I think we've made the right decision.I think it makes us want to stand on our own two feet, and forces us to stand on our own two feet."Image caption Dairy farms are closing because they can't find able staff to take on the roles available.However not too far away, near Uttoxeter in Staffordshire, David Brookes has a dairy herd of 180 cows.He's a member of the West Midlands Dairy Board.He relies on his daughter to help with the business and talks of what experts have referred to as the "shocking crisis" in the dairy labour industry."There's only around 1% on jobseekers allowance in Staffordshire.Whether it's the butchery side of things and processing meat or whether it's processing dairy products we have become reliant on a migrant labour force, mainly from Eastern Europe," he says."We need the skilled labour.And at the moment they are not coming over."He says that the devaluation of the pound is largely to blame, but also the uncertainty surrounding Brexit."One of the problems is the classification of 'labour'.Because the government is very keen to get a lot of skilled labour.A lot of our processing workers (such as those that operate milking equipment) are skilled, but their skills are not clearly defined as skilled under government guidelines," Mr Brookes explains.He believes that if restrictions are imposed "it could be very difficult".Further south, in Wiltshire, Jenny Quick helps to run a small family dairy herd."People may tell you their view," she says, "But no one knows.We just have no idea yet."Follow Claire on Twitter.
Westminster sexual harassment: MPs outline claims:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Chi Onwurah: Male and female researchers left 'uncomfortable' in Westminster bar MPs have been speaking out about sexual harassment in the corridors of Westminster - including one claim that bad behaviour at a parliamentary bar was dismissed as typical "pub" talk.Commons leader Andrea Leadsom vowed to stamp out "sleazy, sexist or homophobic banter", as she faced MPs in light of allegations of sexual harassment in Parliament.One of those to speak out, Labour's Chi Onwurah, said some male and female researchers had been made to feel "deeply uncomfortable" by MPs while at a parliamentary bar, the Sports and Social club - but her complaint was ignored.The Labour MP said: "When I complained recently to an officer of Parliament who had some responsibility in this area...I was told that happens in pubs all over the country."Ms Leadsom gave her "absolute assurance" that people going to restaurants and bars in Westminster should feel safe."There should be no place here on the estate or in our constituency offices where people can be abused or allegations not taken seriously," she said.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Liz Saville Roberts says she was told "distrust is endemic" among staff of MPs Liz Saville Roberts, of Plaid Cymru, said she had been told by one employee of an MP that authorities failed to act when she reported an assault claim - leaving the woman "deeply disappointed and distrustful"."She reported being sexually assaulted to the proper authorities earlier this year, who did nothing," she said, adding: "She tells me that distrust is endemic."Ms Saville Roberts asked: "How can I assure her that her complaint will now be treated differently?"For her part, Ms Leadsom said she would be willing to take the complaint up herself.One MP already being investigated for inappropriate behaviour is international trade minister, Mark Garnier, who reportedly asked his secretary to buy sex toys and called her "sugar tits".Secret text Conservative MP Matthew Offord said he was recently sent a text message that accused a current MP of being "utterly foul" towards a woman - but he did not reveal the name of the sender or the politician.Mr Offord said the sender had described the incident as a "problem he saw in this place".He quoted the text as saying the MP was "utterly foul and I'm sure it's a pattern of behaviour on his part - but in this instance I don't think it'd be fair on the woman in question to name him."He added that the sender asked him to "do the best you can" to widen the investigation from sexual harassment claims to also address complaints about bullying and treating staff like "dirt".Monday's question-and-answer Commons session took place in response to an urgent question on plans to tackle sexual harassment in Parliament, brought by Labour MP Harriet Harman.Ms Leadsom's statement prompted "wittering about a witch hunt", according to Labour's Jess Phillips.She told the chamber: "As I walked in here, as I rushed in here today to come to this statement, I overheard two male colleagues walking through the halls wittering about a witch hunt that was going on in Parliament."Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The PM is "too weak" to tackle abuse allegations amongst her own ministers, says Labour's Lucy Powell Conservative Graham Brady, chairman of the backbench 1922 committee, confirmed that some people had expressed "anguish" that the allegations could "unfairly tarnish" innocent MPs.He insisted that Parliament was not a "den of inequity".Earlier, Labour MP Lucy Powell told the BBC that there was an "imbalance of power" in Westminster that left employees open to being abused."When you have that mix of lots of desperate people in that environment [you get] this sort of power abuse - because that's what it is," she said.
Cyber-crime: Security Minister Ben Wallace's claim about arrests unpicked:::::The Claim: Security Minister Ben Wallace told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "There is some good news which never gets reported - nine out of 10 of the latest, most serious cyber-crime attacks have resulted in arrest or charges."Reality Check verdict: The relevant figure is slightly less positive to the one Mr Wallace cited on air.Between October 2016 and May 2017, the National Crime Agency (NCA) and regional organised crime units identified suspects in nine, and made arrests in seven, of the 10 most serious cyber-incidents under investigation.No-one was charged during the relevant period.We all know a burglary when we see one.Smashed window.TV gone.But large numbers of people - and entire organisations - don't necessarily realise when they've been a target or victim of a digital smash-and-grab.That's the public awareness challenge that makes combating the growth of this 21st Century crime so difficult.Put simplest, cyber-crimes and attacks fall into three broad categories: Personal crimes - such as a fraud committed through a bogus online shop or auction - but also bank card cloning and other identity-related scams in which your personal details are taken, sold in online market places and used, ultimately, to steal money.Attacks against organisations - such as this year's huge Wannacry attack which caused major disruption within the NHS.The criminals demanded payment in an untraceable online currency before they would hand back control of computers.Attacks possibly organised by a state against another state's institutions or infrastructure.The alleged involvement of Russian agents in the US president election would be an example of this kind of cyber-attack, if proven to be true.Starting at the bottom and working up, a few years ago the Metropolitan Police estimated that the annual number of online fraud offences nationwide would overtake all types of burglary by, at the latest, autumn 2017.That already looks spot on.In the year to June 2017, the police recorded just over 423,000 burglaries across England and Wales.The Office for National Statistics says there were 653,000 frauds - and all experts in this field think there are many more unreported incidents.Separate experimental data from the Crime Survey for England and Wales, a rolling survey of our experiences, estimates there were 3.3 million frauds in the year to June - and more than half of those were "cyber-related".On top of all that, there were an additional 1.6 million incidents of "computer misuse", generally meaning hacking or virus attacks.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption GCHQ is one of the government agencies tasked with tackling cyber-crime If a hacker steals your personal data, that can be used by organised crime gangs to create fake bank cards in your name.Viruses can be used to hold machines to ransom or, without your even knowing about it, turn your PC into a "zombie" that becomes part of a global attack on a major institution.And that's where many of these individual crimes fit into a bigger picture.Since it was set up in October 2016, the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) dealt with 590 "significant" incidents.The most well-known of these was the Wannacry attack, which prompted the Home Secretary to hold the first ever Cobra meeting (a government emergency response committee) dedicated to a cyber-attack.National priority So what about the response?The Home Office says cyber-crime is a national priority and the NCA plays the lead role in pursuing suspects and building the intelligence picture.It runs some investigations itself and assists others being led by detectives inside the country's regional organised crime units.But individual police forces are also under sustained pressure to up their game.While some have well-developed units, such as the Metropolitan Police's "Operation Falcon", others are struggling to recruit because they need detectives with highly specialist skills.One of the major problems is working out who is supposed to be investigating a particular incident because the crime gang behind an attack could be anywhere in the world.It's very difficult to count how many cyber-related criminals have been successfully prosecuted.Many suspects will be charged with fraud or theft offences but there's no breakdown on how many of those were related to online swindles.Only 55 people were convicted of computer misuse offences relating to hacking last year.During his interview Mr Wallace was referring to the NCA's list of the most serious cyber-incidents between October 2016 and May 2017.These are categorised by assessing the following factors: Threat and risk Public impact Financial harm Nature of the incident Victims Mr Wallace claimed: "We are getting there."Are we?The government believes it is, arguing that the NCSC is a world-beating body, backed up by expert investigators in the National Crime Agency, MI5 and GCHQ.But Parliament's Public Accounts Committee said in February that a skills shortage and "chaotic" handling of personal data breaches were undermining confidence in the government's ability to protect the UK from cyber-attacks.The MPs said ministers had taken too long to consolidate an "alphabet soup" of agencies - although some experts said the report was unfair and failed to take into account the resources now being thrown at this very modern threat.Read more from Reality Check Follow us on Twitter

Brexit: Is a last-minute deal possible?:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption David Davis tells MPs Parliament's vote on a Brexit deal may come after March 2019.The Brexit Secretary, David Davis, has suggested that Parliament might not get a vote on a Brexit deal until after March 2019.It's prompted criticism from some MPs, who are worried their votes will be meaningless because by that point, the UK will have already left the EU.Also significant is Mr Davis' claim that the European Parliament might have to wait to have its say too.According to Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, which the UK triggered seven months ago, the withdrawal agreement must be passed by a majority of members of the European Parliament.Even if a deal was done at "the 11th hour" as Mr Davis suggested when giving evidence to the Commons Brexit committee, it would be too late for MEPs to debate it and vote it through.So the upshot of a last-minute deal could be no deal at all.The Brexit department later clarified that Mr Davis was talking about "hypothetical scenarios" and ministers are working to reach an agreement in "good time" before March 2019.It's not entirely clear what "deal" Mr Davis was referring to.The European Union has broken down the negotiations into two parts.The first focuses on the issues associated with withdrawal, such as the rights of EU citizens, the Northern Irish border and the UK's financial obligations.The second covers what our future relationship might look like, including areas such as trade, scientific research and consumer rights.The British government says it's not possible to separate the two parts, because in many respects, they're intrinsically linked.If the "deal" that Mr Davis was talking about this morning encompasses both, it must be ratified on or before 29 March 2019, which means an agreement would need to be reached in time for that.The future relationship part could be ratified after the deadline, but only if part one is rubber-stamped before the deadline.The EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, is hopeful of reaching a withdrawal agreement by autumn 2018 and the Brexit department said that was their aim as well.Technically it is possible to extend the Article 50 period, currently fixed at two years, if there's unanimous agreement from the 27 remaining member states.But that option would be a hard sell.Read more from Reality Check Follow us on Twitter
The Houses of Parliament - a building catastrophe?:::::Image copyright Getty Images This autumn, MPs are due to debate whether they will have to leave the Houses of Parliament while it undergoes essential repairs.But could they be forced out of their iconic building by a potentially messy blockage?Turn on a gas alarm as a precaution, open a substantial iron gate and head down into a basement.The hum of machinery grows louder - and the smell grows stronger.Impressive but distinctly old-fashioned cylinders and pumps appear.An engineer accompanying me explains that these are "sewage ejectors", dating from 1888.An enterprising Victorian technology museum, you might be assuming, with working exhibits?But this is in fact the basement of the Palace of Westminster.And these Victorian antiques are all that stand between Parliament and an almighty stink.The engineer is Andrew Piper, design director for Parliament's Restoration and Renewal programme, which is planning a project lasting several years and will cost billions of pounds.Image copyright CIBSE Heritage Group Collection Image caption The original steam engine, once used to power the sewage ejectors, is still in working order He explains that "everything from the toilets, the rainwater outlets - it all comes down to this point" - before being ejected out to the main London drain.The ejectors were installed to stop London's sewage invading the buildings after heavy rainfall.And there they still are, working away, almost 130 years later.But, adds Mr Piper "we can't rely on these sorts of systems for much longer".So what happens if they suddenly fail?"If you can't use the toilets any more a building quickly becomes unusable.The end result would be potentially shutting the building down."The sewage system is just one of several growing hazards.Mr Piper and his basement maintenance team struggle with constant fire dangers.There are modern electrical cables crammed next to older asbestos-covered steam pipes.And a system of vents that could carry smoke or flames swiftly through the building.Image copyright UK Parliament Image caption Flooding in the basement of the Palace of Westminster in June 2017 The building that's meant to represent the British constitution is a kind of national monument to make do and mend, with lots of bits from different eras bolted on to each other and much left unwritten - like where all these cables and vents end up, and what they actually do.The Palace of Westminster, one of the best known buildings in the world, is in a truly terrible state.Some have known this for years.A joint committee, including MPs and peers, published a report last year which warned that the palace "faces an impending crisis which we cannot responsibly ignore"."There is a substantial and growing risk of either a single, catastrophic event, such as a major fire, or a succession of incremental failures in essential systems."Home from home So how has this happened?And what does the state of Parliament say about the state of our politics?Firstly, there's the belief that the building represents political stability.Maintenance has long been limited by MPs' insistence that nothing must stop them from sitting there.So any repairs have been crammed into recess times.And there's another layer to this psychological attachment, says Dr Caroline Shenton, historian and former parliamentary archivist.The palace, with its bars and restaurants, gym and post offices, becomes a kind of home from home for MPs and peers, giving a "daily sense of continuity and security".Add to that anxiety - in this increasingly angry, anti-politics era - about what public opinion and headline writers will say as the multi-billion cost of renewal emerges.Sheffield University's Prof Matthew Flinders, chair of the Political Studies Association of the United Kingdom, who has closely followed the Restoration and Renewal programme, says this failure to take a decision is a classic example of what political scientists call "elite blockage".The palace, he says, "casts a spell" on many who use it.It represents a kind of politics with "low expectations of public engagement" which "locks in by its design not only a two-party system but also a very masculine, adversarial kind of politics".Those who benefit leave it to others to take tough unpopular decisions in the future.Meanwhile "the building can't take it any more - we've reached a crunch point."Image copyright uk parliament Image caption The Palace of Westminster's cast iron roofs are 160 years old He would like the current problems to be seen as an opportunity - to open up the building and change the way we do politics.Public access could be greatly improved, especially for disabled people who currently struggle to enter.Others say a renovated palace would prove a huge asset as Brexit Britain tries to reinforce its international reputation.MPs are due to debate the latest restoration and renewal plan at some point this autumn.But those who have watched years of delay and disagreement don't expect swift action.So will it take a catastrophe - like the 1834 fire which destroyed the palace's predecessor - to force a change?"It's starting to look like that," says Dr Shenton.It might be that "the whole place just grinds to a halt"."In terms of British pride," warns Prof Flinders, "if we wait for a catastrophe to close down Parliament, it's going to be an absolute disaster."And as for the failure of those sewage ejectors - that would create an "elite blockage" like no other.Chris Bowlby presents Parliament - A Building Catastrophe?on BBC Radio 4 on Monday 23 October 2017 at 20:30 BST.You will be able to listen via the Radio 4 programme website or download the programme podcast.
Brexit: Why a transition period may not buy more time for talks:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption David Davis updates Parliament on Brexit talks So the focus of the Brexit talks has shifted slightly as a result of the EU leaders' summit in Brussels.There is still plenty of tough bargaining ahead in the next few weeks, especially on the question of money.But there is also going to be more and more talk about preparing for a transition period - for what happens immediately after the UK leaves the EU in March 2019.Plenty of people see transition as a way to buy a little more time to sort things out - to finalise negotiations on a future trade deal.But the UK government prefers to calls the transition phase a "period of implementation".It is not entirely clear what would be implemented.But the Brexit Secretary David Davis warned this week that without a final deal on a future partnership with the EU - at least in principle - the government would not want to trigger any kind of transition at all.Does it mean the two sides view the prospects for transition very differently?The EU27 - the other member states without the UK - have now agreed to start working on new guidelines for their negotiators.And both the EU and Theresa May (in her Florence speech) have said that any transition/implementation period would take place under "the existing structure of EU rules and regulations".There will be plenty of technical challenges: what happens, for example, to the UK's role in EU trade agreements with third countries?Those third countries might have their own opinions about that.But there is also the question of what happens during a transition period itself?It could mean roughly two more years to continue negotiations on the details of a future partnership with the EU on trade, security and a host of other issues.The Confederation of British Industry, for example, argues that in order to avoid a "cliff-edge" Brexit, negotiations on a trading agreement should continue during a transition.But UK government policy is rather different.It still argues that a deal on our "final relationship" with the rest of the EU can be completed before the UK leaves the EU at the end of March 2019.Most observers are convinced that, for practical reasons, that will not be possible - there is simply too much to do.Upping the ante But Mr Davis insisted in the House of Commons this week that if the broad outlines of a permanent deal are not in place when the UK leaves, a transition period will not be triggered.Asked by Conservative MP Rishi Sunak for reassurance that "what is meant to be a transitory state of affairs does not become a permanent bridge to nowhere", Mr Davis said: "We will try to get the nature of the implementation phase agreed as soon as possible, so that businesses can take that into account."He added: "But he's right that such a transition phase would only be triggered once we've completed the deal itself, we cannot carry on negotiating through that - our negotiating position during the transition phase would not be very strong."In other words, Mr Davis is saying - in stronger language than the government appears to have used before - that if there is no final deal by March 2019, at least in principle, then the UK would not want to trigger a transition period.The words "at least in principle" contain a fair amount of wiggle room.And the EU itself would be delighted if the outlines of a future agreement could be agreed so quickly.It says only that a withdrawal agreement (as opposed to a future trade agreement) has to be finalised in order for there to be a transition.And Article 50 simply says the withdrawal agreement must "take account of the framework for a future relationship".But Mr Davis appears to be upping the ante."No final deal" equals "no transition" equals "hard Brexit".As a negotiating tactic, it may be designed to keep the pressure on.But it may not be what many business leaders want to hear.Read more from Reality Check Follow us on Twitter
Brexit: All you need to know about the UK leaving the EU:::::Here is an easy-to-understand guide to Brexit - beginning with the basics, then a look at the negotiations, followed by a selection of answers to questions we've been sent.What's happening now?The UK has voted to leave the European Union.It is scheduled to depart on 29 March, 2019.Talks are currently taking place on three aspects of how Brexit will work - focusing on how much the UK owes the EU, what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK.The UK wants to talk about future trade relations - and a plan for a two year "transition" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations.But the EU says they will not talk about the future until enough progress has been made on the other issues.What does Brexit mean?It is a word that has become used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in a same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past.Why is Britain leaving the European Union?A referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union.Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%.The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Find the result in your area What was the breakdown across the UK?England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%.Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%.Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU.Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave.See the results in more detail.What changed in government after the referendum?Image copyright PA Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May.The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum.Like Mr Cameron, Mrs May was against Britain leaving the EU but she played only a very low-key role in the campaign and was never seen as much of an enthusiast for the EU.She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out.Where does Theresa May stand on Brexit?Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want.Her key message has been that "Brexit means Brexit" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March.She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk.She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy.How did the snap election change things?Image copyright Getty Images Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had been due in 2020).She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders.She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy.However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.What has happened to the UK economy since the Brexit vote?David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum - and remains around 10% lower against the dollar and 15% down against the euro.But predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations.The UK economy has continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017.Inflation has risen since June 2016 to stand at 3%, but unemployment has continued to fall, to stand at a 42 year low of 4.3%.Annual house price increases have fallen from 9.4% in June 2016 but were still at an inflation-beating 5% in the year to August 2017, according to official ONS figures.Brexit talks are under way They finally, officially, started on 19 June, 2017.Here's a picture from that first session: Image copyright Reuters The UK and EU negotiating teams meet face-to-face for one week each month.Their first tasks are trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called "divorce bill", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border.You can find out more about the talks here.What is the European Union?The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list).It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other.It has since grown to become a "single market" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country.It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide

Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009.Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure.What date will the UK will leave the EU?For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split.Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave on Friday, 29 March 2019.It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one.What's going to happen to all the EU laws in force in the UK?The Conservative government has introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament.If passed, it will end the primacy of EU law in the UK.This "Great Repeal Bill" as it has been called, is supposed to incorporate all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove.The government is facing claims from Remain supporting MPs that it is giving itself sweeping powers to change legislation without proper Parliamentary scrutiny.Read a full guide to the bill.What is the Labour Party's position on Brexit?Labour's position on Brexit was tweaked in mid-August, when the shadow Brexit secretary, Sir Keir Starmer, announced that the party now wanted to keep the UK in the single market and a customs union during a transition that could last for up to four years.Labour would also accept free movement of people, payments into the EU budget and the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice during the transition.This is a considerably "softer" version of Brexit than the one advocated by the government, but there are still divisions within the party about whether the UK should try to stay in the single market in the longer term.What do 'soft' and 'hard' Brexit mean?These terms have increasingly been used as debate focused on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU.There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, "hard" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if meant leaving the single market.At the other end of the scale, a "soft" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.What is the single market?The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place.Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market.In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country.It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it.The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices.But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a "level playing field".Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs.Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule.Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has said continued membership of the single has to be an option in negotiations with Brussels.Read more: A free trade area v EU single market What's the difference between the single market and the customs union?The customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU.It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area.In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The single market is a very different beast - it is not just about the trade in goods.It allows the free movement of people, money and services as if the EU was a single country.Who is negotiating Britain's exit from the EU?Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit.Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary.These three are each set to play roles in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although it would be Mrs May, as prime minister, who would have the final say.Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.How long will it take for Britain to leave the EU?The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019.EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member.But there is currently uncertainty about how final the break will be on that day - a number of UK and EU figures back the idea of having a "transition" period of up to three years to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc.Why might Brexit take so long?Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task.It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators will, to some extent, be making it up as they go along.The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.So why can't the UK just cut all ties in March 2019?The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a "cliff-edge" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight.They think it would harm the economy.What is the focus of negotiations between the UK and EU?The priority issues in negotiations are: 1) Agreeing what rights EU citizens already in the UK - and UK citizens living in the rest of the EU - will have after Brexit.2) Agreeing a figure for the amount of money the UK has to pay the rest of the EU "to settle its accounts", when it leaves.3) Working out what will happen on the border between Northern Ireland, when it is outside the EU, and the Republic of Ireland, which is part of the EU.The EU says it wants to make decent progress on these three issues before beginning talks about what the UK's relations with the EU will be like after Brexit.Mrs May set out her negotiating priorities in the letter officially triggering the process of leaving the EU on 29 March.Here's a guide to the key points.How are the talks going?There have been agreements on some technical points, but the chief EU negotiator, Michel Barnier, has said there had been no decisive progress on any of the main issues.The UK's Brexit Secretary, David Davis, insists progress has been made.The main sticking point at the moment is money - and the size of the bill the UK will pay to cover its outstanding obligations when it leaves.The UK wants this to be as low as possible.All the other countries in the EU want it to be as high as possible.Because when the UK leaves, there will be a hole in the EU budget and they will have to cover the shortfall.The UK government has published a series of papers setting out its position on issues such as future customs arrangements, and on the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.Government policy is now that the UK will leave the single market and the customs union on the day of Brexit, but that it will try to replicate existing customs arrangements during a time-limited transition period.What happens if there is no deal with the EU?Prime Minister Theresa May says leaving the EU with no deal whatsoever would be better than signing the UK up to a bad one.Without an agreement on trade, the UK would have to operate under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border check for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland.There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care.Here is a full explanation of what 'no deal' could mean What happens to EU citizens living in the UK?It has yet to be agreed.All EU nationals lawfully resident in the UK for at least five years will be able to apply for "settled status" and be able to bring over spouses and children, under a 15-page proposal unveiled by Theresa May.Mrs May says she wants to give reassurance and certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of the three EEA countries and Switzerland.But any deal on their future legal status and rights must be reciprocal and also give certainty to the 1.2 million British expats living on the continent after the UK leaves the EU - expected to be on 29 March 2019, she says.Michel Barnier, who is leading the Brexit negotiations for the EU, said the UK's proposals did not go far enough and he wanted the same level of protection citizens currently have under EU law.He has demanded more clarity and ambition from the UK government.The key points of the UK's proposals are: Those granted settled status will be able to live, work, study and claim benefits just as they can now The cut-off date for eligibility is undecided but will be between 29 March 2017 and 29 March 2019 Family members of EU citizens living abroad will be able to return and apply for settled status EU nationals in the UK for less than five years at the specified date will be able to continue living and working in the UK Once resident for five years, they can apply for settled status Those arriving after the cut-off point will be able to stay temporarily But there should be "no expectation" they will be granted permanent residence A period of "blanket residence permission" may apply to give officials time to process applications to stay in the UK The Home Office will no longer require evidence that EU citizens who weren't working held "comprehensive sickness insurance" Labour has said it would guarantee the rights of of EU citizens living in the UK to stay there on "day one" of a Labour government.EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit.What happens to UK citizens working in the EU?A lot depends on the kind of deal the UK agrees with the EU.If the government opted to impose work permit restrictions on EU nationals, then other countries could reciprocate, meaning Britons would have to apply for visas to work.What about EU nationals who want to work in the UK Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit.The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a "transition" phase of up to three years.However they will have to register.A permanent proposal for post-Brexit immigration is not likely to be known for a few months yet, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.What does the fall in the value of the pound mean for prices in the shops?Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Shoppers will need to keep a close eye on how much they are spending People travelling overseas from the UK have found their pounds are buying fewer euros or dollars after the Brexit vote.Even if the pound regains some of its value, currency experts expect it in the longer term to remain at least 10% below where it was when the referendum happened.This means exports should get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper, but imported goods will get more expensive - some price rises for food, clothing and homeware goods have been seen.The latest UK inflation figures have the rate at 2.6%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Will immigration be cut?Image copyright PA Prime Minister Theresa May has said one of the main messages she has taken from the Leave vote is that the British people want to see a reduction in immigration.She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a "sustainable" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year.The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed significantly since the Brexit vote.This has largely been driven by an increase in emigration from the UK by citizens of Poland and the other East and Central European countries.There were still 246,000 more people coming to live in the UK than leaving in the year to March 2017, according to the latest estimates - some way above the government's target of 100,000.Could there be a second referendum?It seems highly unlikely.Both the Conservatives and the Labour Party have ruled out another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave.Will MPs get a vote on the Brexit deal?Yes.Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process.This vote is currently proposed as a "take it or leave it" one.Labour wants the vote to have the option of sending the UK team back to renegotiate.It is worth mentioning that any deal also has to be agreed by the European Parliament - with British MEPs getting a chance to vote on it there.Will I need a visa to travel to the EU?The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals.No agreement has been reached yet, however.If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Image copyright Reuters Will I still be able to use my passport?Yes.It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same.In theory, the government could, if it wanted, decide to change the colour, which is currently standardised for EU countries, says the BBC's Europe correspondent, Chris Morris.Has any other member state ever left the EU?No nation state has ever left the EU.But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation.The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.What does this mean for Scotland?Image copyright Reuters Image caption Nicola Sturgeon says a new independence referendum in Scotland is likely Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was "democratically unacceptable" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain.Ms Sturgeon has officially asked for permission for a second referendum to be held.She had wanted the vote to be held between the autumn of 2018 and spring 2019, but after losing seats at the 2017 general election she has put her plans on hold with no referendum likely until 2021.Theresa May has said a second referendum should not be held during the Brexit process.What does it mean for Northern Ireland?The land border between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland is a key part of the Brexit talks.There is currently a common travel area between the UK and the Republic.Like Scotland, Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in last year's referendum.The result in Northern Ireland was 56% for Remain and 44% for Leave.The UK government has published a paper setting out its vision for a post-Brexit border.It wants to avoid returning to a "hard border" - that means no physical infrastructure, such as customs posts.There would be no CCTV cameras or number plate recognition technology at the border, or set back from it.Instead, the UK government is arguing for a wide-ranging exemption under which small and medium-sized businesses will not have to comply with any new customs tariffs.If the proposals are accepted, customs officials envisage using a mix of technology and physical checks to monitor the compliance of bigger businesses engaged in international trade.Critics say the proposals lack credible detail, with Labour deriding the plans for the border as "a fantasy frontier".Sinn Fein, which was part of the ruling coalition in the Northern Ireland Assembly before it was suspended, has called for a referendum on leaving the UK and joining the Republic of Ireland as soon as possible.The Conservatives have rejected Sinn Fein's call, saying there was no evidence opinion had shifted in favour of a united Ireland.How much has Brexit cost so far and how much will it cost by the end?There is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.There have been no official estimates published of the size of the bill, which covers things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments.Various figures ranging from 50bn (44bn) to 100bn (88bn) euros have been bandied about but although the UK has agreed to meet its financial obligations, Brexit secretary David Davis has said: "We will not be paying 100bn."The UK could leave without any Brexit "divorce bill" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court.If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.How will pensions, savings, investments and mortgages be affected?During the referendum campaign, David Cameron said the so-called "triple lock" for state pensions would be threatened by a UK exit.This is the agreement by which pensions increase by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest.Theresa May had proposed ditching the 2.5% part of the lock in the party's election manifesto, but as part of the post-election deal with the DUP the triple lock was again guaranteed.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low.There are few signs yet that rising inflation have worried the Bank of England enough to consider raising interest rates.But if that happened it would make mortgages and loans more expensive to repay - but would be good news for savers.Will duty-free sales on Europe journeys return?Image copyright Thinkstock Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an "upside" or "silver lining" of Brexit.As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the "customs union" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.Will EHIC cards still be valid?Image copyright Thinkstock If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more here.Will cars need new number plates?Probably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.Could MPs block an EU exit?Could the necessary legislation pass the Commons, given that a lot of MPs in the current Parliament - all SNP and Lib Dems, nearly all Labour and many Conservatives - were in favour of staying?The referendum result is not legally binding - Parliament still has to pass the laws that will get Britain out of the 28 nation bloc, starting with the repeal of the 1972 European Communities Act.The withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament - the House of Lords and/or the Commons could vote against ratification, according to a House of Commons library report.So in theory they could block the UK's EU exit.But in practice that is seen as very unlikely given that a majority of people voted for Brexit in the referendum.Will leaving the EU mean we don't have to abide by the European Court of Human Rights?The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution.It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine.So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.There have been longstanding plans to repeal the act and replace it with a British Bill of Rights.What about the European Court of Justice?The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority.It is based in Luxembourg.It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects.The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade.It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does.Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the "direct" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit.But the UK government has not ruled out remaining under its jurisdiction during the Brexit transition period that is planned after March 2019.After that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided.There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The UK has set out some ideas in a position paper, which was criticised for being too "vague".The EU is insisting that its citizens in the UK should continue to enjoy the legal protection of the ECJ even after Brexit, guaranteeing their right to work and access to benefits among other things.This is a major sticking point in the negotiations, with the UK saying EU citizens living in the UK should be subject to British law only.Will the UK be able to rejoin the EU in the future?BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU.Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining.But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands.New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.Who wanted the UK to leave the EU?The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU.They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet.A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving.What were their reasons for wanting the UK to leave?They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return.They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work.One of the main principles of EU membership is "free movement", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country.The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of "ever closer union" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a "United States of Europe".Who wanted the UK to stay in the EU?Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in.He said the deal would give Britain "special" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in.The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign.The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in.The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU, as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.What were their reasons for wanting the UK to stay?Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services.They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.What about businesses?Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world.Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU.Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound.Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU.Image copyright Reuters Image caption Boris Johnson was one of the most prominent Leave campaigners Who led the rival sides in the campaign?Britain Stronger in Europe - the main cross-party group campaigning for Britain to remain in the EU was headed by former Marks and Spencer chairman Lord Rose.It was backed by key figures from the Conservative Party, including Prime Minister David Cameron and Chancellor George Osborne, most Labour MPs, including party leader Jeremy Corbyn and Alan Johnson, who ran the Labour In for Britain campaign, the Lib Dems, Plaid Cymru, the Alliance party and the SDLP in Northern Ireland, and the Green Party.Who funded the campaign: Britain Stronger in Europe raised 6.88m, boosted by two donations totalling 2.3m from the supermarket magnate and Labour peer Lord Sainsbury.Other prominent Remain donors included hedge fund manager David Harding (750,000), businessman and Travelex founder Lloyd Dorfman (500,000) and the Tower Limited Partnership (500,000).Read a Who's Who guide.Who else campaigned to remain : The SNP ran its own remain campaign in Scotland as it did not want to share a platform with the Conservatives.Several smaller groups also registered to campaign.Britain Stronger

party ran its own campaign.The Trade Union and Socialist Coalition also ran its own out campaign.Several smaller groups also registered to campaign.Will the EU still use English?Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler.There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - "much to France's chagrin", she says.Will Brexit harm product safety?Probably not, is the answer.It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards.Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this page Which MPs were for staying and which for leaving?The good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list.Click here for the latest version.How much does the UK contribute to the EU and how much do we get in return?In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out.Only France and Germany contribute more.In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.Image copyright Thinkstock Image caption The UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to 4.6bn in 2014/15.According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was 8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10.The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was 5.7bn.Read more number crunching from Reality Check.If I retire to Spain or another EU country will my healthcare costs still be covered?David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans.This is one of those issues where it is not possible to say definitively what would happen.At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS.After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment.In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.If Britain remains in the single market, or the European Economic Area as it is known, it might be able to continue with this arrangement, according to a House of Commons library research note.If Britain has to negotiate trade deals with individual member states, it may opt to continue paying for expats' healthcare through the NHS or decide that they would have to cover their own costs if they continue to live abroad, if the country where they live declines to do so.What will happen to protected species?Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.The answer is that they would remain in place, initially at least.After the Leave vote, the government will probably review all EU-derived laws in the two years leading up to the official exit date to see which ones to keep or scrap.The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied.The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.The government would want to avoid a legislative vacuum caused by the repeal of EU laws before new UK laws are in place - it would also continue to abide by other international agreements covering environmental protection.How much money will the UK save through changes to migrant child benefits and welfare payments?Martin, from Poole, in Dorset, wanted to know what taxpayers would have got back from the benefit curbs negotiated by David Cameron in Brussels.We don't exactly know because the details were never worked out.HM Revenue and Customs suggested about 20,000 EU nationals receive child benefit payments in respect of 34,000 children in their country of origin at an estimated cost of about 30m.But the total saving would have been significantly less than that because Mr Cameron did not get the blanket ban he wanted.Instead, payments would have been linked to the cost of living in the countries where the children live.David Cameron said as many as 40% of EU migrant families who come to Britain could lose an average of 6,000 a year of in-work benefits when his "emergency brake" was applied.The DWP estimated between 128,700 and 155,100 people would be affected.But the cuts would have been phased in.New arrivals would not have got tax credits and other in-work benefits straight away but would have gradually gained access to them over a four year period at a rate that had not been decided.The plan will never be implemented now.Will we be barred from the Eurovision Song Contest?Image copyright BBC/Guy Levy Image caption To participate in the Eurovision Song Contest countries need to be a member of the European Broadcasting Union, which is independent of the EU Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry.We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: "All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union.The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe.Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC."What will happen to pet passports?The answer to Alan Rippington's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws.It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: "The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU."Has Brexit made house prices fall?Image copyright PA So far, the answer is no.But there has been anecdotal evidence of house prices falling at the top of the market in Central London and the annual increase in the price of property has fallen from 9.4% at the time of the referendum to 4.9% a year later.What is the 'red tape' that opponents of the EU complain about?Ged, from Liverpool, suspects "red tape" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection.According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related.The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs 4.7bn a year, tops the list.The working time directive (4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019.Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them.Brexit may also generate "red tape" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Will Britain be party to the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership?Ste, in Bolton, asked about this.The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of 10bn a year.But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights.US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the TTIP agreement, which means it is now seen as unlikely to be agreed - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it will not be part of TTIP and will have to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.What impact will leaving the EU have on the NHS?Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS.This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was 350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead.The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses.The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as "scaremongering" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned.EU citizens working for the NHS are expected to get the right to stay in the UK, although details on EU citizens in the UK and UK citizens elsewhere in the EU are yet to be finalised (see earlier answer).Sally Miller bought a house in Spain nine years ago and plans to retire there in the next five years.She asked how Brexit will affect this.Image copyright Getty Images The BBC's Kevin Connolly says: The issue of free movement - the rights of EU citizens to live and work in the UK - was a huge issue in the Brexit referendum of course, and will be a big part of the exit negotiations.We've heard quite a bit from the British side already with the government saying that securing the status and rights of EU nationals in the UK and UK nationals in the EU is one of the government's earliest priorities, and specifically that it is looking for a reciprocal deal.So you might feel the mood music is encouraging but all we can say for sure is that, while there are no guarantees yet, it will be a big part of the Brexit negotiations to come.Jonathan Eaton is a Briton living in the Netherlands with his wife, who is Dutch.He asks what rights to benefits and housing he will have if he has to return to the UK.Image copyright Getty Images BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith says: The short answer is there is no easy access to benefits.As it stands at the moment, Brexit aside, you will have to pass what's known as a habitual residence test which was introduced in 1994 and applies to British citizens just as EU citizens.The rules have been tightened up which means for some benefits, if you have been out of the country you can't even think about applying for the test for several months.For example, when it comes to jobseeker's allowance, you cannot even take the test to apply for those benefits for three months.And that was done to stop EU citizens coming here and just getting on benefits straight away.After three months, you can take the test which looks at your English language skills, what sort of efforts you made to find work before coming to the UK.It also considers how strong a tie you have to the UK, whether you have property or family here and what your intentions are in terms of staying and working, or returning.But once you have taken the test, if you pass it then you should be eligible to apply for a range of benefits, as long as you meet the usual requirements in terms of income and showing you are looking for work.That is likely to continue when we move fully on to Universal Credit.The one sort of unknown in the whole system is what happens with Brexit negotiations, in terms of guaranteeing the rights of British nationals abroad.And we simply don't know what that will involve and whether in any way that might impact on how soon you can apply for benefits when you come back to Britain.Will I have to buy a new passport and driving licence, and will my rights to use them freely across Europe be taken away from me after Brexit, asks Francis Lee.Image copyright Getty Images Kevin Connolly says: At the moment UK passports carry the words European Union and British driving licences have the blue square with yellow flags of the EU.That will presumably change after Brexit but it seems likely that the change will be phased in so that you'll simply get documents with the new design when the old ones expire.That's what happened, I seem to remember, when the UK joined the EU.Anything else would be expensive and risk flooding the system, after all.The right to use them freely is an interesting question.When we talk about restrictions on freedom of movement we generally mean the freedom to live and work in another country.If Britain poses restrictions on the EU in that respect then it can expect some kind of response.But in terms of tourism there are plenty of non-EU countries whose citizens can visit the UK for up to 90 days without a visa.And, as part of the Brexit negotiations, you'd expect similar arrangements to be discussed for the UK.Both sides need each others' tourists and, after all, if you can drive a car in the United States on a UK licence then it doesn't seem fanciful to assume that you'll be able to do the same in Europe in future.It is very clear that the PM and the government want to leave the tyranny of the European Court of Justice.Why has leaving the European Court of Human Rights (an organisation far more hated than the ECJ) been ignored, asks Barry Fryer.Image copyright Getty Images Kevin Connolly says: Two different courts here of course, so two different bits of politics.Crucially, the European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law.So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.Adrian Wallis runs a small electronics company and wants to know about export tariffs after Brexit, and what they'd mean for his business.Kevin Connolly says: As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs.That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free.On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own.That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU.Image copyright Thinkstock One bit of good news is that the UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU.That matters because in the period when the UK is negotiating a new trade deal with the EU, and that could take years, trade would be conducted under WTO rules.At the moment, for non-food items, that implies an average tariff of about 2.3%.But suppose the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, for example.Well, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars.In theory, an economist would say that creates a situation where everyone has an incentive to sort out a better deal for their consumers.The snag is that these things take years, if not decades.They tend to be done on a country-by-country and sector-by-sector basis.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then I'm afraid he's going to have to be patient.Maybe very, very patient.What impact will leaving the European Union have on the UK's long term political influence in Europe, asks Peter Hoare.Norman Smith says: There are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.My take is that not much is probably going to change.I say that because the UK'll still be a member of significant organisations such as the UN and Nato, and will still be co-operating with EU partners.For example, there will still be close ties on defence with the French.The UK will still be the same old Britain, will still have significant military force, will still be a wealthy country and will still be a nuclear power, so I don't think people will suddenly think the UK's an entirely different country.Are other countries likely to leave the EU and if so could we start a new free trade area, asks David John.Kevin Connolly says: Funnily enough, I was discussing this question just the other day with a French politician, a conservative and a real Europhile, and he said he thought if there was a free vote in France tomorrow, as the right wing National Front would like, that the French would vote to leave.But generally speaking I can't see much prospect of a tidal wave of insurrectionist, exitism sweeping the continent.When a country like Ireland has a spat with the EU about tax, for example, it does annoy Irish politicians, but most mainstream leaders in the Europe have grown up with the idea that the EU has brought peace and prosperity for decades.Image copyright Getty Images Lots of them see plenty that irritates them about the European Union, but they mainly argue that the benefits hugely outweigh the irritations.And in countries where you do find Euroscepticism, such as Poland and Hungary, there is also a healthy awareness that there are huge financial benefits to membership.As for the future, we will see.If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, I think it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Britain could perhaps join the Free Trade Association along with Norway, Lichtenstein and Switzerland.But of course it would be joining under existing rules, so the likeliest future for a post-Brexit UK, I think, is a future where it tries to do the best deal possible with the EU and then looks around for other free trade deals.But that would fall short of creating a free trade area based on the UK itself.What will happen to the borders in Gibraltar and Northern Ireland, asks Nigel May.Kevin Connolly says: I think the question of what is going to happen to borders after Brexit is one of the most difficult of the lot.Since 1985 when Spain joined the EU, it has basically been prevented from closing the border with Gibraltar as a way of applying pressure to the British territory.In fact, 12,000 Spanish people cross into the territory to work every day and the area of Spain around Gibraltar is a pretty depressed area so they are important jobs.On the other hand, the Spanish have talked openly about this being an opportunity to get Gibraltar back.Jose Manuel Garcia-Margallo, its minister of foreign affairs, said in September the UK's vote to leave the EU was "a unique historical opportunity in more than three hundred years to get Gibraltar back".But at a minimum, as things stand, it looks to me as though they could certainly re-impose border controls if they chose to.Image copyright Getty Images The situation with Ireland's border is more complex.For those of us for whom Northern Ireland is home, the total disappearance of military check points on the border is one of the most tangible daily reminders of the end of the Troubles and no one wants a border like that back.But, when the day comes when Ireland is in the EU and the UK is not, then the Irish border of course is also going to be the UK's land border with the European Union.Conservative leader Theresa May has said we don't see a return to the borders of the past, but the reality is that if Britain leaves the common customs area, then presumably some sort of checks are going to be necessary on that border.And if the UK wants to stop Polish or Romanian migrant workers using Dublin airport as a back door into the UK, then it is going to have to do something about that too.The UK has published a paper setting out its preferred options.Of course, what it will all mean for towns and villages like Belleek and Belcoo in County Fermanagh, which more or less straddle the border, is hard to imagine.How will access to healthcare change for expats living in the EU, asks Veronique Bradley, who lives in Italy.Kevin Connolly says: Healthcare is one of those issues that remains relatively simple as long as the UK remains in the EU.It is just part of a range of citizens' rights that apply across the entire union.After Brexit, I suppose there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.What will happen to EU nationals who lived and worked in the UK and now receive a British state pension, asks Peter Barz, a German citizen living in the UK.Norman Smith says: If you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Image copyright Getty Images Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, "I paid in there", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Is it possible to be both an EU citizen and not an EU citizen, asks Declan O'Neill, who holds an Irish passport.Kevin Connolly says: I should probably declare some sort of interest here as a dual Irish and British national myself.Of course, anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.Image copyright Getty Images The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.Is there a get-out clause for Article 50, asks Gillian Coates.Norman Smith says: I think the honest answer is you would have to be a legal eagle to answer this.But my take on it is that legally it looks like once we trigger Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.Image copyright Thinkstock However, in the real world I think it is likely to be rather different, whatever the legal protocol.I think the truth is, if we were trundling along and decided it was all going to be catastrophic and we have got to pull up the handbrake pretty sharpish, a lot of other EU countries would be probably be laughing at us, but I think at the same time they would probably be quite pleased we weren't going.So I think the short answer is: legally, it doesn't look so good if you want to get out of it, but politically, it probably can be done with the support of other European leaders.Eric Degerland asks when UK passports are going to change.Kevin Connolly says: This takes us to the heart of an issue that lots of people really care about.It will be a real and palpable sign of Brexit when there is a new UK passport without the words "European Union" on the front cover.Sadly, the short answer is we don't really know when the change will come about.Image copyright Getty Images But we can say that the cheapest thing for the government to do would be to phase in the new passports as people's old ones expire.So if you're looking forward to getting back that blue hard-back passport we had in the old days, you may have a long time to wait.The BBC's Reality Check team answered some of your questions about Theresa May's plans for EU citizens living in the UK.Will Irish citizens be exempt from this five-year residency requirement, and continue to be afforded equal treatment with UK nationals?Yes, Irish citizens residing in the UK will not need to apply for settled status to protect their entitlements as the UK government is committed to protecting the Common Travel Area arrangements.Would EU citizens still be able to move to the UK in the next two years until March 2019?Yes, they would.The UK is a member of the EU until it withdraws, so the freedom of movement rules will apply until then.Why shouldn't British courts have full jurisdiction over the rights of EU citizens living in the UK?Wasn't that the whole point of Brexit?The UK government says the European Court of Justice will not have jurisdiction over EU citizens' rights.The EU demands that it does.This is an important sticking point in the Brexit negotiations.How can a lifetime stay be guaranteed?Could a future government change the law?Once the UK leaves the EU, any future government will in principle be able to propose amendments to the rules and the UK Parliament would decide on the new law.I plan to retire to France within the next two years and buy a property.Will this be possible after Brexit?You can buy property and retire anywhere in the world, subject to the rules of the country you are retiring in.So, you'll be able to do that but we don't know what your exact rights will be until the UK and EU conclude the citizens' rights negotiations.I'm an EU national living in the UK but my wife is from outside the EU.Is her status going to change?Your wife, as a family member of an eligible EU citizen who has been resident in the UK before we leave the EU, will also be eligible to apply for settled status with you, provided that she too meets the settlement criteria and has been in a genuine relationship with you while resident in the UK.
Theresa May's cabinet: Who's in and who's out?:::::Theresa May has formed her new government after the Conservatives lost their majority in the general election.The prime minister's room for manoeuvre in the reshuffle was limited when her party was left with 318 MPs and Labour had 262.Here's what we know so far.The list will be updated as new appointments are made.Prime Minister - Theresa May Image copyright Reuters Theresa May stays as prime minister despite not achieving the mandate for Brexit she had called the election for.The UK's second female PM took up the role after David Cameron resigned in the wake of the EU referendum result.She had previously been home secretary for six years.Theresa May: Full profile Election 2017: Key points at-a-glance First Secretary of State - Damian Green Image copyright AFP Damian Green has been promoted to a new role the prime minister did not have in her first cabinet - that of first secretary of state.As the same time he also replaces Ben Gummer as minister for the Cabinet Office after Mr Gummer lost his seat in the election.The move effectively makes the former work and pensions secretary, a friend and ally of Theresa May, her second in command.It could see Mr Green standing in for Mrs May at PMQs when she is not available.The role - which was previously held by George Osborne and, under Labour, Peter Mandelson - gives Mr Green seniority over other cabinet ministers.Chancellor of the Exchequer - Philip Hammond Image copyright PA Philip Hammond remains as chancellor of the exchequer.He was foreign secretary under David Cameron from 2014 to 2016, having previously served as defence secretary and transport secretary.Mr Hammond, 61, is seen at Westminster as the ultimate safe pair of hands steering Britain's economy through the post-Brexit period ahead.Sometimes mocked as "box office Phil" for what some see as his dull delivery, he forged a reputation in the shadow Treasury team as the Tories' public spending "axeman".Foreign Secretary - Boris Johnson Image copyright AFP No change at the Foreign Office as Boris Johnson keeps his job.Despite hints from some of the newspapers that Mr Johnson, 52, may turn his hand to trying to lead the party, he has categorically dismissed such claims.Mr Johnson said that while the public would be wondering about the future of the current government, Mrs May had got the biggest Conservative mandate anyone had achieved for decades."I'm going to be backing her, and absolutely everybody I'm talking to is going to be backing her as well."Home Secretary - Amber Rudd Image copyright Reuters Amber Rudd remains as home secretary despite only narrowly holding her seat as MP for Hastings and Rye.During the election campaign, she stood in for the PM in the BBC's televised debate in May.Ms Rudd was previously energy and climate change secretary, a position she held for just one year.The former investment banker, venture capitalist and financial journalist, aged 53, decided to enter politics in her 40s in order to get "a grip on her life".Secretary of State for Exiting the EU - David Davis Image copyright Reuters David Davis keeps his job of secretary of state for exiting the European Union - or "Brexit secretary".The role was created in July to take the lead in negotiating the UK's exit from the EU.A veteran Eurosceptic, he has previously held the positions of Conservative party chairman and shadow deputy prime minister.Between 2003 and 2008, he was the shadow home secretary under both Michael Howard and David Cameron.Mr Davis, 68, lost to David Cameron in the 2005 Tory leadership contest.Defence Secretary - Michael Fallon Image copyright AFP Michael Fallon has kept his job at the Ministry of Defence - a position the 65-year-old has held since 2014.He was Conservative MP for Darlington from 1983 to 1992 - initially during Margaret Thatcher's time in Downing Street - and after leaving Parliament was later re-elected as MP for Sevenoaks in 1997.A former Conservative Party deputy chairman, Mr Fallon has previously served as energy and business minister, and before that secretary of state for business and enterprise.Secretary of State for International Trade - Liam Fox Image copyright AFP Liam Fox, 55, continues as the secretary of state for international trade.He was made secretary of state for defence in 2010 but resigned in 2011 over allegations he had given a close friend, lobbyist Adam Werritty, access to the Ministry of Defence and allowed him to join official trips overseas.Mr Fox stood in the leadership race against Theresa May but was eliminated in the first ballot after winning the support of just 16 MPs.He told reporters he was "delighted" to keep the job he has held since July last year."It's now time for the whole of the Conservative party to rally behind the prime minister and get a government in the national interest."Justice Secretary - David Lidington Image copyright PA Former Leader of the House of Commons David Lidington gets the job of justice secretary, replacing Liz Truss.He had been Europe Minister since 2010 but moved across to aid the smooth running of the Commons in 2016.The Cambridge history graduate and father-of-four has been MP for Aylesbury since 1992.He previously worked for BP and mining firm Rio Tinto.Leader of the House of Lords - Baroness Evans Image copyright PA Baroness Evans of Bowes Park keeps her job as the leader of the House of Lords.When appointed in 2016, it was her first ministerial role since being ennobled by David Cameron in 2014.She attended London's Henrietta Barnett School and Cambridge University before becoming deputy director of the Conservative research department, deputy director of the Policy Exchange think-tank and chief operating officer of the New Schools Network - the organisation which ran Michael Gove's free schools programme.Health Secretary - Jeremy Hunt Image copyright Reuters Jeremy Hunt remains in his post despite the problems within the NHS.He took over the health portfolio following a cabinet reshuffle in 2012, and at the time described the appointment as the "biggest privilege of my life".But in a tweet he admitted there were "challenges ahead, but also huge opportunities to make our NHS even better".Last year, Mr Hunt was locked in a battle with the British Medical Association over a new contract for junior doctors, which led to a series of strikes.Education Secretary - Justine Greening Image copyright PA Justine Greening has kept her roles as education secretary and minister for women and equalities.She is part of the most diverse Parliament yet as she openly defines herself as a lesbian.At London Pride in 2016, the 48-year-old announced in a tweet she was in a same-sex relationship, saying "I campaigned for Stronger In but sometimes you're better off out!".Ms Greening replaced Nicky Morgan at education in 2016, leaving her international development secretary post, which she was promoted to in 2011.She has been MP for Putney since 2005.Transport Secretary - Chris Grayling Image copyright Reuters Chris Grayling remains as transport secretary in Theresa May's cabinet.The former Leader of the House has been dealing with Southern Rail's disrupted services, the question of Heathrow's third runway and the high speed rail link, HS2.He also served as shadow transport secretary from December 2005 to 2007.Culture Secretary - Karen Bradley Image copyright Getty Images Karen Bradley has kept her role as Culture, Media and Sport Secretary.She had been working with Theresa May as a Home Office minister since 2014.She was first elected MP for Staffordshire Moorlands in May 2010.Environment Secretary - Michael Gove Image copyright EPA Michael Gove has made a comeback, with the prime minister bringing him back into cabinet and appointing him environment secretary.In the 2016 reshuffle he was sacked as justice secretary and before that he served under David Cameron as education secretary and chief whip in the Tory-Lib Dem coalition.Despite campaigning alongside Boris Johnson for Brexit, he withdrew his support for Mr Johnson to be Conservative leader and prime minister, choosing instead to stand himself.He was eliminated in the final round of voting by MPs, coming third.Mr Gove's surprise move to stand for the leadership effectively dashed his colleague's hopes of winning and prompted Mr Johnson's withdrawal from the contest.Work and Pensions Secretary - David Gauke Image copyright AFP A sideways step for David Gauke, with the PM appointing him as the new work and pensions secretary.He was previously the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, who attends cabinet but does not have a ministerial role.Mr Gauke has been the MP for Hertfordshire South West since 2005.He is a qualified solicitor and worked for a leading City firm until he was elected.Communities Secretary - Sajid Javid Image copyright AFP Sajid Javid keeps his job as secretary of the department for communities and local government.He held this position in 2014 before being appointed to business secretary a year later.A former managing director of Deutsche Bank, Mr Javid has been MP for Bromsgrove in Worcestershire since 2010.He stood on a "joint ticket" with Stephen Crabb for the leadership election, hoping to be chancellor if Mr Crabb had become PM.Northern Ireland Secretary - James Brokenshire Image copyright PA James Brokenshire continues as the Northern Ireland Secretary.He previously worked with the PM at the Home Office, where he was immigration minister.From 2011 to 2015, he served as security minister at the Home Office with responsibility for domestic national security and counter-terrorism.This included supporting the home secretary with oversight of the work of MI5 and the national police counter-terrorism network.Mr Brokenshire's responsibilities also included the government's counter-terrorism strategy and he was part of the prime minister's "extremism taskforce".He also led negotiations with the Jordanian government to secure the deportation of the radical cleric Abu Qatada.Welsh Secretary - Alun Cairns Image copyright PA Alun Cairns, MP for the Vale of Glamorgan, remains in his cabinet role as secretary of state for Wales.The 46-year-old, who was born in Swansea and is a graduate of the University of Wales, Newport, was elected in 2010.He worked in banking for a decade before his election to the Welsh Assembly.Scottish Secretary - David Mundell Image copyright Reuters David Mundell will continue as secretary of state for Scotland.He is one of 13 Scottish Conservatives to be in Parliament after this snap election.Former prime minister David Cameron first appointed Mr Mundell to the post when he held his Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale and Tweeddale seat for the third consecutive election in 2015.In January 2015, Mr Mundell became the first openly-gay Conservative cabinet secretary.Conservative Party chairman and Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster - Patrick McLoughlin Image copyright AFP Patrick McLoughlin remains as the Conservative Party chairman and chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.He left his role as transport secretary in 2016 but has been an MP since 1986.The former miner also served as chief whip after being appointed to the role in David Cameron's first cabinet.Business and Energy Secretary - Greg Clark Image copyright PA Greg Clark keeps his job as secretary of state of business, energy and industrial strategy.The role, when it was created by Labour's Gordon Brown, was originally called the Department of Energy and Climate Change.Last year, it was merged into the new department and lost the "climate change" part of its name.Environmentalists immediately expressed concern that the reshaping of departments showed the government was downgrading climate change as a priority.International Development Secretary -

Guide: 2017 political party conferences:::::Autumn sees Britain's political parties gathering by the sea - or in big city conference centres - here's a round-up of this year's.Conservatives - 1-4 October in Manchester Image copyright PA The most memorable moments of the 2017 Conservative conference came at the very end, in a speech more eventful than Theresa May and her team could have imagined.The prime minister was plagued by a cough which left her relying on gulps of water - and even a cough sweet handed to her by the chancellor - to complete some lines.If that wasn't bad enough, prankster Simon Brodkin had somehow gained access to the conference floor and handed her a mocked-up P45."I was about to talk about somebody I'd like to give a P45 to, and that's Jeremy Corbyn," the PM quipped, to cheers from the party faithful.It didn't end there - some of the letters fell off the conference stage backdrop behind her, leaving it as: "Building a country that works or everyon."The speech had been billed as the PM's attempt to reassert her authority after the ill-fated snap general election and reports of splits in her cabinet over Brexit.It also contained policy pledges on social housing and a cap on standard tariff energy bills, while Home Secretary Amber Rudd announced a ban on acid sales to under 18s and a tightening of the laws on viewing terrorist content online.In his speech, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - who has been accused of undermining the PM with his interventions on Brexit strategy - said it was time to "let the British lion roar".Mrs May ended the conference being publicly supported by her MPs and ministers although there were reports of "emerging plots" among some MPs.Labour - 24-27 September in Brighton Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption In full: Jeremy Corbyn's 75 minute speech Jeremy Corbyn ended Labour's week in Brighton with a speech to delegates in which he claimed the party was "on the threshold of power".The centre ground of British politics had shifted, he argued, and his Labour Party was now in the "political mainstream" because its polices were "what most people in our country actually want".He used the speech to announce some new policies - such as rent controls and curbs on gentrification - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another election campaign, with the Tory government "hanging by a thread".His supporters in the hall loved it, although they were chanting "Oh, Jeremy Corbyn" for a full two minutes before he had even begun.This conference cemented Mr Corbyn's dominance of the party, following his better-than-expected general election result.There was a row about Brexit, with moderate MPs, who want Mr Corbyn to commit to keeping the UK in the single market and customs union, feeling they had been denied a vote on this issue and the chance to debate it more fully.And Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell caused a stir when he warned Labour must prepare for all eventualities in government, including a possible run on the pound.But delegates approved changes to the way leaders are elected, which could make it easier to elect a left-wing successor to Mr Corbyn.SNP - 8-10 October in Glasgow Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Opening her conference speech, Nicola Sturgeon says: "At the risk of tempting fate, I have come prepared" SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon insisted her party will "always make the case for independence" as she used her keynote speech to focus on domestic priorities rather than constitutional matters.Although the Scottish government has delayed plans for a second independence referendum, Ms Sturgeon said her party still had a mandate for a vote on the issue.The "essence of independence", she told activists, was being "in the driving seat and not simply at the mercy of events" as she stressed the case for leaving the UK did not merely hinge on Brexit.Her headline policy announcement was a plan to set up a publicly-owned, not-for-profit energy company by 2021.She argued the venture would give people - particularly on low incomes - more choice of which supplier to use with energy sold at "close to cost price as possible".Spending on early-years childcare in Scotland will be doubled to 840m by 2020, a move the SNP said would be "truly transformational", while there will be a new scheme to provide free sanitary products in schools, colleges and universities from next August.Liberal Democrats - 16-19 September in Bournemouth Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Liberal Democrat conference: Sir Vince Cable's full speech The Liberal Democrats gathered by the seaside having modestly increased their tally of MPs to 12 in the recent general election, following an electoral drubbing in 2015 that left them with just eight.In his keynote speech to conference, new leader Sir Vince Cable said he could lead the Lib Dems back to power by offering a mix of "hope and realism".He called for higher taxes on foreign property speculators and second home owners to help tackle inequality.And he claimed Brexit would be an act of "masochism", leaving the UK poorer.UKIP - 29-30 September in Torquay Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Mr Bolton won the UKIP leadership contest with 30% of the vote UKIP members met for a two-day conference in which new leader Henry Bolton was crowned.The former soldier, who saw off challenges from better-known candidates, told members: "Brexit is our core task.However it is not the end of the line."Controversial anti-Islam candidate Anne Marie Waters finished second.Some MEPs had threatened to quit if she had won.UKIP's share of the vote in the general election collapsed to just 1.8%, prompting the resignation of then-leader Paul Nuttall.Green Party - 7-10 October in Harrogate Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Greens told to look on the bright side after disappointing election Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley spoke of the "hurt" he and others felt at the party's loss of ground in June's election, where its vote share more than halved.While the Greens had suffered at the hands of the two-party system in England and Wales, he said it could be proud of the causes it had espoused and the influence it had had on debates around austerity and fracking.Through its national and local representation, he said the party would stick up for the "little guy" as it made the case for far-reaching economic change.He called for more public input into the funding of services, locally controlled energy schemes and bank investment in "community bonds".Plaid Cymru - 20-21 October in Caernarfon Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Leanne Wood said Plaid Cymru had "the ambition to show a new way for Wales" Leanne Wood vowed to stay on as leader of Plaid Cymru at the party's conference.She told the conference they needed to earn the trust of non-Plaid Cymru voters whilst announcing the party could back a second Brexit referendum if there was no deal with the EU by March 2019.Ms Wood also announced proposals to re-train manual workers whose jobs are threatened by automation and promised a "rail revolution".The party saw a drop in their share of the vote in June's general election, although they gained a seat.Meanwhile Plaid Cymru AM Neil McEvoy, who was suspended from the party following a row over policy on council house sales, dismissed suggestions he was planning a leadership challenge at a fringe meeting.
